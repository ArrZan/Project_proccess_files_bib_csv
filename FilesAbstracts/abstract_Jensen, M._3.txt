Agency theory is employed to formalize the intuitive rationale for the widespread practice of setting up captive finance subsidiaries: reduced agency costs of debt increase the firm's consolidated debt capacity. Of the two Canadian industries tested, firms forming captives had significantly higher use of debt in manufacturing but failed to show any significant difference for merchandising. In light of confounding influences from tax-clientele effects, size difference, and support in tests on U.S. firms, the mixed finding should encourage further testing. The outcome of these tests suggests that it is potentially useful to think of captive finance subsidiaries in light of agency theory.

Agency theory rests on a well-defined relationship between shareholders and managers. That relationship is examined and found to be a poorly denned state-contingent contract. The implications of that finding, and the existence of only a weak market for managers, lead to the conclusion that the traditional assumptions about the rights of shareholders no longer apply and that common stock (ordinary share capital) is obsolete.

Tender offers provide an ideal setting for the analysis of agency relationships since the best interests of the principal (target firm shareholders) and agent (target firm managers) are often in conflict. Moreover, the actions and stated rationale of target managers in resisting or not resisting tender offers are readily observable, and the size of the possible agency costs is great. This research provides direct empirical evidence on the relationship between managerial welfare and takeover bid resistance. Tests on a sample of cash tender offers provide support for the managerial welfare hypothesis. The existence or absence of bid resistance is found to be directly related to the personal wealth changes of the target firm's managers-The relationships between managerial actions and bid premium size, bidder nationality' conglomerate offers, and "ex post settling up" are also examined.

The paper presents a model which explains the firm's life-cycle via the agency approach. The application of agency theory to the understanding of the life-cycle of the firm provides interesting implications for management compensation programs for growth-inducing policies and for some aspects of mergers. The dynamic model presented here provides a synthesis of different perspectives of the firm and its management. Copyright (c) 1986 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Signalling and agency theories appear in the accounting literature to be competing theories. This article demonstrates that they are actually consistent theories, in that one set of sufficient conditions of signalling theory is at least consistent with one set of sufficient conditions of agency theory. Indeed, a considerable overlap exists between the two theories: rational behaviour is common to both; information asymmetry in signalling theory is implied by positive monitoring costs in agency theory; 'quality' in signalling theory can be defined in terms of agency theory variables; and signalling costs are implicit in some bonding devices of agency theory. Examples are given where both theories' predictions about lobbying, accounting choices, and voluntary auditor selection are added together. (c) 1987, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

This paper employs recent developments in agency theory to study the impact that compensation contracts have on portfolio management investment decisions in a restricted mean-variance world. Two types of incentive contracts for mutual fund managers are analyzed and compared. The results show that the "symmetric" contract, while not necessarily eliminating agency costs, dominates the "bonus" contract in aligning the manager's interests with those of the investor.

Abstract. The long search for accounting principles has tended historically to be practice-and standards-oriented. It is the author's contention that accountants might do better to think of themselves first and foremost as being involved in an intellectual discipline. Concern should be with subject matter, the nature of theory employed to handle problems dealing with that subject matter, and the methodology to be employed in verifying that theory. What has been put forward as a revolution in accounting thought in recent years may in this context come out as something more evolutionary in nature. We have: (1) useful extensions in subject matter -- Information Economics and Agency Theory in particular; and (2) a sometimes healthy emphasis on and sometimes unhealthy obsession with empiricism in both macro (security market) and micro (choice decision) research. In fact, concern with both positive and normative questions, and employment of both logic and empiricism in our thinking, are essential in the study and practice of our discipline. The best of new thinking would seem to be complementary with, rather than a substitute for the best of what has gone on before. Resume. La longue quete de <<principes comptables>> a ete orientee historiquement vers la pratique et les normes. De l'avis de l'auteur, les comptables feraient mieux de se considerer comme oeuvrant tout d'abord au sein d'une discipline intellectuelle. L'interet devrait porter sur le sujet, la nature de la theorie utilisee afin de prendre en charge les problemes relies audit sujet, et la methodologie a etre utilisee dans la verification de cette theorie. Ce qui a ete avance dans les dernieres annees comme une revolution de la pensee comptable pourrait donner lieu dans ce contexte a quelque chose d'une nature plus evolutionniste. Nous possedons (1) des prolongements utiles dans le sujet -- particulierement l'economique de l'information et la theorie mandant-mandataire; et (2) parfois une saine importance et a l'occasion une obsession malsaine de l'empirisme, accordees a la fois aux recherches de type macro (marches financiers) et micro (decisions et choix des individus). De fait, le souci pour a la fois des questions positives et normatives, et l'utilisation dans notre reflexion a la fois de logique et d'empirisme, sont essentiels a l'etude et a la pratique de notre discipline. Les meilleurs aspects de la nouvelle pensee devraient etre un complement plutot qu'un substitut aux meilleurs aspects de l'approche anterieure. 1987 Canadian Academic Accounting Association

This is a descriptive study examining the determinants of disclosure for Not-for-Profit Organisations (NFPOs). The hypothesised determinants were identified by a review of the determinants identified in other studies and by reference to agency theory. These were analysed for significance using as dependent variables accounting policies and items of financial disclosure which have been suggested for adoption or disclosure by NFPOs. It was found that six of the hypothesised determinants (gross income, number of members, the presence of a professional administrator, geographic dispersion of members, and auditing of the financial statements) were significant factors influencing disclosure. Nature of the organisation, accounting experience of the person preparing the financial statements, and use of outside credit facilities were found not to be significant determinants.

This paper explores the historical American political values which have shaped modern financial theory and agency theory. Financial agency theory's intellectual roots are shown to be located in the liberal tradition which espouses the instrumental nature of property and property rights. The paper also argues that financial theorists should recognize that, historically, economic efficiency was not a value or end in itself but merely a means by which more fundamental social goals might be achieved.

This article discusses two leading theoretical approaches to understanding how firms operate in markets and the functioning of their internal organizations. Game theory is a microanalytic approach that offers a useful framework for organizing thinking about the factors that influence firm strategic conduct vis-a-vis its competitors. Agency theory is mainly concerned with market mechanisms, such as an executive labor market or market for corporate control, that may discipline firm management in the absence of ownership control. Both approaches can yield useful hypotheses for empirical testing of factors affecting industry and firm performance. Copyright (c) 1988 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

The extent to which directors of target companies act in their own interests, and not shareholder interests, when a takeover bid is received is examined using data from 400 takeover bids for Australian listed companies. A series of hypotheses is developed from theoretical inquiry into the motives of target company directors. Using univariate and multivariate analysis to test these hypotheses, it is found that directors' accept/reject recommendations to shareholders are associated with target leverage, bid premium, bidder's initial shareholding, ownership concentration (univariate only) and directors' shareholding in the target (univariate only). It is concluded that, overall, directors have acted in a manner consistent with shareholder interests, even though personal wealth effects are greatest for directors of bid-accept targets.

Prior empirical research has documented a large cross-sectional correlation between the level of executive pay and firm size. In contrast, this paper examines the association between percentage changes in executive compensation and percentage changes in organizational size. We analyze compensation and size data for executives at several levels of the corporate hierarchy for a sample of 303 firms. Our results indicate that the correlation between compensation and size is much smaller, although still statistically significant, in changes than in levels. This suggests that changes in an executive's compensation are not primarily driven by changes in organizational size. Copyright (c) 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Both agency theory and organization theory have considered the problem of employee misconduct -employee decisions to pursue selfinterest at the expense of their principal or employer Integrating these two theoretical perspectives, this article describes the empirical results of a study that examines the effects of inducements and enforcements on individuals' estimates that employee misconduct would occur The effects of these factors were considered within a context where the expected value of engaging in misconduct was positive. Although inducements and enforcements were both significantly related to estimates of misconduct, the rationales providedfor instances of employee misconduct suggest that otherfactors, such as ethical, cost, or risk considerations, may also affect estimates that employees will engage in misconduct.

This paper examines the role of the straight-commissioned salesperson in the context of agency theory and asserts that because the agent acts to benefit two principals, potential conflicts of interest arise. Temporal differences in receipt of rewards create a major conflict, while the firm's exhibition of both espoused and actual behaviors and information asymmetries intensify this conflict. Finally, in light of these inconsistencies, the ethical implications of the straight-commission compensation system are examined. (c) 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This paper examines some accounting and legal aspects of the excessus balance in mediaeval manorial accounts. Earlier findings that such a balance may represent unpaid creditors are supported here with evidence from the Crowland Abbey estates, but it is also suggested that such a balance may possibly be explained as the outcome of an incentive arrangement in an agency relationship between the lord and the reeve. An attempt is made to apply the agency concepts of incentives, bonding and monitoring to this relationship. There is a discussion of whether manorial accounts and audit can be explained in terms of agency theory or whether the existence of the action of account implies a preexisting legal obligation to account and submit to audit. The paper concludes with a consideration of the excessus balance in relation to the action of account. (c) 1991 Taylor & Francis Group All right reserved.

Equity financing is the optimal strategy for innovating firms, which can use their financial structure as a signalling device to attract outside investors. This situation is likely to arise when the firm undertakes a specific purpose R&D project aimed at developing a certain product innovation. Typically, innovations of this kind draw on the firm's cumulative, idiosyncratic knowledge base and, accordingly, the innovation process involves an high degree of asset specificity. Under such circumstances, the terms of debt financing will be adjusted adversely, and equity financing will represent the most economically efficient solution. These arguments are developed in standard static principal-agent models dealing with New Technology Based Firms and publicly held large firms undertaking an aggressive R&D strategy. In the case of NTBFs, two kinds of optimal venture capital contracts are considered, which render the sharing rules independent (a) of the agent's action and (b) of both the agent's action and the specific assets involved in the transaction. Regarding innovating large firms, it is argued that in this case, too, equity represents the optimal financing strategy, and that top executives use their equity share to signal the firm's expected return stream and value to outside investors.

The literature applying agency theory to management has focused on the performance advantages to be gained when ownership and control of the firm are aligned. This article investigates that premise by comparing family-owned and -managed and professionally managed firms. The article presents the results of a field survey that examined the extent to which family-owned and -managed firms differ across structural, process, and performance dimensions from their professionally managed counterparts. Significant differences exist between these two groups on both structural and process dimensions, and there is evidence that family-owned and -managed firms exhibit performance advantages as a result of the unification of ownership and control.

Vertical integration is a fundamental corporate strategy of interest to the fields of strategic management and organizational economics. This paper synthesizes theoretical arguments and empirical findings from this literature to identify the underlying advantages and disadvantages of choosing vertical financial ownership relative to vertical contracts. It then suggests that in the absence of agency and transaction costs, vertical financial ownership and vertical contracting are equivalent governance structures for achieving corporate objectives. However, given a world of positive agency and transaction costs, the key theoretic question then becomes predicting when market mechanisms are sufficient, when intermediate forms of vertical contracting become necessary, and when vertical financial ownership becomes the preferred governance structure. The concluding section of the paper provides a framework for making this analysis based on a synthesis of agency and transaction costs perspectives. Copyright (c) 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Agency theory recognizes that the interests of managers and shareholders may conflict and that, left on their own, managers may make major financial policy decisions, such as the choice of a capital structure, that are suboptimal from the shareholders' standpoint. The theory also suggests, however, that compensation contracts, managerial equity investment, and monitoring by the board of directors and major shareholders can reduce conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders. This research investigates the relationship between the firm's capital structure and 1) executive incentive plans, 2) managerial equity investment, and 3) monitoring by the board of directors and major shareholders. This paper finds a positive relationship between the firm's leverage ratio and 1) percentage of executives' total compensation in incentive plans, 2) percentage of equity owned by managers, 3) percentage of investment bankers on the board of directors, and 4) percentage of equity owned by large individual investors. These findings are consistent with the predictions of agency theory, suggesting, in turn, that capital structure models that ignore agency costs are incomplete. (c) 1992, Cambridge University Press.

Many small firms in Sweden are characterized by a lack of equity capital. For several years measures to increase the equity capital have been discussed. In this discussion the private investors' market has received virtually no attention. This study presents some preliminary results of the private investors in Sweden. The research in small firms financing is characterized by a lack of theoretical framework. One basic assumption in the study is that agency theory can provide an essential framework to explain the interaction between the private investor and entrepreneur. Twenty-five hypotheses generated from agency theory are formulated and tested on 62 small unlisted firms in Sweden. Multiple regression analysis is used for the causal analyses. The empirical results in the study show inter alia that the geographic distance and the private investor's knowledge about the portfolio firm's transformation process seem to be the most influential factors for determining the private investor's involvement in the portfolio firms. It is also interesting to notice that none of the variables, frequency of contacts and the private investor's operational work in the portfolio firm affect the performance of the firm. Contrary to conventional wisdom, private investors do not add value to their portfolio firms through their interaction with the entrepreneurs. The theoretical conclusion is that agency theory does not provide any satisfactory framework to explain the private investor -entrepreneur relationship. Some of the basic assumptions in agency theory seem to be invalid. A model for the relationship between private investors and entrepreneurs is developed in which four interaction strategies are identified. The model gives implications on two levels: the portfolio level and the individual case level. (c) 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This study examines, from a cultural perspective, owner-managers'and other stakeholders'interpretations of the partial fusion of ownership and control through high leverage in eight UK management buy-outs (MBOs). Owner-control and debt-control are interpreted as having positive effects on managerial motivation, organizational decision-making processes and implementation of cost reduction strategies and negative ones on fundamental changes in strategy and acquisition. These interpretations accord broadly with agency theory propositions but show that owner-managers place less emphasis on wealth incentive effects and more emphasis on the enabling and facilitating roles of collective ownership and the freedom it gives from inappropriate corporate control.

Recently, economists have directed attention to the phenomenon of organization. An important difference between the newly developed economic theories of organization, such as for example agency theory, and sociological theories of organization is the fact that economists explicitly employ an individual utility maximization assumption. In this paper, it is reasoned that this assumption, if used as in agency theory, entails logical inconsistencies if we try to explain the existence of the kind of agreements that purportedly form the basis of organiza tions. However, if the condition of uncertainty to which agency theorists merely pay lip service is taken seriously, the observed inconsistencies can be reconciled. A classificatory scheme of four 'sources of obligation' is proposed for the analysis of the basis of agreements. Taking all four sources into consideration in the analysis of organizational agreements can help to avoid one-sided attention to, for example, formal, legally enforceable agreements. The findings of empirical research suggest that two basic dimensions lie at the root of the proposed classifi catory scheme. Further research is needed to check this supposition and its implications.

Agency research has concluded that executive compensation through fixed salary promotes managerial opportunism, whereas equity ownership promotes managers' compliance with stockholders' interests. Using an experimental design, this study examined the extent to which these motivational effects of compensation are conditioned by the level of board control and conditions in the managerial labor market. Participants' opportunistic behavior was negatively affected by the level of board control. This effect was reinforced by high fixed salary compensation and favorable conditions in the managerial labor market. (c) 1992, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

Board of director involvement in restructuring reveals whether restructuring is brought on as an action by the board in its central oversight role or whether managers are purusing positive strategic action or correction. Therefore, based on an integration of organization economics (agency theory and market for corporate control) and strategic management theory (internal control and strategic leadership contingencies), this research examines board involvement in restructuring. Board involvement is hypothesized to be contingent on the governance mechanisms used by the board to monitor top management, control emphasis used by managers to process strategic information and board and managerial characteristics. The basic premise of the paper is that, due to their oversight role, board members (especially outside directors) become involved in restructuring only when managerial strategy implementation appears to be deficient. Top management team equity stakes are found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring, while outside director ownership is found to be positively related. Emphasis on strategic controls by managers was found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring. Top management team tenure and top management organizational tenure are negatively related to board involvement. Outsider representation on the board is positively related to board involvement in restructuring, while board tenure was found to be unrelated. Results imply that incentives to monitor (ownership) and emphasis on strategic controls reinforced by higher top management team tenure result in less board involvement in restructuring. However, restructuring may be initiated by outsiders on the board when other governance and control mechanisms fail. This implies a substitution process between governance tactics (ownership vs. board monitoring) and internal controls (managerial vigilance). Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study seeks to estimate the relative importance of free cash flow, corporate governance, and takeover threat in determining financial and portfolio restructuring. The free cash flow hypothesis and agency theory prescriptions are used as the basis for developing a model of restructuring. A simple analysis of variance method is used to decompose restructuring transactions and outcomes into the three effects. The results support the hypothesis that financial and portfolio restructuring are motivated, in part, by agency costs. Decomposition of variances indicates that restructuring is equally explained by free cash flow and interaction of governance and takeover threat with free cash flow.

This paper deals with the impact of debt on R&D intensity for firms undergoing a leveraged buyout (LBO). We develop seven hypotheses based on capital market imperfection theories and agency theory. To test these hypotheses, we compare 72 R&D performing LBOs with 3329 non-LBO control observations and 126 LBOs with little or no R&D expenditures. The regressions yield four statistically significant major findings. First, pre-LBO R&D intensity is roughly one-half of the overall manufacturing mean and two-thirds of the firm's industry mean. Second, LBOs cause R&D intensity to drop by 40 percent. Third, large firms tend to have smaller LBO-related declines in R&D intensity. Fourth, R&D intensive LBOs outperform both their non-LBO industry peers and other LBOs without R&D expenditures. Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

From an agency theory perspective, recent conversion activity of savings and loan associations (S&Ls) from mutual to stock organizations should improve the overall performance of the thrift industry. We employ a two-step approach to examine this issue using a sample of 559 S&Ls in the Atlanta Federal Home Loan Bank District in 1988. In the first step, we estimate inefficiency scores for individual S&Ls using a stochastic cost frontier methodology. In a second step Tobit model we use these inefficiency scores to examine the relationship between firm inefficiency and organizational form. We find three important results: (1) that the mutual and stock S&Ls in our sample have similar cost structures, allowing the pooling of S&L data; (2) that S&Ls have a wide range of inefficiency scores, with a mean score of 16 percent indicating that the average S&L could produce its output with only 84 percent of the inputs actually used; and (3) that operating inefficiency was not significantly related to form of ownership.

This paper tests competing theoretical explanations for the passage of corporate charter antitakeover amendments. The managerial entrenchment hypothesis suggests that antitakeover amendments are adopted by incumbent management to obtain job security at stockholders' expense. An alternative hypothesis is that antitakeover amendments are proposed in order to enable the management of the target firm to extract a higher price from the bidding firm and thereby benefit stockholders. Our event study from a sample of 409 firms that adopted antitakeover amendments in the 1974-88 period indicates a strongly negative effect on stockholder wealth, in support of the managerial entrenchment hypothesis that antitakeover amendments are adopted by managers at the expense of stockholders.

This paper contributes to the literature on organizational form and performance (the performance-conduct paradigm) by examining the impact of two sets of variables that have not been examined previously: measures of environmental uncertainty and alternative forms of controlling separation of ownership from control. The paper first examines the extent to which contextual variables such as perceived environmental uncertainty and age of the organizational form moderate the relationship between organizational form and corporate performance. Next, the paper extends the analysis by examining the possible effects of ownership and control structures on performance. Measures suggested by agency theory, such as conventional ownership proxies (i.e. proportion of shares held by identifiable, homogenous groups), the proportion of non-executive board members and Fama and Jensen's concept of separation of decision management from decision control are used in the analysis. The results indicate that these measures have direct impact on corporate performance in their own right, though the main impact is indirect through interactions with organizational form variables.

The utility of the contract model is illustrated empirically using a large data set on organizations and their employees in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing industries. The results are consistent with many transaction cost and agency theory predictions, though they also indicate the need to supplement these economic theories with sociological explanations based on political, cultural, and other institutional differences.

The objective of this study is to examine the effects of control system characteristics and perceived environmental uncertainty on the relative use of performance-contingent compensation. The results, based on a survey of division managers, indicate that monitoring ability is negatively associated with the use of performance-contingent compensation. In addition, monitoring is found to moderate the relationship between uncertainty and compensation system design. Whereas in non-monitoring firms, higher levels of uncertainty are associated with increased use of performance-contingent compensation, in monitoring firms, higher levels of uncertainty are associated with decreased use of performance-contingent compensation. These results support agency theory arguments that compensation structure is determined at least in part by concerns for economic efficiency. (c) 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This article examines the determinants of both book-value insolvency and regulatory closure in the thrift industry. Agency theory suggests that the determinants of insolvency and closure are a function of conflicts between shareholders and creditors, shareholders and managers, and regulators and taxpayers. Certain thrift attributes may have differing effects upon insolvency and closure because regulators' best interests may not be served by promptly closing insolvent institutions. In this study, both thrift insolvency and thrift closure are modeled as functions of two broad risk factors: operating risk and agency risk. Using a bivariate probit model to jointly examine determinants of insolvency and closure, the analysis reveals that measures of both operating risk and agency risk generally are statistically significant with the expected signs, providing evidence consistent with the existence both of moral hazard by thrift oweners and of expense-preferent behavior by thrift managers. The results also show that agency conflicts between regulators and taxpayers are important in explaining why some thrifts were closed while others were not. (c) 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

In a recent paper, Parker (1990) proposed that corporate financial reporting and auditing regulation in major nineteenth-century British industries was associated with concerns about monopoly powers, privileges granted by the State and financial and physical safety. This paper examines whether these factors can explain variation in the use of distributable profit for regulating dividends in special legislation and private acts of Parliament in four of the nineteenth-century industries covered by Parker, namely banking, railways, gas and insurance. It is argued that the use of dividend restrictions based on distributable profit was associated with concerns about monopoly power in these industries, but was not associated with issues of privilege or safety. Other explanations, including agency theory, are considered and rejected. (c) 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

In the search for more realistic models of managerial behaviour, the principal-agent model has been credited with valuable insights into management accounting problems. However the highly simplified model of organizational conflict and the contrasting complexity of the mathematics required to provide solutions to the agency problem have been frequently cited as limitations to agency theory. The particular purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the agency model's simplistic conceptualization of the conflict of interest inherent in employer-employee relations, and its inadequacy to cope with the complexities and contradictions surrounding the uses of accounting information encountered in evaluating and controlling employee performance.

The board of directors has been identified as a key internal control mechanism for setting CEO compensation. Theory suggests that CEOs will attempt to circumvent board control in an effort to maximize salary. This hypothesis was tested using a sample of 193 firms in a cross-section of industries. Corporate governance literature was reviewed to develop a multiple indicator measure of board control. Although, as hypothesized, CEO salaries were greater in firms with lower levels of control, CEO compensation was not significantly related to firm size or profitability.

Recent research and public discourse on executive compensation and corporate governance suggests a growing consensus that firms can and should increase their control over top managers by increasing the use of managerial incentives and monitoring by boards of directors. This study departs from this consensus by offering an alternative perspective that considers not only the benefits, but also the costs of both incentives and monitoring in large corporations. The study develops and tests a contingency cost/benefit perspective on governance decisions as resource allocation decisions, proposing how and why the observed levels of managerial incentives and monitoring may vary across organizations and across time. Specifically, the study suggests that: (1) firms that are more risky face greater costs when using incentive compensation contracts for top managers, thus reducing the expected level of incentive compensation use for such firms; (2) firms facing this problem of low incentive compensation use can realize greater benefits from higher levels of board monitoring, and thus are likely to rely more on board monitoring; and (3) firms with more complex comporate strategies face higher costs in using board monitoring, and are thus likely to rely less on board monitoring as a source of controlling top management behavior. The study also proposes that within this contingency perspective there may be diminishing 'behavioral returns' to increases in monitoring and incentives. These hypotheses are tested using extensive longitudinal data from over 400 of the largest U.S. corporations. The supportive findings suggest that maximal levels of incentives and monitoring are not necessarily optimal, and that a firm's strategy may not only have significant product/market implications, but also corporate governance implications.

This paper evaluates agency theory as a theory of performance outcome. Agency theory attributes uncertainty in performance outcomes to moral hazard, adverse selection and the state of nature. This paper argues that by overlooking two critical sources of outcome uncertainty in organizations -- incomplete knowledge about the effort-outcome relationship and lack of agreement about effort and outcome -- the generalizability of the theory is strictly limited. Even in such settings where it is generalizable, principal-agent approaches to contract design are unrealistic to the extent that they presume that performance in organizations results exclusively from individual-contributor jobs, exagger ate the degree to which individuals are work-averse, and emphasize the quant ity of effort at the expense of the quality and type of effort. As a theory of performance, principal-agent approaches overstate the importance of opera tional effort and ignore the importance of facilitative effort such as team work. (c) 1994, Sage Publications.

Patterns of corporate governance and control differ significantly across countries because of national differences in structures of ownership and composition of boards of directors. Based on agency theory, we examine the relationship between ownership structure and the composition of the board of directors of 390 large manufacturing firms based in Japan, Western Europe and the United States. In particular, we examine how ownership concentration, bank control and state ownership affect the percentage of outside directors on the corporate boards. The results show that, consistent with predictions of agency theory, ownership structure has significant effects on board composition. Copyright (c) 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The author introduces constructs based on neo-classical and socio-economic assumptions, and argues that board-management relations should be characterized by both "independence" and "interdependence". Interdependence is especially important in small firms. The article presents a model of directorates from research about directorates based on agency theory assumptions. This model is supplemented with constructs from the theory of contractual relations. Whilst traditional literature tends to focus upon "independence" from an agency theory perspective, this article argues that it is necessary to use more than one dimension of attributes regarding the board-management relations in order to understand the board's contribution to company performance, and that trust and solidarity is especially important in small firms. Board-management relations described by simultaneous "independence" and "interdependence" are proposed to give the highest contribution to company performance. The theoretical propositions are exemplified and supported by results of a field survey of directorates in small firms. (c) 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Using the agency theory framework, this study examines the impact of corporate size, profitability, solvency, operational complexity, industry and auditor on the compliance with non-mandatory accounting pronouncements. Results of the probit analysis of 106 listed companies are generally consistent with agency theory hypotheses. In particular, companies that are large, profitable and highly geared are more likely to comply with non-mandatory accounting pronouncements. Also, companies in the industrial and commercial sector and companies audited by large public accounting firms are more likely to comply with nonmandatory pronouncements than do their counterparts. The hold-out accuracy rates of the probit model are 78.6% for non-compliance, 87.5% for compliance, and 84.0% overall. (c) 1994, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This article suggests that strategy research (and other management disciplines as well) should move beyond a neo-Hobbesian approach to contracting toward a new social contract approach. Work from an agency theory perspective in particular has generated utilitarian insights, but its description of agent behavior is too limited and its assumptions are not a useful guide to productive alliances among firms. Altruism, ethics, goodwill, moral sentiments, and trust need to be placed in the foreground of our vision, and society must be accepted as the ultimate principal to which both individuals and firms are responsible.

This paper argues that attempts to build a theory of performance in organizations have largely been confined to individual disciplines of psychology, sociology, economics and organization theory. The paper highlights the inadequacies of the agency model of performance from organizational economics. The paper suggests that an integrated model of performance can be built by combining ideas from agency theory in economics and organization theory. The paper presents the first step towards such a model. It is shown that organizational activities can be classified as 'operational' or 'facilitative' based on the notion of interdependence. Implications of this model are discussed. (c) IOS B.V.

Several studies have addressed the CEO duality-performance relationship, with inconsistent results. This paper proposes that these inconsistencies can be resolved by integrating agency and stewardship perspectives on duality. Using data from 192 firms in 12 industries, both the direction and magnitude of the duality-performance relationship was found to vary systematically across Dess and Beard's (1984) environmental dimensions. These results provide partial support for both agency and stewardship perspectives. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Research on the determinants and effects of various governance mechanisms typically assumes that these mechanisms operate independently. However, since a variety of mechanisms are used to achieve alignment of the interests of shareholders and managers, we propose that the level of a particular mechanism should be influenced by the levels of other mechanisms which simultaneously operate in the firm. We examine the substitution effects between alternative internal governance mechanisms for a sample of 81 bank holding companies in the postderegulation period. Specifically, we consider the relationship between monitoring by outside directors and the following mechanisms: monitoring by large outside shareholders, mutual monitoring by inside directors, and incentive effects of shareholdings by managers. Our results provide evidence consistent with the substitution hypothesis. We examine the implications of our findings for future research in the area of corporate governance.

In this paper we argue that unobservable constructs lie at the core of a number of influential theories used in the strategic management literature--including agency theory, transaction cost theory, and the resource-based view of the firm. The debate over how best to deal with the problem of unobservables has raged in the philosophy of science literature for the best part of the current century. On the one hand, there are the positivists, who believe that theories containing unobservable constructs are only useful as tools for making predictions. According to positivists, such theories do not inform us about the deep structure of reality. On the other hand, there are the realists, who believe that our theories can give us knowledge about unobservables. Herein we review this debate, we argue for adopting a realist position, and we draw out the implications for strategic management research. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

New Zealand is currently experiencing a liberal and competitive economic environment which has led to a greater investment interest in corporate securities. Likewise, New Zealand firms are also developing strategies to attract investors, for example, through voluntary disclosure of information. Therefore, the level of information voluntarily disclosed by New Zealand companies is of interest to prospective investors. The purpose of this study is to examine empirically the relationship between five firm-specific characteristics and the general level of accounting information voluntarily disclosed by companies listed on New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZSE). In this study the a priori expectations are based on agency theory. The five firm-specific characteristics examined are: firm size, leverage, assets-in-place, type of auditor, and foreign listing status. The results obtained from cross-sectional regression show that firm size, foreign listing status and leverage are significantly related to the extent of voluntary disclosure. In contrast assets-in-place and type of auditor are not significant explanatory variables. A study of this type would be of particular relevance to accounting policy makers because, inter alia, it helps them in (a) understanding corporate disclosure behaviour, (b) explaining why firms adopt certain disclosure strategies, and (c) developing a coherent and acceptable set of mandatory disclosure requirements.

This study examines the interrelation between board composition and variables that capture various agency and financial dimensions of the firm. The agency literature suggests that outside directors on the board provide important monitoring functions in an attempt to resolve, or at least mitigate, agency conflicts between management and shareholders. The agency literature indicates that other mechanisms such as managerial equity ownership, dividend payments, and debt leverage also serve as important devices in reducing agency conflicts in firms. This study argues and documents that an inverse relationship exists between the proportion of external members on the board and managerial stock ownership, dividend payout, and debt leverage. This is consistent with the hypothesis that individual firms choose an optimal board composition depending upon alternative mechanisms employed by the firm to control agency conflicts. Board composition is also found to be systematically related to a number of other variables including institutional holdings, growth, volatility, and CEO tenure.

We examine how ownership configuration affects the determination of CEO pay raises. Based on a sample of 188 firms over a 5-year period, it was found that pay raises were based on distinctly different factors, depending on the ownership profile of the firm. In management-controlled firms--where no single major owner exists--results suggest an overarching pay philosophy: maximize CEO pay, subject to demonstration of face legitimacy of that pay. In externally-controlled firms--where a major (nonmanager) owner exists--results suggest a very different philosophy: minimize CEO pay, subject to the ability to attract/retain a satisfactory CEO.

Critics have argued that the field of information systems (IS) lacks a coherent theoretical framework. This paper attempts to further the theoretical development of a critical and pervasive contemporary phenomenon, outsourcing of IS functions, by synthesizing four theoretical models (resource-based theory, resource-dependence theory, transaction cost theory and agency theory) that are useful for understanding determinants of a firm's outsourcing strategy. From these theoretical models, a contingency model of outsourcing is developed which can be used to direct empirical research. (c) 1995, Palgrave Publishing. All Rights Reserved.

This study tests the effects of ownership concentration, outside director equity holdings, and corporate strategy on, and the Performance implications of, the size and relatedness of units sold by parent firms. The study is based on a model that integrates agency and resource-based theories, and a sample of sell-offs by 112 Fortune 500 firms. Ownership concentration is found to be associated positively with the sale of unrelated and small units. This relationship is strengthened when outside director equity is high. In addition, the effects of corporate strategy types on the characteristics of units sold depend on ownership concentration and outside director equity. Finally, post'sell-off performance of the parent firm is associated negatively with the relatedness of the unit sold. These results suggest that the type of unit sold depends on the type of economic benefit sought by the parent firm. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this research, the authors present a model that demonstrates that motivating managers to change unpopular or irresponsible corporate behavior may be required when the stakeholders desire such a change. Using agency theory, they then test part of the model and demonstrate why it may be necessary for an organized protest to impact on share prices before managers choose to change the behavior. Investors' reactions to announcements of product boycotts and stock divestitures made over the 23-year period 1969-1991 were examined. Announcements about boycotts were associated with significant negative market reactions, whereas divestiture announcements resulted in no significant market responses. From a pure stock market perspective, boycotts appear to be a more effective tool in influencing managers to change a company's behavior. (c) 1995, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

This paper provides an empirical examination of the impact of the corporation tax and agency costs on firms' capital structure decisions. Our evidence suggests that the agency costs are the main determinants of corporate borrowing. Consistent with the agency theory, we find that firms that have fewer growth options have more debt in their capital structure. Moreover, our results show that debt mitigates the free cash flow problem and that firms that are more likely to be diversified and less prone to bankruptcy are highly geared. the negative effect of insider shareholding on leverage disappears, however; when all the agency mechanisms are accounted for. In addition, we find that, in the long run, companies that are tax exhausted exhibit significantly lower debt ratios than tax-paying firms. However, in the short run, firms' capital structure decisions are not affected by taxation. Copyright (c) 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

This paper addresses the effects on corporate restructuring of changing management and ownership. First, it synthesises a number of perspectives on corporate restructuring which involve managerial succession, voluntary restructuring, agency theory, incentives and entrepreneurship, to obtain insights into the relative impact of simultaneously changing either, neither or both management and ownership. Second, it uses case study evidence from management buy-ins to examine the effects of changing both management and ownership. the evidence suggests that whilst management may be adequately incentivized, problems may arise in respect of information asymmetries, difficulties in matching entrepreneurs to the context and monitoring by venture capitalists, and implementation of strategies.

Quality management practitioners in the USA such as W. Edwards Deming, strongly advocate the Japanese model of supplier relationships-recommending substantial specific investment in a single supplier for improved co-ordination and higher quality. But the strategy literature and conventional wisdom favor multiple sourcing, suggesting that a high level of specific investment in a sole source will lead to problems with supplier performance. Using agency theory, we construct a model to evaluate the tradeoff between the costs to set up and coordinate with suppliers and the incentive for performance provided by competition. We find that the validity of Deming's Point Four, that sole sourcing is more profitable than competitive sourcing, depends on parameters such as profit sensitivity to supplier performance.

Couched in positive agency theory, it is shown that the straight-commission compensation system (SCCS) creates a conflict of interest between the agent's and the client's self-interests. Based on this, it is hypothesized that the SCCS will encourage agents to intend to act unethically towards their clients. Two hundred and forty five insurance agents in the U.S. were surveyed, with 59% responding. The results suggest that the SCCS does not significantly affect agents' ethical intentions, positively or negatively. This lack of empirical evidence may be due to the unique nature of the sample. Indeed, the company which enabled this sample appears to have found a practical solution to temper the potential negative effects of the SCCS in its commitment to selective hiring and marketing products which benefit both the client and the agent.

This paper examines the capital structure decisions of firms in the retailing sector of the UK economy. A model is developed, in the context of agency theory, which focuses on the role of risk, tangible assets, reputational assets and growth potential as explanatory variables. An attempt is also made at assessing the success of retailing firms in adjusting their capital structures in the current recession. While the results are generally in line with other empirical work and, in addition, suggest that capital structure adjustment has been reasonably rapid, risk had an unexpected positive effect on financial leverage. Finally, some policy implications are discussed; in particular the role that investment in reputational assets has in partly off-setting the negative effect on the debt capacity of the firm of investment in future growth potential.

This study addresses the question of whether directors of publicly listed companies engage in self-serving behaviour. Specifically, the enquiry considers whether directors in failing firms reduce personal shareholdings in their firms as failure approaches. The answer not only has implications for shareholders and regulators but has importance in terms of agency theory. While it appears that directors of failed firms do not hold fewer shares or reduce their shareholdings in their own firms, it seems that they do not increase their shareholdings as frequently as those in non-failed firms.

This study extends agency theory to explain the design of compensation strategy in foreign subsidiaries competing within global industries. Results from 100 subsidiaries in five countries indicate that compensation strategy is influenced by the agency problem, defined by the subsidiary's cultural distance from its headquarters market, lateral centralization, and senior management's commitment to the parent. In addition, the association between the overall design of the compensation strategy and perceived subsidiary effectiveness was examined. An incentive structure aligned to the agency state was positively related to subsidiary effectiveness.

This article investigates the financial structure of small firms with an emphasis on growth and access to capital markets. Neo-classical economic, life cycle, pecking order and agency theory perspectives are reviewed in order to formulate testable propositions concerning levels of long-term, short-term and total debt, and liquidity. Up-to-date financial data were collected from the U.K. Private+ database for a large sample comprising of both listed and unlisted small firms. Regression results indicate significant relationships between financial structure and profitability, asset structure, size, age and stock market flotation but not growth except when rapid and combined with lack of stock market flotation. Analysis of stock market flotation as an interactive dummy reveals major differences between listed and unlisted small firms. The results indicate that the variety of financial structures observed in practice may reflect rational trade-offs of various costs on the part of small firm owner-managers but that the over-reliance on internally available funds and the importance of collateral, in the case of unlisted small firms, are likely to be major constraints on economic growth.

This paper examines the influence of competitive strategy on the relationship between suppliers and their distribution networks. Drawing on agency theory, hypotheses are developed specifying the appropriate match between manufacturer strategies and systems of control within distribution channels. Cluster analysis is used to show distinct differences in channel management and structure for the three generic strategies of cost leadership, differentiation and focus. Results suggest that variation in control relationships may be explained by the demands posed by manufacturers' competitive strategies. This study therefore extends the applicability of Porter's typology to the specific structure of distribution channels and shows that agency theory can provide insights into the economic basis of interorganizational relationships.

This study used a sample of middle-level managers to investigate the effects of organization-level agency-theory-based variables on the proportion of variable compensation that managers receive. Level of task programmability was associated with an increased use of variable pay, and long-term relationships between an agent and principal were associated with decreased use. Results supported the classical organizationtheory prediction that under higher risk, organizations use higher proportions of variable pay; but results question agency theory's ability to predict compensation strategy for middle-level managers in the high-risk situation.

The study of capital structure has increasingly gained importance in strategic management research. Paradigms derived from organizational economics have also gained popularity in explaining firm actions. Agency theory and transaction cost economics represent two such paradigms that rely on the notion of market imperfections. Notwithstanding the similarities between them, these two offer different explanations of the role of debt and equity in a firm. The governance abilities of the financing structures and the nature of assets of the firm provide two key sources of differences. Viewing capital structure from transaction cost economics gives rise to predictions that are contradictory to those presented by agency theory. It is argued that the extant evidence mainly supports the transaction cost viewpoint. Two organizational phenomena - leveraged buyouts and product diversification - are used to highlight the comparison.

For innovators and entrepreneurs in service businesses, franchising is frequently suggested as a way to succeed and grow. Academic research has provided little guidance for potential franchisors, however. This article provides a model to guide that choice of organizational form using results from agency theory. Analytically, franchising is a way to allocate decisions within the franchise system between the franchisor and the franchisee in order to promote efficiency and provide incentives. Franchisees make decisions regarding local operations, such as hours, prices, and locations, because they have the knowledge about local trading conditions. Franchisors make decisions regarding the product, its production, and associated marketing efforts that together create the standardization that the trademark signals. The revenue of franchise systems is divided to provide incentives to each party to support the allocation of decisions. Franchisors receive a percentage of gross sales, typically 5%, to compensate them for use of the trademark and associated services. Franchisees keep the unit's profits after paying royalties. These profits motivate the franchisee to make the good decisions that operate the unit efficiently. But franchising has limitations as well. First, by making franchisees invest in a unit in a specific geographic area, the franchise system exposes the franchisees to business risk; it consists of local economic conditions beyond franchisees' control that could reduce or eliminate their capital. That risk could be eliminated by owning a geographically diversified portfolio of shares of units in different places, but then incentives are weakened. Second, the requirements of standardization under the common trademark constrain franchisees from the full use of their human capital, including their knowledge of local conditions. Some adaptations to the local market are prohibited by the requirement of standardization. So high levels of either business risk or human capital in an industry make franchising a less desirable choice of organizational form. These ideas are tested with interindustry data using an econometric discrete choice model on the share of sales through franchise systems (termed organizational form share). The methodology is identical to market share models used in economics and marketing. Business risk, as measured by percent of units that have failed in the industry in the last 3 years, and human capital required in the industry, as measured by average wages paid, both negatively influence the share of sales through franchise systems. The model can be applied by entrepreneurs considering franchising, especially in industries not traditionally associated with franchising. Using public data sources identified in the study, a prospective franchisor can research the industry to determine if industry conditions support franchising as the optimal choice of organizational form. The empirical tests also suggest a second managerially relevant conclusion: the decision of "should we franchise?" can be and should be separated from the decision of "how do we implement franchising?" Factors previously shown to influence the implementation of franchising, the degree of ownership of units within the system, do not influence organizational form share, thus suggesting that the strategic decision of whether to franchise is distinct from the operating decision of how to implement franchising.

Using agency theory and the stakeholder fairness concept as the conceptual base, this study confirmed three agency theory hypotheses about differential relationships between four sets of pay procedures and evaluations of pay, supervision and the employing organization. Education and seniority related variables were also found to moderate the relationships between procedural justice perceptions and evaluations of supervision and the employing organization. The study used a stratified random sample of 612 occupationally heterogeneous employees of a large County government in South Eastern United States. Results suggest that agency theory provides a parsimonious explanation for why justice matters in compensation decision making.

Empirical studies of information systems planning practices in organizations indicate that wide variations exist. We propose and test a model based on agency theory and transaction-costs economics to account for these variations. As senior management's uncertainty with respect to the information systems function increases, we argue they will delegate more decision rights to the information systems manager. As a result of increased agency costs, senior management will demand more information systems planning to provide the basis for monitoring and bonding of the manager. In addition, because information systems plans may be used to resolve the distribution of gains and losses between senior management and the information systems manager in the event of unforeseen circumstances, both senior management and the information systems manager will seek to exercise control over the planning process and the form of the final plan. We argue that the relative specialization of human capital of senior management versus the information systems manager will dictate whose views dominate in the preparation of and form of the information systems plan. Our empirical results show moderate support for our model.

Variability in employment levels, particularly when resulting from downsizing and layoffs, has considerable consequences for employees and organizations. Applying strategic compensation and agency theory principles to multiple years of employment, financial performance, and managerial compensation data on 152 organizations, we found that compensation design was related to employment variability through two avenues. First, organizations relying more heavily on long-term compensation incentives for managers exhibited less employment variability. Second, when groups of employees were covered by variable pay plans, their employment variability was lower.

Most current writers on strategic control, whether from the rational planning or processual schools, agree on the importance of dialogue and debate between the interested parties to the control process. This is particularly so when strategic control is regarded in a 'warning bell' sense, responding to a signal that all is not going according to plan, rather than as a behavioural constraint or as an element of agency theory practice. This paper advances a normative framework for ensuring the effectiveness of such discussions based on Bird's notion of a 'good conversation'. Bird argued that the discussion of business ethical problems should be vocal, reciprocating, issues-oriented, rational, imaginative, and honest. It is argued here that these characteristics should also apply to the discussions within the strategic control process if the process is not to be dysfunctional.

Executive compensation has recently become the subject of extensive scrutiny by the popular press. However, compensation for corporate directors is one area which has only received little attention or research. The present study combined resource dependence and agency theories with previous research on executive salaries to develop an explanatory model of director compensation. Data were collected from US firms at two points in time to assess the stability of these predictors. Four variables were found to have a significant relationship with director compensation: firm size, firm profitability, equity ownership by directors, and resource richness of the board. However, the explanatory power of these variables appear to decline over time. Practical implications of these results are discussed.

This paper contends that a major breakthrough has occurred in economics, that this breakthrough is related to the matching of economics and organization theory, and that this breakthrough is already remodeling our understanding of how economic systems work. Section I comes back to the problem of the existence of organizations and to its generalization through the concept of "governance" structures. Section II develops the explanation provided by transaction cost economics of the trade-off among these structures. Section III compares recent contributions of agency theory and of transaction cost economics to the analysis of the structuring mechanism of formal organizations. Section IV explores some properties of the government of organizations. Section V argues that what precedes may have major consequences on public policies and regulations.

We argue that the policy implications flowing from this view of the world are flawed, as they ignore the role of trust in contract formation and execution. Evidence is drawn from health, local authority, and water service sectors of the economy to illustrate the way in which the efficiency-enhancing properties of contract-based provision may be attenuated if trust is distorted by institutional change.

Innovation in complex engineering projects is hampered by information asymmetries which attend joint problem solving by owners and external organizations. This uncertainty creates additional informational asymmetries between owners and firms engaged in designing, building, and supplying projects. Industrial marketing suggests that overcoming these asymmetries is easier when owners are knowledgeable and part of the design process. We examine whether the same proposition holds for innovation in complex engineering projects. We focus on the relationship between innovativeness of complex engineering projects and internal owner capabilities. We test hypotheses derived from agency and organization theories of innovation. Our results indicate that projects where owners have internal capabilities are generally less innovative than projects where owners lack internal capabilities.

This paper examines the attitudes of the top managers within one large financial services organization in the UK to fixed and variable components of their compensation package. The rationale for performance-related pay for senior managers is to align their interests with those of the shareholders, but little is known about the views of top managers on the effectiveness of such incentives. The results suggest that the design of effective bonus systems is not just a technical issue: perceptions of market fairness with respect to the compensation package and the clear communication of goals are important in getting senior managers to focus on shareholder interests.

The way in which project teams respond to problems and manage risks during IT project developments is affected by the organizational context. In particular, it is affected by the implicit "contract" between the team and the organization. This contract is controlled through the adherence to formal methodologies and the use of organizational control system. This paper looks at risk management from the point of view of team behaviour, focusing on behavioural response to risks in terms of effort and risk aversion. Three case studies of project team behaviour are used to illustrate the types of risk management behaviour which may arise under different contracts between project team and organization.

Agency theory suggests that many of the costs incurred by the taxpayer during the 1980s thrift crisis were the result of conflicts between principals and their agents. This study models the costs associated with three distinct types of agency conflicts involved in closing an insolvent thrift - conflicts between creditors and owners, between owners and managers, and between taxpayers and government officials. Using a model that controls for sample-selection bias, the study presents strong evidence that thrift owners effected wealth transfers from creditors by undertaking high-risk investments, and that government officials pursued policies that increased losses to the thrift deposit insurance fund which ultimately were funded by the taxpayer. The results do not show that managers effected wealth transfers from owners through expense-preference behavior, but rather that inefficient management increased the losses of the deposit insurance fund.

A comparison of the essential characteristics of public and private enterprise against the background of agency theory shows that archetypal public enterprise is not an enterprise in the generally accepted legal and economic senses of that expression. If it is to be efficient, therefore, archetypal public enterprise must not be left dependent upon governance and monitoring systems appropriate to private enterprise but must, by means of an intimate and cooperative (and not an 'arm's length') relationship between the principal (government) and the agent (management), be provided with precisely defined and quantified objectives that lead to an agreed measure of overall performance. The essay's conclusions are important because, inter alia, they shift the efficiency debate from property to governance. (c) 1996 CIRIEC.

This paper considers the relationship between Dutch accounting legislation and changes of organizational form. Empirical evidence is provided on the effects of a 1970 accounting law for the public company form and on the effects of a 1982 accounting law for the private company form. Much of the agency theory literature assumes that accounting regulation limits firms' opportunities to minimize agency costs and, thus, reduces firms' abilities to survive. Hence, a company subjected to new accounting requirements may have an incentive to change to an organizational form without accounting requirements (e.g., a partnership form). However, it may be expected that in deciding whether to change organizational form, a firm will take switching costs, like taxes, into account. This paper uses the following data: 1) the number of firms switching between organizational forms, and 2) changes in the total number of firms in various categories of organizational forms. The results suggest that the first accounting law negatively affected the number of public companies, and the second negatively affected the number of private companies. However, the results also indicate that the effects of the 1970 accounting law were much stronger than those of the 1983 accounting law. Differences in switching cost are suggested as an explanation for this difference.

Recent thinking about top management has been influenced by alternative models of man.1 Economic approaches to governance such as agency theory tend to assume some form of homo-economicus, which depict subordinates as individualistic, opportunistic, and self-serving. Alternatively, sociological and psychological approaches to governance such as stewardship theory depict subordinates as collectivists, pro-organizational, and trustworthy. Through this research, we attempt to reconcile the differences between these assumptions by proposing a model based upon the subordinate's psychological attributes and the organization's situational characteristics.

Among the various stakeholders of a firm, senior managers are the most likely targets for private and public political pressures. Other stakeholder groups are less visible and may be perceived as less influential in corporate strategy formulation and implementation. In some situations, consequently, senior executives may adopt corporate strategies in response to political pressures even if these strategies may be costly to shareholders. In this study, a special case is examined: the effect of divestment of South African business units on firm value. Using data from 1984 through 1990, we examine the impact that announcements of divestments have upon the stock return behavior of publicly traded firms. Our results indicate that significant and negative excess returns accrue to shares of companies announcing divestments of South African operations. These results are supportive of the premise that noneconomic pressures may influence managerial strategies rather than value-enhancement goals.

In this article I examine those business exchanges in which firms hire professional service organizations and give them limited decisionmaking authority to perform knowledge-intensive tasks. I frame such exchanges within agency theory perspective and invoke the extant literature on professions to delineate several attributes that make principal-professional exchanges intrinsically distinct from others, such as owner-manager agency. In doing so, I question and complement some key assumptions in agency theory and also discuss explicitly how the study of principal-professional exchanges helps highlight important considerations not addressed in the mainstream theory. I then present an expanded framework that integrates agency theory and the literature on the professions and present several propositions to outline four types of restraints on potential opportunistic behavior of professional agents: (1) self-control, (2) community control, (3) bureaucratic control, and (4) client control. The article ends with theoretical and empirical implications.

In recent years, agency theory has substantially influenced research on corporate governance. Organizational sociologists have critiqued the agency theory model of boards as limited and have studied how the functioning of boards is shaped by structural, political, and cognitive contexts. Building on their work, this paper empirically studies the cultural embeddedness of boards in a nonprofit organization called Medlay. It shows how organizational identity - the members' shared beliefs about the central, enduring, and distinctive characteristics of the organization - influences the construction and enactment of the director's role and shapes interactions among board members and managers. The findings demonstrate that the role of the director is shaped by Medlay's Janus-faced identity, as both a volunteer-driven organization and a family of friends; directors see themselves as vigilant monitors and as friendly, supportive colleagues. The findings also portray how some board members' scrutiny of the budget, including "lavish" travel expenditures, surfaces the contradictions in Medlay's identity, and creates conflicts for directors. Should board members take managers to task and thereby exercise vigilance and uphold the ideal of volunteer control, or should they safeguard the principle of friendship and avoid all conflict? An influential subset of directors and top managers resolved the budget issue and preserved Medlay's identity by using different "face-saving" strategies to make directors feel that they had been vigilant, and to affirm sentiments of cooperation. More generally, this study extends the literature on corporate governance by showing how organizational identity influences the construction and enactment of the director's role. It introduces the idea of "conflicts of commitment," a form of intra-role conflict that arises when directors are besieged by conflicting aspects of the organization's identity. When actions occur that breach the expected role performance of board members, latent contradictions in the organizational identity emerge, and directors are faced with the conflict of upholding one dimension of identity while undermining the other. The study also contributes to research on organizational identity by proposing a model of how organizational and individual identities shape the board role through the processes of identification and action, and how a hybrid identity generates the potential for intra-role conflict.

Previous empirical studies of top managers tend to draw from either positive agency theory or strategic leadership theory. This manuscript reviews and critiques these two approaches, outlining their advantages and inherent limitations. Because each is inherently limited, we suggest that developments in personality theory, transformational leadership theory, and visionary leadership theory can contribute to a more realistic view of top managers. Consequently, we contrast these three alternative perspectives with the two more dominant approaches in this manuscript. As a result, we identify future research directions for scholars interested in studying strategic leadership. (c) 1997 JAI Press Inc. All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

This study examines the performance implications of the fit between strategic orientations and incentive plan characteristics. Research hypotheses are based on a framework that draws upon managerial discretion and agency theories to identify the links between firm strategy, managerial motivation and control, managerial risk-bearing, and incentive plan characteristics. A pooled cross-sectional, time series research design is used to test hypotheses in a sample of 50 electric utility firms. Consistent with theory, results indicate that annual bonus plans that use cash incentives and accounting measures of performance lead to better performance among firms with Defender strategic orientations. In contrast, firms with Prospector strategic orientations realize performance benefits when they adopt stock-based incentive plans and use market measures to evaluate managerial performance.

Downsizing and layoffs are an important mechanism for U.S. firms to cope with their strategic and economic environment. In contrast, the Japanese tradition of lifetime employment limits the ability affirms to employ layoffs as a strategic measure, relegating its use to conditions of financial distress. This paper provides the first comparison of layoffs in Japan and the United States and examines stock price reactions to layoff announcements in each country from 1990 to 1994. Agency theory and Aoki's cooperative game theory are employed to discuss differences in the governance structures of U.S. and Japanese firms and their implication for stock price reactions. Results show that layoff announcements trigger negative returns for both U.S. and Japanese firms. Specifically, layoff announcements of U.S. firms are associated with a negative 1.78 percent abnormal return, while layoff announcements for Japanese firms are associated with a negative 0.56 percent abnormal return. To better understand the impact of layoffs, this study examines the relationships between stock price reactions and various layoff characteristics (such as whether the layoff is proactive or reactive or whether the layoff is the first in the industry). Implications of the findings are discussed. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The reported research examines the relative contributions of prospect and agency theory explanations for specific operational risks and subsequent firm performance in regulated and unregulated environments. Specifically, this study simultaneously models competing theoretical explanations for risk using three distinct realized operational risks managed by savings and loan (S&L) firms. It then examines the effects of these risks on performance. Implications of this study argue for a mesotheoretic approach to the modeling of risk and for its disaggregation into distinct risk choices.

Recent studies have examined the determinants of international joint venture (IJV) formations and stock market reactions to such investments. Less is known, however, about the evolution of IJVs and the attendant performance implications for parent firms. This paper examines one specific type of IJV evolution, IJV internalization, whereby one firm acquires the IJV by buying out its partners). Standard agency theory variables are hypothesized to influence parent firm valuation effects. The results indicate that parent firm valuation effects are positively related to the parent firm equity owned by insiders and the interaction of debt financing and free cash flow.

This paper discusses a model that combines internal and external control mechanisms in a firm in which assets can have alternative uses that are in some states more profitable than the current one. However, restructuring a firm in order to realize the gains from alternative uses affects managers adversely since they invest in firm-specific human capital. Managers can be motivated to restructure the firm through their compensation scheme. Alternatively, investors can acquire costly information on the firm and interfere with managers' decisions. The main focus is on independent directors, who review and monitor contracts and managers' compensation. If information is not too costly, directors are the optimal institution to check managerial discretion and the degree of managerial entrenchment depends on the compensation of independent directors. However, if directors fail to exercise control over management properly, takeovers or creditor control become second-best solutions. If information is costly to transfer, unchecked managerial control may be optimal.

This article uses the insights of agency theory to analyze ownership structures in the life-health insurance industry. We examine operational, financial, and institutional determinants of ownership structure. We simultaneously test hypotheses regarding the owner-manager incentive conflict and the owner-policyholder incentive conflict. Our results demonstrate systematic differences between the activity choices of stock life insurers and mutual life insurers, consistent with the managerial discretion hypothesis. We also find that mutuals are more likely to be licensed in New York, stock firms are more likely to be organized as groups, mutuals are more likely to have high A. M. Best ratings, and older insurers are more likely to be mutuals.

This paper's empirical results indicate that the average effect of antitakeover provisions on subsequent long-term investment is negative. The interpretation of these results depends on whether one thinks that there was too much, too little, or just the right amount of long-term investment prior to the antitakeover provision adoption. We use agency theory to devise more refined empirical tests of the effects of antitakeover provision adoption by managers in firms with different incentive and monitoring structures. Governance variables (e.g. percentage of outsiders on corporate boards, and separate CEO/chairperson positions) have an insignificant impact on subsequent long-term investment behavior. However, consistent with agency theory predictions, managers in firms with better economic incentives (higher insider ownership) tend to cut subsequent long-term investment less than managers in firms with less incentive alignment. Furthermore, managers in firms with greater external monitoring (due to higher institutional ownership) also tend to cut subsequent long-term investment less than managers in firms with less external monitoring. Thus, the decrease in subsequent long-term investment is significantly less for firms where the managers have greater incentives to act in shareholders' interests. Finally, there are interesting effects of the control variables. First, high book equity/market equity firms cut total long-term investment more. Second, firms that were takeover targets or rumored to be takeover targets cut long-term investment more. These results suggest that inefficient firms cut long-term investment more when an antitakeover provision is adopted. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Examination of financial economic stories told at a conference on hostile takeovers demonstrates the power of stories to frame thinking about issues and to compel and convince listeners. Assumptions of financial economic stories include ethical properties ascribed to market forces, primacy of shareholder wealth maximization, and presumption that managers are the enemy. When market efficiency and agency theory assumptions are questioned, financial economic stories fail to provide a convincing response to the concerns of economic justice. Ethical shortcomings of financial economic theory are relevant since financial economic theory underlies accounting practice and research. Accountants' ability to portray performance and value becomes critical if market prices do not adequately represent this information. If the social benefits of shareholder wealth maximization are questioned, accounting must be expanded to adequately meet the needs of stakeholders other than shareholders and accounting researchers must investigate the wealth distribution effects of financial reporting.

Recent occurrences of financial distress to some insurers have raised questions about whether the current guaranty system is adequate to protect policyholders. Four new systems have been proposed. Using the state preference model, it was found the Stewart's national system faring the best, if it adopts uniform regulation. Based on agency theory, the pre-assessment approach and the policyholder surcharge (or premium increase) recoupment method were found to be better than the current post-assessment approach and premium tax offset method. Furthermore, uniform policy limits and regulations are recommended.

Much of the literature on accounting is totally irrelevant to African conditions and problems. Asechemie's reconstruction of pre-colonial African accounting therefore has special value for African accounting scholarship. This critique examines the central, and very important, question addressed by Asechemie: that is, whether a contemporary accounting theory can be used to explain and reconstruct past practices, particularly in a foreign context. In addition, another perspective on the African labour process and the "house" (or communal) system is offered. The use of oral history methodology in the reconstruction of the past, agency theory's relevance to pre-colonial Nigeria and the concept of "African maintenance accounting" are examined. The critique also assesses whether (1) the pre-colonial African setting was a capitalist or non-capitalist social one, (2) agency theory applies to settings other than the modern Western capitalist world and (3) there are other pre-colonial accounting systems that can illustrate, in a meaningful manner, the prevailing labour processes in that world. It sceptically examines the main points raised in Asechemie's article not in a spirit of criticism, but to suggest points which may have been overlooked and future possible lines of enquiry.

The American corporate sector saw major reform movements during the 1980s. Despite frequent admixture in practice, two key movements can be singled out as analytically distinct: financial restructuring (generally debt-financed, often involving mergers), and total quality management (a particular approach to productive restructuring). Unfortunately the precepts and practices of these movements often clashed. This paper examines these tensions and explores them by reference to economic theories of the firm associated with each movement. While financial restructuring has been interpreted through the lens of neoclassical agency theory, total quality management has strong links with alternative approaches that can be grouped under the heading 'capabilities theory'.

Cooperative organizational forms such as franchising and joint venturing have long been popularamong hospitality chains. However, not all chains use cooperative organizational forms and those that do varygreatlyin theirproclivityto use them. One possible explanation for this variation is that when a chain confronts critical resource scarcities, its managers will use cooperative organization in order to build upon the resources of their partners. However a second approach, agency theory, suggests that chain managers use cooperative organization to minimize the costs of monitor ing outlet managers. Using data on 94 restaurant chains, hypotheses are tested that investigate the independent and joint efficacy of these explanations. Results show that capital and brand name are important resources affecting the choice of organizational form whereas geographic dispersion, task programmability, and asset specificity are key agency variables. Overall, perhaps the key finding is that the ability of agency theory to explain organizational form is diminished among resource scarce chains. The results, therefore, suggest that both perspectives are needed to fully explain the choice of organizational form. (c) 1997 THE COUNCIL ON HOTEL, RESTAURANT AND INSTITUTIONAL EDUCATION.

The agency framework is a general formulation of a stylized relationship between two parties, the principal and the agent, where the principal wants the agent to supply a productive input. However, due to information asymmetries, the relationship is not frictionless. In the case of investments, the agent may use the information asymmetries to produce investment myopia in an attempt to boost the agent'smarket value or otherwise to further his/her own interests. Throughout the literature review, a simplified model is used to capture the information asymmetry leading to bias. Critical drivers, as well as main and ancillary results, are tabulated and discussed. Suggestions of testable hypotheses and managerial implications are provided. As a general conclusion, the theoretical case of investment bias within the agency framework appears to have reached a state of maturity, spanning a number of issues and possible real-world situations. Thus, it seems more and more timely to develop an integrated and general formulation of the problem at hand, a formulation that captures the fundamental economic properties in a stable and convincing fashion, rather than to pursue further variations of assumptions which, in the models, sometimes are of a partial and ad hoc nature. To that end, four possible fundamental investment bias drivers have been suggested: 1. Several input factors that are unobservable to the principal, through 'signal jamming', create a potential for investment bias. 2. Limited possibilities of risk spreading of human capital, together with managerial risk-aversion, affect investment bias. The information asymmetries of the investment models are primarily grouped into hidden action and private information. 3. Chain effects of exogenous frictions in capital markets may induce investment bias. 4. Non-verifiabilities of critical information pose problems of incentive and bias, particularly with innovative output. At a greater level of generality, the investment bias problem revolves around the well-known market failure problems: imperfect and incomplete markets. However, it can be shown that the very foundation of received capital budgeting theory since Fisher (1930) o the Separation Theorem o rests precisely on the assumption of perfect and complete markets. The Separation Theorem in turn provides the theoretical foundation of the received managerial implication: use the discounted cash flow method. Since the agency theory offers an intra-theoretical rationale for questioning the validity of the Separation Theorem, agency theory promises new perspectives on a dominant finding in empirical studies on the administrative use of capital budgeting methods o namely, the limited role of the methods for reaching administrative decisions. Traditionally, this finding has been related to weaker forms of economic rationality (e.g. bounded rationality) and the impact of uncertainty. However, with agency theory there is no need to shift theoretical focus and the finding can instead be related to the impact of information asymmetries. Thus, there is a potential scope for agency theory in both empirical and managerial settings. This potential can hardly be realized by trying to apply specific models to administrative problems, but rather by using the theory as a general framework in which economic trade-offs and information asymmetries in organizational structures and processes are illuminated. Developing the framework into an analytical and useful tool formanagement seems a fruitful research objective, since the positive nature of economics in general suggests a practical role for the agency framework also in this field o the economics of management, and the economics of investment management in particular.(c)Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997.

The best opportunity for growth is often overseas, even for smaller entrepreneurial firms. However, resource-constrained smaller firms do not have as many available entry strategies as larger multinational corporations (MNCs). Smaller firms frequently must ally themselves with partners in order to make international expansion feasible (i.e., employing an export agent, licensing, joint venture, or strategic alliance). The alliance of two distinct parties central to these entry strategies lends itself to an agency theory perspective. Agency theory illuminates the underpinnings of these relationships, in particular highlighting the problems and risks that the entrepreneur faces when entering into the partnership. These problems arise from information asymmetry (each party is privy to knowledge that the other isn't). This article develops these problems within the entrepreneur/ export agent realm and suggests that government assistance can reduce these problems. Specifically, government assistance reduces verification and monitoring costs. The article proposes that those firms that take advantage of governmental information and assistance will more likely enter foreign countries successfully. (c) 1997 Taylor & Francis.

This case considers ethics and agency theory issues presented by an early extinguishment of debt. An electric utility company retired $50 million par of mortgage bonds employing a never-previously-exercised, unique, early retirement provision. This provision allowed the issuer to force early retirement of bonds selling at a premium at par value as opposed to the call price. The case presents the need for financial managers to consider non-financial factors in the process of making financial decisions. The case is based on actual class-action litigation brought by the bondholders. The case is directed to a master's level course, an executive development program, or an upper-division undergraduate course in management accounting. (c) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Total quality management (TQM) has received considerable attention as a way to increase both the effectiveness and the efficiency of corporations (Bounds et. al., 1994; Grant, Shani and Krisnan 1994; Olian and Rynes 1991; Powell 1995; Ross 1993). Concerned primarily with the delivery of customer satisfaction, the proponents of quality and/or TQM (Deming 1986; Juran 1992; and Crosby 1979) have developed principles and procedures for achieving total quality and meeting multiple corporate goals. Empirical evidence regarding outcomes is mixed; success and failure case studies abound, statistical methodologies are questioned, and more rigorous empirical studies present some positive findings (Powell 1995). Some maintain that the reasons for the failure of TQM systems is incompatibility between existing Western management thought which is grounded in economic models, and the TQM paradigm, which evolved from statistical theory, and has its own set of assumptions (Grant, Shani and Krisnan 1994). Despite such mixed empirical results, TQM continues to be promoted and implemented. This is the beginning point for our examination of TQM. The TQ management paradigm is practiced in economically and culturally diverse environments, including those which embrace an economic perspective, complete with maximisation of shareholder wealth, self-interest, rational decision makers, separation of ownership, and agency costs (Grant, Shani and Krishnan 1994).

Firms' boundary choices have undergone careful examination in recent years, particularly in information services. While transaction cost economics provides a widely tested explanation for boundary choice, more recent theoretical work advances competing knowledge-based and measurement cost explanations. Similar to transaction cost economics, these theories examine the impact of exchange attributes on the performance of markets and hierarchies as institutions of governance. These theories, however, offer alternative attributes to those suggested by transaction cost economics or offer alternative mechanisms through which similar attributes influence make-buy choices. Traditional empirical specifications of make-buy models are unable to comparatively test among these alternative theories. By developing and testing a model of comparative institutional performance rather than institutional choice, we examine the degree of support for these competing explanations of boundary choice. Hypotheses are tested using data on the governance of nine information services at 152 companies. Our results suggest that a theory of the firm and a theory of boundary choice is likely to be complex, requiring integration of transaction cost, knowledge-based, and measurement reasoning.

Extant research examining the relationship between a firm's board and its CEO's compensation has focused primarily on the composition of the board-at-large. However, it may be the nature of the compensation committee, not the board as a whole, that is at issue. This study was a longitudinal assessment of the relationship between the composition of a firm's compensation committee and multiple measurements of CEO compensation. We found no evidence that "captured" directors led to greater levels of, or changes in, CEO compensation. These findings may suggest the consideration of theories other than agency theory as explanations for the continued focus on board independence.

Amihud and Lev (1981) are widely cited as providing evidence that managers, unless closely monitored by large block shareholders, will attempt to reduce their employment risk through unrelated mergers and diversification. These corporate strategies, however, may not be in shareholders' interests. Reconsidering the agency assumptions underlying Amihud and Lev's study and the methodology they used, we develop hypotheses regarding the association between ownership structure, board vigilance, corporate strategy, and corporate performance from management theory and test them using Amihud and Lev's data from the 1960s and new data from the 1980s. Neither study supports the conclusions of Amihud and Lev, nor the agency theory belief that monitoring efforts by principals affect the strategic behaviors of agents or the performance of firms that they manage.

The results of this research demonstrate that boards of directors in venture-capital backed companies are more involved in both strategy formation and evaluation than are boards where members do not have large ownership stakes. These same results are demonstrated even when industry, board size, level of diversification, and insider board representation are held constant. Agency theory and institutional theory are advanced as reasons for this higher level of involvement. Venture capitalists are generally seen as value-added investors who have played a significant role in the development of many entrepreneurial businesses (Bygrave and Timmons 1992). This success has lead students of industrial competitiveness like Thurow (1992) to argue that the venture capitalist should serve as an example for directors of all types of organizations. One of the most significant value-added activities of the venture capitalist is involvement with strategy (Fried and Hisrich 1995; MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian 1988; Sapienza 1989, Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir 1996; Rosenstein, Bruno, Bygrave, and Taylor 1993). Implicit in the writings extolling directors who act like venture capitalists (Porter 1992a, 1992b; Bhide 1994; Thurow 1992) is the belief that they will be more active than traditional board members. However, little empirical work has been done to directly compare the level of strategic involvement of the two types of boards. Building on the work of Judge and Zeithaml (1992), this study compares the level of board involvement with strategy by the boards of venture capital-backed companies with the boards of other types of organizations. After establishing different levels of involvement, it then examines why there is a difference. Finally, this study provides additional empirical evidence on the relationship between board involvement and performance (Zahra and Pearce 1989). (c) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

This paper examines the link between a firm's resources and its efficient organization form with a focus on entrepreneurial resources. Entrepreneurial resources are defined as the propensity of an individual to behave creatively, act with foresight, use intuition, and be alert to new opportunities. This paper assumes that these entrepreneurial resources can be distributed in two ways throughout the firm: they can be held by one or a few individuals-"individual entrepreneurial resources" - or they can be dispersed among a team of individuals - "team entrepreneurial resources." Agency theory is used to consider how various organizational characteristics - such as the assignment of decision responsibilities, incentives and risk bearing, the number of hierarchical levels, horizontal linking structures, mutual monitoring and bonding devices, and information systems - will differ in the individual and team entrepreneurial forms. Generally, the individual entrepreneurial form resembles the "classic entrepreneurial firm" (Fama and Jensen 1983) in which various decision making roles and risk bearing are performed by a single entrepreneur. The team entrepreneurial form is similar to what Bartlett and Ghoshal (1993) call "beyond the m-form." Responsibility for steps in the decision process is dispersed in the team form, and monitoring the decision process will occur at the organization's apex. The CEO will not make operational or strategic decisions; instead, he manages the internal market for managers and develops an organization's cultural context and information systems. Below the CEO level, team entrepreneurs are responsible for ratifying innovative decisions, and below this team entrepreneurs are responsible for initiating innovative decisions. After presenting these two entrepreneurial forms, this paper relates them to extant research on corporate entrepreneurship and organizational forms.

Agency theory research on franchising, to date, has posited linear effects of franchisor characteristics on the distribution of company-owned and franchised outlets in franchise systems. This study argues that many of these characteristics actually have curvilinear effects. Using pooled cross-sectional time series regression analysis on U.S. franchisors over the 1991-1994 period, this study tests the curvilinear effects of geographic dispersion, royalty rates, system growth rate, system size, franchise fee and initial investment on the proportion of outlets franchised.

Our current understanding of information technology (IT) usage does not explain why and how managers can influence organizational members to use a new IT. Drawing on principal-agent research, this paper develops and tests a model of intraorganizational IT usage that addresses this important issue. Managerial incentives and control are examined as important components of managerial influences, which are linked to IT usage via a principal-agent model (PAM). Seven research hypotheses are generated from this model and empirically tested using a laboratory experiment. Results of the study indicate that managers can promote IT usage within organizations by designing appropriate incentives and control structures such as monitoring and multiple-period contracts. However, the effectiveness of these structures will depend on potential users' ability to distinguish between various forms of incentives and control.

This study examines the influence of agency costs and ownership concentration on the capital structure of the firm. Of particular interest is the composition of equity ownership as a determinant of overall capital structure and the dynamic adjustment of capital structure to changes in the equity ownership. Results indicate that the distribution of equity ownership is important in explaining overall capital structure and that managers do reduce the level of debt as their own wealth is increasingly tied to the firm. It is also noted that the time-series component is important in resolving the conflicting results reported in prior research. (c) 1998 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper considers some developments within Russian privatized industrial firms 1992-94 through the lens of Stakeholder-Agency Theory (SAT). Although it has its own shortcomings and weaknesses, SAT, unlike the traditional financial version of Agency Theory, at least contemplates the possibility of a transitional period during which enterprise governance structures can evolve. It is by now widely recognised that in the middle of deep economic crisis, the Russian economy is too volatile for longitudinal studies of formally structured samples of firms over a period of time. In any case, SAT is at a stage of development that has not yet yielded detailed predictions for scientific testing. Yet surveys of recently privatized firms in Russia do provide empirical data away from the origins of SAT, and it is argued that this fresh data suggests new research propositions that can hopefully lead to more theoretical refinement and ultimately testing. At the very least, SAT can be used as a heuristic device, capable of providing a way of looking at complex Russian developments in a structured way. A process of Russian privatization through management - employee buy-outs involving giveaway distributions of shares has secured the compliance of the two main groups of enterprise stakeholders who could have prevented the withdrawal of the State from the governance of industrial enterprises, but has not yet produced a form of corporate governance structure that is likely to survive in the long term without State protection. In the longer term, international competitiveness can only be secured in Russia through investment in new products and processes, and the inadequacies of managers and other employees as sources of investable funds mean that incumbents must generate a more welcoming climate for outside investors. Even after such a short period since privatization and in the middle of a deep economic crisis, some enterprises are already favouring more efficient governance structures in a way consistent with SAT.

This paper examines variations in executive pay as a function of CEO power. We assume that CEOs optimize their pay conditional upon their ability to shape decisions that favour their interests. Power is inferred from overt manifestations such as share holdings, but also from covert sources such as a CEOs' social capital. Two components of compensation are considered: base pay and bonus. While financial performance, firm size, and other factors are held constant, the results show overt power as measured by CEO, and CEO-family equity holdings, to have a curvilinear relationship with executive compensation. Proxies of covert power include tenure, being (one of) the founder(s), and firm diversification. These variables magnify or moderate the effect of equity holdings on compensation. The power effects are most pronounced for the size of CEO bonus.

Much debate has been generated about whether privatization tends to enhance firm financial performance. The research presented here seeks to identify the strategic choices that differentiated firms with superior post-privatization performance from those with inferior post-privatization performance. Using agency theory as a theoretical foundation, it is hypothesized that superior post-privatization firm performance will be associated with (1) the government not retaining a significant stock holding, (2) changes in leadership, (3) management stock options being initiated, (4) employee head count being reduced and (5) the company being restructured financially. The sample draws from 41 privatized firms from six industry classifications and 15 countries. To accommodate comparisons of small subsamples, non-parametric statistical methods are used. Controlling for size, industry and country (economic/regulatory effects), the hypotheses are generally supported except for the one relating to headcount.

Although earlier capital structure theories, grounded within the finance paradigm (agency theory, transaction cost theory etc), have contributed to a deeper understanding of the capital structure puzzle, recent efforts suggest that research for the missing pieces of the puzzle should continue. This paper considers that these missing pieces of the puzzle could be diverse non-financial and behavioural factors influencing capital structure decisions, that have received relatively little attention from finance researchers. The paper reports on an exploratory attempt to use interview techniques for the study of capital structure in small firms. Interviews can provide evidence about non-financial and behavioural variables that quantitative analysis cannot. The paper develops a model for understanding capital structure decision making in small firms. It analyses the responses of small business owners/managers concerning the management of the financial structure of their firms and the factors that influence their capital structure decisions. Small business owners' responses indicate that although a number of different financial variables may affect their capital structure decisions, other non-financial and behavioural factors such as the need for control, risk propensity, experience, knowledge and goals may be more important in influencing the capital structure of their firms, at any time. The results indicate that significant progress in understanding the factors that influence capital structure may be achieved if financial researchers incorporate management theory in their studies, so that financial as well as non-financial and behavioural factors are explored.

This paper evaluates the potential for institutional economics to help us frame choices for the design of institutional arrangements aimed at improving public sector performance, and the lessons it offers for the development of a new public management theory. It defines the key elements of transaction cost and principal agency theory and their application to the public sector. Local government contracting, fiscal decentralization, and performance budgeting, applications that share problems resulting from divergent objectives, information costs associated with policy making and implementation, and risks to public sector accountability, are analyzed. This analysis demonstrates that institutional economics can illuminate how public management can effectively utilize private sector solutions by providing the theoretical underpinnings for government reform initiatives.

This research examines the lending decisions made by microenterprise credit support pro-grammes in Jamaica, focusing on what types of owners of firms successfully obtain loans. Utilizing agency theory, human capital and social capital theories, the study examines what types of borrowers successfully navigate the credit market nurtured by non-governmental orga-nizations (NGOs). It is based on field research comparing five organizations, evaluating the loan process and characteristics of each lender, with a study of their market, utilizing interviews conducted with entrepreneurs of 254 informal sector firms. The study first describes and exam-ines the organizational character of the loan agencies, to discern their effect on the loan granting process. Subsequent analysis examines the characteristics of those individuals who received loans, and compares them with those who did not. The research shows that the behaviour of NGO microenterprise credit institutions in Jamaica conform closely to predictions based on agency theory, behaving very differently from banks, credit unions, informal lending associations and families. Although the bureaucratic mechan-isms and organizational goals and objectives were found to be quite similar among the five different NGO credit agencies studied, each lender varied considerably in their tacit selection criteria of their clientele. The research underscores the importance of social capital and human capital on the lending process. (c) 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper combines agency theory and internal-labor-market theories to explain the determinants of bonus payments among a large sample of top and middle managers from Spanish firms. A distinction is made between the decision whether to pay bonus or not and the size of the bonus. The empirical evidence confirms that the two decisions are determined by different factors. The results of the analysis show a trade-off between short-term and long-term incentives (bonuses and promotion opportunities) as well as differences in the pattern of compensation policies across economic sectors and functional areas inside the firm.

The authors describe the pharmaceutical utilization system and present the conceptual framework for agency theory. They then apply agency theory to the selection of pharmaceuticals and the role of drug formularies in drug selection. The use of drug formularies can increase the goal conflict and uncertainty related to the selection of drug products. The authors address public policy and research directions to suggest ways of reducing the level of goal conflict and uncertainty associated with drug selection. Recognition of agency relationships and the environment surrounding agency relationships appear to be important for the development and analysis of future policy regarding selection decisions pertaining to pharmaceuticals.

This paper tests the principal-agent theory in the context of contracting practices for the development of large-scale engineering projects. Five hypotheses are derived from the principal-agent theory regarding the propensity to use behaviour-based contracts versus outcome-based contracts function of the project owner's risk aversion and monitoring competencies, of the goal congruence between principal and agent, of the agent's risk aversion, and of the technological innovation required by the project. A sixth hypothesis states that more successful projects are more in line with the predictions of the first five hypotheses. All hypotheses are translated into testable propositions specific to large-scale engineering projects. For instance, outcome-based contracts are assimilated to fixed-price contracts such as turnkey and EPC. Results based on a sample of 60 power plant projects confirm that participants tend to select contracts as the principal agent theory predicts. Moreover, contracts used in successful projects follow more accurately the theoretical predictions.

We investigate the influence of the composition of the board of directors and stock ownership patterns on the decision to enter markets in Central and Eastern Europe. Our findings suggest that board composition alone does not influence the entry decision while firms with less concentrated stock ownership were more likely to enter these developing markets. We also found that while better performing firms were attracted to opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe, firms with poor prior performance and outside dominated boards were also more likely to enter these markets.

This article aims at provinding an extensive survey of theories an stylized facts of one of the most important elements of financial structure, namely credit to the private sector (firms and households). Section 2 analyses financial structure from the perspective of financial intermediaries (theory of financial intermediation). Section 3 takes the distinction between regulators and regulatees as a starting point (theory of regulation). In section 4 the capital structure of firms is described (theory of capital structure). Section 5 documents the agency relationships between equityholders and managers and between equityholders and debtholders (agency theory). In section 6 one of the key characteristics of a credit contract, its maturity, is examined (theory of debt maturity). In all of these sections the theoretical issues involved are complemented by a summary of relevant stylized facts of financial structure. Futhermore, a cross-country comparison is made. Finally, section 7 provides a synthesis and summary of the findings of the former sections.

The model of managerial incentives used in Positive Accounting Theory sees debt contracts as important in accounting choices in firms. The paper argues that agency theory and costly contracting theory imply a much wider role for debt contracts as corporate governance mechanisms for controlling relationships between lenders and firms. We analyse the creditor's problem in providing debt to the firm in terms of anticipated agency costs. This analysis leads to a consideration of contracting solutions involving the choice of debt contract terms providing credit protections which are efficient in agency cost and contracting cost terms. The model of debt contracts accepted in the literature is based upon US research, both theoretical and empirical, and thus reflects US institutional experience. This model involves detailed bonding and monitoring terms focusing upon financial and other covenants and implies customisation of such terms to meet creditors' contracting requirements. The paper reviews evidence on the applicability of this model in practice and concludes that, despite broad similarities, institutional biases are present if the model is applied to countries other than the US. We examine evidence on UK debt contracting practices, in particular contract form and content, types of covenant, lenders' perceptions of the role of covenants as control mechanisms, and the issue of standardisation versus customisation. The paper identifies important differences in debt contracting in the UK, for example in types of covenants and the role perceived for them by creditors and identifies standardisation in contract terms as being more common than often implied by other research.

The development of the field of strategic management within the last two decades has been dramatic. While its roots have been in a more applied area, often referred to as business policy, the current field of strategic management is strongly theory based, with substantial empirical research, and is eclectic in nature. This review of the development of the field and its current position examines the field's early development and the primary theoretical and methodological bases through its history. Early developments include Chandler's (1962) Strategy and Structure and Ansoff's (1965) Corporate Strategy. These early works took on a contingency perspective (fit between strategy and structure) and a resource-based framework emphasizing internal strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps, one of the more significant contributions to the development of strategic management came from industrial organization (IO) economics, specifically the work of Michael Porter. The structure-conduct-performance framework and the notion of strategic groups, as well as providing a foundation for research on competitive dynamics, are flourishing currently. The IO paradigm also brought econometric tools to the research on strategic management. Building on the IO economics framework, the organizational economics perspective contributed transaction costs economics and agency theory to strategic management. More recent theoretical contributions focus on the resource-based view of the firm. While it has its roots in Edith Penrose's work in the late 1950s, the resource-based view was largely introduced to the field of strategic management in the 1980s and became a dominant framework in the 1990s. Based on the resource-based view or developing concurrently were research on strategic leadership, strategic decision theory (process research) and knowledge-based view of the firm. The research methodologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated and now frequently combine both quantitative and qualitative approaches and unique and new statistical tools. Finally, this review examines the future directions, both in terms of theory and methodologies, as the study of strategic management evolves. (c) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

We offer a rationale for a link between capital scarcity and franchising. Predictions respectively based on agency theory and the capital scarcity hypothesis were tested among 91 restaurant chains. Our specific focus was on whether or not variables based on capital scarcity could explain variance in firms' franchising decisions beyond what was explained by agency variables. The latter were significant predictors of franchising, and the capital scarcity variables explained additional variance, indicating that capital is among the resources related to franchising.

We claim that there is a link between corporate control structure and managers' strategy towards unrelated mergers and risk diversification. Companies with greater ownership concentration are less diversified. Evidence also shows that corporate diversification generally results in value loss while focussing is value increasing.

This paper uses a nonlinear simultaneous equation methodology to examine how managerial ownership relates to risk taking, debt policy, and dividend policy. The results have implications for our understanding of agency costs. We find risk to be a significant and positive determinant of the level of managerial ownership while managerial ownership is also a significant and positive determinant of the level of risk. The result supports the argument that managerial ownership helps to resolve the agency conflicts between external stockholders and managers but at the expense of exacerbating the agency conflict between stockholders and bondholders. We further observe evidence of substitution-monitoring effects between managerial ownership and debt policy, between managerial ownership and dividend policy, and between managerial ownership and institutional ownership.

This study uses agency theory to develop testable implications about three provisions commonly observed in franchise contracts: (1) restrictions on passive ownership, (2) area development plans, and (3) mandatory advertising expenditures. The primary hypothesis is that these provisions are most likely when there are significant externalities among the units within the franchise system. The evidence, based on a large sample of franchise contracts, is generally consistent with this hypothesis. The evidence also suggests that these incentive instruments are complements. In contrast to the theory, most of the results do not support the hypothesis that the percentage of company-owned units is related to externalities within the system. Franchisee risk aversion and/or wealth constraints appear more important. While the study focuses on franchising, the results provide insights into related provisions in other contracts.

Using both agency theory and comparative national culture frameworks, this study investigated factors determining the degree and type of control used by American and Japanese MNCs on their Korean subsidiaries. Two characteristics of MNCs affected the control they exerted - the degree of MNCs' ownership, which affected the amount of control, and the nationality of the MNC's headquarters, which affected the type of control exerted. As predicted, the size of the subsidiary relative to the MNC, moderated the relationship between the degree of ownership and amount of output control the MNC exerted. Overall, the study supported the usefulness of agency theory in explaining the degree of management control exerted, while national culture accounted for the type of control exerted.

International retailers are increasingly using franchising as a means of entering foreign markets. However, international retail franchising lacks a conceptual basis from which an explanation of the major elements of this activity can be generated. Agency theory and its major premises of information asymmetry, monitoring costs, moral hazard and opportunism, are introduced in an attempt to provide an initial effort at bridging this conceptual gap. The paper reviews international retailing and franchise research before explaining agency theory. A discussion follows on how agency theory can explain major elements of international franchise activity of retail firms such as the international retail franchise process and the operationalisation of the international retail franchise system.

Research on the internationalization of retailing has focused on descriptive and empirical studies centring on issues such as motivations for retail internationalization and individual company experiences of the internationalization process. One particular aspect of the retail internationalization process that has remained relatively underresearched, and consequently under theorized, is market entry mode strategy. Furthermore, with a few notable exceptions, potentially interesting research from the economics of international production and corporate finance literatures has been virtually ignored in the international retailing domain. This paper represents an initial step in rectifying these deficiencies by exploring some of the issues associated with the economics-based internalization and agency theories, in the context of international retailers' market entry mode strategy. By combining market transaction costs (associated with internalization theory), together with information and monitoring costs (associated with agency theory), and thus highlighting the interlinking issue of information asymmetry, a more coherent basis is established for analysing international retailers' entry mode choice decision.

Recent empirical studies support self-interest as the sole basis for economic decisions (as predicted by agency theory). However, cognitive moral development (CMD) theory suggests that decision makers will allow ethical/moral considerations to constrain their economic behaviour. The purpose of this study is to resolve the essential conflict between the tenets of agency theory and CMD theory. The results of a laboratory experiment suggest that both moral reasoning level and adverse-selection conditions (self-interest) can have a significant effect on managers' project evaluation decisions. Specifically, managers are likely to continue a project that is expected to be unprofitable only when adverse selection conditions are present and moral reasoning level is low. Thus, agency theory may not be generalizable to accounting-based economic performance.

In their response to our paper, Amihud and Lev (1999) and Denis, Denis, and Sarin (1999) claim that disciplinary differences don't matter and that methods and evidence should speak for themselves. In contrast, we argue that important differences exist between financial economics and strategic management, leading to differing beliefs, norms, methods, and interpretations of empirical results. Using a strategic management perspective to review the evidence presented by Amihud and Lev in their earlier study (1981) and in their and Denis et al.'s critiques of our work (1999), we find no reason to revise our original conclusion: there is little theoretical or empirical basis for believing that monitoring by a firm's principals influences its diversification strategy and acquisition decisions.

This article examines creative-risk-taking behavior by agencies and the circumstances that increase their propensity to take risks. Drawing upon agency theory, and the wider literature on risk in management decision making, two areas are investigated. (1) resolving the conflicting desires of agencies and advertisers, and (2) how advertisers control agent's risk-taking. A mail survey of senior creative directors across a cross section of agencies is used and data to test the hypotheses gathered. Analyses indicate that agencies are less risk-seeking than expected. Market response and advertisers have the most influence on agency risk-taking, and agencies take a portfolio approach to risk - being more likely to suggest creative risk-taking for relatively smaller clients. The findings are discussed in terms of developing winning creative ideas. Suggestions for future research are identified.

Two widely adopted views of firm efficiency are agency theorists' residual claims and organization theorists' routines. The agency view holds that ownership structures (and their proxies) are the primary source of efficiency differences between firms. The organization theory view holds that organizational routines are the primary source of efficiency differences between firms. We conduct an empirical test that compares the relative value of residual claims and routines in generating firm efficiency, while controlling other factors. We find support for both views, but more importantly find that the average value of routines is roughly an order of magnitude higher than residual claims. (c) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We reexamine signaling and agency theories and argue that the free-cash-flow hypothesis implies a stronger information effect for both over-and underinvesting firms than for value-maximizing firms. Our results indicate that dividend and capital structure policies interact to provide significant predictive information about future cash flow. We also find a U-shaped relation between the amount of information and Tobin's q. The minimum of this relation occurs near a q value of one. This outcome implies a stronger information effect for both over-and underinvesting firms than for value-maximizing firms.

Agency theory is used to develop hypotheses regarding the effects of ownership proliferation on firm performance. The authors examine the effects of chief executive officer (CEO) ownership, executive team ownership, and all employee ownership in addition to the moderating effect of risk on firm survival and stock price. Firms with low CEO ownership outperform those with high levels of CEO ownership across all levels of risk, hut the effect is most pronounced for low-risk firms Executive team ownership is negatively related to firm performance, whereas ownership for all employees is positively associated with firm performance, particularly for higher risk firms.

A substantial body of research employs agency theory and transaction costs analysis to explain ownership decisions in distribution channels. Agency theory identifies factors that prompt firms to favor behavior-based contracting over outcome-based agreements. Transaction cost economics is a complementary framework which maintains that the organizational form in a location should be the one that economizes on production and transaction costs. Prior research illustrates that independent variables (e.g. proximity to highways, dedicated assets) outlined in these theories provide a partial explanation for ownership decisions. Nevertheless, scant research has analyzed whether factors outlined in agency theory and transaction cost analysis are employed by executives when making ownership decisions. The purpose of this study is to investigate managerial rationales underlying plural contractual networks. (c) 1999, MCB UP Limited.

Industrial foundations are self-governing, non-profit institutions that own business companies. This ownership structure is found in a fair number of Northern European companies, some of them successful world-class competitors. Standard agency theory would predict foundation-owned companies to be relatively inefficient since they lack monitoring by residual claimants and access to equity finance from the stock market. Nevertheless, empirical research (Thomsen 1996) has found that Danish foundation-owned companies do no worse in terms of profitability and growth than companies with dispersed ownership or family ownership. The paper considers and tests alternative explanations of this paradox. Explanations based on tax incentives, alternative control mechanisms and product-market advantages are rejected, but some support is found for performance advantages related to family control and long-term business commitment.

Finance, ownership and control issues have received a great deal of attention in recent years as centres of interest in the 'new institutional economics'. Much of the debate has been fuelled by the inability of neoclassical economics to explain the continued existence, and increasing importance, of small enterprises. Developments in agency theory, information asymmetry and signalling theory, and transaction cost economics are identified as contributing to a new approach. The concepts distilled from a review of these developments are then used in the analyses of well-known phenomena involving small enterprises. These include capital structure and access to capital markets featuring the finance gap, the underpricing of new issues and the small firm effect. In addition, going private, by means of management buy-outs, and franchising are examined. It is seen that the economic literature on finance, ownership and control helps to explain both the advantages and disadvantages of small enterprises. Their continued existence is seen as being due to a trade-off of various costs and benefits.

In this paper, we examine agency theory's presumptions of self-interest, opportunistic behavior, and the notion of the "economic man" (or woman). We contend that the application of agency theory's presumptions to the firm may imply high costs, competitive disadvantage, and high firm risk. We suggest that agency theory's presumptions may not contribute to the interests of the principal, agent, or other stakeholders. Alternatively, we discuss socioeconomic theories' presumptions of enlightened self-interest, trustworthy behavior, and the possibility of the noneconomic person. We argue that the extension of socioeconomic theories to the firm may imply low costs, competitive advantage, and low firm risk. We contend that the socioeconomic presumptions may contribute to the interests of various stakeholders. (c) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

This is a study of the accounting policies of the leading UK companies analysed by Terry Smith in Accounting for Growth (1992). Smith's critical survey achieved a certain notoriety at the time both for the content, which catalogued important ambiguities in UK GAAP, and also because the author was a leading investment analyst whose employers attempted to suppress the publication. The events that led to his dismissal were extensively reported in the financial press. In this paper we revisit the original analysis in the context of recent advances in the economics of accounting policy choice. Agency theory variables are used to predict the individual accounting pohcy choices and combinations of policies in Terry Smith's analysis. In particular, size gearing, the presence of an industry regulator and industry classification are good predictors of accounting policy choices. Our results are stronger for the whole set of accounting policies than for each individual policy. This is consistent with accounting policy choice being a strategic and comprehensive selection from interactive policies rather than a series of independent decisions.

This study uses a large, micro data set to present evidence which suggests that owners of regulated electric utilities have little incentive to structure CEO compensation packages in an effort to curb potential expense preference behavior. Because such potential behavior occurs, or would occur, at no cost to the firm (or the firm's owners), little incentive exists to structure compensation schemes in a way that would curb such behavior (e.g. by compensating them with incentive bonus plans and stock options). The results presented here augment those which examine other industries (e.g. banking) in an effort to point out the relationships between ownership organization, political involvement and expense preference behavior.

Incentive design for productivity gains has become important for Asian organizations in recent years. This paper introduces the theory of incentive design to an Asian audience while extending the agency theoretic approach to control. Hypotheses derived from this theory were tested in 61 retail stores in Singapore. The results show that employee skills, output measurability and task uncertainty significantly impact incentive design. The results indicate that agency theory may be applicable across cultures. Implications for the Asian context, and its adaptation in terms of behavior, are discussed. (c) 1999 bY John Wiley & Sons (Asia) Ltd.

Results based on personal visits to 90 small retail clothing stores located at shopping centers throughout Singapore, with responses from 180 salespersons, store owners, and supervisors, showed that agency theory was robust in explaining the extent of outcome-based compensation used in rewarding salespeople. Risk sharing factors (e.g., the principal's risk aversion and average purchase size) were more prominent than monitoring factors (e.g., number of stores owned by the principal) in explaining the structure of compensation for salespeople in the industry. Implications for future research were discussed. (c) 1999 by John Wiley & Sons (Asia) Ltd.

This research investigates the relationship between reputation and two types of agency costs, namely those associated with auditing and those associated with value-reducing activities of management resulting from their capitalizing on asymmetric information by misreporting income. A competitive-market model is used as a basis for developing and empirically testing hypotheses using an experimental-markets approach. This model includes (1) contracting between risk- neutral owners and risk-averse managers that allows risk sharing, (2) information asymmetry favoring managers over owners, (3) public financial reporting by managers, (4) the presence of endogenously-priced costly auditing that can be demanded by either management or owners, and (5) opportunities for managers to engage in value-reducing activities that are not directly observable by the owners. Two main hypotheses are set forth, both of which are found to be supported by formal statistical tests based on the data from the experimental markets as conducted in this study: (1) reputation effects reduce total agency costs. Further, these results show that agency cost reductions from reputation effects include both an increased rate of honest reporting by managers and a reduction in the demand for auditing by owners; and (2) the market rewards honesty and penalizes dishonesty in reporting.

In this study, two different theoretical perspectives are used to develop sets of hypotheses regarding the mechanisms used to manage foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations. First, agency theory serves as the basis for a model that predicts the use of monitoring mechanisms and incentive compensation. Then, it is argued that these mechanisms are insufficient for managing subsidiaries characterized by high levels of intra-firm international interdependence, the management of which is critical to many of today's complex global firms. A second set of hypotheses is argued, linking international interdependence to several social control mechanisms. Primary and secondary data from U.S. based multinational corporations were used to test both sets of hypotheses. The results indicate that agency theory, although a useful foundation for studies of control within MNCs, is limited in its ability to explain fully the phenomenon of foreign subsidiary control, however, the model based on intra-firm interdependence had much greater predictive ability.

The ineffectiveness of several privatized firms within emerging economies underscores the importance of agency theory issues and their impact on the privatization-performance relationship. We argue that weak governance and limited protection of minority shareholders intensify traditional principal-agent problems (perquisite consumption and entrenchment) and create unique agency problems (expropriation). We suggest that postprivatization performance can be enhanced by using appropriate ownership, management, and corporate structures that mitigate agency problems in the context of weak governance, and we highlight avenues for research.

This study uses the resource-based view of the firm and agency theory to examine the relationship between innovation and CEO pay in 90 high-technology firms. With firm size, performance, and other factors controlled, CEO short-term compensation was related to innovation as measured by number of patents and R&D spending. The data also suggest a less consistent temporal relationship between innovation and long-term CEO compensation in the high-technology firms. In a control sample of 74 low-technology firms, there was no relationship between innovation and either short-or long-term CEO pay.

The paper investigates the agency argument that sales growth in firms with free cash flow (and without strong governance) is less profitable than sales growth for firms without free cash flow. It also tests whether strong governance conditions improve the performance of firms with free cash flow and/or limit the investments in unprofitable sales growth. Consistent with agency theory, firms with free cash flow gain less from sales growth than firms without free cash flow. But different governance conditions affect sales growth and performance in different ways. Having substantial management stock ownership mitigates the influence of free cash flow on performance, despite allowing higher sales growth. In contrast, outside blocks held by mutual funds reduce sales growth substantially, but does not increase performance from sales growth. Copyright (c) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to relate the extent of disclosure in the annual reports of French listed companies to some economic determinants. The sample includes the 1995 annual reports of 102 randomly selected industrial and commercial firms. The extent of disclosure is measured by an index based on financial and non-financial discretionary information. The model of hypothesis explaining voluntary disclosure is defined as the interplay of contradictory forces: inducements deriving principally from agency theory and limitations imposed by information costs. The results reveal that voluntary disclosure is significantly related to size, foreign activity and to a proxy for proprietary costs. (c) 2000, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Outsourcing affects thousands of companies and employees every year. Recent studies indicate that 85 per cent of all companies outsource at least one function generating billions of dollars in outsourcing contracts (ElmutiElute, KathwalaKithara & Monippallil, 1995). Transportation is one of outsourcing's biggest players. Many outsourcing attempts have proved unsuccessful and recent articles blame these failures on failed outsourcing relationships. This paper addresses these failed relationships and suggests two possible solutions to the problem. The first solution is to diagnose the relationship from both sides of the contract. The second suggestion is to engage agency theory to help design the types of contracts and relationships necessary to provide and support an environment of trust. (c) 2000, MCB UP Limited

Franchising is fast becoming one of the most popular entry mode strategies for international retail companies when moving into international markets. Academic research, however, has only recently begun to examine international franchising within the context of retailer internationalization. A major gap in the literature is the nature of the international retail franchise relationship and, in particular, the mechanisms used to control and co-ordinate the international franchise network. This paper reports the findings from an in-depth, ethnographic study of the internationalization activity of one retail franchise company and examines the extent to which the marketing channels and agency theory literatures can, in practice, explain power and control in international retail franchising.

This paper examines the demand for on-board computers in trucking, distinguishing between their incentive-and resource-allocation-improving capabilities. I find that monitoring's incentive benefits are high when perquisite-taking is attractive to drivers, driver effort is important, and verifying drivers' actions to insurers is valuable. These results are consistent with agency theory and suggest that networking applications will raise the productivity and pay of difficult-to-evaluate workers. I also find that monitoring's benefits are disproportionately resource-allocation-related when managerial decisions are least constrained. This suggests that networking applications' monitoring capabilities raise the returns to delegation when resource allocation decisions are routine and lower them when they are not.

Research into accounting risk-return relations largely relied on reference-based models of managerial choice. This focus ignores other explanations that may contribute to our understanding. Our study extends prior research by incorporating agency theory and implicit contracts theory into models based on the behavioral theory of the firm. We test our hypotheses in a large sample of US manufacturing firms in two different economic environments. Our results show some support for each theory, suggesting that multiple frameworks may better explain risk-return relations. Further, differences in results between the two economic environments imply that macroeconomic conditions may be important. (c) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study examines empirically the effect of managerial ownership on firms' disclosures. Agency theory predicts that investors' information requirements increase with the agency costs of the firm. Managerial ownership mitigates agency costs and therefore should reduce investors' information needs. This study tests the hypothesis that firms with lower levels of managerial ownership provide more extensive disclosures by examining analysts' ratings of firms' disclosures. In contrast to the proxies used in prior studies that test this relationship, such as the earnings-return correlation and management earnings forecasts, these ratings provide a more direct measure of firms' overall disclosure practices. I find that the relationship between managerial holdings and disclosures depends on the type of disclosure. Consistent with the hypothesis of this study, firms with lower levels of managerial ownership are more likely to receive higher ratings for the disclosures provided in their annual and quarterly reports, even after controlling for size, performance, volatility of returns, the frequency of securities offerings and proprietary costs. The more informal and flexible aspects of disclosures, however, as measured by the investor relations rating, are not influenced by the level of managerial ownership. These results are consistent with prior research that predicts that firms lower their costs of capital by signaling a commitment to maintain a more open disclosure policy. Because annual and quarterly reports are less flexible, and therefore less likely to change, they may represent a more credible commitment to provide more informative disclosures.

This paper builds a model of the effects of agency risk and procedural justice in the boards of directors of venture capital-backed firms. Such boards are unique in that they consist of managers and outside owners with significant power and incentive to be highly involved in venture governance. The authors integrate agency theory and procedural justice perspectives to develop propositions regarding the effects of agency risk and board processes on the responses to poor performance and conflicts of interest. This integrated perspective suggests that factors that increase perceived agency risks will increase outsiders' tendency to focus efforts on monitoring and controlling board decisions and their propensity to resort to formal means to resolve conflicts. However, the authors suggest that through their effects on trust and positive attributions, fair procedures and interactions will reduce these tendencies. A discussion of the practical and theoretical implications of the proposed model concludes the paper. (c) 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Using both agency and institutional theories, we examined factors associated with the board's adoption of a formal process for evaluating the performance of the corporation's chief executive officer (CEO). Our sample was drawn from the hospital industry. Results show that an independent board chairperson, the level of market competition and the degree of managed care penetration were significant predictors of whether or not the board had adopted a formal CEO evaluation process. These findings imply that initiatives to improve governance effectiveness based on agency theory should take into account the institutional environment of corporate boards.

This study investigated several basic research questions suggesting a positive relationship between education and cognitive moral development. More specifically, these research questions examined the relationship between government mandated ethics education and cognitive moral development by testing the efficacy of a compulsory ethics intervention. Kohlberg's (1969, 1984) Cognitive Moral Development Theory was applied to test the efficacy of compulsory ethics education on the moral development of real estate salespeople used comparative statistical measures of ethical reasoning ability. The results of this research, while somewhat counterintuitive, suggest that the value of compulsory ethics education as an intervention to improve the moral reasoning of real estate salespeople is highly questionable. However, the results of the study do provide new insights into the relationship between ethics education and cognitive moral development.

Because shark repellents decrease the vulnerability of firms (and their incumbent managers) to the market for corporate control, the decision to adopt these devices represents an excellent test of agency theory. In this empirical study, we examined the relationships between the adoption of shark repellents and several mechanisms that, according to agency theory, should align the interests of corporate board members and shareholders and/or make directors more effective monitors of management behaviour. Of the variables included, only board stock ownership (especially by employee directors) was linked to a reduced propensity to adopt shark repellents in the predicted manner. Two variables not immediately associated with agency theory - the proportion of inside directors appointed by the incumbent chief executive officer (CEO) and a lower ratio of CEO compensation to the compensation of other top executives - were linked to higher rates of shark repellent adoption. Given that agency theory explains relatively little of the variance in shark repellent adoption, we advocate serious consideration of other theoretical formulations for corporate governance, including two approaches -stewardship theory and agent morality - that take the moral ('other regarding') obligations of directors seriously.

Audit committees have become more important and prevalent in recent years but there is a relative paucity of empirical research concerning their value. This paper contributes to this research by reporting an analysis of the relationship between the size of the audit fee and the existence of an audit committee. The analysis builds on previous research in this area in several ways. First, it uses more recent data than previous research which may have been influenced by transitional problems. The data in this paper were collected from financial reports for the years ending in 1994 and 1995. Second, it investigates the effect on audit fees of audit committee adherence to the Cadbury Committee Report recommendations of 1992. Finally, the analysis is set within a theoretical framework developed from agency theory. The results suggest that audit committees have been through a transitional phase comprising changes to the general audit environment and a learning phase for the establishment and operation of committees. By 1995 there is no evidence that audit committees, whether adhering to the Cadbury Code or not, have any overall effect on audit fees. The only effect found was a reduction in fees due to improved internal controls in the presence of auditee complexity. There was evidence that size was the main determinant of the presence of an audit committee. (c) 2000, MCB UP Limited

The separation of ownership and control can lead to managerial entrenchment and a convergence of decision making and decision control. Decision-making refers to management's authority to make strategic and operating decisions while decision control refers to the ratification and monitoring of management decisions. Managers that possess decision control may behave in a risk-reducing manner relative to the behavior of owner managers because of management's desire to maximize job security (Amihud and Lev 1981; McEachern 1975). For example, the managers of such firms may choose to diversify the firm into a wide variety of industries in an attempt to smooth revenues and earnings and avoid a series of peaks and valleys in the company's financial performance. These managers may believe that stable earnings will be viewed positively by shareholders and should help lessen the risk of stockholder action to replace upper-level management. Managers that possess both decision-making and decision-control capabilities may pursue a variety of risk-reducing strategies in addition to broad diversification. The existence of large outside investors has been shown to result in management becoming less risk-averse; management is more willing to adopt a wide range of strategies that present greater risk, but offer greater returns to shareholders. Hill and Snell (1988) found a significant, positive correlation between stock concentration and R&D intensity, indicating that large outside beneficial owners or dominant stockholders can influence management to pursue higher risk-higher return strategies. R&D intensity is used as a proxy for innovation and is generally operationalized as a firm's industry-adjusted R&D expenditures as a percentage of its sales. Findings of other studies also suggest that large investors are associated with decreased risk aversion by management. When controlling for the effects of time, previous R&D spending, liquidity, market share, diversification, market concentration, industry, and leverage, Hansen and Hill (1992) found a mild positive correlation between institutional stock concentration and R&D spending. This paper examines management's ability to utilize employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) to facilitate managerial decision control or the capability to ratify and monitor decisions and subsequently adopt greater risk-reducing behavior. It is possible that management may adopt an ESOP to enhance entrenchment by placing a large block of the company's shares under the control of company managers and employees that are under the supervision of management. As a result, some ESOPs may not be effective alignment mechanisms since participants may find it difficult to organize a vote against management proposals or generate adequate enthusiasm and momentum to replace top-level managers. The paper anticipates that a positive relationship exists between the degree of ESOP stock concentration and the reduced risk-taking behavior of management. Specifically, the study argues that as ESOP stock concentration increases, management will likely behave in a risk-reducing manner and decrease its commitment to innovation, as measured by R&D intensity. Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) are qualified retirement plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and are treated similarly under the Act to other qualified pension plans with the exception of portfolio diversification. Employee stock ownership plans consist only of shares of the employer's stock and the performance of an ESOP-based retirement fund hinges with the market performance of that single stock. An agency theory framework would suggest that ESOPs that control large blocks of outstanding shares have an effect on management similar to that of other large investors and act to encourage management to craft and implement strategies that will yield superior financial and market performance. As ESOP stock concentration increases, agency theory proposes that ESOP participants would readily act to protect their interests and the interests of other shareholders. However, some previous research suggests that large ESOPs are not alignment mechanisms, but further entrench current management into their positions. Gordon and Pound (1990) found that management can use large ESOPs to increase effective insider ownership to protect against unwanted changes in corporate control. The authors suggested that ESOPs were less effective than other types of large investors at monitoring management decisions since ESOPs are unilaterally undertaken by management, ESOP shares are held only by incumbent managerial and non-managerial employees, and ESOP trustees are frequently appointed by management. The market has been shown to view an ESOP as a management entrenchment mechanism when the ESOP was adopted as a possible takeover defense (Chang 1990; Dhillon and Ramirez 1994). The market reacts more favorably to an ESOP adoption when other large outside shareholders are present who have the capability to offset the influence of inefficient managers who might choose to use the ESOP to further entrench themselves into their positions (Park and Song 1995). The results of this study find that after the implementation of an ESOP, R&D intensity decreases as ESOP stock concentration increases. A significant negative relationship exists between ESOP stock concentration and change in industry-adjusted R&D intensity at the 0.05 level when controlling for firm size and change in profitability. The sample included firms where ESOP stock concentration represented as little as 3% of the employer's outstanding shares and as much as 67% of all outstanding employer stock. The sampled firms with the greatest ESOP stock concentration were associated with the greatest decreases in industry-adjusted R&D intensity after the implementation of the ESOP. The results suggest that management of high ESOP stock concentration firms became more risk-averse in regard to commitment to innovation after implementation of the ESOP. Agency theory adequately explains the effect of large outside stockholders on management's choice of strategy. Hill and Snell (1988) and Hansen and Hill (1992) have found that as stock concentration increases, incentive alignment becomes increasingly likely. The independent nature of large outside blockholders contributes to a separation of decision making from decision control, a reduction in agency costs, and a minimization of managerial risk-reducing behavior. As highly independent blockholder size decreases, decision making and decision control converge, and management entrenchment is more probable. Agency theory fails to adequately explain the effect of employee stock ownership on managerial risk-reducing behavior. Employee stock ownership does have the capability to align shareholder and employee interests under the proper conditions. However, ESOPs lack independence from managerial influence and are much less likely than outside institutional investors to monitor management decision-making and pressure management to adopt strategies that incorporate greater risk and an opportunity for greater returns. The study found that increased ESOP stock concentration was associated with greater managerial risk-reducing behavior. The results suggest that agency effects are more likely in firms with modest ESOP stock concentration since the ESOP does provide incentives for an alignment of interests, but does not provide management with a mechanism to block the actions of other large blockholders. ESOPs with higher levels of stock concentration are likely to facilitate management entrenchment by preventing some large percentage of shares from aligning with other large shareholders to challenge management decision-making. If other investors lack the capability to put full pressure on management, the monitoring and ratification of management decisions has been yielded to management. Therefore, a managerial entrenchment hypothesis is better suited than agency theory in explaining the effect of large ESOPs on management's risk-reducing behavior. (c) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

The aim of this paper1 is to explain Australian RandD capitalization and voluntary disclosure. It is argued that the discretionary choices available to management in Australia with respect to the accounting for and the disclosure of RandD expenditure and activities can be explained by the reduction of information asymmetries and agency costs. The results confirm that three aspects of information asymmetry investigated are important in explaining the discretionary capitalization of RandD expenditure: research intensity; the use of RandD financing arrangements; and the percentage of subsidiaries not wholly owned. Furthermore, research intensity, and the use of RandD financing arrangements are significant in explaining voluntary disclosure of RandD expenditure and activities. These results are robust to the inclusion of controls for other economic characteristics of the firm including share issue, size, accounting performance, leverage, proprietary costs and tax status.

This study extends the work of Kesner (1988) and Bilimoria and Piderit (1994) in examining the determinants of compensation committee composition. Consistent with their findings, my results suggest that the likelihood of compensation committee membership is significantly related to director type (i.e., outside vs. inside), length of board tenure, and the number of other directorships held. In addition, my results suggest that committee membership also depends on director age, and the number of other committee memberships served. Importantly, in contrast to the predictions of agency theory, I find that committee membership is only marginally related to director affiliation, and unrelated to outside director stock ownership. Together, these results provide mixed, somewhat weak evidence that firms staff their compensation committees with directors that are likely to protect shareholder interests.

This paper assesses the effects of Berle and Means' study of the separation of corporate ownership from control on corporate financial reporting theory, research and policy. Their focus on shareholders and managers provided a starting point for the subsequent development of agency theory such that this relationship has come to dominate capital markets research and policy, to the virtual exclusion of parallel issues involving other parties. Berle and Means' omission of the role of investment funds led them to conclude that the separation of ownership from control problems was located between shareholders and company managers. We document the inaccuracy of this conclusion using historical and contemporary US evidence and contemporary evidence for Germany, Japan, South Africa, and Canada. In contrast to Berle and Means, we find that investment fund influence and control over companies is pervasive and probably a common characteristic of modern capital markets. Our analysis shows how viewing the capital markets setting from a richer, two-tier perspective involving investors, investment managers, and company managers results in quite different and better perspectives on financial reporting issues, particularly in terms of company reporting to funds, and fund reporting to investors. Consequently, we suggest that our understanding of capital markets may be improved by studying and portraying more diverse types of parties and their relationships than just managers and owners. This perspective subsumes the single-tier principal-agent model and allows multiple relationships to be portrayed and studied. (c) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Increasingly, the equity investments of individual investors are being channeled through financial institutions. This article posits that the role of institutional owners as financial intermediaries, and the resulting complexity that institutions bring to ownership, distinguish institutional ownership from individual ownership. I develop a model of institutional ownership, referred to as the nexus agency model (NAM), which reflects this complexity. The model provides a framework for identifying the potential additional agency costs to beneficial owners that are associated with owning via financial institutions. The degree to which owning via institutions benefits individual owners depends on the adequacy of the legal and regulatory environment and governance mechanisms in protecting individual owners' interests. The applicability of the nexus model to different institutional owner types is then demonstrated in a discussion of U.S. public and private pension plans and mutual funds, leading to the generation of a NAM-based research agenda for each type and across the types. The article ends with discussion of the model's applicability to non-U.S. institutional environments. (c) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Agency theory emphasizes the role of ownership, control and incentives in encouraging managers to improve efficiency. Owners often tie managers to contracts that reduce conflict of interest between owners and managers. The differences between alternative business ownership structures have been investigated. According to theory, we expect managers with an outcome-dependent dealer contract to be more efficient than managers with a more integrated and less performance based employee dealer contract. We also analyse how competitive pressure might reduce the moral hazard problem and therefore affect contract design. Berle and Means (The Modern Corporation and Private Property, Macmillan, New York, 1932) long ago stated that the market mechanism could constrain the agency problem. Even so, this problem has scarcely been investigated empirically. This paper also considers the contractual effect of potential monitoring costs, education and relationship age in a model tested on data from 175 dealer contracts in a multinational oil company.

This study argues that an evaluation of the relationship between CEO turnover and corporate performance can be usefully approached in three steps. (1) An empirical longitudinal analysis of 88 German corporations which had experienced a change in CEO shows that different kinds of CEO turnover are associated with different developments in published performance during the succession period. (2) Using a structural equations model it is possible to demonstrate the aptness of a hypothesis on performance variation based on agency theory and using empirical data on involuntary CEO turnover. (3) By introducing an indirect method of measurement it is shown that CEO "influence" explains a substantial part of the observed variation in performance during the succession period.

Governance in organizations according to traditional agency theory is based on the premise that managers and employees do not have identical goals. As a consequence, employees need to be monitored and controlled. If legal contracts are not sufficient for proper control, incentive contracts should be used. This paper argues that incentive contracts are not sufficient to solve governance issues in organizations due to problems in measurability and enforceability of presumed contract violations. Such problems are complicated by asymmetries in power, perspectives and aspirations between managers and employees. Acognitive argument is advanced suggesting that time constraints and bounded rationality render the idea of monitoring relatively ineffective. Governance ideas that focus on communication flow and information sharing are described. The role that other cognitive elements such as memory play in a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary framework for understanding governance relations is discussed.

Linking executive compensation to stock price performance is predicted to decrease the usual positive price response to dividend increases for two reasons. One, increasing pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) exacerbates managers' optimistic bias regarding future firm performance, reducing the credibility of dividend signals. Two, increasing pay-performance sensitivity reduces the need for dividends as a means of reducing agency costs. Consistent with behavioral and agency theories of corporate finance, we find that price response does decrease as pay-performance sensitivity increases and that this effect is concentrated in firms with low market-to-book ratios. Additional findings are most consistent with the agency cost explanation. (c) 2000 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

An important aspect of current governance practice is the utilisation of non-executive directors to monitor the behaviour of senior management. The purpose of this paper is to provide an initial insight on the determinants of non-executive representation on the boards of large UK companies. The study adopts an agency theory perspective, focusing specifically on the impact of company size and ownership on non-executive representation. I find that larger companies, where monitoring via ownership is expected to be less efficient, utilise higher levels of non-executive representation. I also find that non-executive representation is positively associated with the ownership of external blockholders. The presence of CEO/chairman duality has a negative impact on non-executive representation. Overall, the findings suggest that companies utilise boards with stronger monitoring potential when size and ownership characteristics suggest that alternative governance mechanisms may be unable to ensure managers pursue shareholders' interests.

The 1970s and early 1980s saw significant structural change in the insurance market at Lloyd's of London and it became increasingly difficult for providers of the collateral against which insurance was written to monitor the activities of those responsible for writing the insurance risks and determining the distribution of returns. Agency theory analyses the incentives for principals and agents to develop more formal and rigorous arrangements for accounting and audit when agents become more remote from principals. However, when we examine the historical evidence, we find little sign of such development at Lloyd's during this period. We explore a number of institutional characteristics of the Lloyd's market which acted to constrain adaptation until external regulatory pressure was brought to bear. Conclusions are drawn on the limited role of agency theory in guiding policymakers and regulators in financial markets.

The economic importance of 'knowledge work' has become widely accepted. Less widely accepted are the changes knowledge work requires in how we manage performance. This paper explores the differences between knowledge work and more traditional physical and managerial work, in the context of economic agency models, the most rigorous extant theoretical representations of how to manage performance. Assumptions derived from the characteristics of knowledge work are used to extend agency models. The conclusions about how to manage from this extended model are different from the conclusions of traditional agency models. Linking measured performance and compensation - a common recommendation that arises from interpretations of agency theories - is effective in knowledge work contexts only if knowledge workers are intrinsically motivated. We conclude that agency models and recommendations derived from them are relevant only to the extent that they employ modified assumptions consistent with the distinctive characteristics of knowledge work and knowledge workers.

The relationship between exporters and independent foreign channel intermediaries (FCIs) is complex. The present paper analyses and discusses the potential types of opportunistic behaviour that might be engaged in by foreign agents or distributors (FCIs) using an agency theory approach. A classification framework of opportunistic behaviour is developed and a detailed qualitative examination of the content of five agencydistributor agreements between Australian exporters and their FCIs. A five-category classification scheme for opportunistic behaviour was found that included (1) product, (2) price, (3) information, (4) logistical, and (5) legal opportunism. The implications of each type of opportunism for an exporter are discussed using examples obtained from ways to control opportunistic behaviour are discussed.

The purpose of this research is to examine determinants of royalty rates in restaurant franchising from a monitoring costs perspective utilizing agency theory. The primary hypothesis of the study is that agency costs associated with monitoring franchisees are inversely related to royalty rates levied by the franchisor. Agency problems specifically related to monitoring costs of franchise contracts are identified. An empirical model for monitoring costs in relation to royalty rates is developed to test a series of hypotheses. Empirical evidence largely supports the primary hypothesis that when the franchisor perceives monitoring activities are difficult and/or costly, the franchisor tends to lower royalty rates to induce the franchisee's efforts.

Does owner management necessarily eliminate the agency costs of ownership? Drawing on agency literature and on the economic theory of the household, we argue that private ownership and owner management expose privately held, owner-managed firms to agency threats ignored by Jensen's and Meckling's (1976) agency model. Private ownership and owner management not only reduce the effectiveness of external control mechanisms, they also expose firms to a "self-control" problem created by incentives that cause owners to take actions which "harm themselves as well as those around them" (Jensen 1994, p. 43). Thus, shareholders have incentive to invest resources in curbing both managerial and owner opportunism. We extend this thesis to the domain of the family firm. After developing hypotheses which describe how family dynamics and, specifically, altruism, exacerbate agency problems experienced by these privately held, owner-managed firms, we use data obtained from a large-scale survey of family businesses to field test our hypotheses and find evidence which suggests support for our proposed theory. Finally, we discuss the implications of our theory for research on family and other types of privately held, owner-managed firms.

Controlling for size, industry, and managerial ownership, the results suggest that firms controlled by the founding family have greater value, are operated more efficiently, and carry less debt than other firms.

The purpose of this paper is to draw together the many different facets of corporate governance that have been examined in the extensive literature in both strategic management and finance. In particular, we are interested in the relationship between the typical agency theory constructs of monitoring, incentives and ownership structure, with financial performance. First, we catalog this large body of work to see where there are still unanswered questions. We find that previous work has generally focused on examining subsets of governance mechanisms, typically studying one or two governance variables in any one study. Our view is that the most critical issue still to examine, is the ability of firms to choose among a number of different governance mechanisms in order to create the appropriate structure for that firm, given the environment in which it operates. We identify a sample of firms and examine CEO compensation, CEO tenure, board composition, leadership structure and ownership structure and their contribution to both market performance, Market Value Added, and risk-adjusted accounting performance, Economic Value Added. In addition, we control for ownership by blockholders, industry performance, and firm size. We examine these measures both individually and as interactions. Our results indicate that while some of the traditional agency variables do impact performance, both individually and as interactions, industry performance is a strong and significant driver of performance for our sample of firms. We conclude that, while there is evidence to support that firms may use governance packages to deal with agency issues, further research could provide important evidence on these issues by focusing on examining a more refined, industry-level context.

This paper analyzes the link between economics and the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm. Although, historically there has been a strong link between the disciplines of strategy and economics, explicit citations of key RBV works has been disappointingly low in mainstream economics journals. However, there are substantial bodies of works that build implicitly on the ideas of the RBV, in particular the consequences of path dependency on firm behavior, to explain a number of different economic issues. The issues we review in the paper are all influenced by path dependency and include: (1) diversification and market entry, (2) corporate refocusing, and market exit, (3) explaining innovative activity among firms, (4) diversification and performance and (5) industry evolution with rapidly changing products. Furthermore, we identify a number of reasons that may have limited the explicit use of the RBV in economics, which include the problems of causal ambiguity, tautology and firm heterogeneity. Finally, potential areas for future research are identified, which include the interaction of the RBV and Agency Theory, the RBV as a dynamic theory, using the RBV to explain radical change and the application of the RBV to issues of antitrust.

Co-operative firms have been the subject of criticism by many economists, who base their arguments on property rights and agency theory: members do not control management, investments are short term, accumulated investments are below the economic optimum, etc. Nevertheless, many co-operative organisations do function well for their members. An analysis of the assumptions underlying the criticism reveals that this is not generally justified. As it focuses mainly on the functioning of capital markets, it disregards the vertically integrated character of the co-operatives, i.e. that their purpose is to counteract market failures on product markets. For many co-operatives, however, the critique is valid. Individual ownership in the form of tradable residual rights is thus motivated in many co-operatives. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This article develops a dynamic model of a firm in which diversification can be a value-maximizing strategy even if specialization is generally efficient. The central idea is that firms are composed of organizational capabilities that can be profitable in multiple businesses and that diversification is a search process by which firms seek businesses that are good matches for their capabilities. The theory can account for diversified firms trading at discounts compared to single-segment firms, as well as some empirical regularities that are challenging to the agency theory of diversification, such as positive returns to diversification announcements.

The corporatization reform in Chinese SOEs has been largely influenced by the Anglo-American corporate governance model, but at issues is whether or not this model suits China's current institutional and cultural contexts. Agency theory and stewardship theory are two corporate governance theories that provide conflicting assumptions about human behavior and different prescriptions about governance mechanisms. In this study we drew upon both theories and developed competing hypotheses about the relationships between board composition, leadership structure, and organizational performance in Chinese shareholding companies. We gave special attention to China's unique institutional context and its influence on board attributes. The hypotheses were tested with a sample of Chinese listed companies. Overall, the stewardship hypotheses received stronger empirical support. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

An agency framework is used to model the behavior of software developers as they weigh concerns about product quality against concerns about missing individual task deadlines. Developers who care about quality but fear the career impact of missed deadlines may take "shortcuts." Managers sometimes attempt to reduce this risk via their deadline-setting policies; a common method involves adding slack to best estimates when setting deadlines to partially alleviate the time pressures believed to encourage shortcut-taking. This paper derives a formal relationship between deadline-setting policies and software product quality. It shows that: (1) adding slack does not always preserve quality, thus, systematically adding slack is an incomplete policy for minimizing costs; (2) costs can be minimized by adopting policies that permit estimates of completion dates and deadlines that are different and; (3) contrary to casual intuition, shortcut-taking can be eliminated by setting deadlines aggressively, thereby maintaining or even increasing the time pressures under which developers work.

Given conflicting theoretical perspectives and inconsistent empirical results, this study examined the relationship between board leadership structure and organisational performance. A meta-analysis based on 22 independent samples across 5,751 companies indicates that independent leadership structure has a significant influence on performance. This relationship varies depending upon the context of the study.

In this paper, we discuss agency theory in the context of the individual principal and agent, and also in the context of the organization and its groups. Agency theory is examined in the context of goal orientation, obligation and reciprocity, risk, and self-interest. We offer propositions given agency theory's assumptions. We also extend agency theory and offer alternative propositions based on a relaxing of agency theory's assumptions. In relaxing the assumptions of agency theory, insights from outside the agency literature, specifically from behavioral theories are used. Implications of agency theory and the extension of this theory are also discussed in relation to outcomes associated with economic exchanges. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Agency theory, the predominant theoretical lens employed to examine leveraged buyouts, focuses on buyouts principally as a governance and control device. This view is especially useful in evaluating mature firms where discipline, incentives and limits to managerial discretion serve to mitigate the destruction or the downside of firm value. In contrast, an entrepreneurial view of buyouts is introduced, which incorporates upside incentives for growth and improvements not associated with pure efficiency gains or more effective monitoring to curtail opportunism. Investors such as venture capitalists in the UK and LBO associations in the US are increasingly investing in buyouts to realize entrepreneurial opportunities. Understanding how entrepreneurs make decisions with greater reliance on cognitive biases and heuristics provides an insightful lens for understanding why different types of buyouts occur. These perspectives provide a view of buyouts as a vehicle for strategic innovation and renewal that fosters upside growth opportunities in a variety of buyout types which heretofore have not been incorporated into buyout theory. Finally, research issues are discussed to facilitate future conceptual development and empirical testing of the upside as well as the downside of buyouts. (c) 2001 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

We challenge the implicit assumption that entrepreneurs are the sole owners of their young firms and we suggest that because cutting-edge innovation projects are complex, they create substantial information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and their investors. Linking previous research on governance, entrepreneurship, and innovation, we ask what forms of governance and incentive systems are conducive to spur and implement innovation among young entrepreneurial firms. Using agency theory and building on the rich literature on governance, we make eight practical suggestions regarding the governance of young entrepreneurial firms. We suggest that early and effective governance systems may help entrepreneurs and investors work in alignment with each other's best interests. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

In Asia, the recent catastrophic decline in regional stock markets, continuing currency crisis and failures of major financial institutions and industrial corporations have increased domestic and international interest in corporate governance. Nowhere is this greater than in Japan where financial institution reform has catapulted this to the fore. In this paper, we use agency theory and institutional theory, together with comparative case examples, to derive some propositions on the dynamics of changing corporate governance systems in Japanese firms. We argue for the co-existence of stakeholder and shareholder-centered corporate governance systems in Japan. This argument has an important implication for corporate governance research and agency theory. Namely, changes in ownership structure and institutional expectations would force firms to focus on maximizing shareholder value even where the interests of stakeholders are more emphasized. It suggests an environmental selection mechanism to ensure the emergence of appropriate corporate governance mechanisms to solve the agency problem. Further, the loss of competitiveness and the prolonged poor performance of firms can change the institutional norms to emphasize asset efficiency and transparency rather than stability and business ties.

In this study it is argued that positive agency theory is a relevant theoretical perspective in studies of the balanced scorecard in business management because agency theory addresses implementation and organizational control issues. If the balanced scorecard is to be applied also in public management, then positive agency theory should be complemented with political economy to incorporate possible implementation and organizational control issues related to political uncertainty, common agency and implementation ambiguity. It is argued that uncritical application of the balanced scorecard in public management could result in dysfunctions common in Soviet-type, central planning. However, such dysfunctions could be reduced with certain modifications of the balanced scorecard in order to facilitate political competition to a relatively larger extent. (c) 2001, MCB UP Limited

The concept of 'capacity building' is explored, through illustration and critique of the concept's development in the international, national and local community literature. Theoretical strands where the concept belongs partially include community development theory, agency theory and stewardship theory. The concept is examined in the context of new public management thinking, and its discovery by professionals to enhance their community roles is highlighted. Findings from micro-level case study research among local community organizations are reported, suggesting organizational scepticism about its meaning and outcomes, and producing a preliminary typology of organizations' responses to the concept. The article concludes that the concept appears theoretically homeless. It emphasizes the need for clarification of the concept's multiple meanings, so that the chances of useful evaluation of publicly funded capacity building programmes may be enhanced.

Adapting well-established organization theories to international joint ventures (IJVs), this paper develops an overarching theoretical model of the determinants and effects of parent control of IJVs from an interpartner bargaining power perspective. Drawing upon power dependence, transaction costs, and agency theories, we argue that the relative bargaining power between IJV partners serves as the key determinant of control structure, and that control exerts a direct effect on the venture's performance. In addition, government influence and interpartner working relationship are critical factors that complicate the linkage between control and performance but may help to explain past conflicting results. Propositions regarding these relationships are formed for future empirical test, and implications and directions for future research are provided. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

This paper looks at the changing nature of work for workers in knowledge-intensive high-tech firms. Four theories (institutional theory [IT], resource-based theory, game theory, and agency theory) are examined and propositions formulated as to how each theory helps explain the existence of intellectual cooperation and knowledge sharing within high-tech firms. The paper examines the usefulness of existing theory and suggests new research propositions, constructs, and methods to focus on building an empirical approach towards organizational research in the high-tech arena.

In this paper we provide new evidence on the relationship between internal governance structures (board composition and ownership concentration) and audit fees of UK industrial quoted companies, before the recommendations of the Cadbury Committee were implemented. We also develop a new hypothesis derived from agency theory, in an attempt to explain the puzzling positive relationship between audit and non-audit fees. In common with post-Cadbury research, we find no significant evidence that board structure variables, including chairman/chief executive officer split and the proportion of non-executive directors on the board, impact significantly on external audit fees. Also, while prior research has shown that the aggregated level of institutional and managerial ownership are negatively associated with audit fees, we find that only one constituent of this variable, namely directors' ownership, has a significant impact.

This paper examines the cross-sectional relation between ownership structure and corporate performance of a sample of 434 manufacturing firms listed on the Chinese stock exchange. Following the agency theory and taking other influential factors into account, such as firm size, leverage ratio, variance of sales, growth of sale and firm age, the results suggest that there is a strong relation between ownership concentration and corporate performance, measured by Tobin's Q. A further classification of owners reveals that while shares held by state play a negative role in corporate governance, domestic institutional and managerial shareholdings improve the firms' performance.

This study is among the first to systematically evaluate the role of foreign ownership (volume of ownership and board representation) on self-interested strategizing behavior of organizational managers. Building on agency theory, strategic management and organization theory literatures, it argues that the volume of foreign ownership is unlikely to have any bearing on the extent of unrelated diversification that managers pursue. However, the level of foreign representation on the board of directors is likely to dampen such strategies. Results from the empirical examination set in India provide support for this line of reasoning. Contributions, implications and future extensions are explored. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Despite Stock Option Plans' (SOPs) widespread use, evidence regarding their use and their effectiveness is relatively sparse and typically relies on an agency theory perspective that emphasizes the principal's interests in a market context. This study focuses on the agent as an individual who is involved in SOP management. Eighteen interviews with senior executives were conducted. Their responses indicate that SOPs are used to (a) initially align managemerit's incentives, (b) attract and retain key personnel, and (c) facilitate the payment of high levels of executive compensation. SOPs are successful when they are paid to employees whose actions influence stock prices. Our analysis suggests that no single theory provides a comprehensive explanation of SOP management. A critical assessment of agency theory as the dominant paradigm in executive compensation research and practice is presented, and the need for an integrated theoretical perspective for understanding SOPs is discussed.

This study is an extension of research which links top management team characteristics and the use of a variety of business strategies. Agency theory and information processing theory provided the framework used to investigate the complex business strategies of 219 Japanese firms in four sectors. Statistical results support our view that top team characteristics reflect important aspects of the corporate governance strategies needed to manage business strategies such as specialization, diversification and internationalization. Although there are substantial institutional differences in the business environments, it appears that there is increasing convergence in the Japanese and American approaches to corporate governance.

Extant literature demonstrates that participating policies mitigate shareholder-policyholder incentive conflicts in stock insurance firms. However, extending the argument in Mayers and Smith (1994), the authors formally show that participating policies also exacerbate the shareholder-manager incentive conflicts in stock insurance firms. In this article, the authors test whether hypotheses derived from agency theory explain the usage of participating life insurance policies by stock insurers. The authors' results are consistent with the argument that participating policy usage is dictated by the trade-off between the mitigation of the contracting costs of risk shifting and underinvestment, and the exacerbation of the incentive conflicts between managers and shareholders.

Focusing on player agents in professional ice hockey, this paper utilizes the theoretical construct of agency theory as a means of evaluating attempts by several stakeholder groups to find solutions to opportunistic agent behavior. As proposed by agency theorists, this would include the creation and implementation of monitoring mechanisms by industry stakeholders in order to regulate agent activities. Stakeholder groups involved include state and federal governments, the agents themselves, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and Players' Associations, which, at various times, all have adopted forms of certification programs in attempts to monitor player agents. Documentation on these programs and interviews with industry stakeholders are employed to develop criteria by which such programs can be assessed in terms of their ability to reduce traditional agency problems. In doing so, it is argued that the agency model can be used to provide additional insight into problems associated with these programs and to improve program effectiveness in monitoring hockey agent behavior.

Agency theory is primarily concerned with the relationship between the principal (employer/ purchaser) and the agent (employee/contractor) in the issue of goal-aligned behavior. Jensen and Meckling and others were not referring to a knowledge worker agent in their conceptualization of the principal/ agent relationship. The significance of having a knowledge worker agent is that the decision rights are no longer located with the principal but with the agent. This in turn has a tremendous bearing on goal alignment and agency problems. We propose that information systems/information technology (IS/IT), in particular enterprise wide systems, can alleviate these agency problems. We illustrate this through a case example from health care, an industry with a high proportion of knowledge worker agents. (c) MCB University Press.

Relying on neo-classical economics, agency theory, transaction cost economics and institutional approaches to organization, writers on the chaebol tried to highlight or elide certain organizational variables in their expositions of the growth and change of the chaebol organization. In this contribution, theoretical problems are discussed in these perspectives in explaining the chaebol, by focusing on four organizational variables: ownership and control structures, state regulation structures, inter-firm relations and technological uncertainties. These four organizational variables, despite their strengths, are found to miss some important points that are pertinent to understanding the rise of, and the current reform actions taken by, the chaebol.

Agency theory proposes that increasing managerial ownership in a firm can help align owner/management interests and motivate managers for better performance. This paper examines the relationship between managerial stock holdings and firm performance in the restaurant industry. Using the financial data of restaurant companies during 1995-1996, this study found that managerial ownership was positively and significantly associated with most of the performance measures, particularly in firms with 0%-15% managerial ownership. Firm size, a control variable, was also found to have a positive impact on performance. The results suggest that large restaurant firms with relatively low managerial ownership may raise managerial holdings to enhance their profitability and Stock returns.

Managers of a sample of private and public banks in Greece were surveyed through the vehicle of agency theory. It was found that managers in private banks showed greater alignment of interests with those of the bank, their pay related to outcomes and they were more mobile in their jobs. Private banks also used more control mechanisms to align interests of their managers with those of the bank and displayed a different working climate. Given evolving organisation structures resulting from deregulation, the convergence of information technology and communications and the entry of firms from other industries, the implications of the findings for governance are important.

Agency theory suggests that to motivate a firm's managers to act in the best interests of the firm's shareholders, managerial compensation should be directly tied to firm performance. In this study, the measure of firm performance used to test this theory is the decision by a firm to omit its common stock dividend. A dividend omission is taken to indicate that the firm's management and board of directors believe that the current and future earnings prospects (performance) of the firm are poor. In a sample of firms that omitted their dividend sometime during the years 1987 through 1992, we find that, on average, the CEOs (Chief Executive Officers) of these firms experienced significant decreases in total compensation (wealth) around the time of the dividend omission. Not surprisingly, the CEOs who experienced the greatest compensation loss were the 61.4% of CEOs who lost their jobs. The probability that a CEO would be replaced around the time of the dividend omission was found to be directly related to the CEO's age and inversely related to the firm's performance and CEO share ownership.

Deregulation during the 1980s allowed savings and loan associations to undertake many of the same activities as mutual savings banks, so that competition among thrifts increased, and they became more homogeneous in nature. At the same time, according to agency theory, mutual institutions should experience less efficient operations than stock institutions due to differences in monitoring and compensation of management. The purpose of this study, then, is two-fold: first, to determine whether mutual savings banks exhibit the same cost behaviour as savings and loans; and second, to determine whether mutual institutions are less cost-efficient than stock institutions. To compare cost structures and cost efficiencies, a three-input, three-output, translog cost frontier is estimated for mutual savings banks, mutual S and Ls, and stock S and Ls. Approximately 1500 observations, restricted to the states in which mutual savings banks are chartered, are extracted from the 1990 OTS data to be used in the estimation. Each type of institution is found to have a unique cost function. The data are then used in a second regression to determine which characteristics are correlated with the inefficiency scores. It appears that mutual savings banks do have a different cost structure than savings and loans. As well, the comparison of stock versus mutual savings and loans reveals that mutuals exhibit cost efficiency, a result that contradicts agency theory.

Asymmetric information and asymmetric dependency form the bases of two explanations for suboptimal performance in organized economies: managerial control loss and rent seeking. Both posit a loss of collective efficiency, but they differ in their assessment of the source of that loss in efficiency, information costs, or the possibility for arbitrary exercise of power. Both agents and principals have resources at their disposal, but the capacity of agents to engage in collective action (point 4) may have an important role in determining the distribution of benefits. Although usually discussed in dyadic terms, asymmetric information and asymmetric dependency, as explored in agency theory, imply networks of information and exchange with mutually inconsistent structures. Therefore, the problems of transitional economies can be understood by observing the formal and informal linkages among bureaucratic officials and enterprise managers. Moreover, interventions in the structure of those networks of linkages may be able to address the performance problems of postsocialist economies more effectively than macroeconomic adjustments and broad-based legal reform. This article's aims are, first, to bring the literatures on control loss and rent seeking together and to relate both to a wider literature on social networks and social institutions; second, to outline a methodology showing how the structure of social networks aids in the gathering of benefit and, therefore, how it can be used in the measurement of relative power; and, third, to document the networks of exchange among nearly 60 ministry officials and enterprise managers in heavy and light industry in one postsocialist economy, Vietnam, where state enterprise ownership persists. Specifically, we examine the nature of the relationships between (1) ministry officials and enterprise directors, (2) ministry officials and their coworkers, and (3) the managers of different enterprises. Because each of the two mechanisms of inefficiency rests on distinct social network patterns, we are able to assess the salience of each explanation. The nature of these relationships is important for understanding the past performance of the state sector in the economy of Vietnam and is key to understanding how to successfully restructure economies worldwide.

In this paper, a model is developed to investigate the design of profit-sharing incentive plans in an environment, e.g. just-in-time production, where the worker'S responsibility has been enlarged to perform multiple tasks, e.g. production and setup time and costs reduction. The incentive model is based on the agency theory and the Scanlon profit-sharing plans developed in the USA. Comparing inventory cost with a pre-established cost target, each employee receives a share of profits or loss in proportion to his or her wage or salary level. The main contribution of this paper is to explore the roles of risk attitudes, production risk and monitoring mechanisms in developing such profit-sharing plans. Understanding these human and environmental factors will help managers design more effective incentive systems.

There has been growing recognition in recent years of the importance of corporate governance in ensuring sound financial reporting and deterring fraud. The audit serves as a monitoring device and is thus part of the corporate governance mosaic. The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of various corporate governance factors, such as the board of directors and the audit committee, on the audit process. Importantly, there is little professional guidance on how auditors should consider such factors when formulating an appropriate audit strategy, and there has been only one prior study on this issue (Cohen and Hanno 2000). Because there are no current specific auditing standards that relate to the effect of corporate governance on the audit process, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 36 auditors on current audit practices in considering corporate governance in the audit process. Reflecting on client experiences, auditors indicate a range of views with regard to the elements included in the rubric of "corporate governance". Most significantly, auditors view management as the primary driver of corporate governance. The inclusion of top management in the "corporate governance mosaic" is inconsistent with agency theory's prescription of the board and other mechanisms serving as a means to independently oversee management's actions to protect stakeholders. Auditors consider corporate governance factors to be especially important in the client acceptance phase and in an international context. Further, despite the attention placed on the audit committee in the academic literature, in the business community, and by regulators in different countries (e.g., Canada, United States, Australia), several respondents indicated that their experiences with their clients suggest that audit committees are typically ineffective and lack sufficient power to be a strong governance mechanism. Implications for research and practice are presented.

Drawing on prior empirical research based on disclosure behavior in developed western markets, this study examines the association of ownership structure with the voluntary disclosures of listed companies in the Asian settings of Hong Kong and Singapore. An analysis of annual reporting practices shows that the extent of outside ownership is positively associated with voluntary disclosures. In particular, the results also indicate that the level of information disclosure is likely to be less in "insider" or family-controlled companies, a significant feature of the Hong Kong and Singapore stock markets.

Governance of family firms differs from mainstream corporate governance in an important respect: Important owners, i.e., family members, may have multiple roles in the business. In this paper, we develop and test a model of family firm governance that incorporates both formal control and social control aspects of governance. Governance based on the formal control draws on agency theory, whereas the social control aspects draw on social theories of governance, addressing social capital embedded in relationships. Drawing on these theories, we examine the influence of different governance mechanisms on the quality of strategic decision making. The Family Business Governance Model is tested using survey data from 192 family firms in Finland. We use structural equation modeling in testing the empirical validity of the model. The empirical analysis largely supports our hypotheses on formal control and social control as well as their influences on the decision-making quality. (c) 2002, SAGE Publications.

In this research we discuss the relationship between CEO and top management team (TMT) member compensation, and explore the implications of TMT pay for firm performance. Specifically, we suggest that firm performance may benefit due to agency and group behavioral issues when top management team member pay is aligned-alignment is defined as the degree to which TMT member pay reflects (1) shareholder interests and (2) key political and strategic contingencies within the firm. In support of our theorizing, we found CEO pay to be related to TMT pay; TMT compensation, in turn, predicted performance (i.e., return on assets and Tobin's q) when aligned with shareholder interests and internal contingencies. Moreover, the effect of CEO pay on future firm performance was dependent on top team pay.

In this article an extension of agency theory based on problems that arise in agency relationships, even when agents are assumed to be honest and dutiful, is put forward. With one exception, these assumptions lead to essentially the same predictions as in standard agency theory, suggesting that effects commonly attributed to self-seeking may be better understood as more fundamental effects of the agency relationship itself. This analysis raises a number of previously unexplored research questions concerning the nature of managerial agency relationships.

This paper examines the valuation effects associated with the incentive structures of different types of institutional investors using the ownership levels of public and private pension funds in a firm. The results suggest that institutional monitoring is associated with valuation effects when both observable and unobservable aspects of the relationship between institutions and firms are taken into account. Moreover, the valuation effects vary according to the objective functions of institutions' administrators. Thus, other shareholders do not necessarily benefit from relationships between institutions and managers, and they could be hurt when the institutional agents watching firm agents have conflicts of interest with other shareholders.

We examined the effects of unsystematic and systematic firm risk on CEO compensation risk bearing and total pay. Both the proportion of variable pay in CEO pay packages and their magnitude are curvilinearly related to unsystematic firm risk - that is, they are highest under conditions of moderate firm-specific risk. Our results are consistent with agency theory predictions that both performance-contingent pay and the greater earnings potential associated with that form of pay are highest when an agent has greater control over performance outcomes.

In this study, we examine in an agency-theoretic context the influence of executive equity stakes upon corporate strategy and firm value. We argue that beneficial, risk-increasing corporate strategies may initially be emphasized but non-value-maximizing, risk-reducing strategies may subsequently be emphasized as managers expand their stock ownership. We alternatively contend that stock options may have a consistently positive impact on firm risk taking and acquisition returns. The empirical findings are supportive of our expectations.

Application service providers (ASPs) offer multiple users a subscription-based access model via the Internet to centrally managed applications. The appeals of ASPs are the per-user-pricing models, one-to-many access possibilities to applications, IT expertise and capabilities, and value added management services. This paper argues that although the ASP model offers an electronic outsourcing solution, there are in fact many similarities with more traditional IT outsourcing. Using four case studies from exploratory research into ASPs, we illustrate the applicability of a little used contingency model from the research literature that combines resource dependency theory, resource-based theory, transaction cost theory and agency theory. From this, we develop six major propositions that customers should bear in mind when considering an ASP option. Similar to outsourcing services, ASP sourcing offers some interesting benefits, but equally entails a set of risks that practitioners should carefully evaluate when considering the 'netsourced' ASP option.

Cognitive evaluation theory and its hypothetical construct of intrinsic motivation are enjoying increasing popularity in the fields of business administration and economics. Consequently, intensifying skepticism towards performance incentives and agency theory is postulated. According to cognitive evaluation theory, it is argued that performance pay may undermine an agent's intrinsic motivation. In contradiction to agency theory, the principal might be worse off when providing an incentive contract to the agent than without doing so. Since the contention is substantiated by empirical evidence, it seems worrying enough for further investigation. Restricting attention to performance pay in business corporations, the scope of this article is to evaluate whether agency theory faces an urgent need to incorporate the construct of intrinsic motivation and its 'hidden costs of reward' as postulated by supporters of the concept. The subsequent analysis reveals good and bad news for agency theory. The bad news is that hidden costs of reward do indeed exist. The good news is that the empirical evidence on undermining effects cannot be interpreted as being contradictory to agency theory.

Applying the agency theory perspective, we examined the relationship between board structure and the average political risk of firms' international manufacturing operations in a sample of 95 manufacturing firms from the Fortune 500. Our results indicate an association between board composition, CEO duality, and the level of international political risk present in a corporation's portfolio of foreign direct investment.

Some scholars have argued that CEOs may have excessive influence on their foundation's trustees to give away a portion of company profits to charitable causes in order to gain access to elite circles or support the CEO's personal causes. This may result in charitable contributions that ultimately serve the personal interests of the CEOs without regard to corporate interests or social needs. We examine the extent that CEOs appear to direct charitable giving to be compatible with their own personal interests, and if CEO participation on the foundation board affects the relationship between CEO personal interests and charitable giving. Using a sample of 160 corporate foundations, our results showed that CEOs' interests, as measured by membership in different non-profit organizations, was associated with foundation charitable giving. This association decreased, but was not eliminated, when CEOs were absent from the foundation board. Implications of these findings for researchers and managers are discussed in regards to both agency theory and stewardship theory.

When is franchising the appropriate organizational form for implementing marketing strategy in global markets? In this paper we identify conditions under which franchising facilitates efficient transactions globally with the help of constructs from transaction cost analysis, agency theory, and franchising research in domestic contexts. Some, bases for setting initial fees and royalty payments as well as the rationale, for establishing master franchises are also explored The advantages and limitations of adopting franchising as the mode of operation in gbbal markets are briefly discussed A conceptual framework that provides an integrated multidisciplinary approach for studies of franchising from a global marketing perspective is developed.

This article focuses on the role of the family business shareholder. Based on Agency Theory, it examines the elements that influence the conflict of interests and objectives between nonemployed shareholders and the top management team and its impact on commitment to the family firm. Data were empirically obtained from a field study of 156 shareholders and executives of 10 Spanish family firms. Combining quantitative and qualitative data, investigation results show that the degree of commitment to the family business is negatively correlated with the number of family members on the board of directors. Nevertheless, the most robust and statistically significant correlation (positive) was found between the number of external board members and the commitment level of the nonemployed shareholders. Regarding the mechanisms and processes implemented, results depended on the attention that the family business paid to the institutional overlap of the three subsystems: ownership, family, and business.

The paper examines whether and how the increasing internationalization of firms impacts on the operation of a co-ordinated market economy. Following the tenets of agency theory, it assumes that an emerging market for corporate control changes the monitoring mechanisms that oversee management. Since Anglo-American forms of monitoring are usually associated with a higher return for investors compared with Continental European firms, a change in the distribution of the net value added of firms is expected. Using financial data on fifty-nine large German companies, the paper shows that the emerging convergence of German corporate governance practices to Anglo-American standards has had a weak, but significant, impact on the distribution of net value added. This is in contrast to the impact of the internationalization of firms on product markets, which does not have an effect. Since the market for corporate control is, however, still underdeveloped in Germany, the main effects remain to be seen.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the variables that influence the board structure adopted by firms and the subsequent relationship to the firm's performance. The results of this study of 229 Australian firms show that firms' investment opportunities are strongly associated with a higher proportion of executive directors ("EDs") on the board. The results also show that the negative relationship between a firm's investment opportunity set ("IOS") and firm performance is weakened at higher levels of non-executive director board domination. These results have implications for policy setters and managers of firms with investment opportunities. (c) City University of Hong Kong. (c) 2002, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Most empirical investigations on the disassociation between executive compensation and firm performance have been done using agency theory. Agency theory alludes to a power imbalance favorable to the executives, allowing them to pursue their self-interest in the form of large pay packages. However, because of its roots in the economic discipline, agency theory has led researchers to test financial rather than behavioral hypotheses. Over 70 years of research has been conducted on the pay-form-performance relationship, but only a few significant relationships have been found. This paper attempts to incorporate behavioral conjectures of power into the agency theory framework to provide a comprehensive approach to testing executive pay. Agency theory is combined with the resource dependency theory and with specific measures of power developed by Finkelstein (1992) for a more complete executive pay model.

Leveraged buyouts are an accepted method of restructuring, but a substantial percentage of these privately held buyouts eventually return to public trading, thus defining a public-private-public cycle of ownership. Arguments supporting buyouts have pointed to positive performance changes that occur while the firm is privately held. Such improvements, according to agency theory, are the result of changes in ownership when the firm is bought out. Since ownership patterns change substantially over the buyout cycle, performance implications of the complete cycle of changes must be considered before the true value of the buyout phenomenon can be assessed. With agency theory as a foundation for hypothesis development, we examined the performance and restructuring of 39 firms over the complete buyout cycle and found that agency theory explanations of performance are generally valid throughout the buyout cycle; i.e., increased managerial ownership leads to better firm performance. Moreover, when firms reversed buyouts and returned to public trading, we again found support for agency theory explanations. Qualitative content analysis also supported the agency theory's prediction of restructuring emphases associated with a buyout. Overall, these results suggest that agency theory is an appropriate theoretical base for explaining managerial choices during the buyout cycle. Unexpectedly, however, agency costs that were eliminated or minimized during the private buyout period did not reappear immediately following a reverse buyout. It took several years for the predicted performance declines associated with the agency costs of public ownership to reemerge. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper advances the Hunt-Vitell General Theory of Marketing Ethics as a framework for enriching current understanding of both long-term marketing relationships in general, and principal-agent associations specifically. Under economic models of agency theory, manufacturer-distributor relationships are conceptualized as principal-agent associations where both parties are assumed be motivated exclusively by short-term financial self-interest within the logical constraints of zero-sum game conditions. As a general model of ethical decision making and behavior in marketing, the Hunt-Vitell theory illustrates how ethical decisions are predicated not only upon estimations of potential benefits or outcomes (using teleological criteria), but also deontological evaluations which invoke norms and values. Furthermore, the recent ideas advanced in "relationship marketing" perspectives suggest that distribution channel associations premised upon non-zero-sum or symbiotic assumptions may be more effective and more jointly profitable. Based upon the Hunt-Vitell model, propositions are formulated that complement the understanding of agency theory within the context of marketing channel relationships, and thus, may represent a basis for more effective agency selection and interaction in marketing practice.

This study investigates variation in managers' responses to motivations to use accruals opportunistically. Agency theory suggests accounting-based contractual and governance mechanisms are imposed to limit the discretionary behavior of managers to reduce agency costs. Accordingly, managers are motivated to opportunistically use the discretion in accounting to relax constraints imposed by contractual mechanisms. This implies their accounting choices are determined, at least in part, by these contractual motivations. Existing research, however, implicitly assumes all managers respond equally to contractual motivations. This study relaxes this constraint to investigate whether managers' accounting choices conditional on contractual motivations vary with their external reputations for 'wise use of corporate assets'. All managers are unlikely to exhibit identical opportunistic behavior, and agency theory suggests organizational attributes like the manager's propensity for opportunism, are ex ante priced. Since contracting and governance mechanisms are imperfect and costly, not all variation in opportunistic tendencies from that expected in a fully efficient organization is priced away. This study exploits these predictions to document that managers with high reputations for stewardship over corporate assets are less responsive to the contractual motivations to use accruals opportunistically than are managers with lesser reputations. In other words, the results shown in this study are consistent with the hypothesis that managers' responses to contractual motivations to use accounting accruals vary with their external reputations for stewardship over corporate assets.

This paper explores the degree of competition among each of several major categories of Swiss banks, using a structural econometric model. Conduct is found to vary across ownership structures, with foreign-owned banks exhibiting the most market power and state-owned or mutual banks the least. The results are consistent with agency theory but contrast with some previous empirical results. They are also consistent with a Swiss premium in the provision of international banking services, though this latter hypothesis is not formally tested.

Developed by Stewart Myers (1984), the pecking order theory has turned out to be a spotlight in the recent trend of shifting from the traditional static trade-off optimal model to other theories as an effort to look for an explanation of corporate capital structure behaviour. This article proposes a rational justification to the pecking order hypothesis through the establishment of its relationship to the paradox Modigliana-Miller proposition I. In the process of reasoning to support our justification, we have resorted to various existing theoretical hypothesis including tax-shelter theory, bankruptcy costs theory, agency theory, signalling theory, and managerial risk aversion theory. Some implications of this rational justification to the pecking order hypothesis are also briefly discussed. (c) 2002, MCB UP Limited

This paper examines changes to the accounting system of the Spanish tobacco monopoly in 1887, following the decision by the state to lease the publicly owned and state-run monopoly to a privatesector company. The switch to private-sector management generated a fundamental change in the demands made of the accounting system. As a result, double-entry bookkeeping and a new method of calculating costs were implemented. The paper discusses the motives behind the design of the new accounting system and its consequences using the framework provided by agency theory. It highlights the need to consider the role of the capital structure of the firm and the state as explanatory factors for both the parameters and uses of cost accounting information.

Entrepreneurial activity in the form of strategic subsidiary initiatives is examined theoretically utilising an extended agency theory perspective and extant empirical findings. The analysis using traditional agency theory suggests that entrepreneurial subsidiary initiatives are unlikely given the risk necessary to put forth an initiative and lack of incentives on the part of traditional subsidiary management. In developing an extended principal-agent analysis it is discovered that the risk attitudes of both the parent company and the subsidiary as well as the internal contracting system of the multinational company are rudimentary to a theoretical understanding of subsidiary-driven initiatives. The implications of the analysis are delineated and several propositions developed. (c) 2002 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

An obstacle to the teaching of principal-agent theory is the technical complexity and intractability of the general model. Even in academic studies strong assumptions are often imposed so as to derive an analytical solution. The author describes a graphical approach to the standard principal-agent model. Characterizing equilibrium in the contract space defined by the incentive parameter and insurance component of pay under a linear contract, this approach provides a simple and intuitive method for analyzing the principal-agent problem, which can be easily understood by students of economics with basic knowledge of algebra and differentiation. The approach has shown to be convenient and rich for comparative statics analyses. (c) 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The "atemporal" character of Kirzner's notion of alertness and discovery, and his insistence that entrepreneurship is independent of factor ownership have attracted many criticisms from within the Austrian camp. However, it is precisely these elements of his theory of entrepreneurship that offer important insights for the analysis of the relation between shareholders and management in the modern corporation. First of all, the Kirznerian perspective allows us to view both groups as entrepreneurial. Secondly, and contrary to modern agency theory and the Rothbardian strand of Austrian economics, it highlights the entrepreneurial role of management in introducing innovation. Finally, we argue that the Kirznerian perspective on the division of the entrepreneurial roles in the corporate firm shares some important ideas with the "resource based view" of the firm.

Agency theory dominates research on equity holdings-firm performance relationships; however, extant studies provide no consensus about the direction and magnitude of such relationships. Consistent linkages have not been demonstrated for firm performance and CEO, officer, director, institutional, or blockholder equity. We conducted a series of meta-analyses of relevant empirical ownership-performance studies. The meta-analyses provide few examples of systematic relationships, lending little support for agency theory. We propose a substitution theory perspective for future ownership-performance research.

This study analyzes the impact of ownership structure on R&D investments in the United States and Japan. It begins with the premise that U.S. and Japanese firms have distinct patterns of ownership that may result in disparities in R&D investments. Agency theory and stewardship theory are used to hypothesize about the relationship between ownership and R&D investments. Empirical evidence shows that the level of ownership concentration, and its impact, differ across countries. We argue that these differences result from a mixture of motives and incentives.

How likely are multinational enterprises (MNEs) to use expatriate parent country nationals to staff culturally distant subsidiaries? How does their employment affect subsidiary performance? The agency theory prediction is that MNEs will rely more heavily on parent country nationals as cultural distance increases and that this reliance will weaken over time. Both agency theory and the "resource-based view" suggest that a positive effect of expatriate staffing on subsidiary performance increases with cultural distance but decreases over time. Results largely supported the predictions in data on Japanese foreign subsidiaries.

This article consists of two parts. The first part reports findings from a survey of the issues facing top executives in 272 Canadian family firms. Results show that succession is their No. 1 concern, thus supporting the predominant focus of family business researchers on succession issues. Results also show that concern about relationships with nonfamily managers is a close second in importance. The second part of the article uses Agency Theory to explain why relationships with nonfamily managers are so important. Empirical results show that both the extent and the criticality of a firm's dependence on nonfamily managers are statistically significant determinants of the importance. This study implies that relationships with nonfamily managers is a neglected research topic and points to a new direction for research in family business management. (c) 2003, SAGE Publications.

Although uncovering the factors that lead firms to offer franchises has long been a central goal of franchising research, considerable ambiguity surrounds extant findings. In an effort to help resolve this ambiguity, we used meta-analysis to aggregate results from 44 studies containing 140 tests of ten hypotheses. The ten hypotheses reflect two theoretical perspectives-resource scarcity and agency theory. Overall, the findings offer support for several of the hypotheses grounded in agency theory, but not those grounded in resource scarcity. The results also highlight the need for future inquiry to include new theoretical approaches and richer data. (c) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

We empirically examine standard agency predictions about how performance measures are optimally weighted to provide CEO incentives. Consistent with prior empirical research, we document that the relative weight on price and non-price performance measures in CEO cash pay is a decreasing function of the relative variances. Agency theory speaks to the weights in total compensation (annual total pay and changes in the CEO's equity portfolio value), however, and we document that very little of CEOs' total incentives come from cash pay. We also document that variation in the relative weight on price and non-price performance measures in CEO total compensation is an increasing function of the relative variances. The conflicting results using total compensation indicate that existing findings on cash pay cannot be interpreted as evidence supporting standard agency predictions. Based on our results, we suggest approaches for future research on performance measure use in CEO total compensation.

Multiple-performance-measure agency models predict that optimal contracts should place greater reliance on performance measures that are more precise and more sensitive to the agent's effort. We apply these predictions to CEO retention decisions. First, we develop an agency model to motivate proxies for signal and noise in firm-level performance measures. We then document that accounting information appears to receive greater weight in turnover decisions when accounting-based measures are more precise and more sensitive. We also present evidence suggesting that market-based performance measures receive less weight in turnover decisions when accounting-based measures are more sensitive or market returns are more variable.

The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of relative familiarity and language accessibility on the International Accounting Standards (IASs) disclosures when IASs are first introduced in an emerging capital market. The study focuses on the annual reports of listed non-financial companies in Egypt when IASs were first introduced. The method used applies a disclosure index measurement to a sample of listed company annual reports and evaluates relative compliance with IASs in relation to corporate characteristics. The results show that for relatively less familiar requirements of IASs, the extent of compliance is related to the type of audit firm used and to the presence of a specific statement of compliance with IASs. A lower degree of compliance with less familiar IASs disclosure is observed consistently across a range of company characteristics. Consideration of agency theory and capital need theory would lead to prior expectation of a distinction in disclosure practices between different categories of companies. The results were, therefore, counterintuitive to expectations where the regulations were unfamiliar or not available in the native language, indicating that new variables have to be considered and additional theoretical explanations have to be found in future disclosure studies on emerging capital markets.

The principal-agent theory asserts that public firms' performance is driven by efficient capital and labor markets but is silent about non-listed private companies, which are less permeable to market forces (both capital and labor) than are public companies.

Our findings provide highly contrasted results and raise important issues for further study of private firms.

Executives confront potentially conflicting pressures-maximizing shareholder wealth in the long term and appeasing shareholders in the near term. Because they must address near-term pressures to preserve tenure and to realize the benefits of long-term strategies, executives are increasingly likely to seek to mollify shareholders. We develop a behavioral-agency theoretical framework for studying how stock repurchase programs are used to help top managers appease shareholders. Analysis of 250 large U.S. firms suggested that stock repurchase programs are variously a function of information asymmetry, risky stock-based incentives, and performance expectations.

Two theories have emerged in the managerial control literature as to the best way for organizations to ensure that managers are acting in the firm's best interest: agency theory, which stresses controlling decision-makers through monitoring and incentives aligned with organizational goals, and stewardship theory, which stresses that decision-makers will act in the organization's best interest even in the absence of controls. Much of the research investigating the utility of these two positions is based on archival data where actual decision-making can only be inferred. In this study, we utilize a laboratory methodology in order to determine if decision-makers actually make different decisions when under the types of control (or lack thereof) suggested in these two theories. The results of this study show that individuals under agency controls invest more in alternatives that maximize profits of an organization than individuals under stewardship controls.

Hostile takeover attempts oftentimes signal that a target firm has an over-diversified and ineffective corporate strategy. What does this signal mean when takeover attempts fail? Drawing from agency theory, we argue that target firms managed by independent directory boards are likely to ignore the takeover attempt and not refocus their firms' strategy. Conversely, target firms managed by nonindependent boards are more likely to view the failed takeover attempt as a 'wake-up call' and will refocus their firms' strategy so as to preserve the firm's survival. These arguments are tested using a sample of 76 firms that were targets of failed hostile takeover attempts. Logistic regression analyses confirm the predictions. This study suggests that in the aftermath of a failed takeover attempt board of director characteristics can help predict changes in corporate strategies.

This review evaluates the four major theories of corporate financing: (1) the Modigliani-Miller theory of capital-structure irrelevance, in which firm values and real investment decisions are unaffected by financing; (2) the trade-off theory, in which firms balance the tax advantages of borrowing against the costs of financial distress; (3) agency theories, in which financing responds to managers' personal incentives; and (4) the pecking-order theory, in which financing adapts to mitigate problems created by differences in information. These theories are conditional, not general. It is easy to find examples of each theory at work, but otherwise difficult to distinguish the theories empirically. Large, safe firms with mostly tangible assets tend to borrow more. Firms with high profitability and valuable growth opportunities tend to borrow less. Each of these tendencies is consistent with two or more of the major theories of financing. It may be possible to devise sharper tests by exporting the theories to developing economies, where agency and information problems are more severe. Further progress in understanding corporate financing decisions will require a deeper understanding of agency issues when value-maximizing operating and investment decisions cannot be observed or verified. But managers are not just temporary agents motivated by immediate pecuniary compensation or perquisites. Managers specialize their human capital to the firm. Some recent research suggests how financing can support the co-investment of human and financial capital. (c) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Agency theory implies that asset ownership and decision authority are complements. Using 1998 data from Texas commercial banks, we test whether the likelihood of local ownership of bank offices increases with the importance of granting local managers greater decision authority (for example, due to location or customer base). Our empirical evidence is consistent with this hypothesis. It suggests that complementarities between strategy and organizational structure can foster differentiation among firms in terms of location, customers, and products. It also supports the growing view that small locally-owned banks have a comparative advantage over large banks within specific environments. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This article examines the franchisor-franchisee relationship from two theoretical perspectives - agency theory and exchange theory. Taking the case of the fast-food industry in Israel, the research focuses on control and autonomy in a domestic hamburger chain - Burger Ranch - and two international chains - McDonald's and Burger King. The findings led to the design of a model that illustrates several aspects, such as the concept of franchising, the size and age of the chain, and the range of the contract, that relate to control and autonomy. The combination of agency theory and exchange theory enables us to focus on control and autonomy as multidimensional concepts, and to present various possibilities for judiciously balancing them. The case indicates that in some respects (e.g. master franchisee), the two global chains are more similar to each other than to the domestic chain. However, in other respects (e.g. size, growth rate), the domestic and one of the two global chains show more similarities than differences. The findings indicate different forms of integration of control and autonomy in the three chains. (c) 2003, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

Researchers use various definitions to describe the family firm. The characteristics of family firms that are stressed in each of these definitions are somehow related to family control. All characteristics together reflect a spectrum of family firm types along one core dimension: family involvement in the firm. However, it is more helpful to distinguish among family firms by using their precise type. Each particular family firm type is characterised by a set of agency relations within and between the family system, ownership system and the business system. This paper is a first attempt to apply the insights from agency theory on a highly simplified (reference) family firm situation where the father is full owner and the daughter manager of the family firm. Agency theory establishes the foundation for the optimal contract conditions between father and daughter. While real life is often characterised by bounded rationality and incomplete information, future research should help identify the "optimal contract" between the family/shareholders and management in various family firm types under these circumstances.

In agency theory, the remuneration packages of executive directors in large companies are seen as an attempt to give them a pattern of rewards that aligns their interests more closely with shareholders as a whole. The sensitivity of total executive rewards to share price performance has become the conventional yardstick for judgements concerning whether reward packages do indeed serve shareholders' interests or executives themselves. Long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) introduced in the UK from 1995 have imposed new, firm-specific performance conditions on senior managers. While LTIPs are designed to increase performance-pay sensitivity, however, they also give executives new opportunities to manipulate the terms of LTIPs in their own favour, at the expense of shareholders and stakeholders in general. This paper presents the first estimates of UK total executive rewards that include detailed LTIP valuations. It finds that, while increasing average total rewards, the presence of LTIPs is actually associated with reductions in the sensitivity of executives' total rewards to shareholder return. This raises doubts concerning both the effectiveness of the LTIP instrument and the validity of an agency perspective in this context.

This article examines the implications of the escalation in institutional inves power and heterogeneity for two dominant theories of corporate governanceagency theory and stakeholder theory. From this analysis, a new view of the agency relationship between institutional investors and their portfolio firms emerges, which recognizes the institutions' market power, complex role as financial intermediaries, and possible involvement in simultaneous and opposing agency contracts. We also conclude that stakeholder theorists should reconsider these newly empowered shareholders'moral standing in relation to their portfolio firms, and they should reexamine the identities and goals of these modern investors. To that end, we demonstrate that a novel, intragroup application of Mitchell, Agle, and Wood's stakeholder framework to heterogeneous institutional investors illuminates their varying levels of stakeholder salience.

Empirical research on the impact of reform on the Japanese corporate governance system could provide useful lessons for their European counterparts who are themselves facing similar pressures to reform. We found that although participation of outside directors in strategic decision-making was associated with positive stock returns, the increase in the ratio of outside directors, the separation of the board members and executive officers, and the reduction of board size were not related to firm performance.

This study examines the perceptions of directors in Australian public listed companies about their access to information for their role as directors. We focus on information costs and information asymmetry. Directors' perceptions of the relationship between the composition of Boards, the perceived roles of Boards and the information requirements to fulfil those roles were explored in interviews with 45 directors from public listed companies. Implicit in Agency Theory is the assumption that independent directors have free access to the information required to fulfil their role in monitoring and control. We found, however, demonstrable evidence of information asymmetry. The central finding was that directors perceive that the CEO and Executive have the controlling power over information. The provision of appropriate information for Board decisions is perceived to hinge on the "integrity" of the CEO and Executive. This emphasis on integrity and "good companies" does appear consistent with the Stewardship Theory of governance. It raises as a question for future research the possible alternative relationships between Boards and management. The directors interviewed discussed a range of strategies they used to keep themselves informed and made observations of additions to information that they believed should be available as a matter of course.

In spite of its considerable popularity, multi-unit franchising has been considered an anomaly from an agency theory perspective. This paper addresses this anomaly by attempting a comprehensive agency theoretic explanation of international multi-unit franchising. Although past agency theoretic examinations have mostly focused on single-unit franchising, a closer examination of the international context, which is characterized by significant geographic and cultural distance between franchisors and franchisees, suggests that multi-unit franchising may be more appropriate. This paper examines several agency problems inherent in multi-unit franchising. These include: bonding, adverse selection, information flow, shirking, inefficient risk-bearing, free-riding, and quasi-rent appropriation. Consideration of each of these problems using agency theory perspective leads to the suggestion that multi-unit franchising might address agency problems better than single-unit franchising in the international context.

Consistent with our model, we find significant effects for human capital, organizational size, and organizational affiliation. We find tentative support for a significant pay-for-performancerelationship. We find that when education, tenure, size, performance, and affiliation are held constant, femaleexecutives are compensated significantly less than male executives. (c) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper examines the professional hockey industry to explore the principles of agency theory. Using basic tenets derived from the agency literature and conditions specific to the hockey industry, a series of propositions are developed. These are investigated using data from industry documents, popular articles on hockey, and interviews with players, agents, team managers and other relevant industry stakeholders. The results suggested that concerns for agent reputation, agent competition, agent certification and salary disclosure have cumulatively reduced information asymmetry favoring the agent and have decreased the likelihood of agent opportunism. This has resulted in a decrease in the use of commissions by agents, but this form of performance contingent compensation remains the most widely used form of remuneration.

The aim of this article is to study the effect of diversification strategy on firm capital structure using a panel data analysis for a sample of 480 Spanish manufacturing firms during the period 1991-1994. Co-insurance effect and transaction cost arguments help to explain a positive relation between firm debt ratio and firm diversification, while agency theory predicts a negative relation. This study did not find a significant relationship between firm leverage and the degree of firm diversification, using different debt ratios, and the revenue-based Herfindahl index and the entropy measure as proxies of firm diversification. This evidence contrasts with previous studies for American and Australian markets that suggest a positive relation, according to co-insurance effect and transaction cost explanations.

Considerable differences exist between Germany and Anglo- American countries in the development of the statutory audit, the emergence of professional associations of auditors, and the legal and organizational forms of audit firms. This paper examines historical developments in Germany from the late 19th century, to the formal regulation of auditing and the audit profession in 1931. Its main objective is to provide a better understanding of the comparatively slow development of the audit in Germany and reveal attitudes towards the audit and the forms of audit firms. A secondary objective is to examine the use of agency theory frameworks for this type of historical research. The study draws on primary and secondary sources, both of which have been underutilized by previous authors. The paper finds that many of the unique features of the development of auditing in Germany and the solutions adopted there can be traced to historical differences concerning the objectives of the audit, the structure of the audit market and the foundations of the audit profession. It further adds to the critique of agency theory assumptions in historical contexts. (c) 2003, Academy of Accounting Historians. All rights reserved.

In this article, the cost minimization model of dividends, which is underpinned by agency theory, is estimated and tested on data from 882 private sector firms listed on the Mumbai Stock Exchange for the period 1994 to 1998. Specifically, the hypothesis implied by the model is that private sector firms in India set their target payout ratios so as to minimize the sum of agency costs and the costs associ ated with raising external finance. Cross-sectional weighted least squares method ology is used, and squared and interaction terms are introduced into the model, along with a number of novel explanatory variables. It is found that government ownership, insider ownership, risk, debt, and growth opportunities, have a negative impact on the payout ratio. In contrast, institutional ownership, foreign ownership and dispersed ownership have a positive impact on the payout ratio. These results are consistent with the predictions of the cost minimization model of dividends in the context of listed companies in India. (c) 2003, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

We examine the compensation strategies of commercial bank holding companies (BHCs) during 1992-2000. In particular, we analyze whether CEO compensation is more closely tied to the presence of growth options and to risk than is revealed in earlier research. We also examine whether BHC entry into investment banking has influenced compensation policies. Our evidence shows a stronger link between growth options and CEO compensation in the 1990s than observed in earlier studies and that pay-for-performance sensitivities are substantially larger for BHCs that have entered the underwriting business. We also find that BHC leverage and variability in returns have positive effects on CEO incentive pay. Finally, we find some evidence supporting the hypothesis that pay-for-performance sensitivities decline generally at BHCs as return variability increases, as agency theory predicts.

This paper examines the financial performance effect of three corporate governance mechanisms: (i) founding family CEO, (ii) board ownership, and (iii) board independence. The developed hypotheses are tested using multivariate ordinary least-squares regression on a 3-year sample of 32 publicly traded maritime firms from Norway and Sweden, and compared to the results of the same hypotheses tested on a sample of 96 manufacturing firms. This study concludes that maritime firms with a founding family CEO have better financial performance than maritime firms with a non-founding family CEO. Support was also found for the hypothesis that a high level of board independence enhances profitability in maritime firms. Contrary to agency theory predictions, no significant relation was found between the level of board ownership and firm profitability in maritime firms, although board ownership control was significant in the sample of manufacturing firms.

This paper analyses operational differences between mobile franchising arrangements and fixed-site franchises from an agency-theoretic perspective. Almost 40 per cent of all franchised units in Australia operate as mobile or home-based businesses, predominantly in service industries where products or services are provided directly to consumers. A two-stage methodology is reported in this paper, incorporating quantitative and qualitative research methods. In stage one, data obtained from a survey of the population of Australian franchisors in 1998 are analysed to compare operational variables of mobile and fixed-site franchise units. The second stage of the research employs in-depth interviews with a sample of mobile franchisors and franchisees to further explore relevant issues. The results confirm the agency theory perspective that start-up investment risk is lower in mobile units and mobile operations exhibit a higher level of repeat customers than fixed-site franchises. No significant differences between the two arrangements are revealed in relation to the levels of franchisee monitoring, initial training or essential franchisee experience. This study indicates that agency theory contributes to our understanding of mobile franchising arrangements, yet also suggests the findings are not completely explained by agency theory. The results imply that both monitoring and alignment of incentives have complimentary effects and that both forms of contract are necessary in a franchisor's control system. (c) 2003, MCB UP Limited.

This paper examines issues in the design of a co-operative member's contractual relationship with the other agents (including the remaining members) using organizational economics. The paper assumes that the central defining characteristic of a co-op is the residual claim specification. Agency theory identifies certain inherent problems of the co-op form, the horizon problem, common property problem, and non-transferability. Non-transferability both reduces the incentive to monitor and imposes limits on portfolio diversification. This paper argues that features such as claim incompleteness and non-transferability are not inherent to the co-op but may be transaction-cost economizing. The paper also argues that the pre-emptive payoff feature by which the residual claimants (the co-op members) also become fixed payoff agents can affect the risk of other agents, and is an important determinant of co-op risk. A co-op may have more than one potential residual claim base. Five generic design choices are available for handling possible multiple claim bases: battleground, pre-specified allocation, limited return, alignment, and fixed payoff. The paper uses the design of residual claims in sugar co-ops to show how a co-op can partly overcome some of the problems identified by agency theory. This illustration ties together the issues of claim incompleteness and non-transferability, pre-emptive payoff, and multiple claim bases. (c) 2003 CIRIEC.

The Japanese system of corporate governance and in particular the role played by banks and other financial institutions have been the subject of considerable research and controversy in recent years. We estimate the impact of equity ownership by financial institutions on firm performance in Japan for 1986-1991, a period that precedes many of the problems of the ensuing decade. We find that while ownership by financial institutions is associated with unprofitable diversification, such ownership is, on balance, positively associated with firm profitability. Some implications of these findings for Japan's unique system of governance are discussed.

There remains a continuing debate as to whether administrative leaders and bureaucrats in the public sector should operate as private sector entrepreneurs or should be seen as the conservators of our constitutional values and the principles on which this country is based. The ideational discourse between the reinventing government movement and the conservatorship paradigm continues to resonate a yet-unresolved intellectual crisis in public administration. The real conservators of American constitutional and administrative values are not the individuals who man her offices; rather, it is society in general that must assimilate and articulate these values. Bureaucrats come and go, but society remains essentially what it is. Rather than conservators or entrepreneurs, bureaucrats are "contracted" custodians of our administrative values but not the repository of those values. By drawing on the principal-agency thesis, this paper offers an alternate premise - the contractarian approach - for assessing bureaucratic accountability in public administrative practice.

Teleworking as an integration of information and telecommunication technologies with human resources management, means a new job organisation paradigm for companies working in the new economy. However there are very few empirical studies that have analysed the teleworking adoption issue from an organisational theory perspective. This paper contributes, with empirical data from industrial and service companies, to the analysis of teleworking diffusion based on hypotheses developed from the agency, institutional and resource-based view theories.

This paper analyzes the links among executive compensation, a firm's strategic orientation, and firm performance. A number of key questions relative to the relationships among these elements remain unanswered because prior research on this subject has reported mixed results, and, moreover, has been confined almost exclusively to U.S. firms. We develop a framework that draws on arguments from agency theory to identify such links. A research design with both archival and survey data is used to test hypotheses in a sample of 253 Spanish companies. We found that top managers' compensation systems are linked with a firm's strategic orientations, but in a different form than that of previous studies. Results show two differentiated groups of firms: (1) prospective firms that adapt their managerial compensation systems to the requirements of strategic context, consequently obtaining positive performance effects; and (2) conservative firms that design managerial compensation systems independent of strategic context, consequently not obtaining additional performance benefits.

This paper examines the circumstances in which financial reporting exists. Jensen and Meckling (1995) observe that where there are high knowledge transfer costs, then decentralisation is necessary; and that where decentralisation occurs there is a control problem, which can be addressed by providing a control system. I predict that where there are high knowledge transfer costs there will be a control system; if the control system uses financial reports, these will occur for activities with high knowledge transfer costs. The ability to decentralise is reduced where dependence makes it potentially costly to allow a subordinate to make decisions about the activity. The paper predicts that high dependence will be negatively associated with the existence of financial reports. The results confirm the predictions that financial reports are positively associated with knowledge transfer costs and negatively associated with dependence. (c) AFAANZ, 2003.

Do outside directors on corporate boards make a difference in firm performance during institutional transitions ? What leads to the practice of appointing outside directors in the absence of legal mandate? This article addresses these two important questions by drawing not only on agency theory, but also resource dependence and institutional theories. Taking advantage of China's institutional transitions, our findings, based on an archival database covering 405 publicly listed firms and 1211 company-years, suggest that outsider directors do make a difference infirm performance, if such performance is measured by sales growth, and that they have little impact on financial performance such as return on equity (ROE). The results also document a bandwagon effect behind the diffusion of the practice of appointing outsiders to corporate boards. The article not only highlights the need to incorporate multiple theories beyond agency theory in corporate governance research, but also generates policy implications in light of the recent trend toward having more outside directors on corporate boards in emerging economies.

In this paper we explore the impact of organisational mechanisms on inter-unit knowledge flows in multinational corporations (MNCs). A comprehensive model, based on agency theory and socialisation theory, is tested on a sample of 134 Finnish and Chinese MNC subsidiaries. Our findings indicate that MNCs can influence inter-unit knowledge transfer by specifying the objectives of the subsidiary and by utilising corporate socialisation mechanisms. However, we found no support for the hypothesised impact of management compensation systems and the use of expatriate managers on the extent of knowledge transfers from foreign subsidiaries to other parts of the MNC.

This study combines elements of the upper echelons and agency perspectives to resolve some of the ambiguity surrounding how corporate elites affect corporate strategy. We propose and test the notion that while differences in individual characteristics of corporate elites may imply different preferences for particular corporate strategies such as diversification and acquisitions, these basic preferences, when situated in different agency contexts (e.g., CEO, outsider director, non-CEO top management team member), generate very different strategic outcomes. Our detailed empirical findings, based on extensive longitudinal governance and corporate strategy data from large U.S. corporations, also highlight the pitfalls of using aggregate units of analysis (e.g., board of directors or top management team) when studying the influence of corporate elites on corporate strategy.

As franchising has increased its visibility and impact on the business landscape, it has attracted the attention of a wide variety of researchers from different academic backgrounds. We draw together much of this research by juxtaposing the two key theories used to explain franchising, resource scarcity and agency theory, with the empirical findings regarding three key franchising constructs-franchise initiation, subsequent propensity to franchise, and franchise performance. We suggest that research emphasis needs to shift toward understanding why firms initiate franchising and how franchising impacts different types of organizational performance. We also find that extant research can benefit from additional theoretical diversity and thus we offer new propositions grounded in three theories not yet widely applied to franchising.

In this article, we document the growing influence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the realm of socially responsible investing (SRI). Drawing from ethical and economic perspectives on stakeholder management and agency theory, we develop a framework to understand how and when NGOs will be most influential in shaping the ethical and social responsibility orientations of business using the emergence of SRI as the primary influencing vehicle. We find that NGOs have opportunities to influence corporate conduct via direct, indirect, and interactive influences on the investment community, and that the overall influence of NGOs as major actors in socially responsible investment is growing, with attendant consequences for corporate strategy, governance, and social performance.

This study investigates the structure of the board of directors at socially responsible (SR) firms. Using a sample of 394 SR firms and comparing these to a matched sample of firms, I find that SR firms have characteristics associated with effective board structures. For instance, SR firms have more outsiders and women directors, and less instance of CEO/Chairman duality than non-SR firms. Results are similar when using a continuous measure of social responsibility. Also, I document that SR firms have higher Governance Index scores than the matched sample. Overall, this suggests that a reason for shareholders' appeal in socially responsible firms and mutual funds may be because these firms have stronger governance mechanisms in place than do non-SR firms. In addition, it appears that effective governance structures are more likely to exist in firms that focus on a broad range of stakeholders, rather than in firms that have a strict focus on shareholder wealth maximization.

While agency theory claims managerial self-interest creates a diversification discount, strategic theory explains that firms with certain kinds of resources should diversify. Longitudinal data on 227 firms that diversify between 1980 and 1992 reveal that the sample firms invest less in R&D and have greater breadth of technology (based on patent citations) than their industry peers prior to the diversification event. Also, acquiring firms may appear to have lower performance because of accounting conventions and because firms that use internal growth rather than acquisition pursue less extensive diversification. These findings help explain how diversification and financial performance are endogenous. Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The role of the board of directors in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. However, research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies: the lack of an overarching theoretical perspective, reliance on proxies for the strategy role rather than a direct measure of it and the lack of quantitative data linking this role to firm financial performance. We propose a new theoretical perspective to explain the board's role in strategy, integrating organisational control and agency theories. We categorise a board's approach to strategy according to two constructs: strategic control and financial control. The extent to which either construct is favoured depends on contextual factors such as board power, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry.

We explore impression and earnings management via reasoning and methods grounded in ethnostatistics and agency theory. We hypothesized that earnings management occurs more frequently following duality-creating successions than otherwise because CEO-chairs have greater control of the impressions created by their firms' financial reports and are operating under greater expectations of positive results. Using a sample of 173 duality-creating succession announcements and 112 non-duality-creating succession announcements, we obtained empirical results consistent with these predictions.

Prior research on the relationship between corporate controls and firm performance is premised on the notion that, in theory, there is direct association between corporate governance and firm performance. However, extensive research has produced mixed and often weak results. In this paper, we posit, as a primary relationship, a negative association between growth and firm performance and then examine whether corporate governance variables moderate this negative relationship. Our results support this notion and show that the role of corporate governance variables in firm performance should be evaluated in the context of the firm's external environment measured in this study in terms of growth opportunities.

Research shows the best project performance is obtained when there is high collaboration between client and project manager, and medium levels of structure, when the project manager and project owner work together in partnership, and the manager is empowered. Unfortunately, this is not how it happens on many projects. There is mistrust, even conflict, between owner and manager, and the owner sets tight constraints within which the manager must work. Project owners mouth partnership and empowerment, but implement conflict and tight control. In this paper, we offer the principal-agency relationship between client and project manager as one reason for this. However, we offer communication between the client and project manager as a way of reducing this problem. We suggest what communication the client needs from the project manager, and what communication the project manager needs from the client to minimize the impact of the principal-agency relationship. We report the results of an international study into communication needs on projects. We establish that the communication needs of project participants are best served by a mixture of formal and informal communication, and of written and verbal communication. We also establish that communication and emotion are closely linked on projects. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite the fact that more than $200 billion of capital investment was financed through project companies in 2001, an amount that grew at a compound annual rate of almost 20% during the 1990s, there has been very little academic research on project finance. The purpose of this article is to explain why project finance in general and why large projects in particular merit separate academic research and instruction. In short, there are significant opportunities to study the relationship among structural attributes (i.e., high leverage, contractual details, and concentrated equity ownership), managerial incentives, and asset values, as well as improve current practice in this rapidly growing field of finance.

Although franchising is a pervasive organizational form, little is known about its performance consequences. Prior studies have not found a direct performance effect, suggesting a need for alternative approaches. Drawing upon agency and resource scarcity theories, we develop the idea that strategic groups exist among franchisors and that performance differs among the groups. Using a sample of 65 restaurant chains, three strategic groups were found. The strategic group most influenced to franchise out of resource scarcity exhibited poorer performance than the other two groups. Results indicate that important, but nonlinear, relationships exist among franchising, its antecedents, and performance. (c) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This article examines the extent to which agency theory may explain chief executive officer (CEO) compensation in Chinese state-owned enterprises during the 1980s. We find support for the agency theory: CEO pay sensitivity decreases with the variance of performance. Moreover, the performance sensitivity of CEO pay increases with the marginal return to executive action. While the elasticity of pay to sales is slightly smaller than that found for conventional firms in the West generally, our estimate of the semielasticity of pay with respect to profitability is comparable with estimates for regulated industries in the United States.

The reluctance to transmit bad news is a problem that is endemic to many organizations. When large projects go awry, it often takes weeks, months, and sometimes even years, before senior management becomes fully aware of what has happened. Accurate communication concerning a project and its status is therefore critical if organizations are to avoid costly and embarrassing debacles. This paper describes the results of an experiment designed to explore some key variables that may influence an individual's willingness to report bad news in an information systems project context. We extend a basic theoretical model derived from the whistle-blowing literature by considering relevant constructs from agency theory. We then test the entire model using a controlled experiment that employs a role-playing scenario. The results explain a significant portion of the variance in the reluctance to report negative status information. Implications for research and practice are discussed, along with directions for future research. (c) 2004, Authors. All rights reserved.

Agency theory assumes that employees and employers have different goals, act in a self-interested manner, and are willing to assume varying degrees of risk. In this paper, we argue that cultural differences may attenuate those assumptions and thereby temper agency theory predictions. Culture may align goals between employers and employees, change a company's preference for behavior- versus outcome-based pay, require higher incentives before employees will accept outcome-based pay, and lower the moral hazard concerns associated with outcome-based pay. Based on those arguments, we develop propositions that can be tested empirically. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper advances the resource dependence and social networks literature by investigating a board's structural social capital created as a consequence of interlocking directorates. Using approaches and measures developed by social network analysis we compare the interpersonal directorship networks of the top 250 companies in the United States and Australia. We find that the smaller, sparser Australian network is only marginally less compact and connected than the larger US network at the firm level of analysis. However, at the director level of analysis the US network is much larger and more connected than its Australian counterpart. As a result, we argue that scholars studying the resource dependence role of boards should consider using measures of interpersonal links as well as traditional measures of inter-firm links. Understanding how boards impact on corporate performance is a question central to the corporate governance research agenda. Agency theory, for example, argues that the key way a board adds value is by ensuring the interests of the managers of the firm are aligned with the interests of the owners (Eisenhardt 1989; Jensen & Meckling 1976). A quite distinct area of inquiry, however, relates to the role that the board plays in providing access to important resources such as customers (Pennings 1980), capital (Mizruchi & Stearns 1988), the business elite (Uscem 1984) and power in general (Pfeffer & Salancik 1978). We aim to broaden understanding of the resource dependence theory of corporate governance by examining the links provided to a board by interlocking directorships. We commence by reviewing existing research on the resource dependence role of the board before outlining how the emerging construct of social capital can be adapted and applied to investigate this role. In particular, we highlight how it is the personal director network that is critical to the development of social capital rather than the corporate network (i.e. network of corporations). While this study is primarily exploratory and descriptive, we contribute to the literature by employing a new methodology to measure the 'opportunity network' that interlocking directorates provide a board within a national corporate governance system (Adams 2002a; 2002b; 2002c). We show how the formal models, procedures and techniques developed in social network analysis can be applied to individual-level networks among directors. We stress that we are not considering the formation of social capital at the individual level; rather we are examining the systemic connections of individual directors in order to illustrate the opportunity network available to a board within the national corporate governance system. A comparison of the Australian and US systems highlights the divergence in network attributes between corporate networks and the networks of interlocking directors. We conclude with implications and areas for further research.

Suppliers and buyers of R&D results perceive two exchange risks: first, the risk to achieve a lower profitability on the innovation return than the exchange partner, second, the risk of the partner becoming a competitor by unplanned, one-sided knowledge flows. Both risks motivate opportunistic behaviour. The paper deals with the reduction of the perceived supplier risks. We analyse how an option on later negotiation of an additional continuous innovation return sharing which is based on contractual hostages can lower the perceived exchange risks. An empirical study examines how effectively these hostages lower the perceived risks. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper reports the findings from a survey of the effects of management buyouts on human resource management (HRM). Buyouts resulted in increased employment, the adoption of new reward systems, and expanded employee involvement. These developments support the resource-based view that buyouts develop internal assets over agency theory predictions that managers will adopt a cost reduction approach. The type of buyout influences the subsequent development of HRM. Buyouts report more commitment-orientated employment policies where employees own shares, and where the buyout pursues a 'buy and build' corporate strategy and adopts a business strategy of enhancing customer service and developing markets.

A curious ownership structure is found in Northern Europe-foundations that own and operate business companies. The foundations are non-profit entities, they have no members and no owners, and they cannot be dissolved. In many cases, these entities control more than 50% of the votes in successful international companies. Obviously, this structure completely blocks the market for corporate control, but it also violates other basic principles of agency theory and corporate finance. Nevertheless, we present evidence that a sample of foundation-owned companies listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange are at least as efficient as other listed companies in terms of risk adjusted stock returns, accounting returns and Tobin's Q. Thus, they question whether profit-seeking ownership is a necessary condition for competitive enterprise. (c) 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This paper describes the results of a field experiment involving 400 employees from ten financial institutions operating within the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone of the People's Republic of China. It was found that, when faced with an agency-based problem, employees indicated they would be less inclined to advise management of the existence of unethical work practices. Younger employees without supervisory experience displayed significant risk aversion. Traditional Chinese values associated with Confucian work dynamism, were shown to be poor predictors of moral choice response. A parsimonious regression model was developed that provides evidence that the universal trait Masculinity/Femininity (Human-heartedness) acted to offset the negative influence of the agency problem. On the other hand, an operative's level of education attainment exerted a negative influence on moral response scores.

This paper sets out the results of interview-based research to determine why companies use performance-related pay. The findings indicate that many companies adopt this structure despite a belief that the money does not motivate executives. Reasons related in part to best practice in human resource management: pay structures were designed to attract and retain executives with the potential of large earnings; to focus their efforts in the direction agreed by the board; and to demonstrate fairness. Importantly, the variable pay was seen as a symbol of the director's success, both internally and to his or her peers in other companies. Finally, and significantly, an institutional theory explanation was given: companies used performance-related pay because their peers did, and because that legitimised them in the eyes of the establishment.

Research has suggested that information systems planning is an important challenge to managers of multinational firms. Although studies have examined marketing, finance, and manufacturing, limited research has considered IS planning autonomy in such firms. A field survey of 55 US subsidiaries collected data from matched pairs of senior IS and non-IS managers to test hypotheses based on corporate governance theory and agency theory. The former described their planning autonomy and the latter described organizational characteristics. Data analysis revealed that foreign product diversity, extent of local ownership of the subsidiary, intracompany purchases, and age of the subsidiary were related to the subsidiary's IS planning autonomy. The findings indicated that parent companies treat the IS function differently from other areas of the organization. Future researchers should investigate the proposed explanations of this difference. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study strives to take an extra step to sharpen the comprehension of one aspect of agency theory as well as to extend previous research by examining the role of board of directors and managerial remuneration in enhancing corporate performance in the REITs industry. The main hypothesis in this study will be twofold. First, managerial remuneration is related to corporate performance. Second, the ratio of outside directors is related to corporate performance. This study will use a sample of REIT firms as of the end of 1996. The sample will consist of the actively traded REITs listed in the public stock exchanges. The final sample that meets all the criteria includes 167 REITs. The results indicate that there is a negative relationship between cash managerial remuneration and firm performance. Moreover, this study confirms a nonlinear relationship between board size and firm performance. The relationship is negative when board size is small, and it turns positive when board size grows.

This paper examines the joint impact of capital requirements and managerial incentive compensation on bank charter value and bank risk. Most of the previous literature in the area of banking and agency theory has focused on asymmetric information between either banks and regulators, (and therefore on the role of bank capital), or between bank shareholders and bank managers, (and therefore on the role of managerial ownership). In this paper we unify these issues and present empirical results from the regression of capital requirements jointly with measures of incentive compensation on Tobin's Q, our proxy for bank charter value, and on the standard deviation of total return, our proxy for bank risk. In a sample of 102 bank holding companies we find that capital levels are consistently a significant positive factor in determining bank charter value and a significant negative factor in determining risk. On the other hand, we find our six measures of incentive compensation to be generally insignificant relative to charter value but do provide some evidence consistent with a theory relating types of incentive compensation with risk.

This study examines both the direct and indirect effects of chief executive officer tenure and age on CEO pay in UK organizations. It was found that the positive relationship between shareholder return and increases in the value of executive options held decreases with CEO tenure. Moreover, the positive association between changes in salary and sales was found to increase with CEO tenure. CEO age, on the other hand, weakened the relationship between the level in salary and size of the organization. Several new methodological issues relating to research on executive pay are also raised. One finding was that the study of these relationships might be better pursued through the use of non-linear functions as CEO influence over the pay setting process may not become significant until about the sixth year of tenure. These findings have implications for further research relating to executive pay and to the corporate governance process. (c) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This article examines the differences, tensions and overlaps between agency and stewardship theories of corporate governance. The context is a hostile bid for Blue Circle Industries, a FTSE 100 company, and the focus is upon its Chief Executive Officer's actions in response. CEOs occupy a position of pivotal importance during such takeover bids, and it is salient to examine their resultant motivations and payoffs. While agency theory suggests that CEOs may act in self-interested ways, diverging from the interests of shareholders, ongoing stewardship theory sees CEOs as fundamentally honest and caring about their company and shareholders' interests. The hostile bid is an opportunity for the target CEO to fight at any cost, or to act in the best interests of stakeholders.In examining the target CEO's actions, this article suggests there is more complexity than these two theories acknowledge and the relationship between them is not one of simple opposition. The article identifies a framework for making sense of CEO/stakeholder relationships, and highlights the importance to boards of understanding how CEOs manage differential stakeholder pressures over time.

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are becoming rapidly indispensable in order for large and medium sized organizations to run their operations. Therefore, management needs to know the factors that drive successful ERP implementation, a product of the continuous interaction between the implementation consultants and client firms. Agency theory has been successfully used by different researchers to explain relationships between two parties seeking a common outcome. This paper develops a model of testable propositions for applying agency theory to study the relationship between implementation consultants and client organizations deploying the ERP systems, and to consequently evaluate how the relationship affects the implementation success.

Recent scandals at Enron, WorldCom and Global Crossing have put the ethical spotlight on corporate malfeasance as never before. However, these are the situations in which management knew that they made the wrong choice. As professor Joseph Badaracco of Harvard Business School points out, the real ethical dilemmas arise when people must choose between right and right - where both choices can be justified, yet one must be chosen over the other. Whether or not to reprice stock options represents one such ethical dilemma. Repricing can help exodus of talented employees and motivate them to improve firm performance. However, it alienates shareholders and other workers of the company who are left unprotected from the adverse economic consequences of a stock price decline. In this paper we examine the ethics and the economics of stock option repricing. We find that repricing runs counter to two key tenets of business ethics - distributive justice and ordinary decency. To examine the economics of repricing, we draw upon agency theory to identify situations where repricing has the potential to benefit shareholders. However, a survey of empirical research reveals that these benefits do not translate into reality. Repricing does not improve employee retention or firm performance. In addition, managers benefit by opportunistically timing the repricing. Due to weaknesses in corporate governance such as lack of independence and conflicts of interest, the current repricing practice seems to be at odds with the objective of shareholder wealth maximization, and at a more fundamental level, a violation of board's fiduciary duty to shareholders. We offer suggestions that mitigate the ethically undesirable effects of repricing in the wider context of prevailing corporate governance and regulatory environment. We believe that these suggestions, if properly implemented, can transform repricing from a greed-inspired evil to a valuable compensation tool to retain employees, boost their morale, and enhance stockholder wealth.

An agency-theory model of IPO management retention is presented and empirically explored. The model is based upon the differences between the investment public's and underwriters 'fears of the consequences of management entrenchment and other agency problems. The model suggests that IPO underpricing shouM be a curvilinear hump-shaped function of retention. A large-sample empirical exploration verifies the curvilinear relation.

Agency theory describes the viability of outcome and behavior contingent contracts in principal-agent transactions. This article proposes that a principal's choice between the two contract forms in a representative negotiation is constrained by the conditions that led a principal to employ an agent. Six of these conditions - expertise, emotional strain, the principal's preferred engagement strategy, zone of possible agreement, communal relationship norms, and repeated interactions between principals - are reviewed and summarized in testable propositions. Specifically, the six conditions are proposed to underscore the viability of behavior versus outcome contingent contracts in serving the principal's substantive and relationship-based interests.

This introductory chapter outlines the features of the new approach to CG that can be built by integrating the insights from the different contributions gathered in the book. Further specific theses advanced in this chapter are that the 'shareholder view' and the unabashed recommendation of pay for performance misapply agency and property right theories themselves; that CG design should be grounded in an empirically-based appreciation of preferences and motivation; that the portfolio of governance mechanisms should be enlarged to include organizational mechanisms such as negotiation, social control, and community governance; and that, contrary to common wisdom, an economic and organizational efficiency view of CG should lead to differentiated rather than homogeneous solutions, while institutional isomorphism and legitimacy may lead to inefficient convergence.

Different organizational theories clearly define critical organizational activities necessary for organizational survival. Recent attention to "hybrid" research that links organizational theory with MIS research has been proposed to lend new insights into strategic alignment of IT (Orlikowski & Barley, 2000; Zrnud, 2002). One gap still to be addressed relates to role expectations and skills required by the IT professional according to different organizational theories. Much of the literature on strategic alignment of IT emphasizes the value provided by the IT artifact or focuses on communication between IT and business management, rather than on the role of IT professionals inferred by critical survival activities outlined in different organizational theories. Motivated by organizational concerns related to the clarity and articulation of the role of Information Technology professionals in contributing to strategic alignment, our study reviews literature about the role of the information technology professional and the differences according to three organizational theories: Agency theory, Transaction Cost theory and Institutional theory. We then use bibliometrics and content analysis to analyze published research for implicit or explicit skill expectations and contributions to organizational survival and strategic alignment of IT. The goal of our study is to contribute to a better understanding of role conflict, skill expectations, and value of information technology professionals in organizations, and also contribute to a consolidation between information systems research and organizational studies.

Firms in mature or declining industries are faced with the challenge of redeploying their excess resources to new applications, and M&A strategies can be an important component of this effort. I consider two ways in which excess resources are applied to more attractive business opportunities through M&A, and I analyze these strategies through the lenses of industrial organization economics, resource-based view, evolutionary perspective and agency theory. In the redeployment strategy, firms seek attractive opportunities in related industries, using acquisitions to fill any resource deficiencies. In the consolidation strategy, firms combine with their competitors within the same industry. The resulting larger pool of resources provides greater opportunities for disposing off their under-utilized resources through the market, while enhancing their profitability. Either way, excess resources can find new applications, within the firm in the former strategy and through the market in the latter. I also discuss some implications for future research and practice.

The governance structure of public corporations is determined by the agency relationship between shareholders and managers, and the agency theory predicts that deregulation of an industry leads to governance adaptation. Deregulation of the Japanese banking business in the 1980s offers an interesting case study in this framework, as Japanese banks fell into serious solvency problems in the postderegulation 1990s. This paper investigates whether ineffective governance was responsible for the plight of Japanese banks. The sample is 384 corporations that were listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange between 1983 and 1990, which includes 59 banks. One of the findings is that bank shareholders allowed more diffuse ownership structure after deregulation, which demonstrates that the agency theory did not hold for shareholders of Japanese banks.

Agency theory starts with the assumption that people act in their own self-interest, and holds that under normal conditions, the goals, interests, and risks of two actors (principal and agent) are not identical. This means that the agent will not necessarily act according to the interests of the principal. CEO compensation is the type of control mechanism that companies employ to reduce the agency problem. This paper took 201 manufacturing companies in the year 1998 in Taiwan, and used the LISTREL 8 model to analyze the influence of company performance, scale, and board of director control over CEO compensation. The results indicate is that company performance, scale, and control by the board of directors all influence CEO compensation, with company scale the main factor, followed by company performance, and control by the board of directors. I also find that CEO compensation is higher when the board of directors' does not have effective control. Moreover, the board of directors control of a company is diminished when the CTO and chairman of the board are one person, and also when the number of internal directors is great. Conversely, the board of directors' control is increased when their ratio of stock ownership is higher. (c) 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

In one of the worst political scandals of the 1990s, a large number of members of the U.S. House of Representatives wrote checks on nonexistent balances in what has become known as the House bank scandal. Agency theory tells us that the most entrenched members of the House should be more likely to consume excessive perquisites in the form of writing more bad checks. In this paper, we employ a Tobit model to test whether more entrenched members of the House engaged in excessive writing of bad checks. Our results support the agency-theoretic interpretation and confirm that entrenched members were more likely to write a greater number of bad checks. (c) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The paper addresses the effect of technological progress on the boundaries of the firm, building on transaction cost theory and agency theory. The model incorporates four types of costs: production, coordination, management, and transaction ones. The market has lower production, but higher coordination costs, than the firm. A principal-two agents framework with adverse selection and moral hazard is adopted. It is found that technological progress in production and information technologies tends to have diametrically opposite effects on procurement. In general, progress in production technology leads to more vertical integration, whereas progress in information technology leads to more subcontracting. When technological change concerns the level of costs, its effect on procurement depends on the cost differential between the firm and the market, and on the relative importance of production and coordination costs; whereas, when technological change affects the effect or disutility of effort, its impact on procurement is unambiguous. The paper provides an explanation for the changing effect of technological progress on procurement throughout the 20th century: why it favoured vertical integration historically, and why it favours subcontracting (or has a mixed effect) today. This explanation relies on the implication of the evolution of the relative importance of production and coordination activities for the relationship between technological progress and vertical integration. The paper constitutes a bridge between contractual explanations and technological explanations of the existence and boundaries of the firm.

This review and introduction to the Special Issue on 'Strategy Research in Emerging Economies' considers the nature of theoretical contributions thus far on strategy in emerging economies. We classify the research through four strategic options: (1) firms from developed economies entering emerging economies; (2) domestic firms competing within emerging economies; (3) firms from emerging economies entering other emerging economies; and (4) firms from emerging economies entering developed economies. Among the four perspectives examined (institutional theory, transaction cost theory, resource-based theory, and agency theory), the most dominant seems to be institutional theory. Most existing studies that make a contribution blend institutional theory with one of the other three perspectives, including seven out of the eight papers included in this Special Issue. We suggest a future research agenda based around the four strategies and four theoretical perspectives. Given the relative emphasis of research so far on the first and second strategic options, we believe that there is growing scope for research that addresses the third and fourth.

Family firms are widely recognized as a major source of technological innovation and economic progress. Yet, over time, some family firms become conservative and unwilling to take the risks associated with entrepreneurial activities. Adopting a broad definition of entrepreneurial risk taking, this study uses agency theory to highlight key correlates of risk taking among 209 U.S. manufacturing family firms. The results show that family ownership and involvement promote entrepreneurship, whereas the long tenures of CEO founders have the opposite effect. These results urge managers to capitalize on the skills and talents of their family members in promoting entrepreneurship and selective venturing into new market arenas.

This paper examines whether the incidence of earnings management by UK firms depends on board monitoring. We focus on two aspects of board monitoring: the role of outside board members and the audit committee. Results indicate that the likelihood of managers making income-increasing abnormal accruals to avoid reporting losses and earnings reductions is negatively related to the proportion of outsiders on the board. We also find that the chance of abnormal accruals being large enough to turn a loss into a profit or to ensure that profit does not decline is significantly lower for firms with a high proportion of outside board members. In contrast, we find little evidence that outside directors influence income-decreasing abnormal accruals when pre-managed earnings are high. We find no evidence that the presence of an audit committee directly affects the extent of income-increasing manipulations to meet or exceed these thresholds. Neither do audit committees appear to have a direct effect on the degree of downward manipulation, when pre-managed earnings exceed thresholds by a large margin. Our findings suggest that boards contribute towards the integrity of financial statements, as predicted by agency theory. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.

This paper examines board effectiveness through an examination of the work and relationships of non-executive directors. It is based on 40 in-depth interviews with company directors, commissioned for the Higgs Review. The paper observes that research on corporate governance lacks understanding of the behavioural processes and effects of boards of directors. Whilst board structure, composition and independence condition board effectiveness it is the actual conduct of the non-executive vis-a-vis the executive that determines board effectiveness. Data about behaviour and relationships on boards suggest that traditional theoretical divisions between agency and stewardship theory, and control versus collaboration models of the board do not adequately reflect the lived experience of non-executive directors and other directors on the board. Developing accountability as a central concept in the explanation of how boards operate effectively enables the paper to both challenge the dominant grip of agency theory on governance research and support the search for theoretical pluralism and greater understanding of board processes and dynamics. Practically, the work suggests that corporate governance reform will be undermined by prescription that supports distant perceptions of board effectiveness but not the actual effectiveness of boards.

This paper argues that research in organization theory has seen a shift in orientation from paradigm-driven work to problem-driven work since the late 1980s. A number of paradigms for the study of organizations were elaborated during the mid-1970s, including transaction cost economics, resource dependence theory, organizational ecology, new institutional theory, and agency theory in financial economics. These approaches reflected the dominant trends of the large corporations of their time: increasing concentration, diversification, and bureaucratization. However, subsequent shifts in organizational boundaries, the increased use of alliances and network forms, and the expanding role of financial markets in shaping organizational decision making all make normal science driven by the internally derived questions from these paradigms less fruitful. Instead, we argue that problem-driven work that uses mechanism-based theorizing and research that takes the field rather than the organization as the unit of analysis are the most appropriate styles of organizational research under conditions of major economic change - such as our own era. This sort of work is best exemplified by various studies under the rubric of institutional theory in the past 15 years, which are reviewed here. (c) 2005 INFORMS.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in international markets. This study argues that the ownership structures of SMEs influence their proclivity to take risks and expand the scale and scope of their internationalization efforts. Data from 889 Swedish SMEs reveal that internal owners (CEOs and other senior executives) tend to be risk averse and have a lower proclivity to increase scale and scope of internationalization than external owners (venture capitalists and institutional investors). The results provide interesting insights into the behavioral change of executives regarding the scale and scope of internationalization in the presence of external ownership.

This study examines the impact of financial leverage on the firms' investment decisions using information on Canadian publicly traded companies. It shows that leverage is negatively related to investment and that this negative effect is significantly stronger for firms with low growth opportunities than those with high growth opportunities. The paper tests the robustness of these results using alternative empirical models and, in addition, uses the instrumental variable approach to deal with the endogeneity problem inherent in the relationship between leverage and investment. The results provide support to agency theories of corporate leverage, and especially the theory that leverage has a disciplining role for firms with low growth opportunities. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

To help understand how firms develop and maintain dynamic capabilities, we examine the effects of the dynamics, management, and governance of R&D and marketing resource deployments on firm-level economic performance. In a sample of technology-based entrepreneurial firms, we find that a history of increased investments in marketing is an enduring source of competitive advantage. We also find that managers' firm-specific experience positively moderates the relationship between R&D deployment intensity and economic returns. In addition, institutional ownership boosts economic returns from marketing deployments by subjecting these deployments to increased scrutiny and by sending positive signals to the market about the firm.

Property rights theory has common antecedents with contractual theories of the firm such as transaction costs and agency theories, and is yet distinct from these theories. We illustrate fundamental theoretical principles derived from these three theories by analyzing the business case of oil field unitization. Theoretical principles and application of theory to oil field unitization are each summarized. From this, it is possible to see how property rights theory is well suited to explain business situations where inefficient economic outcomes persist. Additionally, property rights theory forges new theoretical connections with other branches of organizational economics, in particular, resource-based theory.

This paper contributes to the timely debate on research into boards and their effectiveness by focusing on context, process and time, which are crucial to understanding board dynamics. It also explores key principles of board process research, and advocates the need to strengthen its theoretical and methodological foundations in order to challenge the analytically particular assumptions of agency theory. The paper concludes that there is still much more to be researched in this area and encourages work that explores variation in board process and director effectiveness in different organizational contexts, as well as seeking to go beyond the board to address their impact and effectiveness in the broader organizational and external context.

Through meta-analyses, this study reveals systematic relationships between board composition and six of the seven critical decisions examined. Interestingly, the results provide little support to agency theory's predictions on the impact of board composition on critical decisions that involve a potential conflict of interest between managers and shareholders.

We develop a principal-agent model in an entrepreneurial setting and test the model's predictions using unique data on entrepreneurial effort and wealth in privately held firms. Accounting for unobserved firm heterogeneity using instrumental-variables techniques, we find that entrepreneurial ownership shares increase with outside wealth and decrease with firm risk; effort increases with ownership; and effort increases firm performance. The magnitude of the effects in the cross-section of firms suggests that agency costs may help explain why entrepreneurs concentrate large fractions of their wealth in firm equity.

Corporate scandals, reflected in excessive management compensation and fraudulent accounts, cause great damage. Agency theory's insistence to link the compensation of managers and directors as closely as possible to firm performance is a major reason for these scandals. They cannot be overcome by improving variable pay for performance as selfish extrinsic motivation is reinforced. Based on the common pool approach to the firm, institutions are proposed, serving to raise intrinsically motivated corporate virtue. More importance is to be attributed to fixed pay and strengthening the legitimacy of authorities by procedural fairness, relational contracts, and organizational citizenship behavior.

Good governance for SMEs is critical for economic development and growth in both developed and developing economies. In this paper we focus on boards and governance in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) by investigating the role and contribution of "outside" directors in this setting. By contrasting board role theories against different types of SMEs, firms are expected to recruit "outside" board members for various reasons. Illustrated by 52 empirical studies of "outside" directors in SMEs we show how agency theory, resource based view of the firm, and resource dependence theory can be applied to understand the multiple roles that "outside" directors can play in family firms, venture capital-backed firms and other SMEs. The illustration shows that the concept "outside" director is not the same in different theories and in different empirical settings. Based on this finding, we argue for the need to have a conscious and balanced use of theories for understanding the role and contribution of "outside" directors in SMEs.

We reason that agency theory's behavioral assumptions may too closely reflect the US institutional context to explain the governance heritages that exist elsewhere. We propose that what constitutes opportunistic behavior and what can be done to limit it may vary due to differences in national background and formal institutions. We then test the validity of this nationally bounded model using historical sociology analysis of three nations whose corporate governance heritages are believed to differ (USA, Sweden, and France). Specifically, we review their political, cultural, and economic institutions to explore the different ways that their governance practices have evolved and infer causes for these historical variations.

American businesses and corporate executives are faced with a serious problem the loss of public confidence. Public criticism, increased government controls, and growing expectations for improved financial performance and accountability have accompanied this decline in trust. Traditional approaches to corporate governance, typified by agency theory and stakeholder theory, have been expensive to direct and have focused on short-term profits and organizational systems that fail to achieve desired results. We explain why the organizational governance theories are fundamentally, inadequate to build trust. We advance a conceptual framework based on stewardship theory characterized by "covenantal relationships" and argue that design of governance mechanisms using a covenantal approach is more effective in building trust in organizations. A covenantal relationship is a specialized form of a relational contract between an employee and his or her organization. We argue that regardless of incentives and control mechanisms carefully designed through contractual mechanisms, in the absence of covenantal relationships it is extremely difficult to build trust within organizations. We propose that organizations are more likely to build trust - both at the organizational level and at the interpersonal level - when they create reinforcing and integrated systems that honor implied duties of "covenantal relationships.".

This article investigates the relation between corporate governance and business ethics in the Asia-Pacific region. It draws on four examples of countries in the region (Australia, China, Singapore, and India), not because they are representative of certain regional characteristics, but as a means of reflecting on the diversity in this region. These countries display pronounced differences in terms of inter alia, historical development, cultural and social factors, legal system, corporate governance model, political system, and economic development. The complex interaction of all these considerations provides the context for corporate governance and business ethics in each of the countries. The article highlights different orientations to stakeholder management and integrity behavior in the boardroom and executives' offices. Although globalization and financial market hegemony suggests a convergent model is theoretically desirable, this research suggests that the human capacity to protect diversity and enshrine regional and local interests seems likely to inhibit rapid change.

This paper addresses how the global activities undertaken by multinational enterprises (MNEs) in international settings impact corporate governance mechanisms and accountability systems. International corporate governance and accountability research, whether from a political science, economics, finance, or accounting perspective, has thus far predominantly focused on the comparison of corporate governance schemes in different countries and on the investigation of institutional parameters that determine these schemes. Straying from this line of inquiry, this article discusses how globalization at the firm level affects governance and accountability systems at parent- and subsidiary-levels. It emphasizes how an MNE's globalization attributes such as globalization scale, foreign adaptation, global competition, and international experience influence the design of governance mechanisms such as board size, board composition, executive compensation, market discipline, interlocking directorate, ownership concentration, duality and inbreeding, as well as the design of accountability systems such as accounting information, auditing standards, and financial and non-financial disclosures. This article bases its conjectures on information processing and agency theories. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper attempts to investigate the determinants of the capital structure of a sample of 972 listed companies on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China in 2003. Various theories, namely, the trade-off, pecking order and agency theories, are deployed to explain and predict the signs and significance of each factor identified by Ragan and Zingales (1995) and Booth et al. (2001). Furthermore, we include institutional shareholdings, including state agency shareholdings, state-owned shareholdings and privately owned shareholdings, as corporate governance variables to examine the effects of corporate structure on the debt financing behaviours. As well documented, we find that profitability is negatively related to capital structure at a highly significant level. The size and risk of the firms are positively related to the debt ratio - but only in term of market value measures of capital structure. The years of the companies being listed on stock markets are positively related to capital structure, indicating the access of the firms to debt finance is more easily judged by book value. Tax is not a factor in influencing debt ratio. Ownership structure has a negative effect on the capital structure. The firms with higher institutional shareholdings tend to avoid using debt financing, a behaviour that can be explained by entrenchment effects. A further classification of the institutional shareholders reveals that, among the three groups of institutional shareholding, the state institutions, including state agency and state-owned institutions, were more averse to debt financing, particularly for state-owned institutions. There is no strong evidence indicating debt-averse behaviour by domestic institutional shareholders. (c) Springer 2006.

It has been recently noted that the trade-off between risk and incentives that agency theory predicts turns out to be rather weak. We examine predictions from agency theory on the basis of data from a data set encompassing close to 1000 Danish firms. We find that the relation between performance pay and environmental uncertainty is indeed weak. We examine the relation between delegation and environmental uncertainty, and find that this relation is confirmed. We also examine the multi-tasking agency hypothesis that as risk increases, the flexibility of agents is restricted. We fail to find support for this hypothesis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This article is about the emergence of consolidated financial statements in France at the beginning of the 1970s. French firms were already using US GAAP and not the recommendations of French standard-setters as they used to do. The article has two aims: to document the choice of American Generally Accepted Accounting Practices by French firms before 1973 and to use institutional theory in order to explain why US GAAP was adopted. The cases studied are those of Saint-Gobain (adopted GAAP in 1970), Pechiney (adopted GAAP in 1972) and Rhone-Poulenc (adopted GAAP in 1973) using archival materials, annual reports and internal documentation. We also provide a financial statement analysis. Most studies about accounting choice have been conducted under the agency theory. More recently, alternative theories like the new institutionalism in organizational theory have also been used by researchers. We feel it could be productive to explain the phenomena in the lens of institutional theory. We document the decisive role of auditors such as Price Waterhouse in the emergence of accounting practices. We also insist on the use of accounting in the transformation of corporations into conglomerates. In conclusion, our data show that the use of internationally accepted standards is not an innovation, simply an imitation. Furthermore, our cases suggest that the mimesis theory of Rene Girard subsumes institutional theory. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Agency theorists have put forth a number of internal control mechanisms that can reduce agency problems. These different mechanisms are substitutive and thus it is thought that both the board of directors and large external shareholders can influence CEO compensation. Stewardship theory challenges the presumption of self-interest of agency theory, holding that managers view themselves as stewards of their organisation. The first objective of this paper is to study the influence of the control of the board of directors and large external shareholders on CEO compensation. The second objective is to utilise both stewardship and agency theory to analyse the relationship between control mechanisms and compensation, and to see which theory is more applicable. This paper uses the LISREL model to study the influence that the control of the board of directors and external large shareholders has upon CEO compensation, with data drawn from samples of listed manufacturing companies between the years 1997 and 1999 in Taiwan. The following conclusions are reached: (1) the paper supports the viewpoint of stewardship theory whereby the CEO acts as a steward of his/her company when he/she also holds the position of chairman of the company. (2) The findings show that CEO compensation will be high when the board's control is relatively ineffective. (3) The shareholdings of the board of directors can reinforce the degree of control from the board. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Bruce, Buck and Main (2005) offer two criticisms of agency theory as a valid model of executive behaviour. First, they suggest that because researchers have failed to find a strong empirical link between executive pay and firm performance, and since this research generally rests on models derived from agency theory, then we must question the theory. Second, they suggest that agency theory is under-socialized and therefore lacks generalizability to settings where social solutions would seem to eliminate the agency problem. In our response we make three points. First, agency theory rests on an assumption of self-interest that does not necessarily reflect opportunism. Second, agency theory does not make any reference to payperformance sensitivity, and the failure of this research can be attributable to a variety of problems with the research. Third, we agree that agency theory does not explicitly recognize contextual factors, but suggest that this abstraction from context, gives agency theory greater generalizability. Finally, we review the UK and German contexts discussed by Bruce, Buck and Main to show that socialized solutions do not prevent the occurrence of agency problems. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

This paper draws on field study data to provide an examination of the condominium owner/manager relationship in the Australian tourism context. Although there has been considerable growth in tourism accommodation owned through strata-title, no research examining the somewhat idiosyncratic relationship between unit owners and resident managers has been found in the literature. The peculiar nature of the relationship underlines its significance as a context in which to apply the agency theoretical model. As Australian condominium resident unit managers provide letting and caretaker services for condominium unit owners, it appears that the relationship can be justifiably viewed as a principal-agent exchange (Mills, P.K., J. Business Res. 20 (1990) 31). The study specifically focuses on strata title condominiums located in major tourism regions. This sub-sector of the condominium management industry was chosen for study because it exhibits several key attributes distinguishing it from the non-tourist-based condominium sector. For example, two different parties represent the principal (resident owners and investor owners), also a significant proportion of a resident manager's work relates to the management of short-term holiday unit letting. In light of the particular agency relationship dynamics arising in large tourist-based condominium governance, several suggestions concerning the legal environment of the industry are provided.

This paper examines the relation between board composition and firm value in the presence of significant ownership concentration using publicly traded Canadian firms over the 1993-1997 period. The results indicate that greater board independence does not have a positive influence on firm value and that poorly performing firms increase the proportion of outside directors in subsequent periods. This may result from firms acting to appease unhappy investors by adding outside directors. However, the results also indicate that directors from financial institutions can provide monitoring benefits. Finally, the negative effect of dual class common stock on firm value is mitigated by board independence, the participation of officers from financial institutions and audit committee independence. These findings suggest that sound governance practices can enhance firm value in countries with high ownership concentration even in the presence of strong minority shareholder protection.

How and to what extent should a transnational corporation's governance structures be differentiated to satisfy varying strategic roles played by foreign subsidiaries? Drawing on an agency theory perspective, we examine the effects of agency problems in the headquarters-subsidiary relationships on the design of corporate governance in transnational corporations. We propose that corporate governance of foreign subsidiaries in a transnational corporation should be constructed in response to different levels of agency problems associated with varying strategic roles of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we postulate that differentiating governance structures for each foreign subsidiary is a key contingency requirement in order to achieve superior MNE performance as a whole.

This article brings forward the argument that the practical implementation of a corporate governance code cannot be realized by a compliance program alone. Its relevance in everyday business is determined by the moral values of the company culture. In this context, governance is defined as a company's resources and capabilities, including the moral resources, to take on responsibility for all its stakeholders. A critical discussion of the agency theory, transaction cost theory, and organization theory shows that such an approach is possible only when a company is not perceived as a maximizing machine for shareholders' interests but as an economic form of cooperation of internal and external resources and stakeholders. An empiric study on 22 European corporate governance codes shows that the predominant majority of European codes orientate themselves to stakeholders and the company. The discussion of the empirical data reveals six basic principles that determine all European corporate governance codes: shareholder rights, transparency, voting rights, regulation of remuneration, design of organizational structures, and corporate social responsibility.

Recent scandals allegedly linked to CEO compensation have brought executive compensation and perquisites to the forefront of debate about constraining executive compensation and reforming the associated corporate governance structure. We briefly describe the structure of executive compensation, and the agency theory framework that has commonly been used to conceptualize executives acting on behalf of shareholders. We detail some criticisms of executive compensation and associated ethical issues, and then discuss what previous research suggests are likely intended and unintended consequences of some widely proposed executive compensation reforms. We explicitly discuss the following recommendations for reform: require greater independence of compensation committees, require executives to hold equity in the corporation, require greater disclosure of executive compensation, increase institutional investor involvement in corporate governance (including executive compensation), and require firms to expense stock options on their income statements. We provide a brief summary discussion of ethical issues related to executive compensation, and describe possible future research. (c) Springer 2005.

This study analyzes the impact of ownership structure on innovation in the US and Japan. Agency theory is used to develop links between the distinct patterns of ownership in the US and Japan to differences in innovation. Empirical evidence shows that ownership concentration and the identity of the investors with large ownership positions affects innovation. This relationship differs across the two countries.

This study analyses family businesses' growth andinternationalisation decisions, examining if being a family firm determines differences in these strategies. According to the Resources and Capabilities Theory, family firms can have limitations for internationalisation in their financial and human resources. On the other hand, the Agency Theory and the Altruism Perspective establish that altruism in family firms can drive their foreign strategies, facilitating them. Moreover, family business generation is one characteristic, specific for family firms, that can influence their strategic decisions. An empirical analysis is developed for the Spanish Family Firms in 2001 and 2002, with the main conclusion being that we do not find predetermined limits nor advantages in the foreign growth of Spanish Family Firms, with size and second family generations being the main determinants of internationalisation.

We examine 121 reverse takeovers (RT), in which a privately held firm acquires a publicly traded firm to obtain their exchange listing. The public firms, many of which went public during the initial public offering (IPO) bubble, are generally poor performers. Their shareholders receive significant wealth gains upon announcement, suggesting that these events may provide shareholders of distressed firms a way to recover some of their investment. We observe little post-event improvement in operations or profitability, and only 46% of the sample survives two years. Thus, while reverse takeovers provide alternative means of going public, they are risky and may fail to generate long-term wealth. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Government regulation in an industry is an intermediary in the principal-agent relationship that acts as a substitute for internal governance mechanisms. We propose a model for studying how different forms of deregulation (frame-breaking, metamorphic, piecemeal, and plodding) impact variations in the speed of adaptation of internal governance mechanisms to the theoretical predictions of agency theory and resulting performance implications. We develop illustrative propositions for a set of contingencies that moderate the above relationship. How government and firms manage the deregulatory process has important economic and social consequences.

Since the papers of Basu et al. (1985) and Lal and Srinivasan (1993), marketing academics have been interested in the design and implementation of optimal compensation plans. The literature has focused on agency theory as a foundation to help describe and understand this process. Although there has been much theoretical work on this topic, empirical evidence to support this theory remains sparse. Studies by Coughlan and Narasimhan (1992) and John and Weitz (1988, 1989) have found some early evidence that supports agency theory. In this paper we revisit the issue of salesforce compensation on both theoretical and empirical fronts. On the theory side we build a game theoretic model of salesforce compensation that accounts for risk aversion on the part of both the principal and the agent. We further show that accounting for the firm size within the analytical framework yields new insights into the nature of compensation design. The results obtained from our model, while substantiating past findings, offer some new insights into the compensation design process. In particular we find that firm demographics play an important role in the design of the optimal compensation scheme. We then use two datasets collected ten years apart by the Dartnell Corporation to investigate and test hypotheses generated by our model and the extant literature. Our results show that the basic tenets of agency theory continue to hold over time and that our new theoretical hypotheses are consistent with the data. Using the two datasets we also find that inter-temporal changes in salesforce compensation coincide with the advent and adoption of new technologies. Our research thus adds to our substantive knowledge of the drivers of salesforce compensation, while adding to the theoretical structure through taking account of the possibility of principal risk aversion.

When franchisors pursue different priorities, different agency problems become relevant, which drive the franchisors' choices among various franchising organization forms. We use archival and key informant data from a multi-industry sample of 94 franchisors to examine franchisors' choices of organization forms based on their goals for growth, uniformity and local responsiveness. Our results indicate that franchisors emphasizing high growth are more likely to use multi-unit rather than single-unit franchising and, within the multi-unit franchising form, they are more likely to use area development franchising than incremental franchising. Franchisors emphasizing uniformity instead of growth are more likely to use area development franchising, but those emphasizing local responsiveness are more likely to use incremental franchising. We discuss the implications of these results for franchising research and practice. (c) 2005, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

A buy-out is a fundamental change in the structure of ownership that may affect the way employee relations develop within an organization. Little is known about the impact of buy-outs upon employee relations. This paper aims to address this gap. We focus on two main questions. First, what are the effects of a buy-out on employee relations in an organization? Second, does the national institutional context affect the impact of buy-outs on employee relations? The paper reports changes to employee relations in buy-outs in the contrasting institutional environments of the UK and the Netherlands. Overall, we find that buy-outs positively affect HR practices with increases in training, employee involvement, the number of employees and pay levels. The positive effects appear to be significantly stronger in a less institutionalized environment like the UK than in the more institutionalized environment of the Netherlands. Buy-outs raised HRM practices in the UK to a level closer to, although still below, that of Dutch buy-outs. (c) 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

In the context of agency theory (Jensen and Meckling, 1976. Journal of Financial Economics, 3, 305-360), how insider stock ownership relates to firm performance is explored in this paper. The relevant performance measure used is total factor productivity. Insiders are classified into executives, board members and blockholders so as to facilitate a detailed study. Five-year (1996-2000) panel data of 333 Taiwanese listed electronics firms are examined. It is observed that total insider ownership remains steady while the executive-to-insider holding ratio increases significantly. In terms of the effect on total factor productivity, neither the total insider ownership nor the board-to-insider holding ratio shows any influence on productivity. However, productivity first decreases then increases with the executive-to-insider holding ratio, forming a U-shaped relationship. The results indicate that stock ownership of top officers in high-tech firms should be encouraged to enhance productivity. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

This article introduces the agency theory to the field of higher education research. By applying agency theory to the inter-organisational relationship between government and higher education institutions it is possible to illustrate general problems facing control and governance in a more theoretical and analytical way. The conceptual arsenal provided by the agency theory may benefit various research settings that are related to government-higher education institution relationships. In addition to its descriptive elements agency theory also provides theoretical explanations for e.g. the establishment of quality assurance systems and performance-based funding procedures.

This paper is an exploration of the potential place, if any, for ethics in corporate governance. It begins with the influential role that agency theory has played both in the conception and reform of corporate governance. Its grounding assumption of self-interested opportunism leaves little or no room for ethics beyond what pays. This conception is then contrasted with a Foucauldian view of governance in which ethics is explored in terms of how an 'ethic' of shareholder value has been promulgated in the last decade. The third section of the paper explores the contemporaneous explosion of interest in corporate ethics and social responsibility and suggests that there is a nascent disciplinary regime being assembled which may redefine the terms of shareholder value to include environmental and social performance. What is paradoxical about both an ethics of shareholder value and corporate responsibility is that they are effective only through creating a preoccupation with the self and how the self is seen, rather than the other. The final concluding part of the paper suggests that ethics, following Levinas, should be understood in terms of sentience and the 'responsibility for my neighbour' that this assigns. Such a view of ethics refutes the individualism that agency theory takes as the essence of human nature, and Foucauldian analysis suggests is the product of disciplinary processes. Its grounding in sentience and proximity however offer it only a local role in corporate governance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper undertakes an exploratory study on determining capabilities of international franchising within East Asia. There is a need to develop a deeper understanding in franchising within East Asia as much of the franchising literature is based on the U.S. experience. Findings from this paper indicate that international franchisors use a combination of mechanisms to prevent franchisee opportunism in East Asia. They include ex-ante bonds, performance schedules and formal controls in brand management. However, the effectiveness of these mechanisms depend on the capabilities of the franchisor to negotiate a high initial franchise fee, select the right franchisee and make adaptation but still maintain brand integrity.

This study examines the business environment of Egypt, a nation at the beginning of its transition to a market economy, to determine whether national culture is associated with the use of accounting-based debt covenants in debt agreements. As a country's economy develops, agency problems occur. One method of reducing agency costs is the use of accounting-based debt covenants. While there has been extensive research on agency theory, most of this research has focused on developed nations. We examine three periods of Egyptian economic development using 140 Egyptian debt agreements. The use of accounting-based debt covenants increased significantly during each successive period of development. Proxies for each of (Hofstede, G. (1980). Culture's consequences - International differences in work-related values. Beverly Hills, London: Sage Publications) cultural dimensions are significantly different between the three periods, suggesting that national culture changes with economic development. Three of the four cultural dimensions are significant when regressed on the number of accounting-based debt covenants in debt agreements. This indicates that as a country develops, national culture is associated with the control and understanding of the business process. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we want to focus on the interactions of shareholder theory, stakeholder theory, institutional theory and agency theory in terms of corporate social responsibility. We will specifically study this issue in the context of commercial banks in the financial sector. Financial firms appear to be subject to strong technical and institutional pressures. They are also more opaque and subject to heavier regulation than their non-financial counterparts. It appears that the application of agency-based assumptions to the financial sector is inadequate in explaining corporate governance and related social responsibility practices. In this context, the structure of asymmetric information seems to be more complex and multi-dimensional. It takes place first between the depositors, the bank and the regulatory authorities; second, between the shareholders, the bank and the regulatory authorities; last, between the borrowers, the managers and the regulatory authorities. These parties also constitute the firms' stakeholders. In this respect, the state appears to be a major stakeholder and it is in a position to affect all other bank/stakeholder relations through its regulations and participation in the financial sector. These are the factors that intensify institutional pressures in this sector. The institutional embeddedness inherent in a special context is likely to affect stakeholder position and attitudes. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the conflicting nature of being a stakeholder under institutional pressures and it articulates the factors that determine the behavior of the state as a stakeholder in shaping corporate social responsibility practices of firms.

Corporate governance is importantly based on agency theory and relies on extrinsic incentives to align the interests of managers, employees and shareholders. This article argues that in view of recent corporate scandals, private governance can learn from public governance: (1) Goaloriented intrinsic motivation of agents should be supported by fixed incomes and an extensive selection process of employees; (2) Extrinsic, but non-monetary incentives (e.g. conferring orders and titles) can be used; (3) The power of actors should be restricted by a clear division of power, appropriate rules of succession and institutionalised competition for positions in firms.

This paper applies agency theory to explore the relationship between insider stock ownership and firm performance, particularly in terms of technical efficiency. Insiders are further classified into executives, outside directors, and large shareholders to conduct a detailed study. Six-year (1996-2001) panel data of 416 Taiwanese listed electronics firms are examined by the stochastic production frontier approach. It is observed that raising the executive-to-insider holding ratio first causes a decrease and then an increase in technical efficiency, forming a U-shaped relationship. However, the board-to-insider holding ratio is negatively associated with technical efficiency. The results indicate that equity ownership of top officers in high-tech firms should be encouraged to enhance firm productivity. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper shows how clear divergences arise across the EU in how executive remuneration is structured. Sharp differences also occur in the adoption of best practices in pay-setting and in the disclosure of executive pay. These divergences are broadly in line, as agency theory predicts, with blockholding and dispersed-ownership governance profiles. While the EU has recently adopted two important 2004 recommendations on executive pay, the paper argues that EU-led reforms should be undertaken with care. Harmonization should be limited and only address disclosure. Disclosure is central to the adoption of effective incentive contracts in that it can manage the particular agency costs of executive pay, across dispersed and blockholding systems, without intervening in governance choices and structures. Any other interventions in the pay process carry the risk of distorting competition and interfering with the dynamics of different ownership structures and economic contexts. (c) The Authors (2005).

A major prediction of agency theory is that there is a trade-off between risk and incentive compensation. Aggarwal and Samwick (1999) [Aggarwal, R., Samwick, A., 1999. The other side of the trade-off: the impact of risk on executive compensation. Journal of Political Economy, 107, 65-105.] directly test and find results consistent with agency theory-pay-performance sensitivity is decreasing in risk. However, Prendergast (2002, 2000) [Prendergast, C. 2002. The tenuous trade-off between risk and incentives. Journal of Political Economy 110 (5), 1071-1102; Prendergast, C. 2000. What trade-off risk and incentives? The American Economic Review 90 (2), 421-425.] offers a number of reasons why the sensitivity of pay to performance can be higher in risky environments. We use data from a sample of Internet firms for 1997-1999 to provide empirical evidence on these competing arguments regarding the relation between risk and CEO compensation. Consistent with Aggarwal and Samwick (1999), our results show that pay-performance sensitivity declines with increases in variance in a base model. After controlling for size, we find that pay-performance sensitivity is positively related to risk, consistent with the theoretical predictions in Prendergast (2002, 2000). However, sensitivity tests in later periods show that the Aggarwal and Samwick (1999) results are more robust to changes in the economic environment. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The paper aims to examine five assumptions of agency theory: that both investor and investee make rational decisions; future outcomes are predictable; both act in their own best interests; the investee has an information advantage over the investor; and the investee is work- and risk-averse. Design/methodology/approach: An agency framework is used to analyse the relationship between a venture capital investment house and one of its investees. Empirical evidence is provided on the nature of this relationship. Additional evidence of the post-investment performance of both parties is provided, to examine whether the contractual arrangements are conducive to good performance. Findings: There is general support for the assumptions of agency theory, and the framework is found to provide a useful basis for analysing the relationship between a venture capital investor and investee. Research limitations/implications: The paper uses case studies of one investor and one investee, and so is limited by data, coupled with a qualitative analysis. Further quantitative work should use a larger sample and statistical or econometric methods, to support the findings. Practical implications: The empirical evidence shows that an investor who is alert to such problems as agency theory implies may take steps to control adverse effects, e.g. through improved management accounting systems for monitoring and control. Originality/value: The paper gives evidence on the internal management practice of venture capital investors and investees, linked to publicly available performance measures. Thus it provides an insight into practice which will be of interest to investors, investees and academic researchers alike. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The 1992 National Energy Policy Act (NEPA) intensified competition in the electric utility industry by allowing nonutility generators to produce and sell power in wholesale energy markets. Congress expected NEPA to lead to improved operating efficiencies by substituting market forces for regulation. A data set that is unique to the utility industry allows us to test how and whether utility firms reallocated resources to improve efficiencies and, more important for this study, whether CEO compensation changed in accordance with agency theory predictions that CEO compensation would become more incentive-based and more equity-based in the competitive operating environment.

This paper proposes an internal management perspective of the company, as a complement to longstanding principal-agency theory, for understanding the interchange between regulator and company. It draws from a longitudinal research project on understanding the implications of regulation policy incentives for strategic control in the management of UK monopoly network utilities and the management implications of regulatory policy making. This paper reports on how two utility companies have managed regulatory objectives alongside organizational ones in electricity distribution and gas transportation and suggests a new integrative model of strategic control for understanding utility management. It concludes if regulation policies are to be effective then regulators should understand the internal management of the companies if performance targets are to be attained. (c) CIRIEC 2005.

The purpose of this paper is to examine player representation in professional sport within the context of broader changes in the global market. Following an overview of agency theory and the traditional role fulfilled by agents on behalf of players, we review how changes have impacted players and agents in professional sports. These include: * The increasing importance of endorsements. * The increasing presence of transnational agencies. * A growing allegiance for athletes toward the corporations that sponsor them. * The mobility of labour and rise of 'borderless athletes'. * The emergence of athletes whose incomes are generated as much by their marketability as their playing talent. We then discuss the implications these changes have for the player-agent relationship in terms of the traditional principal-agent relationship proposed by agency theorists, and suggest that the bond between player and agent has been eroded by agents' relationships with sponsoring corporations.

Researchers that have used agency theory predictions of monitoring and incentive alignment that focus solely on principal-agent relationships at the organizational level have been unable to rationalize the use and design of stock options within organizations. In the early 1990s, stock options were virtually free, but eventually, organizations were required to disclose the value of the options in the footnotes of their financial statements. This imperative ignited a battle between agents (and their advocates) who opposed the formal accounting of options and shareholders (and their advocates) who changed their opinions about options over time. In this article, we develop a model to explain how the varying pressures across the various stages of institutionalization cannot only explain how principals and agents are influenced by the institutional environment in making options compensation decisions, but also when and how these parties will shape institutional contexts at the field level to encourage, perpetuate, or delegitimate the stock option arrangements that these actors prefer.

This chapter investigates the impact of the firm-specific dimensions of risk suggested in the finance literature, the financial risk, operating leverage and business risk on audit fees. It is hypothesized that audit fees are related to these three dimensions of risk, size, audit complexity and a set of the agency theory based control variables. The hypothesis is empirically tested using a sample from the U.K. audit market. The results of the study show that audit fees as hypothesized are positively related to financial leverage, operating leverage and business risk of a firm and that the control variables behave according to expectations. This implies that the three dimensions of the firm-specific risk are taken into account in audit pricing decisions and should therefore be incorporated into models when investigating the audit pricing issues.

This paper analyzes the effect of strategic context on managerial compensation design, and the interactive influence on firm performance for a set of Spanish companies. Specifically, this study examines the performance implications of the fit between different managerial compensation systems and diverse firm's strategic orientations-representing various levels of managerial discretion. Based on a framework combining agency theory and managerial discretion concept, a research design with both archival and survey data is used to test hypotheses in a sample of 82 firms. The findings offer sufficient confirmation of theoretical arguments, providing extensions of this research stream for non-U.S. firms. Results show that firms benefit from the design of managerial compensation systems when they match the managerial control and risk-bearing requirements imposed by the strategic context. Specifically, risk-encouraging compensation systems are better for prospector firms-high level of managerial discretion-whereas risk-discouraging compensation systems are better for defender firms-low level of managerial discretion.

The paper offers a property rights and monitoring cost explanation for the allocation of residual income and decision rights between the carriers and truck drivers under internal governance. First, by applying the property rights theory, we argue that the structure of residual income rights depends on the importance of noncontractible (intangible) assets of the truck driver to generate residual surplus. The more important the truck driver's intangible knowledge assets, the more residual income rights should be transferred to him. Second, we controlled for the monitoring costs as an additional explanatory variable of the allocation of residual income rights. According to agency theory, the variable proportion of the driver's income should be higher where monitoring costs are higher. Third, we investigate the relationship between residual income and residual decision rights under internal governance. If the contractual relation is governed by an employment contract, residual decision and residual income rights may be substitutes because, under fiat, a certain incentive effect of the governance structure may result either from the allocation of high-powered incentives or the transfer of residual decision rights to the driver. These hypotheses were tested by using data from the Hungarian trucking industry. The data provide partial support for the hypotheses. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The impact of globalisation and worldwide competition has become glaringly apparent in China. This paper examines China's transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to competitive privatised entities. With China's move toward an open market society, the Chinese government saw the need to privatise some of the SOEs. Using Agency Theory and Ramamurti's three-tiered model of privatisation as a theoretical framework, we chronicle the transformation of six Chinese SOEs that have used advanced management systems to make themselves viable market contenders and competitive enterprises. Finally, we showcase one firm, Chongqing CHN & CHN Ceramics Co., Ltd. (C&C), a company well on its way to becoming a leader in the global ceramics market. (c) 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Elena Rocco 1. INTRODUCTION A large number of heterogeneous human relations, like transactions, delegation, teamwork, promises, are based on trust. As a consequence, different disciplines have contributed from different perspectives to the study of trust (Rousseau et al. 1998; Kramer and Tyler 1996). A shared view in this multidisciplinary debate is that is that there is no trust without risk (Deutsch 1958; Currall 1990; March and Shapiro 1987). Formal control and coordination mechanisms have been devised to reduce the amount of risk associated to trust, for example, escrow account, control procedures and hierarchical control (Thompson 1967; Mintzberg 1979). Nevertheless, these mechanisms reduce risks to the extent we can identify and predict the range of threats to trust. In the face of an unforeseeable event, either intentional or unintentional, if the trustee does not behave as the trustor would have expected to, the trust-based relation is likely to be undermined. Economic models, like the agency theory (Alchian and Demsetz 1972) and the transaction costs perspective (Williamson 1985), have focused on opportunism as the main threat to trust. Opportunistic behavior often leads to intentional actions unknown to the trustor and detrimental to his own interest (Williamson 1985; Gambetta 1988). Beyond opportunism, other elements may undermine trust. Trust may indeed be weakened by unintentional action by the trustee. For instance, the employee may act in the interest of her manager but not as he would have expected to. Similarly, tacit coordination in teams works as long as individuals can rely on each other's.... (c) Katinka Bijlsma-Frankema and Rosalinde Klein Woolthuis 2005.

The primary objective of the study is to determine whether there is a positive relationship between directors' fees with the size of the firm and performance, based on the annual report of 246 listed firms. The results indicate a weak positive relationship between directors' remuneration, corporate size (total assets) and corporate performance (operating cash flow on asset). The weak positive relationship between director fees and performance indicates that other factors, such as the director's yearly performance, may also account for the determination of the director's remuneration. The findings support the notion of agency theory and corporate governance that remunerating the top management should be based on individual and corporate performance. In contrast, other performance variables such as return on assets (ROA) and earning per share (EPS) measured indicates no statistical association.

This paper explores how firms finance their R&D projects. There are several instruments that can be used, however, due to information asymmetries and the combination of tangible and intangible returns that R&D projects generate, debt-financing is the worst alternative. The novelty of this paper is that it combines aspects of the resource-based view with those of the agency theory. This, in terms of a firm's decision making, is to consider that a firm's R&D investment is, on the one hand, partly determined by its financing resources and, on the other hand, a major determinant of its financial structure. The theoretical hypotheses are supported in the empirical study that makes use of a data sample of Spanish manufacturing firms for the period 1991-99. The main implication for managers that can be extracted from our study is that the most powerful financing incentive mechanism to stimulate R&D effort is to follow a deep pocket policy of internal funds accumulation.

In recent years there has been considerable discussion of and some movement towards, harmonisation of governance structures and processes between the EU and North America in particular. Multilateral organisations (i.e. World Bank), the USA's Sarbanes Oxley and the expansion of the EU in 2004 have all provided added impetus for a broader focus on harmonisation or convergence. But is convergence possible? Can any 'one size fits all' approach to governance be consistent with divergent national legal and cultural systems? A qualitative study of Austrian company directors is used to investigate whether the recent development of a more open economy coupled with the global capital market is generating a convergent model of director conduct. It was apparent that a stakeholder approach, where stewardship theory best explains the processes to mediate director conduct, continues to best describe the Austrian way. This contrasts with 'theory in use' in Anglo-American practice which conforms to the tenets of Agency Theory. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for sustainability management.

The problems of agency theory related to security valuation are normally discussed in the context of "owner-managers" and "outside shareholders", and/or equity-holders and debt-holders. In this paper we discuss agency problems that emerge when there is only one shareholder (and no debt), but where the shareholder is a trust with separate income and capital beneficiaries. Trust ownership of this sort is not uncommon. The agency problems emerge as the two classes of beneficiaries have claims on cash flows that occur at different times, with income beneficiaries having claims until "capital" is transferred to the capital beneficiaries. The agency problems that are discussed are dividends, risk shifting, capital structure, cost capitalisation, and investment policy. In all cases agency problems arise, and in some respects the agency problems are more pervasive than in the more "orthodox" settings. (c) 2005 New Zealand Association of Economists.

In this theoretical paper we are investigating the important question of why, in the face of strong evidence that mergers and acquisitions (M&As) do not generate returns for acquiring company shareholders, CEOs continue to pursue these strategies. Drawing on a variety of theoretical perspectives, we argue that the firm's agents (the CEO and executives) and M&A promoters (investment bankers, lawyers and other advisors) have developed non-efficiency based relationships in the context of increased competitive pressures and a crisis in corporate ethics. The key theoretical point is that the nexus between CEOs, professional advisors and boards provides a more compelling explanation for the observed merger preference phenomenon than either the agency problem or the promoter effect on their own. Implications of the model for practice, research and theory building are discussed. (c) 2005 Yoser Gadhoum.

The purpose of this article is to provide an explanation for the contradictory evidence in the literature regarding the performance of family-owned firms. The article suggests that most of the research fails to clearly describe the "family effect" on organizational performance. The "family effect," based on agency theory and the resource-based view of the firm, is described and propositions are generated that examine the relationship between families and organizational performance. Implications for theory and research are also discussed. (c) 2006 Family Firm Institute, Inc.

Agency theories predict that the value of corporate cash holdings is less in countries with poor investor protection because of the greater ability of controlling shareholders to extract private benefits from cash holdings in such countries. Using various specifications of the valuation regressions of Fama and French (1998), we find that the relation between cash holdings and firm value is much weaker in countries with poor investor protection than in other countries. In further support of the importance of agency theories, the relation between dividends and firm value is weaker in countries with stronger investor protection.

This article seeks to link the domains of corporate governance, investment policies, competitive asymmetries, and sustainable capabilities. Conditions such as concentrated ownership, lengthy tenures, and profound business expertise give some family-controlled business (FCB) owners the discretion, incentive, knowledge, and ultimately, the resources to invest deeply in the future of the firm. These long-term investments accrue from particular governance conditions and engender competitive asymmetries - organizational qualities that are hard for other firms to copy, and thus, if tied to the value chain, create capabilities that are sustainable. Investments in staff and training, e.g., create tacit knowledge and preserve it within the firm. Investments in enduring relationships with partners enhance access to resources and free firms to focus on core competencies. And devotion to a compelling mission dedicates most of these investments to a core competency. When such investments are farsighted, orchestrated, and ongoing, capabilities will tend to evolve in a cumulative trajectory, making them doubly hard to imitate and thereby extending competitive advantage. Arguments are supported by making reference to the literature on corporate governance and agency theory and to emerging research on FCBs. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Corporate governance theory predicts that leverage affects agency costs and thereby influences firm performance. We propose a new approach to test this theory using profit efficiency, or how close a firm's profits are to the benchmark of a best-practice firm facing the same exogenous conditions. We are also the first to employ a simultaneous-equations model that accounts for reverse causality from performance to capital structure. We find that data on the US banking industry are consistent with the theory, and the results are statistically significant, economically significant, and robust.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Corporate social performance (CSP) is increasingly viewed as an important business outcome by researchers, investors, and society as a whole. Furthermore, empirical research indicates that CSP is positively related to corporate financial performance. These considerations lead to the question of whether CEO pay is properly structured to provide incentive to the CEO to improve firm CSP. In a sample of 313 firms, the authors found that a short-term CEO pay focus was negatively related to CSP, whereas a long-term focus was positively related to CSP. Implications of these results for future research and CEO pay design are presented. (c) 2006 Southern Management Association. All rights reserved.

Agency theory suggests that the interests of opportunistic, self-interested agents conflict with those of principals. Stewardship theory suggests instead that executives' interests are aligned with company interests and that executives are thus more intrinsically motivated than agency theory implies. This study develops hypotheses regarding the psychological and situational factors that affect the applicability of each theory to executive compensation. I tested hypotheses using a unique data set of 1,238 executives from 528 private companies. Results suggest significant differences between founder-stewards and nonfounder agents that diminish with company growth, and significant effects of equity ownership and outside rounds of financing.

Prior research on listed companies in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore during and before the 1997 financial crisis has reported a significant association between ownership structure and the extent of voluntary disclosure in annual reports. We examine data for Malaysia after the 1997 financial crisis to assess whether the regulatory reaction to the crisis increased the awareness of disclosure as a tool of corporate governance and reduced the influence of insider domination on voluntary disclosure. We contrast director ownership and government ownership as determinants of voluntary disclosure in Malaysian company annual reports. Additionally, we include consideration of proprietary costs by testing whether industry competitiveness has an impact on voluntary disclosure. We find that director ownership is significantly associated with the extent of voluntary disclosure while government ownership, new governance initiatives and industry competitiveness are not significant in pointing companies towards greater transparency. We conclude that, despite the upheaval of the economic crisis, traditional influences of director ownership and family domination of the board outweigh the effect of government-backed accountability initiatives in determining the extent of voluntary disclosure.

Although agency theory suggests that firms should index executive compensation to remove market-wide effects (i.e., RPE), there is little evidence to support this theory. Oyer (2004, Journal of Finance 59, 1619-1649) posits that an absence of RPE is optimal if the CEO's reservation wages from outside employment opportunities vary with the economy's fortunes. We directly test and find support for Oyer's (2004) theory. We argue that the CEO's outside opportunities depend on his talent, as proxied by the CEO's financial press visibility and his firm's industry-adjusted ROA. Our results are robust to alternate explanations such as managerial skimming, oligopoly, and asymmetric benchmarking.

We draw on the concept of community-level social capital and apply it to the situation of a family-controlled public corporation. While traditional agency theory argues that agency costs are minimized in a family-controlled business (FCB) due to an improved alignment of owner and manager interests, we argue instead that FCBs endure additional agency costs uniquely related to the family firm organizational structure. To mitigate these additional costs, we propose that FCBs use board interlocks to build and maintain community-level social capital. That is, the intercorporate network of FCBs generates shared understandings, values, problem solving techniques, and approaches to dealing with family issues. Further, the network generates a level of social support for family business owners and managers grappling with challenges endemic to family control of public corporations. We generate a number of propositions that can be used in future research to test the theory developed here. We conclude with the assertion that the community-level social capital generated by the network of FCBs is an important reason for the survival and persistence of individual family firms, despite the existence of additional family-related costs.

In this study, an attempt is made to test the validity of theories employed in the literature to explain variation in the extent of corporate voluntary disclosure within the corporate social disclosure context. The annual reports of 21 out of the 22 companies listed on the Doha Stock Exchange in Qatar were used as a basis for the study. Variations in corporate social disclosure by the sampled Qatari companies are found to be associated with firm size measured by the firm's market capitalisation, business risk measured by leverage and corporate growth. The outcome of the study lends partial support to agency theory, political economy theory, legitimacy theory, stakeholder theory as well as the accountability approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The board of directors is regarded as one of the most imperative governance mechanisms in small and medium-sized family firms. Empirical studies examining both the roles these boards fulfil in a family business context, as well as evaluating the CEO's perceived importance of these roles, are scarce. Founded by a range of conceptual and multi-theoretical board role definitions, this paper contributes to the literature by empirically determining board roles. Furthermore, the importance of these board roles and differences between the board's performance and perceived importance are assessed. The results show it is indispensable to differentiate between two aggregated roles that boards in small and medium-sized family firms perform: control and service. The control role is predominantly based on agency theory, whereas the service role includes multiple theoretical perspectives. The CEOs of the family firms perceive the service role of the board as most important. However, in order to direct succession and to compensate for the owner/manager's altruistic behaviour, the board's control role should not be neglected. The acknowledgement of these two aggregated board roles and their importance may enhance future research on board roles within specific contexts. (c) 2006 Blaekwell Publishing Ltd.

A study of 439 franchisors was conducted to identify factors influencing changes in their propensity to franchise. Consistent with agency theory, franchisors with wide multinational scope were increasing their proportion of franchised outlets whereas franchisors with large outlets were emphasizing firm ownership. As predicted by resource scarcity theory, franchisors were decreasing their proportion franchised as they grew in size, although most of the decrease occurred while firms were relatively small. In contrast to resource scarcity theory, franchisors increased their proportion franchised over time. Key implications are that both agency and resource scarcity theories are needed to explain franchising, but perhaps future research should look beyond resource scarcities toward resource-based capabilities to better explain franchising decisions.

This paper contributes to the agency theory literature by identifying relations between family control and corporate governance structure. Emerging literature supports the notion that family control creates strong incentives that have potentially competing influences on the manner in, and extent to, which internal corporate governance mechanisms are utilized. A sample of 100 listed companies (evenly divided between family and nonfamily firms) is used to test the hypotheses that corporate governance structures are different between family and nonfamily firms; and that family firms adopt optimal corporate governance structures. This research finds evidence that suggests that family firms utilize substantially different corporate governance structures from nonfamily firms and that these differences lead to performance differentials. Indeed, results suggest that family control creates, rather than negates, agency costs and future research may be well rewarded by pursuing this latter notion further.

This article provides an overview of the literature on nonprofit principal-agent relationships. It depicts the nature of agency theory and stewardship theory, analyzes the origin of their struggle within the nonprofit structure, and marks directions for a conciliatory approach. We open with an introduction to agency theory and discuss the two main components of its mathematical branch. We thereby contrast it with stewardship theory and elaborate on the arguments that can affect the position of nonprofit principal-agent relationships on the stewardship-agency axis. Analysis of the existing literature points to a lack of consensus as to which theory should be applied. We argue that the division of nonprofit principalagent relationships into board-manager and manageremployee interactions may help to clarify the balance between agency theory and stewardship theory and may lead to the establishment of a strongly founded theory on nonprofit principal-agent relationships. We close with a discussion of how this article may prove valuable to nonprofit policymakers and other empirical researchers. (c) Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The objective of a properly designed executive compensation package is to attract, retain, and motivate CEOs and senior management. The standard economic approach for understanding executive pay is the principal-agent model. This paper documents the changes in executive pay and incentives in U.S. firms between 1993 and 2003. We consider reasons for these transformations, including agency theory, changes in the managerial labor markets, shifts in firm strategy, and theories concerning managerial power. We show that boards and compensation committees have become more independent over time. In addition, we demonstrate that compensation committees containing affiliated directors do not set greater pay or fewer incentives.

Despite the fact that several event studies have investigated the market's reaction to information technology (IT) investment announcements, little is known about how specific transactional risks influence the market value of a firm. This study examines stock market data to assess investors' responses to various transactional risks associated with IT outsourcing. More specifically, we develop and test several hypotheses to understand how transactional risks that arise due to a range of factors (i.e., the size of outsourcing contracts, difficulties in performance monitoring, asset specificity of IT resources, vendor capability, and the lack of cultural similarity between client and vendor firms) influence investors' reactions to IT outsourcing announcements. Our results indicate that most of these factors indeed significantly influence investors' perceptions of the risks involved in IT outsourcing. We discuss these findings in a larger organizational context and offer implications for both research and practice. In particular, our study offers a theoretical rationale for why negative reactions to IT outsourcing announcements may occur, while providing practitioners with several means by which they can increase the informational value of outsourcing arrangements.

This paper examines the corporate financing behaviour of listed companies in the People's Republic of China. Our results suggest that some determinants of firm leverage (e.g., size, asset tangibility, growth opportunities and profitability) commonly cited in studies on developed economies also appear to be important in China. In particular, the positive relationships that firm size and asset tangibility have with firm leverage are consistent with the predictions of the static trade-off capital structure model. However, these commonly quoted determinants function in a way different from that reported in developing countries. Moreover, we do not find that State ownership, legal person ownership and foreign ownership have important influences on the capital structure choices of Chinese firms. Given the tight regulatory control over equity issues and acute owner-manager incentive conflicts in State-owned firms, we also hypothesise, and find evidence to support, that Chinese firms have built-in incentives for raising equity. This provides one explanation of the negative effect of profitability on firm leverage and shows that some of the unique Chinese institutional features do help shape corporate financing behaviour.

Prior research over several decades has catalogued many positive motives underlying firms' decisions to engage in joint ventures and other forms of alliances. In this empirical analysis, we investigate whether agency problems brought about by the separation of ownership and control also stimulate the development of firms' joint venture portfolios. By focusing on joint ventures, as opposed to diversification in general or acquisitions, we address the recent debate on agency theory's domain. Results from a sample of U.S. manufacturing firms' alliance portfolios offer supporting evidence, and comparable findings are obtained for international and domestic joint ventures. Agency hazards are also found to bring about extensions of firms' nonequity alliance portfolios in both the international and domestic settings. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This article assesses the corporate governance-related antecedents of nomination committee adoption, and the impact of nomination committees' existence and their composition on board independence and board demographic diversity. We conducted a longitudinal study of board composition amongst 210 Swiss public companies from January 2001 through December 2003, a period during which the Swiss (Stock) Exchange (SWX) introduced new corporate governance-related disclosure guidelines. We find firms with nomination committees are more likely to have a higher number of independent and foreign directors, but not more likely to have a higher number of female board members. Further, the existence of nomination committees is associated with a higher degree of nationality diversity but is not related to board educational diversity. We also find that nomination committee composition matters in the nomination of independent and foreign, but not of female directors. Our results suggest that understanding different board roles and composition require a multi-theoretical approach, and that agency theory, resource-dependence theory and group effectiveness theory help to explain different aspects of board composition and effectiveness. Finally, the article discusses the concept of diversity and appropriate ways to study diversity in a boardroom context. (c) Springer 2006.

This study investigated the tenure of CEOs in a sample of 304 listed companies in Taiwan; 63 firms were family controlled, 241 were not. The results show that CEO turnover is significantly lower in family firms and its relationship to corporate performance is negative. CEO ownership and board ownership are not significant in explaining the length of family CEO tenure. These findings imply that family boards can still effectively replace the CEO despite relatively low ownership. From the ownership structure perspective, this study suggested that the agency theory is applicable for nonfamily firms in Taiwan, but unsuitable for family firms.

Purpose - This study seeks to examine the influence of board independence, CEO duality and ownership structure on the firm financial distressed status using a sample of distressed companies and a matched-pair sample of non-distressed companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia. Design/methodology/ approach - This study utilized publicly available data from annual reports of a sample of 86 non-finance distressed firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia and a sample of matched 86 non-distressed firms for a period covering the 1999-2001 financial years. Findings - Board independence and CEO duality are not associated with financial distressed status. Management and non-executive directors' interests are associated negatively with financial distress. A negative association is also documented for outside blockholders. The evidence also supports the contention that ownership by non-executive directors and outside blockholders effectively increases their incentives to monitor management in ensuring their wealth in the firms is intact. Research limitations/implications - One limitation of this research is that it relies on publicly available data and agency theory. Future research could apply other theories, such as resource dependency and stewardship. Use of process-oriented data could also improve the findings. Practical implications - Independent directors need to undergo training to help them improve and be aware of their responsibilities. Originality/value - This paper offers evidence on the extent to which distress is associated with corporate governance from a developing country. The paper should be of interest to the regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Grounded in agency theory, this study investigates how the strength of shareholder rights influences the extent of firm diversification and the excess value attributable to diversification. The empirical evidence reveals that the strength of shareholder rights is inversely related to the probability to diversify. Furthermore, firms where shareholder rights are more suppressed by restrictive corporate governance suffer a deeper diversification discount. Specifically, we document a 1.1-1.4% decline in firm value for each additional governance provision imposed on shareholders. An explicit distinction is made between global and industrial diversification. Our results support agency theory as an explanation for the value reduction in diversified firms. The evidence in favor of agency theory appears to be more pronounced for industrial diversification than for global diversification. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite theoretical developments in recent years, our understanding of corporate capital structure remains incomplete. Prior empirical research has been dominated by archival regression studies which are limited in their ability to fully reflect the diversity found in practice. The present paper reports on a comprehensive survey of corporate financing decision-making in UK listed companies. A key finding is that firms are heterogeneous in their capital structure policies. About half of the firms seek to maintain a target debt level, consistent with trade-off theory, but 60% claim to follow a financing hierarchy, consistent with pecking order theory. These two theories are not viewed by respondents as either mutually exclusive or exhaustive. Many of the theoretical determinants of debt levels are widely accepted by respondents, in particular the importance of interest tax shield, financial distress, agency costs and also, at least implicitly, information asymmetry. Results also indicate that cross-country institutional differences have a significant, impact on financial decisions. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Alternative explanations of franchising offer contrasting predictions as to how the proportion of franchised outlets changes as franchisors age. We propose that two dominant views - resource-scarcity and agency theory - can be integrated by delineating when each is most relevant. Data from 102 franchisors over a 21-year period suggest that resource-scarcity considerations take precedence when franchisors are young, but that agency considerations prevail as franchisors age. Thus, the proportion franchised exhibits a cubic pattern as franchisors age - increasing rapidly at first, decreasing, and then increasing again. Future researchers and practitioners alike can benefit from understanding how the relative influences of resource and agency considerations shift over time. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This article discusses agency problems in sport organizations in which the same individuals are involved in both the management and control of decision making. We focus our analysis on the case of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by reviewing the behavior of selected IOC members with regard to the bidding process for the Olympic Games and the resulting reform attempts made by the IOC in an effort to address issues of corruption. After a review of examples of corrupt behavior on the part of IOC members, agency theory is introduced to discuss IOC reforms and provide some suggestions for future reform. We propose incorporating other stakeholders (in addition to the IOC members), such as corporate partners, media conglomerates, and other members of the Olympic movement (e.g., athletes, coaches, officials), into management and control functions. More specifically, it is suggested that these stakeholders comprise a board that oversees the operations of the IOC (similar to the IOC's current executive committee) and be given the ability to remove and/or sanction IOC members who act self-interestedly to the detriment of the Olympic movement. Thus, by delegating the control function of decision making to a board and the management function to internal agents, greater accountability for all organization members can be achieved.

Purpose - To improve the understanding of the inter-organizational dynamics of the dyadic relationships between a buyer and provider of logistics services (TPL dyads). Design/methodology/approach - Analyzes the preparation, implementation, and operation of a particular case of third party logistics (TPL) arrangements. Based on a single case study of a dyadic relationship, the paper confronts the static view of the transaction cost approach and the agency theory on "governance structures" and "contracts" by showing how "relationship governance" emerges and develops over time. Findings - TPL dyads are subject to both controllable and non-controllable forces of change, which may not always have a positive effect on the logistics performance or the relationship itself. Inter-organizational dynamics not only relate to learning, competence development, or adaptation, as suggested by other studies, but also to how the dyadic relationships are governed. As the dyad accumulates experience over time, changes will occur in the balance between the two parties in terms of goal congruence and risk preferences, which has a strong influence on the nature of contracts and other safeguards governing the relationship. Similarly, explanatory power of theories applicable to inter-organizational settings may vary as relationships emerge and develop over time. Focus on core competencies as the logic of outsourcing is followed by a period characterized by a principal-agent relationship. To ensure further prosperity of the relationship, the two companies must direct their efforts towards the logic of the network approach. Originality/value - Contributes to a cross-disciplinary fertilization of the SCM field, in particular inter-organizational relationships. (c) 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Challenging the dominant economic agency theory of corporate governance with a new discourse drawn from institutional theory, the paper analyses how management accounting is implicated in corporate governance. The proposed institutional theory of agency links the micro-institutions of the organization that are informed by the practices of management accounting with external institutional players and stakeholders. The paper identifies emerging narratives in which the management accounting profession has recognised a distinctive, post-Enron set of sensibilities. Although techniques drawn from strategic management accounting can be adapted to embed better corporate governance practices, the institutional theory of agency identifies tensions between the heroic CEO narrative and the routinization of strategy implicit in strategic management accounting.

This chapter reviews the interorganizational accounting literature. There are two different types of interorganizational settings that have been covered within the literature: dyadic relationships between two collaborating companies and networks where a relationship is seen as embedded in a set of relationships. The emphasis on intensive and long-term relationships can be associated with a number of interorganizational accounting practices, such as open-book accounting, target costing, interorganizational cost management, value-chain accounting, integrated information systems, total cost of ownership, nonfinancial measurement, and informal control mechanisms. Published papers within the literature have applied a mixture of theoretical models, such as transaction cost economics, agency theory, actor network theory, and the industrial-network approach.

This chapter reviews agency theory and its application to management accounting issues. I begin by explaining how agency models are formulated to capture incentive problems caused by moral hazard and adverse selection problems, and discuss the reasons why agency theory models are difficult to solve. I then review agency theory results regarding the properties that make performance measures valuable in a contracting setting and the optimal shape of contracts. I also review the literature on communication, including models where the revelation principle does not apply, so that nontruthful reporting and earnings management can take place. I then discuss multiperiod agency models, which are critical for comparing different accrual-accounting-based measures of performance in motivating investment behavior. The chapter ends by discussing common misconceptions regarding agency theory models and discussing areas for future research. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) traditionally have been governed by the Communist Party. Privatization has brought greater numbers of investors who have a stake and demand a voice in how SOEs are managed. Three traditional governance perspectives are agency theory, resource dependence, and institutional theory, but China's transition introduces several additional governance approaches. Are "capitalism with Chinese characteristics" and "bureaucratic entrepreneurialism" paradoxes? Based on initial interviews of SOE executives, a survey of top managers and board chairs of listed companies, and subsequent interviews and observations in select case companies, this paper develop a taxonomy of SOE governance that now exists in China. Two of the approaches represent the extremes of the old state-centered regimes and the new shareholder-centered regimes. Considering China's historical and cultural contexts coupled with its current stage of economic transition, two additional approaches to corporate governance are to have a vacuum as neither the state nor shareholders dominate or - in unique contrast to other countries - a hybrid of both.

This paper investigates the impact of M&As on bidder (CEO and other) executive compensation employing a unique sample of 100 completed bids in the UK over the 1998-2001 period. Our findings indicate that less independent and larger boards award CEOs significantly higher bonuses and salary following M&A completion both for the full sample and for the UK and US sub-samples. UK CEOs and executives are rewarded more for the effort exerted in accomplishing intra-industry or large mergers than for diversifying or small mergers and their cash pay is unaffected by other measures of their managerial skill or performance. US bidders are rewarded at higher levels than their UK counterparts and their remuneration is related only to measures of CEO dominance over the board of directors. Overall our findings offer support for the managerial power rather than the agency theory perspective on managerial compensation.

This article examines contractual protection of unsecured financial creditors in US credit markets. Borrowers and lenders in the United States contract against a minimal legal background that imposes the burden of protection on the lender. A working, constantly updated, set of contractual protections has emerged in response. But actual use of available contractual technology varies widely, depending on the level of risk and the institutional context. The credit markets sort borrowers according to the degree of the risk of financial distress, imposing substantial constraints only on the borrowers with the most dangerous incentives. At the same time, the contracting practice is sticky and lumpy, never quite managing to conform to the predictions of first generation agency theory. Levels of protection vary with institutional contexts. Exhaustive contracts providing something approaching complete protection against agency costs prove feasible only in relational contexts conducive to ongoing renegotiation over time due to small numbers of lenders operating under reputational constraints. The public bond markets do not hold out such a process context, and accordingly shut out the riskiest borrowers. The larger, less risky firms that do gain access to the bond markets borrow under contracts offering incomplete protection, with the level of protection roughly correlating to the borrower's risk level. This leaves bondholders confronting a residuum of agency costs and relying on secondary protections like monitoring, exit, diversification, and hedging. This has worked reasonably well in practice, subject to an historical exception concerning the risk of high-leverage restructuring. The bond markets searched for two decades for a stable solution to this problem, finally settling on across-the-board contractual protection only in recent years. (c) 2006 T.M.C. Asser Press.

This chapter summarizes empirical archival accounting research in management accounting that is based on economic theory and uses health care settings. Three perspectives are investigated: (1) production cost economics, including cost structure, cost behavior, cost drivers, the design of cost allocation systems, and the appropriate level of cost aggregation; (2) agency theory, including incentives to bias information or shift costs, the relation between benchmark disclosure and cost containment, and issues pertaining to compensation contracts and performance evaluation; and (3) industrial economics, including the effects of competition and mergers on accounting systems and costs, and capital budgeting responses to regulation.

This research analyzes whether variable compensation is designed as an economically rational incentive to increase organizational performance, or whether it also responds to other factors such as the search for legitimacy. A case study demonstrates how the design of the variable compensation system, at both managerial and lower levels, takes into account the company's adoption of popular management practices that increase its legitimacy but not necessarily its performance.The results show that,in the design of their compensation policies, organizations do not always seek financial objectives, as agency theory maintains, but often have other social objectives such as the search for legitimacy, as institutional theory suggests. The management of incentives not only is used to align the interests of principal and agent, but also has a symbolic character, insofar as it signals that the company belongs to a particular social context.

Consistent with predictions of agency theory, we find direct evidence that executive stock option grants have value implications for firm performance. This inference is drawn from evaluation of various motivations for the use of such grants in executive compensation: value enhancement, risk taking, tax benefit, signaling and cash conservation. We find consistent evidence for the value enhancement motivation to reduce agency costs. As well, they signal for positive price sensitive information. Our results reject the tax benefit and cash conservation motivations. This finding is robust after controlling for the endogenous character of executive stock option grants and other equity-based grants. (c) Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006.

Women corporate inside (executive) directors constitute an elite minority of leaders of large corporations. This study examines the characteristics of CEOs and boards of Fortune 1000 firms that had women who held the dual leadership positions of corporate director and executive officer in 1998 in order to determine whether firms with women insiders had substantially different characteristics than firms without. We find that compared with firms without women inside directors, firms with women inside directors were characterized by CEOs with longer board tenure, more family ties, and fewer director interlocks, and by boards that were larger, with more insiders, and that utilize a management Chair of the board. Corporate governance implications are drawn for the presence of women at the top of the executive hierarchy.

This paper investigates the effects of investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board of directors on their judgments. I hypothesize that investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board will be negatively related to their judgments of investment risk and positively related to the amount they are willing to invest. I also hypothesize that the association between effectiveness of the board and investment judgments will be moderated by investor type such that professional investors will be less conservative than non-professional investors. Forty non-professional investors and 33 professional investors participated in the experiment. Generally, the results of the study are consistent with the hypothesized effects. The results suggest that even in the context of sound financial performance, investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board are a key determinant of their investment judgments. This association is moderated by investor type and suggests professional investors are less conservative than non-professional investors. Such evidence is consistent with agency theory, "use of the house money" hypothesis and recent anecdotal scandals involving professional investors. Overall, the results provide evidence that investors are more confident in firms with effective corporate boards and support regulatory reforms strengthening corporate boards. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

As the debate over appropriate compensation disclosure continues, some firms have volunteered to recognize stock option costs within their income statements. On the one hand, stock option expensing can significantly enhance the legitimacy of the organization and restore shareholders' confidence in corporate governance practices. On the other hand, expensing stock options could decrease firm earnings, leading to unfavorable comparisons to non-expensing firms. Our logit analysis of 402 S&P firms lends partial support to agency theory explanations for stock option expensing; these results depend on the costs associated with expensing. We find stronger support for the institutional theory perspective that mimetic pressures significantly increase the likelihood that firms will expense stock options, independent of the cost. Our findings have important governance implications, suggesting a more complex model of compensation disclosure in which social pressures dominate voluntary compensation disclosure decisions.

Governance of public corporations in the United States has operated under the agency model with regulatory strengthening since the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. With this foundation in place, boards are empowered to utilise their power and influence and can effectively monitor the actions of management, intervening where necessary. In effect, the rules of engagement embodied in the structure and the law guide interactions and empowerment. The governance model of the mutual funds industry, representing over 8 trillion dollars, is often viewed as a mirror of the corporate world, but upon closer analysis is found to have significant structural differences that dilute the authority of directors. The two models are compared and analysed with recommendations made to strengthen the oversight of mutual funds. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Researchers have questioned whether the new knowledge economy is fundamentally different from the social and economic contexts of the 19th and 20th centuries (Webster, 2002). Some argue that classic economic theories still apply with equal relevance; while others claim that we are in the midst of profound changes and thus, new perspectives are needed (Whittaker, 1995; Wigand et al., 1997). This paper examines how one such classic theory; agency theory (developed by Jensen and Meckling, 1973) can be expanded to explain emerging practices in today's knowledge economy and, in so doing, explicates some apparent paradoxes with respect to ERP systems and KM (knowledge management).

Two of the most widely tested predictions of agency theory are that there exists a negative association between an agent's pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) and the risk of output, and that PPS enhances performance. Empirical evidence has been mixed. This paper proposes a new utility function and develops a model that introduces a "wealth effect" and also allows the agent to control the (idiosyncratic) risk of output. When risk is endogenous, the paper shows that the two predictions may not hold. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on agency theory [Jensen and Meckling: 1976, Journal of Financial Economics 3: 305-360] how managerial stock ownership affects the survival of initial public offerings (IPOs) is explored in this paper. A sample of 560 IPOs listed in Taiwan is examined using the accelerated failure time model, a survival analysis technique. Insiders, the broad definition of management, are further classified into top officers and outside directors to conduct a detailed study. It is observed that the survival time of IPOs first decreases and then increases with the percentage of total insider ownership at the time of offering, forming a U-shaped relationship. Additionally, the survival time is positively affected by the officer-to-insider holding ratio. The results suggest that equity stake owned by management, particularly by top officers, of an IPO firm should be encouraged in order to reduce agency cost, and thus enhance firm survivability in the aftermarket.

Purpose - The paper seeks to explain the collaborative intent, trust development, and conflict resolution in a headquarters-subsidiary relationship in a new product launch context in an emerging market. Design/methodology/ approach - Grounded theory development is employed through personal interviews with senior executives of selected multinational firms operating in Turkey. Findings - A major challenge in collaboration is convincing both parties to the dyad that the expertise of the other party is essential for effective collaboration. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based solely on looking at the subsidiary side of the subsidiary-HQ dyad in a single country, which limits their generalizability. Since we did not interview the HQ side of this dyad, speculations made about the possible reactions of HQ personnel to subsidiary actions must be interpreted with caution. Practical implications - The perceptions of both parties play a far more important role than the facts or perceptions of just one party when it comes to relationships and conflict resolution. Both parties need to pay more attention to the possible causes of means incongruence and take perception gaps and the other side's needs and expertise into account when approaching collaboration and conflict resolution. Originality/value - Agency theory is extended to a multinational firm-subsidiary context in order to suggest mechanisms for resolving conflict through increased communication, greater trust in each other's capabilities, and greater collaboration in meeting common challenges. A diagnostic and prescriptive framework and mechanisms are also offered through which disruptive conflict can be transformed into functional conflict and collaboration.

The results showed that the level of institutional ownership in a year was negatively associated with the subsequent year's profitability, as measured by return on equity and return on assets. Increased insider ownership in a given year was followed by decreased debt-to-equity ratio in the next year. Agency theory and financial control theory were discussed.

The primary purpose of this chapter is to present descriptive real-life case studies of different offshore-outsourced custom software development projects (that the author has actually worked for). The first case study discusses the practical issues in two fixedterm/fixed-price custom software development projects that were offshore-outsourced. The second case study discusses the practical issues in the offshore-outsourcing of a time and materials custom software development project to multiple vendors, which involved simultaneous insourcing, onshore-outsourcing and offshore-outsourcing. Furthermore, the observations and issues from these case studies are analyzed by comparing them with the paradigms of socio-economic theories that have been adopted extensively in the academic IS outsourcing literature (namely the agency theory, transaction cost theory, innovation diffusion theory, social exchange theory, and power-politics theory).

I argue and found that the effectiveness of a firm's monitoring mechanisms to prevent managerial opportunism in acquisitions becomes more important under high environmental complexity and/or dynamism because of the increased information asymmetry between investors and top executives under these conditions. I also found that increased monitoring under non-complex and/or stable environments may be viewed negatively by investors, and that symbolic information about governance arrangements affects investors' evaluations of managerial opportunism in acquisitions. The results highlight the need for more research on factors that influence the explanatory power of agency theory. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Although agency theory purportedly applies to a very broad range of organizations and suggests strategies for governing ali types of workers, very little agency theory research has involved professional organizations. Such research is needed to support generalizing agency theory's predictions to professional organizations and to guide managers in professional firms as they make decisions about their firms' governance structures. Furthermore, although professional organizations increasingly use contract professionals to provide services to clients, there has been very little research examining the governance of contract professionals. Because professionals who work on a contract basis have a different relationship with organizations than do employees or partners, agency theory suggests that professional organizations would govern them differently. This study examines whether one important type of professi onal organization, medical groups, use stronger monitoring and incentive mechanisms to govern contract physicians than they use with member physicians. We final no differences in the monitoring mechanisms used (collecting information about or requiring ratification of the physicians' decisions), but medical groups do use more incentive compensation with contract professionals when the medical group is paid by capitation. Overall, our results are not what we would have expected based on agency theory. We discuss the implications of our results for agency theory and for the governance of contract professionals, and highlight the need for further research in this area.

Today, the global economy is undergoing some dramatic changes in the organisation of the workplace and the manner in which employees are paid. The growing use of teams in the workplace has led to an increasing number of incentive systems designed to motivate and increase team performance. As a field aiming to develop and unleash human expertise for the purposes of improving performance, Human Resources heavily utilises the workteam method as one of its practice tools. Agency theory further provides a dimension in understanding the dynamics of team-based compensation. Copyright (c) 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The paper further examines how the roles of "principals" and "agents" complicate the change and improvement processes and experience, and challenge the role of O.D. professionals. This paper contributes to our understanding of why, even with what appear to be the best of intentions on all sides, the principals and agents in organizations may interact to cause failure and outlines the implications of this dynamic process within the organization.

This paper compares corporate governance principles in the U.S., UK, and Germany. The U.S. and UK represent shareholder models of ownership and control whereas in Germany a stakeholder approach to corporate governance provides greater input for creditors, employees and other groups affected by corporate decision making. Recent changes in the U.S. and UK as evidenced by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and a variety of reports including the Cadbury Committee Report recognize the importance of a more independent board of directors, completely independent audit committee, and strong internal controls. In Germany, some of these initiatives have been suggested as well. The U.S. can learn from their British counterparts and endorse governance advances such as to separate out the role of the chair of the board of directors and the CEO. Other changes that would strengthen governance in the U.S. include to: limit the number of boards on which a person can serve; recognize the rights of stockholders to nominate directors; and give shareholders a more direct role in board oversight. The U.S. should consider adopting some of the German attributes in their governance system by incorporating employees and employee representative groups into the oversight process. After all, it was the employees that worked for Enron who suffered the most as a result of corporate fraud including a loss of jobs and the near wipe-out of their 401K retirement plans.

This paper examines whether the dividend valuation changed after corporate accounting scandals such as that of Enron in October 2001 broke out. We find that dividend increasing firms experienced positive abnormal returns in the industry affected by corporate scandals up to four months after the first scandal in the industry became public. We interpret this finding in the context of the agency theory of Jensen (1986). To provide a perspective, we examine the dividend valuation from early 1980s to early 2000s, and find that the dividend valuation increased consistently for this time period. We also find that the dividend valuation was highest in the information technology industry after the year 2000. These findings fit well with the agency theory as well. (c) 2006 Taylor & Francis.

Moral choice, as a precursor to behaviour, has an important influence on the success or failure of business entities. According to Rest, 1983, Morality, Moral Behavior and Moral Development (John Wiley & Sons, New York), moral choice is prompted, amongst other things, by a motivational component. With this in mind, data obtained from a sample of four hundred financial sector operatives, employed in a rapidly developing region of China, was used to construct a relatively stable set of motivational typologies which could be used to predict choice within an agency-based context. A non-egoist version of the agency theory was developed, which permitted the modelling of alternative heuristic patterns. Altruists and persons identified as bordering on the verge of being classified as psychological egoists, refused to reorganize their motives when responding to a problem that included both moral hazard and adverse selection criteria. It was also possible to identify certain personal and contextual issues which discriminated between the typologies. (c) Springer 2006.

Agency Theory as the dominant view of Corporate Governance disregards that the key task of firm governance is to generate, accumulate, transfer, and protect firm specific knowledge. Three different foundations to the theory of the firm which underpin different concepts of corporate governance are discussed: The traditional view of the firm as a nexus of contracts, the view of the firm as a nexus of firm specific investments and the view of the firm as a nexus of firm specific knowledge investments. The latter view distinguishes two fundamental differences between contracting firm specific knowledge investments in contrast to financial investment: (1) A knowledge worker cannot contract his or her future knowledge in the same way as the exchange of tangible goods. (2) Only insiders can evaluate firm specific knowledge generation and transformation. We suggest a concept of corporate governance that takes investments in firm specific knowledge into account: (1) The board should rely more on insiders. (2) Those employees of the firm making firm-specific knowledge investments should elect the insiders. (3) A neutral person should chair the board. This concept provides a theoretical foundation of corporate governance based in the knowledge-based theory of the firm.

For the last two decades or more, agency theory has provided the dominant guiding framework for the research of governance. Despite the results of this effort being described as "remarkably inconsistent not only with the theory but with each other" (Daily, Dalton and Rajagopalan, 2003, p. 152) there have been few attempts to offer alternate paradigms for research. The result of this limitation is that several academics and commentators have had cause to publicly acknowledge that we actually know little about governance. Our understanding of the relationship between governance and subsequent organisational performance is at best haphazard, at worst, little more than an assumption. One attempt at breaking this stalemate concerns venturing into the 'black box' (LeBlanc and Schwartz, 2004), an activity that requires a different battery of research skills including a range of qualitative research methods, direct observation of practice, oral histories, case studies, interventions, action research and the analysis of decision-making. Few of these practices sit comfortably within the normal science (Kuhn, 1970) practices of much governance research conducted to date. The aim of this paper is to discuss the attributes of such black box research, identify various approaches to its conduct and to present a brief summary of interim results from a range of research activities in progress in New Zealand. The primary aim of the research 'agenda' informing these activities is firstly, to determine how a relationship between governance and subsequent organisational performance may operate given the complexities of such an approach and to identify whether specific attributes (either governance architecture or board capabilities) actually influence organisational outcomes. Results to date offer a tentative glimpse at what may be effective governance. In time, they may seriously challenge the relevance of much current research and what is increasingly being promoted by various agencies and accepted by practitioners as best practice.

We introduce the concept that internal organizational agents who negotiate starting salary packages with job applicants may not always act in the organization's best interests. To gain an understanding of what motivates the internal agent toward assuming a particular role, we use expectancy theory, agency theory and concepts from the negotiations literature. We describe the roles that agents may assume, identify factors that impact agents' motivation, and formulate propositions to help identify which role an agent is likely to enact in starting salary negotiations. We form propositions as to how these roles are likely to impact final negotiation outcomes of probability of hiring, salary size, and applicant satisfaction and discuss strategies for ensuring agents are motivated to enact a role that meets organizational objectives.

Many professional service organizations have adopted a little understood contractual form: service-for-equity. Based on in-depth case studies of 12 major professional service providers with a combined experience of 179 equity-for-service deals, this paper documents 18 intended and unintended consequences, emanating from and expanding beyond agency theory, of adopting such a contractual form. Six propositions are developed which speculate how these consequences, categorized under client development, service operations, financial management, and organizational behaviour, affect long run performance. Assuming these propositions cannot be rejected through empirical analysis, the paper also provides managerial guidance for effective implementation of equity-for-service arrangements.

The replacement of a CEO is one of the control mechanisms that companies employ to reduce the agency problems. This paper divides companies into non-family businesses and family businesses and investigates the influence of outside directors, outside blockholders, and excess compensation in CEOs termination process. The samples used in the paper come from manufacturing companies in Taiwan listed between 1996-1997; the analytical method is logistic regression model. The conclusion is as follows: 1. the characteristics of family businesses, corporate governance, and excess compensation have no correlation on CEO turnover. 2. External board members play an important role in CEO termination in non-family businesses.

This paper discusses the governance issues in nonprofit organizations (NPO). The theoretical framework of agency theory is used to analyze the relationship between agents and principals (donors and volunteers) in such kinds of organizations. Similarly to the for-profit organizations, the mechanisms of incentives and monitoring are crucial to the alignment of interests among principals and agents. However, considering the NPO's intrinsic characteristics, due to the difficulty to implement external and internal governance mechanisms, the challenges of alignment are far more complicated. The NPOs are idiosyncratic, being in many situations complex to establish performance comparisons with similar organizations.

The recent financial crises have created a new debate about comparison and convergence of different systems of corporate governance. In particular, they have underlined poor efficiency of rule structures to achieve a good relationship between different stakeholder's rights. In line with many studies of corporate governance that emphasize the manager-stakeholders relationship as explained by agency theory, in this paper, I analyse the role of auditing as an incentive device to reduce contractual or transaction costs related to asymmetric information.Considering as a benchmark the recent US Sarbanes Oxley Act of July 2002. I describe a set of auditing principles by comparing common and civil corporate laws. First, by using multiple correspondence analysis on six countries and twenty-seven dummy variables on auditing rules, I identify the main variables that form the auditing index. Second, I test the hypothesis that a suitable rule structure can improve the capability of financial markets to estimate the fair value of firms. In particular, I analyse the problem of the effects of direct and indirect monitoring rules for managers on the market value of public companies. The results obtained highlight a different relationship between auditing principles and firm performance from that expected on the basis of the legal framework.

Firstly, from Transaction Costs, Property Rights and Agency perspectives, the economic rationale of mutuals is analyzed, paying particular attention to MATEP's peculiarities and incentives in terms of competition, regulation and ownership. Subsequently, the effectiveness of governance mechanisms is discussed, showing that the status quo leaves excess power in the hands of the managers of these organizations.

This paper deals with a broad and controversial part of microeconomic theory represented by the theory of the firm. An overview of the main line of criticism of the orthodox (classical) theory of the firm and also of the theories proposed as reactions to one or more aspects of this criticism is given. However, the attention is attached to managerial theories of the firm, which are represented especially by the models of Baumol, Williamson and Marris. In each case the assumptions of the particular theory are stated, followed by graphical and mathematical exposition of its main conclusions. Finally, the paper concludes with a brief discussion of the contributions and setbacks of managerial theories.

Despite a decade since the inception of B2C e-commerce, the uncertainty of the online environment still makes many consumers reluctant to engage in online exchange relationships. Even if uncertainty has been widely touted as the primary barrier to online transactions, the literature has viewed uncertainty as a "background" mediator with insufficient conceptualization and measurement. To better understand the nature of uncertainty and mitigate its potentially harmful effects on B2C e-commerce adoption (especially for important purchases), this study draws upon and extends the principal-agent perspective to identify and propose a set of four antecedents of perceived uncertainty in online buyer-seller relationships - perceived information asymmetry, fears of seller opportunism, information privacy concerns, and information security concerns - which are drawn from the agency problems of adverse selection (hidden information) and moral hazard (hidden action). To mitigate uncertainty in online exchange relationships, this study builds upon the principal - agent perspective to propose a set of four uncertainty mitigating factors - trust, website informativeness, product diagnosticity, and social presence - that facilitate online exchange relationships by overcoming the agency problems of hidden information and hidden action through the logic of signals and incentives. The proposed structural model is empirically tested with longitudinal data from 521 consumers for two products (prescription drugs and books) that differ on their level of purchase involvement. The results support our model, delineating the process by which buyers engage in online exchange relationships by mitigating uncertainty. Interestingly, the proposed model is validatedfor two distinct targets, a specific website and a class of websites. Implications for understanding and facilitating online exchange relationships for different types of purchases, mitt gating uncertainty perceptions, and extending the principal-agent perspective are discussed.

The failure to document a consistent and robust relationship between executive pay and firm performance has frustrated scholars and practitioners for over three quarters of a century. Although recent compensation research has revealed alternative theoretical frameworks and findings that hold the potential to significantly improve our understanding of executive compensation, to date this diverse literature lacks theoretical integration. Accordingly, we develop a framework to organize and review these recent findings. We further identify methodological issues and concerns, discuss the implications of these concerns, and provide recommendations for future research aimed at developing a more integrated research agenda.

This article examines the effects of monitoring on interfirm relationships. Whereas some research suggests that monitoring can serve as a control mechanism that reduces exchange partner opportunism, there is also evidence showing that monitoring can actually promote such behavior. The authors propose that the actual effect of monitoring depends on (1) the form of monitoring used (output versus behavior) and (2) the context in which monitoring takes place. With regard to the form of monitoring, the results from a longitudinal field study of buyer-supplier relationships show that output monitoring decreases partner opportunism, as transaction cost and agency theory predict, whereas behavior monitoring, which is a more obtrusive form of control, increases partner opportunism. With regard to the context, the authors find that informal relationship elements in the form of microlevel social contracts serve as buffers that both enhance the effects of output monitoring and permit behavior monitoring to suppress opportunism in the first place.

Family business researchers are split on whether family managers in family firms are agents or stewards. If family managers behave as agents, family firms are expected to impose agency cost control mechanisms on them, and this will improve performance. The results based on a sample of small privately held family firms indicate that family managers are monitored and provided with incentive compensation. Those who do so obtain higher performance, thus suggesting the existence of agency behavior among family managers. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study examines the association between board composition and voluntary disclosure in annual reports. In particular, it addresses the incentives within the agency theory framework for both inside and independent directors to disclosure additional information voluntarily. Further, it provides evidence on the relation between the overall total voluntary disclosure and the components of voluntary disclosure, such as forward looking, strategic, non-financial and historical financial disclosures and board composition. Our sample is based on 181 Australian companies. We have developed and hand-collected 67 items from annual reports to develop the total voluntary disclosure index and the sub-indices of voluntary disclosure. Using two-stage multivariate analyses, our results provide some important insights. First, we find that there is a positive association between board composition and the voluntary disclosure of information in annual reports. Second, we also find that independent boards provide more voluntary disclosure of forward looking information and strategic information. However, board structure has no bearing on the voluntary disclosure of non-financial and historical financial information. Our findings are enhanced by different empirical specifications and sensitivity tests.

We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper investigates how governance mechanisms affect the ability of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to introduce strategic change. Previous research typically assumes that governance mechanisms operate independently of each other. Building on agency theory and insights from the literature on small firm governance, we hypothesize that governance variables related to ownership, the board of directors and the top management team all affect strategic change and that it is important to examine the interaction effects of these governance mechanisms. Using a longitudinal sample of over 800 SMEs, our general logic and hypotheses are supported by the analyses. We find that closely held firms exhibit less strategic change than do SMEs relying on more widespread ownership structures. However, to some extent, closely held firms can overcome these weaknesses and achieve strategic change by utilizing outside directors on the board and/or extending the size of the top management teams. Implications for theory and management practice in SMEs are discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Agency theory highlights losses in productivity that may occur when the interests of owners and employees are imperfectly aligned. Pay for performance has been proposed as a solution to this problem. Using a real-effort laboratory experiment with salient incentives, we compared pay-for-performance and fixed-salary compensation. The former achieved significantly higher firm productivity through both sorting and incentive effects. In particular, more productive employees selected pay for performance, and employees on average, regardless of their preferred compensation scheme, produced more under it.

Differently from prior studies that examine the role of stand-alone control systems within the relationship between owners and managers, our study investigates the correlation between two control mechanisms - voluntary disclosure and independent directors - in companies characterized by the presence of a dominant shareholder that is supposed to mitigate the classical agency problem. Based on agency theory, we hypothesize that the two mechanisms tend to coexist, since the presence of either one reduces the costs of introducing the other. Two further effects - the reputation and the domino effect - contribute to determine a positive relationship between the two mechanisms. We carried out the empirical analysis on 175 non-financial Italian listed companies, all controlled by a dominant shareholder. Voluntary disclosure is measured through three alternative disclosure indexes. Independent directors are identified not only according to a formal/legal definition, but also through stricter criteria. The empirical test is based on a multivariate analysis controlling for size, residual ownership diffusion, leverage, profitability and labour pressure. Results support our hypothesis and are robust to alternative criteria to identify dominant shareholders. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between different control mechanisms in particular agency settings.

This article examines the relevance of the two main theories used to understand business format franchising - resource scarcity theory and agency theory - for social venture franchising through an in - depth case study of one of the United Kingdom's first and most high-profile social franchises. We posit that both theories can be reframed to take account of the distinctive characteristics of social franchise systems. In developing our arguments, we present four findings that, taken together, move us closer toward a theory of social venture franchising. (c) 2007 by Baylor University.

Most research investigating the impact of board leadership structure as a corporate governance mechanism, on corporate performance has focused largely on either the Anglo-American context or the Asian experience and has come up with diverse conclusions. This study sheds light on the extent to which corporate leadership structure affects corporate performance by providing empirical evidence from a sample of Egyptian listed firms. The initial econometric results indicate that CEO duality has no impact on corporate performance. However, when an interaction term between industry type and CEO duality is included in the model, the impact of CEO duality on corporate performance is found to vary across industries, a result that is supportive of both agency theory and stewardship theory. In addition, when firms are categorised according to their financial performance, CEO duality attracts a positive and significant coefficient only when corporate performance is low.

Does CEO duality - the practice of one person serving both as a firm's CEO and board chair - contribute to or inhibit firm performance? Agency theory suggests that CEO duality is bad for performance because it compromises the monitoring and control of the CEO. Stewardship theory, in contrast, argues that CEO duality may be good for performance due to the unity of command it presents. The empirical evidence, largely from developed economies, is largely inconclusive. This article joins the debate by extending empirical work to the largely unexplored context of institutional transitions. Our findings, based on an archival database covering 403 publicly listed firms and 1,202 company-years in China, offer stronger support for stewardship theory and relatively little support for agency theory. Finally, we also call for a contingency perspective to specify the nature of conditions such as resource scarcity and environmental dynamism under which CEO duality may be especially valuable.

Challenging agency theory prescriptions for board composition, we contend that the boards of young firms that have recently gone public are best comprised of a majority of original top management team (TMT) members, rather than independent outsiders. We argue that such board members possess valuable tacit knowledge of the firms and their entrepreneurial visions and are in the best position to provide oversight. We additionally argue that outsiders should provide resources that firms' TMTs might use to execute their strategies, rather than monitor the TMTs. Our results from 1996-97 data on 524 initial public offerings support our contentions. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

This field study investigated contextual antecedents of free riding by franchisees on franchisor brand reputation and effects of free riding on performance in a multinational corporation's franchising network. Structural elements (increased formalization, decentralized decision-making), interactions between franchisor representatives and franchisee dealers, and market-related factors (external competition) were associated with lower levels of franchisee free riding. The findings also indicated that free riding has deleterious effects on franchisee performance. The results support theoretical arguments that both economic and social exchange perspectives are valuable in examining free riding and provide important practical guidance in designing and managing franchise systems.

This exploratory study is intended to analyze how a combination of the resources-based view and agency theory can provide a better understanding of the internal dynamic of the family business and its evolution. Our evidence seems to suggest that the desire to keep family control produces specific sources of value and conditions the firm's financial capacity to acquire resources. These peculiarities change between first and following generations. During the first generation, we find that less severe agency costs balance the negative effect of scarce financial structure on the family firm's value. After descendants join the firm, the increasing agency costs are compensated by the enlargement of the firm's financial structure. (c) 2007 Family Firm Institute, Inc.

As outsourcing evolves into a competitive necessity, managers must increasingly contend with the decision about which software development projects to outsource. Although a variety of theories have been invoked to study the initial outsourcing decision, much of this work has relied in isolation on one theoretical perspective. Therefore, the relative importance ascribed by managers to the factors from these theories is poorly understood. The majority of this work also masks interesting insights into outsourcing decisions by focusing on the information technology (IT) function rather than individual projects as the unit of analysis, where many of these decisions occur. In contrast, prior research at the project level has focused on predicting development performance in the postoutsourcing-decision phases of projects. The objective of this study is to examine the relative importance that IT managers ascribe to various factors from three complementary theories - transaction cost economics, agency theory, and knowledge-based theory - as they simultaneously consider them in their project outsourcing decisions. A secondary objective is to assess the cross-cultural robustness (United States versus Japan in this study) of such models in predicting project-level IT outsourcing decisions. We develop and test a multitheoretic model using data on 1,008 project-level decisions collected from 33 Japanese and 55 U.S. managers. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the relative importance that managers ascribe to the factors from these three theories, their complementarities and occasional contradictions, and offer new insights into the differences among U.S. and Japanese IT managers. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed. (c) 2007 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Drawing on three prominent views about the "self" and the self's relationship with "others", a typology of five parental altruistic archetypes is derived that exhausts the possible altruistic influences on the governance of family firms. When taken in concert, these five types comprise a more balanced explanation of the cross-sectional variance in the governance efficiency of these firms than do the explanations from agency theory and more recently, by Schulze and colleagues. Therefore, the typology provides an improved explanation of why some family firms are more able than others to capitalize on the family governance's positive attributes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This article provides a definition of corporate governance and highlights the challenges in adapting understanding of governance to the privately-held firm. We emphasize the need to develop the scope of governance in privately-held firms beyond the traditional agency theory focus in the financial economics literature relating to large publicly-listed corporations. There is a need to draw on and integrate an array of theoretical perspectives from both economics and other social science disciplines as well. We present a schematic model of corporate governance which places the contributions presented in the special issue in context and which serves as a guide to highlighting gaps in the research base. We review the principal issues relating to corporate governance in privately-held firms which relate to: governance in different organizational contexts (institutional context; the industrial sector within which the firm finds itself, the ownership context of the firm, and the stage within the firm's life-cycle); the scope of corporate governance; and other internal governance mechanisms to be considered We identify areas for further research on corporate governance in privately-held firms with respect to processes of governance, organizational contexts, assumptions about the owners, executive remuneration, financial reporting, the nature of the dependent variable relating to the expected outcome of different approaches to governance and various methodological issues. We suggest a need to develop governance codes for privately-held firms that are flexible enough to take account of the different types of governance needs of firms at different stages in their life-cycle.

We explore the impact of CEO tenure on returns to shareholders arising from acquisition announcements. Further, we consider the value added for shareholders when the board of directors is composed in such a way as to enhance vigilance. In the absence of a vigilant board, CEO tenure is positively associated with performance at low to moderate levels of tenure, and negatively associated with performance when tenure further rises to substantial levels. In the presence of a vigilant board, however, shareholder interests can be advanced even at high levels of CEO tenure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Equity financing is important in financing growth but its special features in small business have not been well addressed in the finance or entrepreneurship literature. Since many small firms have family involvement and research shows that family firms have both advantages and disadvantages in managing agency costs, how family involvement and agency issues interact to affect equity financing in small business is an important topic of research. This study examines the effects of family ownership and management on two dimensions of small business equity financing, the use of equity financing and the use of public equity financing within the agency theory of financing. The results show that family involvement and agency issues interactively and separately influence equity financing in small business. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Purpose - The paper seeks to investigate the key drivers and level of voluntary disclosures in biotechnology company annual reports. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses an intellectual capital disclosure index score of voluntary disclosures in a large sample of listed biotechnology companies, and tests the relationship between voluntary disclosures of intangible firm value with traditional agency theory variables. The relationships are tested statistically using correlation and multiple-regression analysis. Findings - The key drivers of voluntary intellectual capital disclosures were the level of board independence, firm age, level of leverage and firm size. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that board independence, leverage and size had a significant relationship with the level of voluntary intellectual capital disclosure. Separate regression controlling for large-sized and small-sized firms demonstrated that voluntary intellectual capital disclosure was only driven by board independence and the levels of firm leverage in large firms. Small firms did not demonstrate this relationship. Research limitations/implications - The implications of this research are that smaller biotechnology companies' managers are not motivated by external debt-holder demands to make voluntary disclosures about intangible firm value. In addition, large biotechnology companies, which are better able to establish independent board oversight, appear more effective at driving voluntary intellectual capital disclosures, perhaps in response to greater demand by owners. A limitation of this study is its Australian context and that data is analysed only from 2005 financial year annual reports. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge this is an original paper whose findings have valuable implications for managing intellectual capital at the firm level. The paper clearly demonstrates that disclosures about intangible firm value is being driven by traditional agency theory variables and more contemporary corporate governance issues, and that small firms may be ignoring the importance of disclosing more about their intellectual capital.

Pure incentive schemes rely on the agent's self-interest, rather than more coercive control, to motivate subordinates. Yet most organizations, and in particular public agencies, rely very little on pure incentive contracts and instead use coercive mechanisms of monitoring and sanctioning that many theorists find objectionable. We use principal-agency theory to investigate the problem. Principal-agency theory has tacitly assumed throughout that it is in the principal's interests to find a set of incentives that induce efficient levels of effort from the agent. We show that this is not necessarily the case. We identify a problem we denote as "the principal's moral hazard constraint" in which bonuses large enough to produce the efficient incentive effect are prohibitively expensive for the principal. Potential solutions to this problem - involving penalization or joint ownership - are unavailable in the public sphere. This means that for a large class of control problems in agencies, the principal's self-interest will result in the inefficient use of monitoring and oversight rather than outcome-contingent incentives. Although monitoring is often thought of as resulting from the agent's moral hazard, it can just as reasonably be seen as resulting from the principal's moral hazard.

While corporate governance research has had some success tying boards' demographic characteristics to relatively distant outcomes such as CEO pay and succession, numerous studies have indicated that a major weakness of this research is that it has largely ignored the intervening behaviours associated with board vigilance. This study begins to answer this call by examining the relationship between boards' demographic characteristics and boards' information-gathering behaviour. Using primary and secondary data from 149 firms, this study finds that an increase in the proportion of outside directors on a board is associated with an increase in boards' information quality and proactive information-seeking. In addition, an increase in outside director tenure is associated with boards exchanging information more frequently. Consistent with agency theory predictions, these findings suggest that vigilant boards are likely to take actions aimed at reducing the level of information asymmetry between them and their CEOs.

Corporate governance issues have attracted a good deal of public interest because of their apparent importance for the economic health of corporations and society in general, especially after the plethora of corporate scams and debacles in recent times. Corporate governance issues flow from the concept of accountability and governance and assume greater significance and magnitude in the case of corporate form of organization where the ownership and management of organizations are distanced. And, it is in this context that the pivotal role played by the board of directors in maintaining an effective organization assumes much importance. A major part of the debate on corporate governance centres around board composition especially board size and independence. Various committees have mandated a minimum number of independent directors and have given guidelines on board composition. However, the relationship of board characteristics such as composition, size, and independence with performance has not yet been established. This paper addresses this question: Does the board size and independence really matter in terms of influencing firm's performance? The findings suggest that: *>There is an inverse association between board size and firm performance. *>Different proportions of board independence have dissimilar impact on firm performance. *> The impact of board independence on firm performance is more when the board independence is between 50 and 60 per cent. *> Smaller boards are more efficient than the larger ones, the board size limit of six suggested as the ideal. *> Independent directors have so far failed to perform their monitoring role effectively and improve the performance of the firm. *> The guidelines on corporate governance should take into account the 'cross-board' phenomenon while defining the criteria for eligibility for appointment as an independent director. *> Lack of training to function as independent directors and ignorance of the procedures, tasks, and responsibilities expected of them could be reasons for the independent directors' non-performance. *> A bad performance leads to an increase in board size, which in turn, hampers performance. Guidelines are provided for future studies to include different variables to see which board composition is suitable for different companies at different stages of life cycle.

We show how capital structure is influenced by the strength of shareholder rights. Our empirical evidence shows an inverse relation between leverage and shareholder rights, suggesting that firms adopt higher debt ratios where shareholder rights are more restricted. This is consistent with agency theory, which predicts that leverage helps alleviate agency problems. This negative relation, however, is not found in regulated firms (i.e., utilities). We contend that this is because regulation already helps alleviate agency conflicts and, hence, mitigates the role of leverage in controlling agency costs.

Board composition in large organizations has been subject to much empirical research, however, little attention has been focused on board composition in start-ups, and more specifically high tech start-ups. This lack of research is surprising given that many high tech start-ups have multiple equity stakeholders such as venture capitalists or public research organizations, such as universities. Given that high tech start-ups are commonly resource-poor these external stakeholders may play an important role in accessing critical external resources. Drawing on agency theory, resource dependence theory and social network theory we examine the tensions that exist between the founding team and external equity stakeholders in determining the presence of outside board members. In particular we focus on whether or not the outside board members have either complementary or substitute human capital to the founding team. We test our model on a sample of 140 high tech start-ups in Flanders. Our results indicate that high tech start-ups with a public research organization as an external equity stakeholder are more likely to develop boards with outside board members with complementary skills to the founding team.

Purpose The effect of corporate governance on firm performance has long been of great interest to financiers, economists, behavioural scientists, legal practitioners and business operators. Yet there is no consensus over what constitutes an effective corporate governance mechanism that induces agents or managers to consistently act in the interest of share value optimisation. The purpose of this study is to develop a model to resolve an on-going issue in financial economics: how can CEOs be effectively monitored by the board of directors? Design-methodology-approach A survey of the literature on corporate governance and the relationship between board composition and financial performance leads to the development of the proposed model, which is based on a framework which takes into account the probability of success representing a CEO's ability, and the active monitoring function (which is represented by the numbers of control visits) carried-out by the directors. Findings The design of the model is aimed at identifying an optimal level of monitoring, which will maximise share value, to guide internal and independent directors. Research limitations-implications The model has limitations: it does not address the input of other directors and it focuses solely on the monitoring function, even though boards also play important roles in providing information and advice to management. Originality-value The finding of this study contributes to the Agency Theory debate, in essence that the board monitoring of CEO will improve the performance of the CEO and avoid possible conflict of interests.

The authors examine the moderating effects of conscientiousness on the relationships between agency controls and effort and agency controls and task performance. Results show that less conscientious individuals appear to increase effort through incentive alignment and monitoring, whereas conscientious individuals do not shirk with or without agency controls. Furthermore, results show that less conscientious individuals increase task performance through incentive alignment, but not through monitoring. The study confirms that motivation to act opportunistically differs between individuals unlike what is assumed by agency theory. Also, incentive alignment may be more effective than monitoring when attempting to align principal and agent interests. (c) 2007 Sage Publications.

This paper analyzes the relationship between investors and private equity managers in order to identify the factors that affect the latter's reputation. Since there are no individual references about their past returns in developing private equity markets, the reputation of such players is thought to be linked to their capacity for obtaining new funds. Results provide evidence of the volume of investments recorded in the past, the ratio of portfolio companies to investment manager, the percentage of divestments carried out through initial public offerings and trade sales, the membership of the national private equity association and the size of funds under management as characteristics of the highest importance in raising funds.

The hypothesis of this article is that agency theory makes implicit assumptions on the power relation between principal and agent. It implicitly assumes an asymmetry in power in favour of the principal. The bases of power approach [French Jr., J.R.P., Raven, B.H., 1959. The bases of social power. In: Cartwright, D.

Journal of Social Behavior and Personality 7, 217-244] of social psychology is used to prove this argument. Surprisingly, the social power perspective does not only reveal this implicit assumption. It also paves the way for a new mechanism that resolves agency problems that had not yet been discovered by agency theory: identification systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Perspectives relating to agency theory, information asymmetries and game theory were utilized to explore two outcomes associated with the management buy-out (MBO) or management buy-in (MBI) of former private firms: whether information was shared equally between vendors (i.e., family firm owners) and purchasers (i.e., MBO/I management teams) and whether a mutually agreed price was achieved. With reference to the themes of company ownership structure, governance structure and company objectives several hypotheses were derived. Survey evidence was gathered from the managers of 114 former private family-owned firms located across Europe that recently reported an MBO/I. Multiple logistic regression analysis detected that respondents in founded (first generation) family firms and those reporting a high focus on the strategic importance of the market value increment were more likely to report that 'information was shared equally between vendors and purchasers'. Respondents reporting no suitable family successor had been identified, a high focus on the strategic importance of the market value increment, and the involvement of venture capitalists in succession planning were more likely to report that a mutually agreed sale price had been achieved. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

To understand the evolving perspectives and behaviour of directors and institutional investors, field research was conducted in 2004-2005 by way of a survey with corporate directors in four countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States; n = 658) and institutional investors in Canada (n = 34). Reported changes in directors' views and practices are substantial and consistent across countries, the defining characteristic of which is a fundamental shift in the positioning of the board toward becoming a strategic partner to management. The role of institutional investors also shifted in ways that are complementary to this new role of directors (e.g., toward increased monitoring). While most research has focused on agency concepts of the board as monitors of management, our research suggests that the board is evolving towards a more collaborative role with management, consistent with stewardship theory. Our findings also suggest that directors are seeking a balance between collaboration and their role as monitors of management, rejecting the notion of the board as primarily a monitoring body. An evolutionary model is offered to explain these changes and implications are discussed. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Agency theory focuses on monitoring and incentives as two solutions to agency problems. Prior research suggests that monitoring and incentives may act either as substitutes or as complements, and that the context of the agency relationship plays a major role in determining the direction of the relationship between them. In a corporate governance setting, we contend that board information and boards' usage of CEO control mechanisms are best viewed as complements. Thus, we hypothesize that boards' information gathering behaviour will be positively related to boards' usage of CEO control mechanisms. Using primary and secondary data from 149 US firms, we find that increases in boards' information gathering are associated with increases in boards' usage of managerial controls. These findings suggest that information and managerial control mechanisms act as complements in the governance context, and that boards take a variety of actions to protect the interests of shareholders.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine whether or not divident policy is influenced by the firm's corporate control structure, investigating the relationship between the dynamics of earnings payout and the voting power enjoyed by different types of shareholders. This allows one to test a set of hypotheses derived from agency and pecking order theories. Design/methodology/approach - A large panel of UK firms for the 1990s and is analyzed that the payout policy is significantly related to control concentration. The problem of control measurement is addressed and the use of Banzhaf indices advocated as a relevant measure of voting power in the analysis of corporate policy choices. The traditional framework proposed by Linter is extended and an econometrically sound approach to modeling the dynamics of the total payout suggested. Where most - even recent - studies on payout policy show some methodological flaws, state-of-the-art dynamic panel data estimation procedures are applied. Findings - Expectedly, profitability is a crucial determinant of payout decisions, but the presence of strong block holders or block holder coalitions weakens the relationship between the corporate earnings and the payout dynamics. Block holders appear to realize that an overly generous payout may render the company liquidity constrained, and, consequently, result in suboptimal investment policy. Practical implications - The results challenge some of the implications of the agency theories of payout, and favor a pecking-order explanation for the observed patterns. The analysis of payout dynamics reveals also that companies adjust payout policies to changes in earnings only gradually, which is consistent with "dividend smoothing". In fact, the results suggest a presence of a more general phenomenon of the "total payout smoothing". Originality/value - According to one's bet knowledge, this is the first study employing those game theory-based concepts in the context of corporate payout policies.

Concepts of social enterprise have been debated repeatedly, and continue to cause confusion. In this paper, a meta-theoretical framework is developed through discussion of individualist and communitarian philosophy. Philosophers from both traditions build social theories that emphasise either consensus (a unitarist outlook) or diversity (a pluralist outlook). The various discourses in corporate governance reflect these assumptions and create four distinct approaches that impact on the relationship between capital and labour. In rejecting the traditional discourse of private enterprise, social enterprises have adopted other approaches to tackle social exclusion, each derived from different underlying beliefs about the purpose of enterprise and the nature of governance. The theoretical framework offers a way to understand the diversity found within the sector, including the newly constituted Community Interest Company (CIC). (c) 2007 The Author.

An integration of agency theory and socialization models is developed and used to explain the types of governance and organizational structures associated with self-initiated subsidiary innovation. This theorizing suggests that: 1) The hub structure is the greatest user of behavior-based contracting and engenders the fewest self-initiated innovations; 2) The federation structure is the greatest user of outcome-based contracting and engenders the most self-initiated innovations, but these are primarily oriented to business level strategy rather than corporate; and, 3) The network structure is the greatest user of goal internalization and is the strongest generator of self-initiated innovations which are oriented to corporate-level strategy. The empirical evidence from extant studies of other researchers in the field is consistent with these propositions. Implications for management practice, research and theory are discussed in the paper. (c) 2007.

Fraud and corporate executives: Agency, Stewardship and Broken Trust. Journal of Forensic Accounting, 5, 109-130] to explain corporate executive Fraud. The Broken Trust theory is primarily based on an "Agency" theory from economic literature and a "Stewardship" theory from psychology literature. We next describe an "American Dream" theory from sociology literature to complement Albrecht el al.'s (2004) Broken Trust theory. Like the Broken Trust theory, the American Dream theory relates to a "Fraud Triangle" concept to explain corporate executive Fraud. Finally, we provide some anecdotal evidence from recent high profile corporate executive Fraud to explore the American Dream theory. We conclude our thoughts on corporate executive Fraud from a teaching perspective. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper models the corporate ownership and performance relationship in Bangladesh listed firms using a simultaneous equations approach. Consistent with contemporary literature a "reverse-way" causality relationship between the two is documented. Using an unbalanced pooled sample of 660 firm-years, our results suggest that ownership does not have a significant impact on performance (Tobin's Q or ROA). However, performance does appear to have a significant negative impact on ownership. With few exceptions, other governance and control variables appear to have significant effects on both performance and ownership. These results imply that despite significant governance differences between Bangladesh and developed market economies there are strong similarities in "internal governance mechanisms" and the implications of agency theory.

We examine shareholder wealth effects in a heterogeneous sample of 115 European leveraged going private transactions from 1997 to 2005. Average abnormal returns as reaction to the LBO announcement amount to 24.20%. In cross-sectional regressions, we find that these value gains can largely be attributed to differences in corporate governance: on a macro level, abnormal returns for pre-LBO shareholders are larger in countries with a poor protection of minority shareholders. On a firm level, companies with a high pre-LBO free float and comparatively weak monitoring by shareholders tend to show high abnormal returns. Furthermore, companies that are undervalued with respect to an industry peer-group exhibit higher announcement returns, indicating that agency conflicts and/or market inefficiencies can serve as an explanation.

Purpose - This paper proposes a methodology for governing expatriate assignments in the context of corporate-level objectives. Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken is to envisage expatriate managerial assignments within the theoretical framework of agency theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm. The paper begins with the view that knowledge acquisition and integration is a primary goal for most expatriate assignments. The relationship between expatriate managers and multinational corporation (MNC) headquarters from an agency perspective are considered and the notion of a "knowledge contract" as a means of governing that relationship is discussed. Four corporate-level international strategies available to MNCs (global, international, transnational, and multidomestic) are then examined and the extent of agency problems under each strategy is discussed. Findings - The paper makes specific predictions about the type of knowledge contract that is most likely to address agency problems for each corporate strategy. Originality/value - This research extends agency theory by introducing the knowledge contract as a means of managing agency concerns. This offers a broader range of contract alternatives, moving researchers beyond traditional agency theoretic prescriptions. The research also contributes to the literature on expatriate management by integrating assignment success with research on corporate-level international strategy. Few authors have recognized organizational strategy as an important unit of study in international human resource management. Doing so, however, has yielded a unique set of contingency relationships that would otherwise be obscured.

Recent scandals in the business world have intensified the demand for an explanation of the causes of corporate wrongdoing. This study empirically tests the effects of mutual fund management fees and control structures on the likelihood of illegal activity within mutual fund organizations. Specific attention is given to the presence of agency duality issues in the mutual fund industry and how this influences the motivations and decisions of fund managers. Findings provide support for the hypothesized relationship that higher levels of management fees decrease the likelihood of illegal behavior.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a theory of intertemporal stewardship that incorporates stewardship, based on a foundation of spirituality, into financial decision-making models. Design/methodology/approach - Argues that stewardship, which shares some common ground with sustainable development, must become an integral component of financial decision-making. Using agency theory as a point of departure, discusses the Anglo-American and Continental European-Japanese models of financial decision-making, and how they can be reformulated to embrace stewardship and the spiritual foundation upon which stewardship is based. The key to linking spirituality and stewardship is our concept of self-fullness - the simultaneous pursuit of reasonable self-interest and reasonable concern for the common good of all human beings. The reformulated model of financial decision-making is labeled intertemporal stewardship theory. Findings - The merger of spirituality, stewardship, and financial decision-making is crucial for the survival and prosperity of businesses and the people they serve. The failure of businesses in the new economy can be traced to the loss of values regarding spirituality and stewardship. Research limitations/implications - Empirical research must be conducted to test the validity of the proposed intertemporal stewardship theory. Practical implications - It is essential that managers base their decisions on internalized spiritual and stewardship values that they do not "park at the door" when they arrive at work. Managers should never lose sight of these values, and their decisions should always be grounded in these values. Without such grounding, it is very possible that once again managers will be caught in a cycle of "irrational exuberance". Therefore, it is critical that these values become not only an integral part of financial decision-making but also an integral part of education for financial decision-making. Originality/value - The financial bottom line is that financial decision-making can no longer be devoid of spiritual and stewardship considerations if an organization is to survive and prosper over the long term. Neither can business organizations deny spirituality and stewardship considerations if they are to be socially responsible members of society, contributing to and upholding a moral existence for all humanity. In this sense then, the conception of intertemporal stewardship theory that is offered in this paper takes a step toward realizing these greater goals. (c) 2007, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Sumantra Ghoshal, in his recent Academy of Management Learning & Education article, argued that management theories currently taught in MBA programs are the causal factor in triggering (a), the recent wave of corporate scandals in the United States and (b), lack of theory building for contemporary management. He identified the dominance in graduate business education of agency theory as the primary culprit for these problems. In this essay I outline how a cognitive philosophy of science shift in the business school culture from Thomas Kuhn's normal science paradigm framework to Karl Popper's revolutionary science methodology would mitigate many of the dysfunctions Ghoshal catalogues. This position is based on published literature, contemporary trends in management theory, and teaching graduate courses in the administrative sciences. I also suggest that, if such a transition is not made, MBA programs will continue to lose both societal and organizational legitimacy. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

This paper uses the changing historical and theoretical frames within which management pay and investor claims are considered to provide a critique of the functionalist approach of agency and to develop an alternative, positional explanation of rewards. The first part of the paper draws on the contrast between the pre-1940 critique of the rentier and the post-1980 discursive construction of the shareholder to raise important contemporary questions about position and reward. The second part develops the idea of positional rewards to challenge agency assumptions by arguing that both giant firm managers and the less visible, though larger, group of intermediaries use their position to skim value. In contrast, the experience of position is more mixed for shareholders, who are generally passive value surfers. The final section of the paper argues that a renewed emphasis on position will enable a problem shift from value creation to value capture.

Research on the efficacy of stock-based compensation for outside directors has documented a weak or non-existent relationship with firm performance. Other variables also influence the relationships between these two constructs. Consistent with agency theory, we show, for a sample of 450 Standard & Poor 500 firms over the 1995-97 period that the use of director stock options and grants ratios was more strongly associated with positive performance in firms with (a) higher investment opportunities, and (b) weaker external monitoring. These findings have implications for compensation committees in the structuring of director compensation. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper explains, through a field study and from an agency perspective, how monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms change to support the interests of a privatized firm's new ownership. In this case, privatization led to important changes in the board of directors and to more formal performance evaluation and compensation systems for top managers, as profitability and financial control gained relevancy with the firm ownership change. Our results show that differences in incentives management before and after privatization are due to different agency relations in the two periods. We also argue that in a privatization framework the relation between monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms is complex, not simply substitutive as agency theory would predict, and this finding allows us to refine and extend agency theory for this specific context.

According to agency theory, agents base their economic decisions on self-interests when adverse selection conditions exist. However, cognitive moral development theory predicts that ethics/morals may influence decision-makers not to behave egoistically. Rutledge and Karim (1999; Accounting, Organizations and Society 24(2), 173-184) find both the moral reasoning level of the managers and an adverse selection condition affect a manager's project evaluation decisions significantly. Since prior studies have shown that national culture might influence the application of agency theory in project evaluation, this current study uses a different moral development measurement to reexamine Rutledge and Karim's hypotheses in another culture. A total of 73 Taiwanese executive MBA students with an average of 12.17 years work experience participated in this study. We found that both moral development level and adverse selection conditions significantly affect managers' project continuance decisions. The interaction effect of these two factors indicates that, when adverse selection conditions exist, participants with a high level of moral development exhibit less of a tendency to continue an unprofitable project than those with a low level of moral development. With subjects from a different culture, our results confirm the findings of Rutldege and Karim. That is, the effects of moral development and adverse selection conditions on managers' project continuance decisions are robust and can be generalized to different cultures. Implications of the findings of this study to multinational firms are also discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This paper presents a model for the governance of radical innovation (RI) efforts within the firm. A longitudinal study of 12 large established companies committed to develop and institutionalize a radical innovation capability are used to inform our work. Thus the firm, rather than the RI project, is the unit of analysis for this work. We draw on Agency Theory, Firm Level Governance, Stewardship Theory and Stakeholder Theory as well to enrich the model. We find that none of these theoretical frames adequately describes the issues faced by companies as they build governance systems to oversee high risk, high uncertainty innovation portfolios. A series of propositions is offered based on the data analysis and extant literature that address board composition, decision style and decision processes that, we believe, enhance a company's ability to generate and commercialize radical innovations.

This paper reports interview-based research examining reasons for the continued increase in executive directors' remuneration in large UK companies. This issue has not specifically been addressed by previous studies, which have focused on the level of the increases, rather than their underlying explanations. Reasons given for making changes included: increases due to being below-market; changing performance-related schemes that did not pay out or paid less than expected; changes in the company's culture or strategy; changes to senior personnel; and compliance with good practice in human resource management and in corporate governance. The results are analysed through two theoretical lenses. Agency theory provides an explanation of the structure of the contracts; expectancy theory suggests why schemes might be changed to motivate the executives. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to comprehend the whole phenomenon of corporate philanthropy in Malaysia by studying the traits of companies that make significant contributions to society. Specifically, it looks at firms' ownership structures and specific characteristics and their influence on the extent of corporate philanthropy. This study employs Agency theory as the basis for explaining philanthropic behaviour of Malaysian companies. A total of 100 public-listed companies were selected from the top 200 companies based on market capitalization as listed on the Bursa Malaysia. The ownership structures and firm characteristics of the selected companies were tested against the extent of corporate philanthropy in order to see the relationship among the variables. In addition, multiple regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. The findings of this study reveal that ownership structure does have some influence on corporate philanthropic activities. This is consistent with the proposition of Agency theory. In addition, the size factor is also found to be a significant determinant of philanthropic tendency among Malaysian companies. In view of the increasing importance of corporate philanthropy in the overall context of corporate social responsibility and nation building, this study serves well in providing an insight into the determinants of corporate philanthropic tendencies in Malaysia. By doing this, it extends the horizon of the study done by Prathaban and Rahim on the levels of firm charitable contributions. This paper offers an important explanation of the factors that influence corporate philanthropic tendency, particularly in the Malaysian context. (c) 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Agency Theory would suggest that increased firm ownership should mitigate a manager's propensity to fraudulently divert resources for unauthorized consumption. However, most of the frauds in recent times have been committed by senior managers and/or Chief Executives who may own a significant portion of the firm. Although such management fraud has been studied extensively in the economics of crime literature as white collar crime and has been the focus of many legislative initiatives such as the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1995 and study teams such as the Treadway Commission (National Committee on Fraudulent Financial Reporting 1987), the assumptions behind many of these studies and legislative initiatives is that an increase in severity and certainty of ex-post penalty is an effective deterrent to financial fraud regardless of this ownership question. What separates financial fraud from other crime is that it is committed in the context of a market that is considered efficient in that it rationally anticipates and reacts to all information and uncertainty. Thus, the market is potentially able to protect itself to some extent by rationally pricing such possible behavior. Such ability to 'self protect' changes the nature of incentive and gain from fraud to a manager who, because of his part ownership, must face some consequences of his own fraud. In the ensuing game, though the penalty for fraud deterrence increases the cost of fraud, whether it can ensure complete honesty is a function of how efficient the legal system is and the extent of firm ownership by the manager. As the analysis of this paper shows, the question of fraudulent behavior can only be answered in conjunction with the question of the extent of ownership of the firm by the manager. The results show that increased ownership may not necessarily reduce the propensity to commit fraud. As the gain from fraud and the corresponding penalty increases, unless the gain from fraud is completely offset through the penalty, the results suggest that more and more managers may find it optimal to engage in a mixed strategy and behave fraudulently some of the time. What is more likely to be successful is the certainty of determination and application of the penalty rather than its size. These results have significant implications in countries such as those in Europe where the insider holdings vary significantly. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This article examines the conditions under which the principal-agent model is self-activating/socially causal. We do so by exploring a principal-agent framework that allows for the possibility that rational agents may hold intrinsic preferences for autonomy in decision making and experience disutility from being monitored. Using a dynamic model of preference formation, we identify conditions under which the principal-agent model is self-activating in that, over time, the introduction of the model in an otherwise efficient monitor-worker relationship leads to the inefficient adoption of the agency model. We also examine the extent to which the agency model is robust when autonomy-preferring agents are introduced into the population.

The purpose of this study is to test cost management behavior of small restaurant firms and identify whether managers of these small restaurants behave differently depending on their management and ownership structure. The sample was comprised of 87 small restaurant firms identified from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances (SSBF). Cost of doing business, size of staff, and five performance measures were used as dependent variables. Independent variables included management and ownership type. Study findings identified significant differences in the profit margin depending on management type and ownership percentage of the primary owner. We also find that the cost of doing business (total expenses) varies depending upon single-family majority/minority ownership and the ownership percentage of the primary owner. The results support the notion that small restaurant firms are operated differently depending on their management and ownership structure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The regulation of Swedish municipal accounting has gone through fundamental changes over recent decades. On 1 January 1998, municipal accounting became regulated by law, after having been merely voluntarily regulated in the past. Using the lens of agency theory as well as institutional theory, this paper explores how legislation and chosen form of association influence the harmonization of accounting and the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the Swedish water and sewage sector. Through comparisons of survey data from the year before and five years after the legislation, the study analyzes whether the legislation has affected the level of harmonization. Even though municipal accounting now is regulated by law, the requirements for aspects such as auditing are still much lower for municipals than for companies; the requirements for accountability are much lower for municipal agents than for companies. The study also analyzes whether there is any relationship between form of association and level of harmonization. The results do not indicate that the legislation had any effect on harmonization; neither do the results show any significant relationship between form of association and level of harmonization.

Departing from the usual debates regarding the superiority of one governance structure over another, this study aims to complement the prior institutional approach by addressing how a firm's internal governance, via board competence and managerial incentives, shapes innovation performance. In a sample of 178 Taiwanese firms in the high-tech industries, the study sets out to examine the innovation-enhancing effects of the firm-level governance arrangements prescribed by agency theory. The results show that the effective governance, characterised by vigilant control through a competent board and the incentives of managers through equity ownership, are conducive to the desired and valued outcomes of innovation by aligning the risk differential between principals and agents. This universal relationship is further extended to a contingency perspective that innovation can be more significantly achieved by managerial risk readiness through a tight coupling of internal governance and the correspondingly appropriate strategy profile. The findings stress that governance and a clear posture of differentiation in high-tech environments are, arguably, multiple bases on which innovation is sought.

Recent accounting scandals have brought focus on the role of management in financial statement manipulation. This focus on micro-behavior does not capture the complexities of earnings management. Taking an institutional rather than agency theory approach, earnings management is posited as a decoupled behavior. A behavior that results from not only agency-based motivations of self-interests, but also regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive legitimacy pressures. Conformity to the central logic of "maximizing shareholder value" found in the "US financial market" institutional field provides the context in which to explore earnings management as a decoupled behavior. Insights for earnings management include the blending of agency and institutional theory perspectives to gain a more complete understanding of the behavior and the positing of a continuum of earnings management conducive to this merger. Institutional theory benefits from exploring the nesting in multiple institutional fields. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Corporate governance (CG) needs to acknowledge the intentional part of governance, where an actor of governance uses the set of corporate governance mechanisms in order to influence the agent to create a performance that will satisfy the interest of the principal. This paper offers a conception of this activity through the concept of governance strategy. The concept is based on a property right approach and derived within the context of agency theory, stressing the interest and the capacity of the principal. It is applied to two empirical organisations seldom investigated in CG research: the organisation of multinational corporations in a business group and the organisation of a riding school in a democratic not-for-profit association, thereby extending the relevance of the concept from corporate governance to organizational governance. The empirical analysis indicates the relevance of the conception and suggests further extension through hypotheses of governance strategy related to environmental influence, accessibility of governance mechanisms and momentum of mechanisms.

Pay Without Performance: The Unfilled Promise of Executive Compensation by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried (Harvard University Press, 2004) challenges the view that executive remuneration arrangements are designed to maximise shareholder value. The authors argue that managerial power results in remuneration being structured to benefit executives at the expense of shareholders. This paper contends that Bebchuk and Fried's approach illustrates issues that contribute to the problematic nature of executive remuneration research. In particular, it is proposed that a priori conceptions about executive remuneration, methodological dogmatism in research approaches and a significant gap between theory and practice, each contribute to the lack of convergence in executive pay research. Illustrative data taken from interview-based research conducted with Australian non-executive directors supports the view that reliance on economic efficiency arguments alone does not provide a sufficient framework to explain the subjective, judgemental and socially interactive processes involved in determining executive pay.

We present an empirical study of the joint impact of required capital and management incentive compensation on risk-taking in banking. Two separate branches of the extant literature are unified in this paper. The first branch holds that moral hazard associated with government-backed deposit insurance dictates the use of mandatory minimum capital requirements for commercial banks. The second branch argues that incentive compensation aligns the interests of managers and shareholders thus overcoming the inclination of managers to minimize risk at the expense of shareholder value. We employ a simultaneous equation model to mitigate the endogeneity between risk and the independent variables. The 1988 Basle Capital Accord is recognized as an exogenous shock to the capital ratios of commercial banks while CEO age and tenure are used as instruments for management compensation. Preliminary results produce a significant and negative coefficient on capital and a significant positive coefficient on pay-performance sensitivity. (c) 2007 John Mylonakis.

Using panel data for the period 1999-2003, this study shows that internal and external financing are not perfect substitutes, not corroborating the theorem of Modigliani and Miller. Portuguese service industries prefer internal to external financing, corroborating Pecking Order theory. The bigger the size of the company, the greater the level of debt, corroborating Trade-Off and Signalling theories. The negative relationship between the amount of fixed capital and debt corroborates Agency theory. The results allow us to conclude that debt contributes to improving management efficiency, agency problems between shareholders and creditors having little relevance.

Purpose - The purpose of the study is to explore the board of directors in leveraged buyouts (LBOs) as a distinct source of value creation and to conceptually investigate the going-private transaction via LBO as a response to deficient governance structures as well as the post-buyout board restructuring. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a review of the literature on LBOs boards, and relies on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to develop testable propositions. The work suggests that the board as a particular source of efficiency gains in LBOs warrants further empirical research. Research limitations/implications - The paper gives strong credence to the argument that boards represent a unique source of value creation in LBOs. Previous agency-theoretic work is complemented by focusing on the monitoring function of the board, but resource dependence theory introduced to suggest the importance of a strategic service and support function. The work is conceptual in nature and thus requires subsequent empirical testing to verify assertions set forth in this study. Practical implications - The paper shows that incentives of managerial equity participation and the discipline of debt are gradually losing their distinctiveness in today's buyout industry. To compete in an increasingly crowded environment, LBO specialists need to identify new sources of value to generate attractive returns for their investors. Originality/value - The paper extends the existing LBO literature by introducing resource dependent as a complementary framework. Given that the traditional LBO literature examines the discipline of debt and managerial ownership that explain their efficiencies, the role of LBO boards as a distinct value creation mechanism in buyouts is introduced.

Negative changes in lending terms could create a worse financial crisis for the small business than that faced by the firm from not getting the loan in the first place. This study examines the drivers of such negative changes using an agency perspective. Agency theory predicts that a borrowing firm's access to debt financing depends on its ability to deal with the agency problems between lender and borrower arising from asymmetric information. Using data collected by Industry Canada, this study found that dealing with agency issues decreases the likelihood that the credit terms of a small business will change adversely. Thus, we show the importance for the small business to develop and improve continually its resources for minimizing agency problems between the firm and its lender. (c) 2007, Copyright CCSBE/CCPME.

Can a stock exchange improve corporate governance and transparency by designating companies that exhibit superior corporate governance? In 2000, the Borsa Italiana created a mid-cap segment with strong listing standards, which is composed of firms (called STARS) that follow stricter standards of transparency, disclosure, monitoring and liquidity. We find that STAR firms exhibit governance characteristics not observed in non-STAR firms, such as a higher incidence of audit and executive committees and higher debt ratios. They experienced a modestly favorable share price response upon the implementation of the STAR initiative. Moreover, they experienced significantly higher buy and hold returns and transparency after the initiative. Several governance characteristics are cross-sectionally associated with performance following the STAR initiative. Overall, the results suggest that firms may be willing to improve governance when they are endorsed by a credible agency for doing so, and such improvements may lead to better performance. The STAR initiative may serve as a model that can be adapted by other stock exchanges to promote transparency and governance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Privacy protection is part of the social demand, which is rendered more crucial by the introduction of new technologies of information and communication in the workplace. Indeed, they improve the capacities of traditional systems for control and offer new ways to monitor (cybersurveillance) and to collect personal data. "Big Brother is Watching" can illustrate the perceptions about the workplace of numerous employees. Can we reconcile privacy protection of employees with the enterprise's needs ? This article is mainly devoted to the legal aspects of this theme, in French organizations. First of all, we study why it is impossible to establish a tight frontier between an employee's private life and his/her professional life. The main reason is that we are not able to determine precisely the outlines of the sphere of personal life. The notions of "privacy", "private life" and "personal life" are extremely vague and variable in legal literature. We propose an original characterization of the notion of "personal life", in terms of "dominant logics" : the logics of self-determination and of informational control on personal data. Next, we explore the economic stakes of the right to privacy with respect to employment relationships : what are the economic consequences of its respect, as regards secrecy and liberty ? We start with the economic analysis of privacy as made by Posner, Hirshleifer and Rosenberg. These authors study the right of privacy in terms of "informational asymmetry", and they get back to Akerlof's demonstration of the risk of adverse selection during the phase of recruitment. The right to privacy seems to produce economic costs. After having exposed the responses given by the jurisprudence during the last fi fteen years and by the laws in France, we establish a critical analysis of French legal principles. Firstly, they permit to reduce informational asymmetry if there is a risk of ineffi ciency. Secondly, when they protect personal life, legal rules appear as an help to make rational decisions in selecting only relevant information. Further on, we explore the "post"-contractual phase of the work relationship once the employment contract has been concluded. To respect employees' personal life implies to reduce monitoring and to give them autonomy and trust.-On the one hand, if we adopt the agency theory point of view, the respect of personal life can be seen as a source of moral hazard (post-contractual opportunism) because of the informational asymmetry. But we show that this analysis is hold up by hypotheses of extrinsic, amoral and asocial motivations of employees.-On the other hand, if we adopt the self-determination theory as developed in applied psychology, the respect of personal life can be seen as a source of self regulated motivations (intrinsic, moral and pro-social motivations) and high task involvement. We conclude that when the work situation permits and requires self regulated motivations, managers should choose high levels of respect for privacy. However, when only extrinsic, amoral and asocial motivation can emerge from a work design, managers should be allowed to reduce such respect. What are the answers under French law ? We fi nd considerable uncertainty to exist as regards an employee's right to autonomy. This has broad economic consequences : managers can choose between optimal levels of monitoring and incentives or simply trust and grant autonomy. In others words, they have the legal possibility to choose between different levels of respect of the employees' personal life. Nevertheless, a set of legal rules determines legal practice : restriction of liberties, activities for monitoring and informational searches about employees must satisfy principles of transparence, proportionality and relevancy.

This paper examines the impact that the relationship between a corporation's board and treasury staff has on foreign exchange hedging policy. Using survey evidence from New Zealand non-financial firms, we find that firms with a more powerful board, more staff, and larger exposures are more likely to have a treasury policy. In addition, firms with a more powerful board are less likely to use options to hedge their exposure. Finally, the majority of firms change hedging decisions based on financial forecasts despite the evidence that these are of no value. (c) by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper studies secrecy in voting and the role of information on coalition building in corporate governance. It finds evidence that supports the coalition building hypothesis and, in part, rejects the agency cost hypothesis. The conditions for insiders and large outsiders to form coalitions are examined. The results are consistent with insiders and large outsiders cooperating and voting as a block to maintain power, this imposes costs on other shareholders. Consistent with the agency theory and the coalition building theory, management initiated amendments have a more negative impact than shareholder initiated amendments. The Vote Your Conscience theory is rejected.

This chapter explains how the agency theory can be used to prevent a development of divergent interests between the management team and investors after a management buy-out (MBO). Agency costs are caused by increased costs of monitoring by the investor to overcome the problems of self-interest, risk aversion, goal conflict, and information asymmetry. The chapter focuses MBOs divested from foreign or local parent companies, of which the majority of the equity after the MBO is owned by venture capitalist. The chapter focuses on the agency costs of equity and debt by analyzing the monitoring role of venture capitalists, the goal congruence between the new shareholders, the financial unification, and the repayment of debt. These mechanisms motivate managers to look for efficiencies to protect the firm against the downside risks as well as for new market opportunities to use the firms' upside potential. Examples are efficiencies in investment programs, in cutting overhead cost, and in disposal of assets. The mechanisms reduce the agency problem by stimulating the agent to make decisions that are in the interest of the principal and result in an improvement of economic performance after the MBO.

Although agency theory argues that there is a direct relationship between ownership patterns and performance, the empirical evidence to date has been mixed. However, previous studies have focused on samples of large mature firms in a single country. Combining agency and institutional perspectives, this paper examines performance effects of two types of private equity investors (venture capitalists and business angels) and ownership concentration in firms that have recently undergone an IPO in the UK and France. Using a unique, hand-collected dataset of 242 matched IPOs in the two countries, it argues that legal institutions can moderate the effects of different types of owners and ownership concentration on performance. Our findings support the argument that concentrated ownership impacts performance, but this effect is stronger in France. Second, it is shown that the two types of private equity investors have a differential impact on performance, but this impact is found to be influenced by the legal institutions in the given country.

A large conceptual economic literature presents assumptions that family owned and controlled firms perform better than others, essentially on the basis of agency theory, ownership structure, cultural specificities and particular management practices. Large empirical evidence has been supplied by various studies, even if there are still contradictory debates. This paper uses the paired samples methodology to compare operational, economic and financial profitabilities of Belgian family firms. Evidence is given that they perform better, and this significantly for economic profitability. Discussion is engaged about the contribution of family values and practices to their results.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the connection between earnings management and corporate social responsibility (CSR). We argue that earnings management practices damage the collective interests of stakeholders; hence, managers who manipulate earnings can deal with stakeholder activism and vigilance by resorting to CSR practices. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a multi-national panel sample of 593 firms from 26 countries between 2002 and 2004, we find a positive impact of earnings management practices on CSR; this relationship holds for different robustness checks. Also, we demonstrate that the combination of earnings management and CSR has a negative impact on financial performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study draws on a generalized agency theory where managers are seen as the agents of all stakeholders and the earnings management literature to highlight that CSR can be used to garner support from stakeholders and, therefore, provides an opportunity for entrenchment to those managers that manipulate earnings. As such, it suggests new avenues of research for both the corporate governance literature, as well as for the stakeholder perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights for policy makers and managers interested in enhancing CSR. For managers, our findings suggest that projecting a socially-friendly image in order to disguise earnings management cannot be sustained over time due to the detrimental effect on financial performance. In addition, this study provides a warning signal to policy makers that certain practices geared toward raising a firm's CSR may simply be a mechanism for hindering other devious practices.

Using panel data on 275 German exchange-listed companies I examine the relationship between founding-family ownership and firm performance. By separating the family effect from general blockholder effects, the paper shows that family firms are not only more profitable than widely-held firms but also outperform companies with other types of blockholders. However, the performance of family businesses is only better in firms in which the founding-family is still active either on the executive or the supervisory board. These findings suggest that family ownership is related to superior firm performance only under certain conditions. If families are just large shareholders without board representation, the performance of their companies is not distinguishable from other firms. In addition, the results indicate that other blockholders either affect firm performance adversely or have no detectable influence on performance measures. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We use agency theory to examine the influence of ownership structure on the relationship between financial slack and R&D investments, highlighting how that relationship might differ depending on the identity of the owners, and their potentially different interests. In doing so, we extend the scope of agency theory by examining the principal-principal conflicts of interests that may exist among different types of owners. Using a sample of Korean manufacturing firms in R&D-intensive industries between 1998 and 2003, we find that financial slack has an inverted U-shaped relationship with R&D investments. Furthermore, that relationship varies depending on the presence of different types of owners. Family ownership positively moderates the relationship between financial slack and R&D investments, whereas domestic institutional investors and foreign investors negatively moderate that relationship. Our results show that distinguishing among different types of owners is instrumental in enhancing our understanding of the nature of the relationship between financial slack and R&D investments.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This is a cross-sectional study of the relation between corporate governance and voluntary disclosure in Ireland. Research Findings/Results: We report clear evidence that voluntary disclosure increases with the number of nonexecutive directors on the board. Firms that have a nonexecutive chairman make greater voluntary disclosures than other firms. This finding is not robust to the inclusion of other explanatory variables. We find no evidence that ownership structure is related to voluntary disclosure. Theoretical Implications: The results regarding nonexecutive directors are interpreted as independent boards facilitating a reduction in information asymmetry between owners and managers. While this supports the predictions of agency theory, the absence of evidence that ownership structure influences voluntary disclosure does not. It is posited that sociological and organizational factors (e.g., informal networking) that pervade the Irish market mitigate against our disclosure measure capturing all aspects of voluntary disclosure. Furthermore, indirect evidence is provided that there are other costs and benefits to disclosure that vary across firms and may outweigh agency costs in many situations. We conclude that while agency theory has some explanatory power for voluntary disclosure, it cannot explain all the cross-sectional differences in voluntary disclosure by Irish public limited companies. Practical Implications: The results support the attention paid by regulators to the proportion of nonexecutive directors on the board. However, the costs and benefits to disclosure vary across firms. Regardless of agency considerations and regulatory guidelines, firms will ultimately formulate their disclosure policy with reference to overall marginal costs and marginal benefits.

We contribute to multiple agency theory by examining cases in which ventures making initial public offerings (IPOs) have managerial agents on their boards whose goals conflict with those of the investment bank agents hired to underwrite the stock. Underwriters have an incentive to underprice IPOs to maintain strong ties with institutional investors. We develop theory on agent differences based on time horizons and risk taking by managerial agents as framed through behavioral agency theory. Examining governance mechanisms, we find both monitoring by board insiders and board experience decrease underpricing. Furthermore, underpricing increases when venture capitalists have prior ties with underwriters. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

We examine the influence of CEO equity-based compensation on strategic risk taking by the firm. Building off the Behavioral Agency Model, Agency Theory, and Prospect Theory, we develop arguments about when equity-based compensation elements will increase or decrease executive risk propensity and, in turn, strategic risk taking. Incorporating a behavioral perspective into our models of incentive alignment provides us with new and potentially more accurate predictions about how individual elements of CEO pay will influence risk selection, as well as how equity compensation interacts with cash compensation and with other factors to influence risk preferences. In general, this study provides evidence that CEO equity-based compensation significantly influences strategic risk, but that this influence is more nuanced and complex than conventional treatments of executive compensation assume. In particular, we find that different forms of equity-based pay exhibit dissimilar influences on strategic risk and that their influence changes as their value and vesting status change. Second, we find that cash-based forms of pay moderate the incentive properties of equity-based pay, indicating that cash-based pay may affect how executives perceive risks associated with equity pay. Finally, we find that stock price volatility and board actions each also moderate the incentive effects of equity-based pay. In sum, our results argue for increased recognition of a behavioral perspective on executive compensation and greater precision in how we measure and model the incentive alignment properties of CEO compensation.

Based on both economic and sociological theory, the effects of supervisory control and organizational support on the frequency and effort of individuals in contributing their personally held valuable knowledge to a "best practices-lessons learned, repository-based" knowledge management system (KMS) were compared. Supervisory control, as expected, had significant impact on frequency, but it also had unexpectedly significant influence on effort. When system variables-usefulness and ease of use-were controlled for, the organizational support measure had little effect on either outcome. These results provide greater support for economic-agency-theory motivators of knowledge sharing and lesser support for organizational support motivators than has been previously believed. They also emphasize the important impact of systems variables in motivating KMS use. Since the study was conducted in a government (joint civilian-military) organization, the organizational type may significantly influence the results. However, since the result is contrary to the conventional wisdom that suggests that a "knowledge-sharing culture" is all-important, at the very least, this study shows that the nature of the organization may moderate the relationship between the motivational approach and the outcomes.

This article contributes to the social networks literature by examining how corporate governance factors influence CEOs' external advice-seeking behaviors. We incorporate insights from social networks research into an agency theory perspective to predict, and demonstrate empirically, that governance factors recommended by agency theory increase CEOs' tendencies to seek out advice contacts who are likely to offer perspectives on strategic issues that differ from their own; these advice-seeking behaviors ultimately enhance firm performance. Accordingly, this article also contributes to the corporate governance literature by describing how and why CEOs' advice networks mediate the effects of governance factors on firm performance.

The objective of this paper is to provide a more comprehensive view of corporate governance than that considered by the traditional agency literature predominately employed in auditing and accounting studies of governance. Specifically, we discuss three widely recognized additional theoretical perspectives: resource dependence, managerial hegemony, and institutional theory. Resource dependence is developed in the strategic management literature and focuses on the contribution of governance mechanisms as a vehicle to help a firm achieve or further its strategic objectives. In contrast with the agency and resource dependence perspectives which offer a functional view of governance, the managerial hegemony perspective views the board and its attendant committees as being under the control of management and hence could be potentially viewed as dysfunctional from a stakeholder viewpoint. Finally, institutional theory, developed in the sociology of organizations and organizational behavior literatures, suggests that it is necessary to understand the substance of the interactions between different governance parties and how these parties use at times symbolic gestures and activities to maintain their form to all relevant parties. Although the value of using multiple theoretical perspectives with respect to governance has been well recognized in the economics and behavioral literatures, this is the first paper that we are aware of that examines the effect of using alternative theories of governance on auditing issues that are influenced by the governance structure of a firm. In addition, we examine how these theories provide a useful basis for reconciling conflicting findings in the existing agency-based audit-related governance literature. Finally, we provide examples of how these alternative theories provide important new insights to issues in auditing research and practice.

Synthesizing agency theory and prospect theory, we examined the effects of stock-based incentives on CEO earnings manipulation behaviors. In analyses of data compiled from the public companies listed in Compustat's Executive Compensation Database and a U.S. General Accounting Office restatements database, we found that CEOs were more likely to manipulate firm earnings when they had more out-of-the-money options and lower stock ownership. Firm performance and CEO tenure interacted with out-of-the-money options and ownership to influence CEO earnings manipulation behaviors. Our findings inform agency-based views by providing evidence that, under certain conditions, stock-based managerial incentives lead to incentive misalignment.

We develop a conceptual model of the career horizon problem of CEOs approaching retirement and discuss its implications on firm risk taking, specifically in engagement in international acquisitions. Based on prospect theory and agency theory, we emphasize the legacy conservation and wealth preservation concerns of CEOs and investigate how their holdings of in-the-money unexercised options and firm equity accentuate or mitigate the career horizon problem. The model is tested in the context of international acquisitions with a sample of 293 U.S. firms over a five-year period (1995-1999). We find that a longer CEO career horizon is associated with a higher likelihood of international acquisitions. We also find that CEOs nearing retirement with high levels of in-the-money unexercised options and equity holdings are less likely to engage in international acquisitions than CEOs with low levels of in-the-money options and equity holdings. The study raises important considerations about the implications of CEOs ' equity and in-the-money option holdings on firm risk taking at various stages of their career horizon.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper analyzes the role of boards of directors in constraining research and development (R&D) spending manipulation. Extant research on earnings management indicates that independent directors reduce accounting accruals manipulation; however, there is little evidence on their effectiveness in limiting potentially value reducing R&D cuts motivated by short-term earnings pressures. Research Findings/Results: Using a large sample of UK firms, I study whether independent boards are efficient at detecting and constraining myopic R&D cuts. The results indicate that more independent boards constrain the manipulation of R&D expenditure. The research design controls for the potential confounding effect of the decision to capitalize vs. expense R&D outlays. Theoretical Implications: The results indicate that independent directors have sufficient technical knowledge to identify opportunistic reductions in R&D, and efficiently constrain opportunistic R&D spending. Practical Implications: The evidence supports the emphasis that recent policy statements have put on increasing the number of independent directors on corporate boards. This study offers insights to policy makers interested in enhancing the monitoring role of corporate boards. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

An important feature of most franchise chains is that they simultaneously use franchised and company-owned outlets. In this study, I show that the relationship between the resources provided to outlet managers and the financial performance of franchise chains is contingent on their governance structure. Specifically, opportunism and knowledge considerations seem to prevent chains with a large proportion of franchised outlets from fully leveraging resources such as a valuable brand name and tacit business practices. On the other hand, brand name value and business practices tacitness are not directly related to the proportion of franchised outlets in chains. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Using a sample of 714 private family influenced businesses in Germany, we investigate the relationship of goal alignment between owners and managers and the existence of a board of directors. Agency theory and stewardship theory serve as theoretical bases for our study. We find that firms with relatively high levels of goal alignment are less likely to have a board of directors. Our results provide support for the substitution hypothesis of formal by social control mechanisms. Furthermore, the findings show that firms without a board and with relatively low levels of goal alignment have less family members in the top management team. This circumstance might in turn be a trigger for owners to install a board. (c) 2008 International Council for Small Business.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and firm performance and the moderating effects of the family control factor on this relationship with respect to public companies in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs publicly available data from financial databases and the annual reports of a sample of 128 publicly-listed companies in Hong Kong in 2003. Findings - Neither agency theory nor stewardship theory alone can adequately explain the duality-performance relationship. The empirical evidence suggests that the relationship between CEO duality and accounting performance is contingent on the presence of the family control factor. CEO duality is good for non-family firms, while non-duality is good for family-controlled firms. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on publicly available financial data, and actual board processes are not observed. Practical implications - The design of board leadership structure is contingent on corporate ownership and control (family control or not). Originality/value - The paper provides empirical evidence that CEO duality is not necessarily bad for public companies in Hong Kong and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, business practitioners, and academic researchers.

Empirical research in the area of corporate sustainability highlights potential conflicts between corporate financial performance and environmental performance. In such a situation, agency theory arguments applied to the corporate environmental context predict that top management compensation should be explicitly linked to environmental performance in order to bring about proper alignment of organizational environmental goals and management incentives. We test this proposition for a sample of 207 Standard & Poor 500 firms in the US in 1996 who explicitly report in Investor Responsibility Research Council (IRRC) surveys the presence or absence of a contractual link between environmental performance and executive compensation. We find that only in firms with an explicit linkage between environmental performance and executive contracts is there is any evidence of a significant impact of firm-level environmental performance on CEO compensation levels. However, even this impact is not very impressive since (a) it holds only for IRRC compliance and spill indices and does not hold for IRRC toxic emission indices, and (b) even the effects for compliance and spill indices do not hold relative to industry levels of these indices.

Business groups, the leading economic players in emerging economies, have responded to the market-oriented transition primarily through corporate restructuring. Agency theory predicts that acquisition and divestiture would serve the interests of dominant families and foreign investors in different ways. Further, dominant families, foreign investors from shareholder-based countries, and foreign investors from stakeholder-based countries each operate under distinct institutional logics of appropriate restructuring strategies. We test hypotheses about agency and institutional mechanisms using large business groups in Taiwan between 1986 and 1998 as our empirical example. We find that, consistent with both mechanisms, family-controlled business groups are less likely to divest of unrelated businesses. However, the institutional logics mechanism can better explain the relative lack of unrelated acquisition in family-controlled groups and the difference in divestiture between groups with more shareholder-based foreign investment and those with more stakeholder-based investment. Our study contributes to the neo-institutional perspective of corporate restructuring and strategic management in general by empirically separating the two mechanisms and examining organizational responses to conflicting institutional logics. Our study also adds to the understanding of business group restructuring in emerging economies. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

We argue that the norms underlying agency theory can be inappropriate for interpreting the ethicality of corporate governance decisions and behaviors of Russians because they were developed in countries with mature market-oriented economies. We posit that integrative social contracts theory has more explanatory power, taking into account two sets of often-conflicting values: traditional Russian values and market-oriented values. We describe three examples of ethical conflict in Russian corporate governance arising from these two sets of values and discuss implications for Western managers interacting with Russians in this crucial area of business activity.

This paper investigates the impact of multiple directorships on corporate diversification. We hypothesize that multiple directorships affect the quality of managerial oversight and, thus, influence the degree of corporate diversification and firm value. The empirical evidence lends credence to this notion. Specifically, we find that directors' busyness is inversely related to firm value. In other words, firms where board members hold more outside board seats suffer a deeper diversification discount. Further analysis also reveals that the negative effect of having overcommitted directors on the board is more pronounced in firms where agency costs are more severe, suggesting that the diversification discount is driven by agency conflicts. Our results aptly fit into the on-going debate on the benefits and detriments of multiple directorships. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Purpose - This study aims to focus on the accountability of organizations to multiple stakeholders with differing interests and power, where there is an absence of accountability towards shareholders. Design/methodology/approach - Longitudinal field study via participant-observation. Findings - The study focuses on the relations between the subsidiary and the parent boards and how a governance improvement plan affected the internal dynamics of the organization and helped to clarify the demands of multiple stakeholders. A stakeholder-agency model is developed which emphasises the role of governance, the importance of structure and process, and the culture or ethos of boards in which multiple stakeholders may have compatible rather than competing interests. Originality/value - The paper focuses on the quasi-public sector and develops stakeholder-agency theory by identifying governance at the centre of differing relationships with stakeholders with unequal salience where there is both an economic concern with efficiency and a broader social concern.

Peer monitoring, which occurs when individuals notice and respond to their peers' behavior or performance results, is an informal organizational control that has not been extensively studied. Agency theory suggests that peer monitoring should be associated with higher performance because it allows workers whose interests are aligned with those of the organization to encourage their peers to perform well and deters inappropriate behavior by increasing the chances that it would be detected. This paper considers two research questions. The first is, "What is peer monitoring?" We found two types of peer monitoring. Direct peer monitoring occurs when workers notice their peers' behavior or results and respond in a forthright way, such as correcting coworkers who make mistakes. Indirect peer monitoring occurs when workers gossip about or avoid poorly performing peers. The second research question is, "Is peer monitoring associated with higher work-unit performance?" We examined the effects of both types of peer monitoring on the performance of 67 theme park work units. We considered supervisory monitoring, task interdependence, and cohesiveness as moderators. We measured performance as the degree to which the work unit is free of employee behavior problems and found a positive main effect of direct peer monitoring. The effect was stronger when supervisory monitoring was low or task interdependence was high. Indirect peer monitoring did not have a main effect on work-unit performance, but when supervisory monitoring or cohesiveness was high, indirect peer monitoring was associated with lower performance. We discuss these results and suggest areas for future research. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

A large body of literature has examined how managerial ownership affects corporate strategy and risk-taking. The present study extends this literature by investigating the effect of other forms of corporate ownership on a firm's equity risk (measured as the volatility of a company's stock returns) and stock returns in the People's Republic of China (PRC) - an important emerging economy that is rich in various forms of corporate ownership. We find that the various types of corporate ownership appear to have important but different impacts on equity risk and returns. In particular, companies with more state ownership tend to have higher stock volatility and lower stock returns; in contrast, companies with more legal-person ownership tend to have lower stock volatility and higher stock returns. Foreign and managerial ownership are found to have little effect on firms' equity risk and returns. These findings support the predictions of agency theory - for example, that state ownership increases agency conflicts in companies because bureaucrats and state agencies do not have the same economic incentives to maximize the value of firms. We believe that our study contributes to the international business literature on investment strategy and risk assessment in developing markets such as China, and as a result our findings could have important implications for international investors.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the impact of corporate governance on the cash-holding policies of firms with different investment opportunities. It is difficult to determine the optimal level of cash holdings for "listed new economy" firms (firms in the computer, software, Internet, telecommunications, or networking industries), which require large amounts of capital for investment opportunities with high return potential. Unlike in "old economy" firms, for which investment opportunities are relatively limited, corporate governance in listed new economy firms may create shareholder protections that make investors willing to accept higher levels of corporate cash holdings. Research Findings/Results: By examining American Standard and Poor 1,500 companies, the evidence shows that CEO ownership and board independence affect the cash holdings in listed new economy and old economy firms differently. Specifically, higher managerial cash holdings tend to reduce cash holdings in old economy firms and higher board independence tend to increase cash holdings in listed new economy firms. Theoretical Implications: This study provides empirical support for the association between agency theory and cash theories. Given different firm characteristics, the impact of corporate governance on cash holdings verifies the implication of agency theory in explaining corporate cash policy. Practical Implications: While firms in new economy industries may be eager for more flexible governance codes in order to maintain the freedom of decision making, the evidence from this study suggests that establishing effective governance mechanisms may, in turn, effectively enlarge the degree of freedom for these firms to make timely business decisions.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper aims at exploring the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance in the context of a small European capital market. Further developing existing literature, we acknowledge the multi-dimensionality of ownership by including both the fraction of shares owned by the five largest shareholders and the fraction of shares owned by management. Research Findings/Results: Using panel data for the period 2000-2003 with respect to the Italian market, we find that the ownership concentration of the five largest shareholders is beneficial to firm valuation. On the contrary, managerial ownership is beneficial only in non-concentrated firms, suggesting that the controlling owner may use his/her position in the firm to extract private benefits at the expense of the other shareholders by appointing managers that represent its own interest. Theoretical Implications: This study provides empirical support for the agency theory and the managerial entrenchment argument. As such, it suggests new avenues of research for the ownership structure literature willing to reflect the diverging interests of different types of shareholders and to explore both endogeneity and non-linearity issues. Practical Implications: This study contributes to the recent debate on the effects of government regulations inspired by the Anglo-Saxon model of corporate governance in the small European countries. In questioning the alleged competitive superiority of the widely held company, our paper also suggests that the existence of good corporate law is not a sufficient condition for the development of a corporate economy resembling the US model.

Foreign firms from emergent economies are increasingly seeking equity capital in developed economies like the United States. Utilizing institutional, signaling, and agency theories this research examines the legitimacy of foreign IPOs (initial public offerings) in the United States. Employing the population of foreign IPOs listed on U.S. stock exchanges between 1997 and 2004, it is demonstrated that firms from countries with governmental policies and institutional practices that protect the economic freedom of its citizens are significantly less underpriced than IPOs of firms originating from countries experiencing lower levels of economic freedom. The evidence further indicates that firms from emerging economies can overcome negative country perceptions associated with lower levels of legitimacy by increasing their international scope of operations prior to beginning the IPO process as well as by retaining acceptable levels of ownership in their respective firms.

Purpose - The relationship between the board characteristics (i.e. board independence, CEO duality, board size, board meeting and board tenure) and the ownership structure (i.e. managerial ownership, family ownership and institutional ownership) and earnings quality is examined. Design/methodology/ approach - Data from 280 non-financial companies listed on Bursa Malaysia's Main Board for the year 2004 is used. Findings - Significant association was found between board tenure and earnings quality. In addition, a positive significant association was found between outside board ownership and family ownership and earnings quality. However no significant relationship was found between board of directors' independence and earnings quality. Research limitations/implications - The association between audit committees' characteristics and earnings quality was not examined. An examination of the impact of ownership structure on boards of directors and audit committees is warranted. An investigation of the impact of the ownership structure on earnings quality in Malaysia using separate test on family-controlled and non-family-controlled firms is suggested. Practical implications - The appropriateness of policy directives requiring majority independent directors may be considered by policy makers. Originality/value - The conflict of interest between outside shareholders and managers in a diffused ownership support the agency theory. However, utility of agency theory to explain the conflicts between the controlling owners and the minority shareholders where ownership concentration is prevalent is limited. Whilst demonstrating the dominant impact of ownership structure on earnings quality in Malaysia the study calls for alternative explanations of corporate governance practices in different institutional settings.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this paper, we examine the determinants of the level of disclosure on corporate governance practices among European listed companies in the time period preceding the adoption of the European Union recommendations and Action Plan. Research Findings/Results: Using ratings on corporate governance disclosure issued by an independent rating agency we find that - ceteris paribus - the level of disclosure: (1) is lower for companies with higher ownership concentration; (2) is higher for companies from common-law countries; and (3) increases with the level of working capital accruals. Theoretical Implications: The results of the study support theoretical arguments that companies disclose corporate governance information in order to reduce information asymmetry and agency costs stemming from the separation between ownership and control, and to improve investor confidence in the reported accounting information. The study suggests various avenues for future research on corporate governance. Practical Implications: To policy makers and practitioners, the results suggest that a mandatory corporate governance disclosure requirement is abundant, and perhaps could even be inefficient. The results also indicate which types of companies can be expected to be least willing to comply with recent corporate governance disclosure requirements, and thus will need extra monitoring.

Aftermarket sales and profits are becoming an increasingly important part of an original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) business model. Because replacement parts often do not require further manufacturing, OEMs act as intermediaries in the aftermarket. As with any intermediary, the OEM must concern itself with suppliers disintermediating its supply chain selling replacement parts directly to the OEM's customers. We frame supply chain disintermediation (SCD) as a principal-agent contracting problem between an OEM buyer and a supplier. Hypotheses relate contract conditions, goal incongruence, supplier capabilities and contract enforcement to SCD. The data are collected from the aerospace industry using a multimethod study, combining an Internet-based survey with archival data. Causal modeling with structural equation modeling (SEM) shows general support for the hypotheses. Particularly, SCD is positively related to buyer-supplier goal incongruence. The agency model offers insights that differ from previous transaction-cost-based models of buyer-supplier relationships. OEM buyers with a lucrative aftermarket should consider aligning goals through incentives rather than relying entirely on economic hostages associated with specific assets.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This paper examines the role of audit committees (AC) in the initial public offering (IPO) process in a governance environment where AC best practices are well established but their adoption is voluntary. We consider the creation and characteristics of the committee as signals that issuing firms can use to reduce the underpricing often associated with IPOs. We also examine the effect of the committee on the quality of management earnings forecasts included in the prospectus. Research Findings/Results: Our empirical analysis is performed on a sample of 246 IPOs issued in the Canadian province of Quebec. We find that the creation of an AC at the time of the IPO has no effect on underpricing unless its members are independent and have expertise in financial matters, in which case it decreases significantly the level of underpricing of the IPO. However, we find no significant association between these two governance attributes and the accuracy of forecasts included in prospectuses. Theoretical Implications: Our results suggest that the AC is a credible signal that could be used in the firm's signaling strategy and the results provide support for the monitoring role of the board of directors, as proposed by the agency theory. Practical/Policy Implications: Our results support the worldwide movement in legislations requiring AC independence and expertise. They stress the importance of the presence of qualified members on the AC with sufficient knowledge of accounting and finance. (c) 2008 The Authors.

Purpose - Sharing of risk benefits supplies network collaborations. The complex mix of heterogeneous collaborators in supply networks, however, also increases the complexity of the risk profiles of inter-related components within these networks. For a given network collaboration, several structures of network relationship are possible, with each carrying distinctive risk implications. This paper seeks to develop a conceptual framework for analysing the differential risks in alternative network structures. Design/methodology/ approach - To capture the structural significance of inter-organisational dependency in networks, alternative typology of network relationships is formulated using agency theory. Basic constructs were developed for analysing risks in supply networks, with configurations ranging from the single-principal, single-agent to the complex multi-principal, multi-agent scenarios. Findings - The study finds that dynamics of risk in network systems depend not only on the typology of networks, but also on the functional role of each collaborator inherent in the network through agreements on supply and incentives, and supply performance. Originality/value - The proposed framework provides a structured approach for identifying and assessing risk dynamics and their differential impacts on different levels of supply networks. It provides insights into the dynamics of risk events and identifies network configurations that are vulnerable to different levels of risk. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

According to the agency theory, separation of ownership and control gives rise to manager's incentives to select and apply accounting estimates and techniques that can increase their own wealth. This issue has become more important in recent years as more firms are listed on stock exchanges as public firms. This study examines the association between the level of managerial ownership and earnings management activities, represented by the magnitude of discretionary accounting accruals in Malaysian listed firms. The results show that managerial ownership is negatively associated with the magnitude of accounting accruals. However, this study finds that managerial ownership is less important in large-sized firms compared to small-sized firms. This finding suggests that large-sized firms demand and use better corporate governance mechanisms due to higher agency conflicts, and, therefore, less managerial ownership is needed for control. As part of the ownership structure, this study also examines the roles of block and foreign ownerships in relation to the magnitude of discretionary accounting accruals.

Previous studies on Japanese corporate governance were largely based on the agency theory framework, and can be seen as attempts to understand the unique monitoring mechanisms in the Japanese context. This paper briefly reviews prior research and then discusses the recent changes in the environment that have been affecting Japanese corporate governance. Our central argument is that there is both change and continuity in Japanese Corporate Governance. We also present emerging research from an institutional theory perspective. In this line of research, corporate governance is treated as part of a nation's institutional framework and hence, researchers need to understand unique institutional arrangements that affect corporate governance practices and their change or continuity.

This paper deals with different organisational forms of collaborative procurement and provides insight into when to use which form. Different forms from the literature are compared with empirical examples to give an overview of forms, which are then described in terms of strategy, skills and organisation. Whilst acknowledging variations, the paper distinguishes between two main forms: virtual networks and third-party organisations. Using empirical data and four theoretical perspectives (transaction cost economics, resource-based view, contingency theory, agency theory), the paper reflects on when which form can be used and presents an overall framework to help choose an organisational form.

This paper focuses on two important characteristics of board effectiveness: (1) the proportion of independent non-executive directors; and (2) CEO Duality. The objective of this study is to examine whether the presence of a majority of independent non-executive directors and the separation role between chairman and CEO, as recommended in the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) 2000, effectively constrains the incidence of earnings management as measured by income-increasing and incomedecreasing discretionary accruals. Using data from the top 200 nonfinancial companies listed on Bursa Malaysia's Main Board and Second Board for the year 2004, this study finds a positive significant result of board independence when firms undershoot target earnings. Although contradictory to the prediction of agency theory, the results show that a higher proportion of independent non-executive directors is associated with higher income-increasing earnings manipulations. Neither board independence nor CEO Duality was found significant in other models tested regarding income-increasing and incomedecreasing earnings management. The results of this study cast doubt on the notion that the independence of directors and the role separation between the chairman and the CEO reduces the incidence of earnings management activity, especially with highly concentrated ownership as is typical in Malaysia.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show that corporate governance structures differ significantly across countries. Using agency theory and institutional theory, it examines how ownership structure and national culture influence the size and leadership structure of the corporate boards of multinational firms based in industrial countries. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested with data on 399 multinational manufacturing firms based in 15 industrial countries. The authors use ownership concentration, bank control, and state ownership to represent ownership structure. They view institutional structural norms as components of national culture and infer the nature of these norms for governance structure from Hofstede's national culture dimensions. Findings - The findings show that national culture has a dominant influence on corporate governance structure, and its emphasis is recommended in future cross-national organizational research. Research limitations/implications - Although the models were successful in explaining MNC board structure, the authors addressed only the effects of ownership structure and national culture. It is expected that these models could be improved by including national political and legal differences and additional national economic variables. Practical implications - The findings demonstrate that national cultures of the home countries of MNCs have powerful influences on their governance structures. Originality/value - This paper links national culture with governance structure. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Professional service firms have distinct operational challenges due to the type of work that is transacted by the employees of these firms, and due to the nature of the employees themselves. In this paper, we develop and present factors that influence professional service operations in firms and compensation structures for professional service providers. We establish professional service influence factors, which we posit will impact agency relationships in professional service firms. That is, we hypothesize that professional service influence factors (PSIFs) will moderate the effect of task programmability and outcome measurability in predicting the use of behavior- or outcome-based compensation schemes (control strategy). Logistic regression is used on data provided by 192 professional service providers in order to examine the impact of the agency variables and moderating factors on control strategies. The results indicate that company- and profession-based factors have moderating effects on task programmability when predicting control strategy. We discuss the implications of our findings.

Purpose This exploratory study aims to provide fresh insights into the ownership transfer of private family firms through internal management buy-out (MBO) and external management buy-in (MBI) succession routes. The paper aims to explore if flows of information impact the succession planning process and if the nature of succession planning impacts the business sale negotiation process relating to family firms that select MBO-MBI succession routes. Design-methodology-approach Guided by insights from agency theory and theories relating to information asymmetries and negotiation behaviour six hypotheses were derived. Private family firms that had received venture capital and the MBO-I deals had been completed between 1994 and 2003 were identified. A structured survey was administered to 117 senior members of acquiring MBO-I management teams after the deal had been completed in several European countries. Non-parametric chi-square tests and Mann-Whitney "U" tests were used to test the presented hypotheses. Findings Evidence highlights the importance of information sharing and that the family owner(s) may not always be in the strongest position. MBOs reported lower information asymmetry. Also, lower information asymmetry was reported when vendors and management were involved in succession planning. Internal managers with greater access to information were found to influence the negotiation process and determine who is more likely to benefit from the price to be paid for the firm. A mutually agreed price was less likely when management controlled information and when personal equity providers (PEP) were involved in the process supporting the interests of the MBO-I team. Practical implications Family firm owners need to plan for succession planning. Vendors of family firms need to leverage external professional advice when negotiating the sale of their ventures to ensure "family agendas" are protected. Originality-value This study has extended the conceptual work of Howorth et al. surrounding the succession of family firms through MBOs and MBIs. Rather than relying on case study evidence alone, cross-sectional survey evidence was explored within a univariate statistical framework to explore gaps in the knowledge base relating to succession planning and business sale negotiation behaviour.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue The relationship between board members and top executives is held central to corporate governance, yet studies of it are relatively few and our knowledge of its consequences is limited. This study aims to address how board-CEO relationships, in terms of power balance and social ties, contribute to the performance of new product introduction. It proposes a contingency view to highlight the context-dependent nature of such governance arrangements. Research Findings/Results Using survey and archival data in a sample of 198 industrial firms in Taiwan, this research finds that the two distinct types of board-CEO relationships relate curvilinearly to the performance of new product introduction. Furthermore, such universal relationships are moderated by market instability and board interlocks, respectively. Theoretical Implications: This study departs from the traditional agency view to an argument that fine-tuned board-CEO relationships, in light of sociopolitical and sociopsychological forces, and will serve as an essential enabling context for managerial risk taking. It demonstrates that research in this field should accommodate different theories to elaborate on the underlying tensions in the corporate governance and emphasize the merits of complementarity. Practical Implications: Acknowledging that good governance design softens managerial risk aversion, this study helps identify the governance conditions in which risk differentials between the board and CEO may align, and thus when exploratory efforts, in the form of new product introduction, are more likely to succeed.

This study investigates two disclosure variables (Extent and Quality) in relation to compliance with paragraph 4.1 (b) of AASB 1047 Disclosing the Impacts of Adopting Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards. Using a sample of 150 Australian listed firms, I find that the extent and quality of disclosure is influenced by firm size, leverage and auditor firm size, with the latter variable being the most significant. In general, the results suggest that many companies might have relied on sample disclosures provided by their auditors, perhaps limiting both quality and intent. Additionally, the ultimate usefulness of broad and imprecise standards might be questionable. Smaller companies might also require more guidance and assistance with their preparation for the adoption. (c) 2008 The Authors.

In this paper I first review the basic tenets of agency theory and theory of managerial capitalism as well as some of the major research in these areas then suggest for areas for future research that go beyond the extant empirical work. First, I suggest that it would be useful to reconsider the basic nature of the agency relationship, taking into account that while equity holders can be considered the principal, the board of directors may be more realistically in need of agent-like controls. Second, the complementary or supplementary nature of the monitoring/incentive alignment relationship has been shown theoretically but the empirical evidence is equivocal and needs future investigation. Third, there has been very limited research on the construct validity of archival measures of the sort used in agency theory. This requires the use of methodologies outside those of the more conventional type used in agency theory (i.e., from economics and finance). Finally, agency theory development would profit greatly by more extensive use of research methods such as laboratory studies and survey methodology and the integration of concepts such as personality and control processes.

Director compensation can potentially represent an ethical minefield. When faced with supporting strategic decisions that can lead to an increase in director pay, directors may consider their own interests and not solely those of the shareholders to whom they are legally bound to represent. In such cases, directors essentially become agents, rather than those installed to protect principals (shareholders) from agents. Using acquisitions as a study context, we employ a matched-pair design and find a statistically significant difference in outside director compensation between acquiring and control firms. Outside directors of acquiring firms earn more than twice as much as their counterparts in the matched-sample. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Incentive alignment, and risk and gain sharing, are argued to be key factors for the successful implementation of Supply Chain Management (SCM). Incentive-related issues can be improved by contract-based, information-based and trust-based solutions. The focus of this article is on contract mechanisms used in the context of high demand volatility, supply allocation and outsourced supply chains. Two case illustrations from a high-tech industry (Agilent and Hewlett Packard) describe recently implemented risk-sharing contracts, as well as experiences and issues regarding their implementation from a buyers' perspective. Although the work of implementing these more formal contracts is demanding, buyers are pleased with the results and the buyers also report pleased suppliers. In the cases, the main barrier to implementing risk-sharing contracts seems to be the shift in mindset and culture needed internally, especially among purchasers.

This study attempts to further the development of family business theory by providing a more detailed understanding of the differences between family and non-family firms' profitability, growth, exporting and networking behaviour. Utilising data from 2190 Australian SMEs, the study compares the Australian experience of differences between family and non-family firms with those found among Belgium firms. The Australian results are consistent with the growth and some of the networking behaviour found among Belgium firms, but not with their profitability and exporting behaviour. The study's findings support the contentions that the differences between family and non-family firms may be less than many earlier studies have indicated and that industry differences and cross-national differences in corporate governance environments may lead to variances in these differences. It also demonstrates that the underlying theoretical rationale for a number of predicted differences between family and non-family firms appears flawed. These findings indicate that new empirical studies that control for context are urgently needed to ensure the scholarly literature on family businesses is not being built on false assumptions. They also indicate that studies designed to explain differences in thefamily/ non-family business relationship between industries and nations may lead to advances in family business theory.

Achieving competitive advantage through a broader consideration of stakeholders of the firm is examined. The inclusion of other significant organisational actors such as managers and employees as stakeholders capable of creating competitive strategic advantage for the firm is considered. Findings indicate that competitive advantage within an economic perspective may be garnered by establishing a broader conceptualisation of stakeholders of the firm. It is concluded employees may be characterised as hybrid stakeholders, as they are a mix of residual risk bearers and input suppliers of strategically highly relevant resources and that ways of articulating employee voice is a key element of gaining competitive advantage. The aim of this paper is to analyse internationally operating modern public corporations from an agency theory point of view with the focus on the role of a suite of stakeholders including shareholders, managers and employees. The economic reasoning demonstrates that the employees' voice is an important component of business from a strategic perspective irrespective of the type of institutional environment present in any given country.

We examine the effect of non-mandatory corporate governance practices on a comprehensive set of audit judgments. We provide initial evidence on how auditors respond to corporate governance in an institutional environment where corporate governance is not mandated by law. Based on the agency and resource dependence theories, we hypothesise associations between corporate governance and auditors' judgments relating to client acceptance, risk assessments, and the extent and timing of substantive testing. Sixty Big 4 audit managers from Singapore are randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions comprising weak, moderate and strong corporate governance. Our results show auditors make more favourable client acceptance judgments when corporate governance is stronger. Clients with stronger corporate governance are assessed as having lower control environment risk. After controlling for control environment risk, we find that stronger corporate governance increases auditors' reliance on the client's internal controls and reduces the extent of substantive tests. When corporate governance is stronger, we observe that auditors conduct more substantive testing during the interim period compared to the year-end. Our findings suggest that audit strategies are responsive to the strength of a client's corporate governance.

Although the alignment effect of equity ownership is often studied with emphasis on changes in firm strategy, the exposure of CEOs' firm-specific wealth to firm risk is more easily controlled by changing their level of equity holdings than by changing firm strategic risk. We rely on prospect theory and the behavioral theory of the firm to examine the antecedents of CEO equity reduction and investigate whether it serves to decouple CEO wealth from firm risk. Given its central role in loss avoidance, we underline the effect of the firm's downside risk and distinguish the total loss potential on equity holdings from the loss potential due to firm-specific factors. Allowing for own-performance referents, we also consider firm performance and the value of a CEO's equity holdings in the analysis. Based on a sample of 208 U.S. CEOs for the years 1997-1999, we find empirical support for the role of downside risk and firm performance in CEO equity reductions. Implications on incentive alignment through equity ownership are presented. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

The purpose of this paper is to address corporate governance structures. Effective corporate governance can lead to managerial excellence but managerial ethical excellence does not always exist without effective corporate governance. Embedded in both effective corporate governance and managerial excellence is the "rightness of decisions" or the ethical decision making process. This paper analyzes this key process in the case of the failure of Swissair. The authors examine the key corporate governance structure through an explanatory case analysis of Swissair. They look at the structure by applying institutional theory rather than agency theory. It is hypothesized that corporate governance structures must comply with the norms generated by various stakeholders as well as economic incentives. No one set of norms may dominate the compliance; otherwise a corporation loses legitimacy and resources. It is contended that this lack of compliance of all stakeholder norms led to the failure of Swissair. The authors examined the strategies for governance in Swissair leading up to its failure. Critical examination of the various elements of effective corporate governance results in a model presented here for assimilating appropriate norms of behavior into the corporate decision-making process. They purport that adoption of the model by corporations will improve decision making leading to improved survival and performance. The case analysis provides for the development of a model of corporate governance which includes consideration of all facets of society, its stakeholders and the norms the stakeholders generate. It is contended that companies must consider ethical, social and political norms of behavior in corporate governance structures as well as economic concerns.

Purpose - Perceived independence is one of the corner-stones in auditing theory. Despite prior research on auditor independence, the results are inconclusive. The lack of research in the Hong Kong auditing environment motivates this study, particularly following the Enron debacle. The purpose of this paper is to examine the non-audit services (NASs), competition, rank and types of auditors, in respect of the independence problem as it relates to the practices of Hong Kong auditors in the post-Enron environment. Design/methodology/approach - Four independent variables identified from literature gaps are examined, namely NASs, levels of competition, auditors of different ranks and types of auditors. Mixed ANOVA are employed to analyze survey responses from 207 "Big 4" and 185 "non-Big 4" auditors. Findings - Results of the study show that the provisions of NASs and high competition could have a negative influence on auditors' perceptions of independence. Second, auditors' perceptions that the influence of NASs on independence depends on an individual auditor's rank are supported. Senior managers have the highest mean rating on perceptions, while partners have the lowest mean rating. Results support the agency theory that the agent (senior manager) may not always act in the best interests for the principal. Finally, there is no difference between Big 4 and non-Big 4 auditors' perceptions of the influence of NASs and competition on independence. Originality/value - The study revokes earlier US research that indicates that NASs provisions favorably influence auditors' perceptions of independence. It would be advantageous for a regulatory body to reconsider professional reforms such as prohibitions of NASs and the repercussions of non compliance of independence.

After reviewing the literature surrounding the link between executive compensation and innovation activities of North American firms, we examine two gaps in the area. First, we analyze how contextual factors can affect CEO pay in high-technology companies. In particular, we study three contextual dimensions: political, economic, and social. Second, we consider the specific case of executive compensation in high-technology firms when family ties are present at the helm. Drawing on agency rationale and previous research, we develop a series of instrumental propositions intended to provide the theoretical basis for a future research agenda in the area.

Purpose - This paper aims at re-examining the predictions of agency theory with regard to the negative association between CEO duality (i.e. the Chief Executive Officer, CEO, serves also as the board chairman) and corporate performance. It also examines the role of other corporate governance mechanisms (board size, top managerial ownership and institutional ownership) as moderating variables in the relationship between CEO duality and corporate performance. Methodology/approach - This paper uses the financial statements for the year 2006 of most actively traded Egyptian companies to examine these predictions of agency theory. Moderated Regression Analysis is used to analyse the empirical data.

This paper investigates valuation effects of share block transfers and employs agency theory to explain the determinants of equity block premia. A sample of transactions from Poland is used to measure benefits and costs of ownership concentration. Block premia are found to be remarkably low and comparable with those for the most developed economies. Shareholders expect to benefit from intensified monitoring and from corporate restructuring resulting from block acquisitions. Still, shareholders are wary of expropriation stemming from the extraction of private benefits of control by block holders. The opportunities to extract such benefits depend on relative power of investors. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between agency factors and the debt level of Ghanaian small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach - Generalized least squares model is used to estimate the regression equation. Findings - The results indicate that managerial ownership is negatively related to debt level. This suggests that SMEs with insider shareholders may prefer lower leverage to reduce the risk of insolvency. The results also show that SMEs with many shareholders are less likely to employ debt finance. Firms with many shareholders are not likely to entertain the fear of loss of control since the firm is seen as group-owned. Originality/value - The findings of this study generally suggest that managerial ownership is important in explaining the capital structure of Ghanaian SMEs. This study extends our understanding of the agency theory and the capital structure of SMEs from the Ghanaian context. (c) 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

How should corporate directors determine what is the 'right' decision? For at least the past 30 years the debate has raged as to whether shareholder value should take precedence over corporate social responsibility when crucial decisions arise. Directors face pressure, not least from 'ethical' investors, to do the 'good' thing when they seek to make the 'right' choice. Corporate governance theory has tended to look to agency theory and the need of boards to curb excessive executive power to guide directors' decisions. While useful for those purposes, agency theory provides only limited guidance. Supplementing it with the alternatives - stakeholder theory and stewardship theory - tends to put directors in conflict with their legal obligations to work in the interests of shareholders. This paper seeks to reframe the discussion about corporate governance in terms of the ethical debate between consequential, teleological approaches to ethics and idealist, deontological ones, suggesting that directors are - for good reason - more inclined toward utilitarian judgments like those underpinning shareholder value. But the problems with shareholder value have become so great that a different framework is needed: strategic value, with an emphasis on long-term value creation judged from a decidedly utilitarian standpoint.

Greatly changing scenarios are affecting how organizations must be managed, leading to the need for very efficacious, efficient governance and management systems. Nowadays, it is essential to examine the elements that organizational governance implies and to pay special attention to the relation between governance and the agency theory that is becoming vital in the seductive, complex topic of contemporaneous companies. This article broaches the theoretical bases of this issue, for the purpose of structuring a conceptual framework to organize the knowledge and scope of corporate governance and its alignment mechanisms, especially those related to the role of administration councils. The article ends by mentioning some papers on this matter, to give it a pragmatic approach.

Management contracts are widely used throughout the world as a mechanism for separating the ownership of hotel properties and their management. The research reported here concerns how Thai hotel owners seek to control the international hotel chains where properties are operated under hotel management contracts (HMCs). Adopting agency theory, the research findings reported here suggest that restraints against agent opportunism tend to focus on two key aspects: contractual controls and operational controls. Additionally, the findings also suggest that the outcome control needs to be viewed as a priority for effectively controlling hotel management companies when using HMCs. (c) 2008, SAGE Publications.

Agency theory has been the dominant framework for a theoretical conceptualization of corporate governance. According to this view, the governance problem of uncertainty about managerial behavior can be solved by assuming opportunistic behavior and setting up governance mechanisms to curtail opportunism. However, the adequacy of agency theory has recently been challenged because distrust-based governance mechanisms that are in line with the theory's recommendations have been ineffective to avoid managerial misconduct. Moreover, agency-based control and incentive systems have even been accused of being harmful. Stewardship theory has been proposed as an alternative approach. Building on a contrasting assumption about managerial behavior, this approach recommends trust-based governance designs that may, however, result in a one-sided and potentially disadvantageous system, too. On the basis of an in-depth analysis and critique of both theories this paper explores ways to either separate or combine the rival approaches. Due to shortcomings of these strategies a new perspective for the design of corporate governance systems is presented that opens the possibility of overcoming the theoretical tension.

The literature indicates that, mainly in countries with high stock concentration, the ownership structure is an important internal mechanism of control of the corporate governance, with effects in the companies' value and performance. In Brazil, the existing relationship among corporate governance - ownership structure - performance is still not conclusive. The present study investigates if there is any relationship among ownership structure, financial performance and value in the Brazilian nonfinancial public companies with stocks negotiated in the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, between the period of 1997 to 2001, as well as the determinant of the level of concentration of the ownership in these companies. In the empiric investigation it was used a multiple regression analysis through the estimators of the Ordinary Least Squares with heteroscedasticity in accordance with White (1980). Concerning the used methodology, the results indicate that the variables of ownership structure as defined do not have influence on the financial performance and value of the companies. Remaining to the determinant of the ownership structure of the Brazilian non-financial public companies, the results indicate that the ownership structure can be explained by the size of the firm, market instability and regulation, being the latter the main determinant of the ownership structure.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: We examine the relationship of concentration of shareholdings with the number of financial analysts following a firm to see if concentrated shareholders substitute for the monitoring activities of analysts. Research Findings/Results: Using a clean ownership dataset with a sample of 3,115 firm-year observations for U.S. firms and regression techniques that address any potential endogeneity, we find that analyst following is negatively related to the concentration of outsider and insider shareholdings. We find similar relations for changes in analyst following and changes in ownership concentration. Theoretical Implications: Our results support the argument that an outsider with a larger stake in a firm is more likely to produce its own in-house information for the monitoring of the firm's managers and avoid both the cost and moral hazard problems associated with analysts. The results also support the argument that if senior managers hold large stakes in the firm, there is a greater likelihood that managerial incentives will be aligned with those of other shareholders. Practical Implications: We contend that there is a governance substitution effect, with concentrated shareholders substituting for the monitoring activities of analysts. Our results are consistent with the opinion that regulators need not fear large shareholders. This is especially applicable to large outside shareholders as we find that the economic effect of concentrated outsider shareholdings is quite strong and greater than that of concentrated insider shareholdings.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper examines the relationship between dual-class share structure and the purchase of nonaudit services, and the extent to which the market's valuation of accounting information is influenced by the perception of auditing compromise resulting from such purchases. Research Findings/Results: Using a sample of Canadian companies from 2003-2004, we find that dual-class firms pay a larger amount of nonaudit fees to the auditors, relative to single-class firms, both in the absolute dollar amount and as a ratio of total audit fees. In addition, the returns-earnings association is significantly lower for dual-class firms than for their counterparts, and there is a further valuation discount as dual-class firms increase nonaudit service purchases. Theoretical Implications: We argue that severe agency problems inherent from the deviation from the one-vote-per-share structure lead to greater demand for economic bonding with the auditors via the purchase of nonaudit services. This study contributes to the growing body of nonaudit service literature by documenting the empirical link between ownership of control and nonaudit purchases. Practical Implications: The results indicate that investors believe a larger amount of nonaudit services highlights the underlying agency problems and compromises auditor independence for firms with a separation of cash flow rights and voting rights. The findings suggest that regulators in Canada and in other developed countries, when revising their future regulations on audit committees, may need to emphasize the role of restricted-class shareholders in bolstering the audit committee function and the auditing process.

Purpose - This paper aims to describe an application of key concepts in agency theory to organizational development. Specifically, it seeks to highlight that formal control systems, the ways to regulate employees' performance, are associated with an important factor for organizational development - the capacity for improvement. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a literature review on organizational development and agency theory, and an empirical examination of the relationships between bureaucratic control systems, task programmability and the organization's capacity for improvement. The hypotheses of interrelationships among different control systems, task programmability and the capacity for improvement were tested with a sample of 237 employees in the service industry. Findings - Results indicate that input control is a significant factor in determining an organization's capacity for improvement, and task programmability moderates the relation between a bureaucratic control and the organization's capacity for improvement. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on a cross-sectional self-report study. It is advisable to include managers' assessment of subordinates' capacity of improvement in further research. Originality/value - The effect of formal controls on organizational performance was controversial. This paper reveals the moderating role of task programmability in a control-performance relationship. In doing so, this paper sheds light on how a manager can enhance his/her subordinates' performance on organizational improvement through different control tactics.

This research argues that there is conflict of interest between managers and shareholders. The conflict also varies based on growth opportunities. This research argues that disciplinary role exist in debt policy with the use of free cash flow hypothesis. This research explores the implications of free cash flow hypothesis concerning the disciplinary role of ownership structure in corporate debt policy. Managerial ownership and internal institutional are other mechanism to reduce agency conflict also has a significant impact on debt policy (control coalition cohesiveness). The relationship between managerial ownership and debt policy is interdependence, as known as balancing of agency theory. This study uses 1264 observation of 154 listed Indonesian firms between the years 1995 until 2003. Three state least square (3SLS) model will be use for statistical and analytical purposes. This study developed several arguments. The relation between debt and free cash flow are positive, but the relation differs between low-growth firms and high-growth firms. Internal institutional shareholders discourage managerial perquisites using debt. The result of this research support the free cash flow hypothesis and balancing of agency theory through ownership and there is disciplinary role of ownership structure in debt policy.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual. Research Question/Issue: Post-acquisition director turnover is a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that needs to be examined beyond the agency lens. In this article, we examine the likelihood of non-executive director turnover in target firms following an acquisition. Research Findings/Result: Acquisitions present an interesting case where conflict of interests may arise between shareholders and directors. This study proposes that the likelihood of target non-executive director turnover depends on the factors that determine the performance of directors in their monitoring, advisory and social roles pre-acquisition and during the acquisition process. Theoretical Implications: While there are multiple studies examining the likelihood of turnover of executive directors (TMTs) following an acquisition, there is no systematic conceptual research explaining the likelihood of turnover of non-executive directors. We draw on three theoretical perspectives-agency theory, resource-based view and the social capital perspective to comprehensively investigate target non-executive director turnover post-acquisition. We further clarify the boundaries of these theoretical arguments concerning their implications for target non-executive director turnover. Practical Implications: One of the most important tasks for the newly formed firm post-acquisition is to build the new leadership team, including a new board. In view of the important roles directors take on in modern corporations, it is critical to understand how the new board should be constituted and what members of the target firm are more likely to join that new board.

In this paper we investigate three corporate governance issues in 30 Italian family firms: (i) the orientation either to the Agency Theory or to the Stewardship Theory; (ii) the board of directors' composition; (iii) the ability to involve nonfamily individuals in the company's management and governance (Openness Index) and the decision-making quality (Extension Index) and we analyze empirical results through a cluster analysis by following the Gubitta and Gianecchini's approach (2002). Our conclusion suggests that (i) small Italian family firms' corporate governance systems seem to be consistent with the guidelines suggested by the Stewardship Theory and (ii) Italian family firms' boards are characterized by a relevant presence of family members.

It is time to consider the lessons to be learned from the recent boom in private equity buyouts, not least in view of its abrupt termination in the wake of tightened credit. In the past, such inquiries have been undertaken in the context of agency theory and have focused on the buyout's implications for solving the problem of separation of ownership and control. This article reverses the pattern of inquiry to consider the buyout's implications for agency theory, pointing to three lessons. The first lesson addresses agency theory's three-way association among control transfers, governance discipline and hostile takeovers, suggesting that this triptych needs to be unbundled and reconsidered. The buyout's recent salience implies that we need no longer assume that hostility is the acquisition mode best suited to post-merger disciplinary governance. The second lesson concerns agency theory's account of buyout motivations. The theory posits a world where agency cost reduction determines control outcomes at the transactional margin. On first inspection, private equity buyouts neatly fit this picture. But a deeper examination shows that buyouts are driven by the economics of leverage, with agency cost reduction taking only a secondary motivational role. The third lesson follows from financial returns. Even as buyouts ameliorate the agency costs of separated ownership and control, buyout structures implicate their own agency costs in the form of fees paid to buyout firms. Studies show that buyout firms take so much of the gain that the institutions investing in buyout funds would be better off investing in market indices. There result questions for the line of agency theory that looks to institutional investors as agency cost-reducing monitors. There also result questions respecting buyouts' incentive compatibility, questions raising doubts as to whether buyout governance structures hold out a template for improving corporate governance generally, even as a matter of agency theory.

Purpose - This paper aims to provide a comprehensive empirical assessment of major contemporary corporate hedging theories, i.e. financial theory, agency theory, stakeholder theory and new institutional economics. Design/methodology/approach - Hypotheses regarding the determinants of hedging are tested on a sample of 150 companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The panel covers a period of five years (2001-2005). Unlike in previous research the tests are organised around theories rather than individual hypotheses. In addition to classic tests, CART analysis is used to verify hypotheses. Findings - The results show low empirical verification of all theories considered. However, the results support some single hypotheses. Tests identified currency exposure, market-to-book value, IT and service sectors and size as being determinants of hedging. Research limitations/implications - The results provide evidence for the low usefulness of contemporary theories. New models are needed to explain hedging behaviour more accurately. Practical implications - The results identify characteristics shared by firms that use hedging. Companies considering implementing hedging can check whether they share these characteristics. Originality/value - This paper adds to risk management research by providing strong empirical evidence of theory verification status. It can serve as a base for future conceptual research.

The empirical support for agency theory explanations for the great variance in CEO pay has been equivocal. Drawing from the performance appraisal literature, we hypothesize that boards of directors incorporate human judgment into the evaluation and reward of CEO performance in order to balance managerial risk with agency costs. We test Baysinger and Hoskisson's (1990) proposition that insider-dominated corporate boards rely on subjective performance evaluation to reward the CEO, and we argue that R&D intensity influences this relationship. Using a sample of Fortune firms, findings support our contention that human judgment is important in evaluating and rewarding CEO performance. (c) 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Scholarly investigations on the board of directors, although intense from the mid-1990s onward, did not lead to entirely convincing results. This study proposes discussion on building a multidisciplinary and integrated theoretical framework able to capture the complexity and distinctive dimensions of the board as a group decision-making process. This is achieved through an essay developed from analytical and descriptive review of the literature. A synthesis on board research is presented, aiming to understand theoretical models lenses used to study corporate governance issues. The strengths and weaknesses of these models are pointed out, and their influence on board investigation is observed. This essay concludes by proposing a research agenda that considers the addition of psychological and sociological approaches to economic models of the analysis of group decision-making.

We examine the effects of venture capitalist involvement and equity incentives for all employees on the performance of initial public offering firms. Data was collected from 402 IPO firms, representing 242 non-VC backed and 160 VC backed firms. Results indicate venture capitalists positively influence the likelihood the portfolio firm will offer equity incentives to all employees. Consistent with the agency theory argument that monitoring and incentives can behave as complements to one another, the results suggest venture capitalist backing and incentive stock options for all employees operate in concert to have a positive effect on stock price performance three years after the initial public offering.

The attention to boards of directors in small firms is increasing. Traditionally they have been considered to be passive but boards in small firms are undergoing major changes. We test hypotheses of what makes boards in small firms active and allows them to contribute to value creation. Activity is seen in relation to board task involvement. Predictions based on agency theory, resource dependence theory and the resource-based view of the firm are used. We found strong support for hypotheses highlighting the use of the knowledge of the board members and various board maintenance tools, such as regular board evaluations, to increase board task involvement. Actionable advice to boards in small firms is provided.

Building on agency and prospect theory views, many researchers have analyzed the executive risk-taking behavior. They have usually put in evidence the role of the mechanisms of corporate governance. In this research, we try to point out that even managerial entrenchment does matter. We consider the non financial firms that are listed in the Tunisian Stock exchange during the 1996 - 2006 period. To reveal the managerial risk taking, we apply factor analysis so as to construct a global index. To find out the impact of managerial entrenchment on risk-taking, we consider the ownership of the manager, his experience within the firm as well as his age. The size of the firm is also worth investigating while exploring managerial risk taking. The results are somewhat robust to different specifications. They may enhance and extend the agency-based corporate governance literature on executive risk-taking. But above all, they may shed some light on the emerging markets context namely the Tunisian one.

The attempt to align interests of executives with those of shareholders has been addressed in the corporate governance context from a predominantly economic outlook based on the agency theory. The models that combine monitoring and control systems in association with financial incentive mechanisms, such as profit and income sharing, stock options, bonds and other benefits, consider an individual to be individualist, opportunist and self-interested, diverging from the assumptions of other theories and contemporary ideas in the area of human resources management. Based on the criticism related to the agency theory, particularly when drawing up incentive schemes, this article aims to look at alternative theories to build corporate governance practices that include considerations on extrinsic and intrinsic motivation of agents.

In this paper I distinguish between the justificatory and explanatory roles of theory, and propose that the justificatory role played in the literature thus far by agency theory is subject to limitations. I therefore argue for the use of resource-dependence theory as the epistemological basis of the corporate governance domain knowledge system, and present an alternate model of corporate governance. Potential contributions of this alternate model are discussed.

Anglo governance systems rely of a number of controls to align shareholder and boards of director's interests. In general they are referred to as market control, regulatory control, and political and cultural control. Agency theory proposes that these control mechanisms are necessary as human nature is such that directors and managers act in a self-interested and boundedly rational manner in decision-making that can result in sub optimality. Notwithstanding that each country within the Anglo system accepts such controls are necessary they have their own foci and priorities, being a product of their own system's characteristics. This paper through interviewing a number of Australian business executives adds to the academic literature by providing evidence from the field of the important characteristics of the Australian governance system, the drivers of change and the effectiveness of the principles-based approach. It argues that debate needs to move beyond the principles versus rules approach to look at how firms can be provided with more guidance in operationalising some of the principles that appear to be key to governance effectiveness. It concludes that there is a need for a holistic model of governance that is broader than that focusing on the control/legalistic approach; that top management is important in setting and driving the in-firm governance agenda; that the public needs to be informed and educated about governance and its importance; and that disclosure still requires an improvement in quality.

In this article we analyse how board characteristics influence firm innovation. Firm innovation refers to basic innovation and entrepreneurial activities internal to a firm, such as the firm emphasis on new product development, innovation technology, and R&D investments. Drawing on agency theory, we developed hypotheses on specific board structural characteristics - i.e. board size, outsider ratio, directors' shareholdings, and CEO duality - and firm innovation. We tested our model on a sample of 301 large manufacturing Italian companies. We find support for our argument that - contrary to predictions of agency theory on CEO ownership - directors' shareholdings negatively influence firm propensity to innovate. Our results also suggest that board size may play a role in shaping firm propensity toward innovation.

This article presents some of the conclusions from a study about board of directors in small firms in Norway and Sweden. Theories built on neoclassical and socio-economic assumptions are integrated, and a stakeholder approach is adapted. Theories based on neo-classical paradigms have dominated most recent research about boards of directors. These studies have focused on board composition such as insider/outsider ratio, board members stock ownership and board size. Models based on agency theory and legalistic approaches have contributed to the framework for these studies, which mainly discuss the consequences of the board's independence of management in order to be an effective control mechanism. The present study adds a dimension of 'interdependence' or closeness to the traditional 'independence'- criterion. Interdependence is measured by the degree of relational norms (Macneil, 1980) between directors and management. The study is an associative cross-sectional field survey of 108 joint stock dual leadership hotels in Norway and Sweden, and uses a dyadic approach with CEOs and chairmen as respondents. This is the first study conducted using a dyadic approach in understanding directorates. The findings of this research contribute to an increased understanding of the role of directorates and board - management relations. The study illustrates the importance of distinguishing company size in research about directors and management, and it shows that a socioeconomic approach may have larger explanatory power than theories based on neo-classical paradigms.

The concepts of organizational slack and innovation are central elements in the literature. Innovation is of central importance as it is vital for organizational renewal and survival. The literature stands divided on the effect of organizational slack, which can be defined as the pool of resources in organizations that is in excess of the minimum necessary to produce a given level of output, on innovation. Three conflicting views can be distinguished. Proponents of slack argue that slack allows organizations to experiment and that it is a necessary condition for fostering innovation. Agency theory turns this perspective upside down. In this view, slack may be a source of agency problems, which breeds inefficiency. Therefore, it considers slack to be negatively related to innovation. Besides these two views there is also a group that takes a middle position: too little slack and too much slack are both bad for innovation, which leads to the prediction that there is a curvilinear relationship between slack and innovation. The study uses an existing dataset, which contains information about 300 innovating South African organizations. Results show that higher levels of slack lead to higher levels of innovation. No evidence is found for either a negative or curvilinear relationship. (c) 2008 PICMET.

This brief research note discusses the role of organizational and governance design in a specific sector, namely the Corporate Venture Capital (CVC). This specific segment of the venture capital industry has so far proved to be at least as successful as venture capital investments carried out by "independent" or "pure" players, but corporate-sponsored initiatives tend to be more short-lived, cyclical and unstable. Unlike traditional venture capital funds, CVC established by corporations usually seek both financial returns and "strategic" benefits. We discuss the dilemma faced by corporations setting-up CVC programs in terms of governance design and ownership arrangements, showing that strategic and financial performances are unlikely to be conjointly maximized, thus leading to the inherent instability of such programs.

This paper aims to investigate the key drivers and level of voluntary intellectual capital disclosures in Bahraini companies' annual reports. The paper uses an intellectual capital disclosure index score of voluntary disclosures in all Bahraini companies listed on the Bahrain Stock Exchange, and tests the relationship between voluntary disclosures of intangible firm value with traditional agency theory variables. The relationships are tested statistically using correlation and multiple-regression analysis. The level of voluntary intellectual capital disclosures in the annual reports is tested with regard to the following key drivers: the level of board independence; financial leverage; firm age; and firm size. Multiple regression analysis revealed that financial leverage and firm size had a significant relationship with the level of voluntary intellectual capital disclosure in Bahraini companies listed on the Bahrain Stock Exchange.

Based on the work of Berle and Means (1932), Coase (1937), Arrow (1971), and others, agency theory emerged in the 1970s to explain economic relationships under conditions of uncertainty and less-than-perfect information. It has become a widely used theoretical lens in strategic management research, with applications intended to inform research about corporate governance (Finkelstein and D'Aveni, 1994; Walsh and Kosnik, 1993), CEO compensation (Barkema and Gomez-Mehia, 1998), firm performance (Brush, Bromiley, and Hendrickx, 2000; Li and Simerly, 1998), firm risk (Bloom and Milkovich, 1998; Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia, 1998); and strategic decisions such as diversification (Kochhar, 1996; Markides and Singh, 1997) and mergers (Holl and Kyriazis, 1997; Reuer and Miller, 1997).

Many problems of corporate governance in Russia are beyond the scope of classical agency theory because of highly concentrated ownership structures. Using ownership and financial dataset from UBS Brunswick, we show that the use of accrual based accounting in Russia has resulted in lower informativeness of earnings. Opportunistic earnings management hypothesis holds where majority shareholders (controllers) enjoy short-term benefits of manipulating accounting numbers. Interestingly, the returns (net of market) increase when use of discretionary accruals to manage earnings increases in firms controlled by either state or oligarchs. However, such relationship does not exist when ownership is accumulated without control. We also found that state-owned companies use less discretionary accruals than other control groups. We do not find any evidence supporting performance measure hypothesis where firms manage earnings by discretionary accruals to offset the over or under reaction of economic shock. Highly leveraged firms tend to have positive relationship between earnings management and returns, whereas, both size and growth reflect negative informativeness of earnings. The results describe the concentrated ownership structure in Russia where controlling owners not only, achieve personal targets by over or under-statement of disclosed earnings but also get positive response from the market. This market benefit however, can only be achieved with effective control.

Companies are increasingly sourcing services from third party providers on a global level. Nevertheless, the academic research on phenomena such as offshoring, international purchasing and the sourcing of certain specific categories is still scarce. Lydia Bals provides terminological clarity regarding the field of offshoring. She identifies different types of offshoring, concluding that the buy option of offshore outsourcing versus hybrid or make options is directly related to purchasing. Her in-depth analysis specifically focuses on the sourcing of marketing services. In this context, the investigations of purchasing/marketing integration provide a conceptual model of barriers to purchasing involvement in sourcing of services. Moreover, the author seeks to shed light on issues of providing incentives for advertising agencies from an agency theory perspective. The case study illustrates that the measures taken against an initially problematic situation in the purchase of advertising agency services correspond with the theoretically identified solution mechanisms.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the relationship between internal governance structures and financial performance of Indian companies. The effectiveness of boards of directors, including board composition, board size, and aspects of board leadership including duality and board busyness are addressed in the Indian context using two theories of corporate governance: agency theory and resource dependency theory. Research Findings/Insights: The study used a sample of top Indian companies taking into account the endogeneity of the relationships among corporate governance, corporate performance, and corporate capital structure. The study provides some support for aspects of agency theory as a greater proportion of outside directors on boards were associated with improved firm performance. The notion of separating leadership roles in a manner consistent with agency theory was not supported. For instance, the notion that powerful CEOs (duality role, CEO being the promoter, and CEO being the only board manager) have a detrimental effect on performance was not supported. There was some support for resource dependency theory. The findings suggest that larger board size has a positive impact on performance thus supporting the view that greater exposure to the external environment improves access to various resources and thus positively impacts on performance. The study however failed to support the resource dependency theory in terms of the association between frequency of board meetings and performance. Similarly the results showed that outside directors with multiple appointments appeared to have a negative effect on performance, suggesting that "busyness" did not add value in terms of networks and enhancement of resource accessibility. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The two theories of corporate governance, namely agency and resource dependence theory, were each only partially supported, by the findings of this study. The findings add further to the view that no single theory explains the nexus between corporate governance and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study demonstrates that corporate governance measures utilized in developed economies related to boards of directors have some synergies and relevance to emerging economies, such as India. However, the nature of business structures in India, for example the large number of family businesses, may limit the generalizability of the findings and signals the need for further investigation of these businesses. The evidence related to multiple appointments of directors suggests that there may be support for restricting the number of directorships held by any one individual in emerging economies, given that the "busyness" of directors was negatively associated with firm performance.

Relatively few studies have examined the audit committee oversight process - the activities that link audit committee inputs and financial reporting outcomes. To study this process, we conducted extensive interviews with 42 U.S. public company audit committee members. We explore six audit committee process areas, offer insights into the state of audit committee processes in the post-Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) environment, and consider our results in light of agency theory and institutional theory. We find that many audit committee members strive to provide effective monitoring of financial reporting and seek to avoid serving on ceremonial audit committees, but within each of the six process areas we find evidence of both substantive monitoring and ceremonial action, such that neither agency theory nor institutional theory fully explains our results. We also find that many responses vary with personal and company characteristics, with particularly notable differences related to audit committee members' accounting expertise and time of appointment to the audit committee (pre-SOX versus post-SOX). We discuss implications and directions for future research and theory development. (c) CAAA.

Family businesses (FBs) play a key role in the world's economies. Unfortunately, the current literature surfaces disparate understandings and conclusions concerning their conduct and performance. Much of that literature falls under two insightful perspectives, agency theory and stewardship theory, that conflict quite directly. The agency view, based in economics, maintains that families will pursue utility for themselves to the detriment of their public shareholders. By contrast, stewardship proponents, arguing from a psychological perspective, suggest that family owners will invest deeply in their enterprise, to the benefit of all. This study synthesizes the literature on each of these perspectives to derive core motivational assumptions and expected organizational outcomes. Then, by employing a third sociological perspective, it proposes to reconcile these opposing views by considering the social embeddedness of firms and their key actors within the institution of the family for different types of public family enterprises. It will argue that there is a need for such integration in order to better understand and permit accurate, context-based predictions across various kinds of family businesses and family business situations.

Agency theory has served as a key basis for identifying drivers of offshore information system project success. Consequently, the role of relational factors in driving project success has been overlooked in this literature. In this paper, we address this gap by integrating the social embeddedness perspective and the culture literature to theorize how and why relational factors affect the success of offshore IS projects that are strategic in nature. We identify organizational and interpersonal cultural differences as critical success factors in this context. Using data from a longitudinal field study of 155 offshore IS projects managed by 22 project leaders, we found evidence of a relationship between hypothesized relational factors and two measures of offshore IS project success-namely, project cost overruns and client satisfaction-over and above the effects of project characteristics and agency factors. Specifically, we found that information exchange, jointproblem solving, and trust reduce projectcost overruns and improve client satisfaction. We also found a relationship between cultural differences at the organizational and team level, and offshore IS project success. The model explained 40 percent and 41 percent of the variance in project cost overruns and client satisfaction, respectively, for projects with a client representative. For projects with no client representative, the model explained 35 percent and 3 7 percent of the variance in project cost overruns and client satisfaction, respectively. Collectively, the results have important theoretical and practical implications for how clientvendor relationships should be managed when partnering with offshore firms and designing offshore IS project teams.

Using takeover protection as an indicator of corporate governance, this study examines how an exogenous shift in power from shareholders to managers affects corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Two competing hypotheses are entertained. The shareholder view predicts that stronger takeover protection will lead to a decrease in corporate attention to shareholders and non-shareholding stakeholders alike, as managers divert resources from share-holders to the pursuit of their private interests. The stakeholder view, in contrast, predicts that stronger takeover protection will increase corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Because catering to non-shareholding stakeholders contributes to the long-term value of the firm, managers will be more likely to attend to those stakeholders when relieved from short-termism triggered by the threat of hostile takeovers. Using a sample of 878 U.S. firms from 1991 to 2002, the study finds that an exogenous increase in takeover protection leads to higher corporate attention to community and the natural environment, but has no impact on corporate attention to employees, minorities, and customers. Additional analyses show that firms that increase their attention to stakeholders experience an increase in long-term shareholder value. These findings provide additional evidence that relief from short-termism is a likely source of the increase in corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders following the increase in takeover protection.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: The goal of this paper is to meta-analyze the results of 35 studies that examine the effect on earnings management of firms' boards of directors and ownership structure. We examine whether differences in results are attributable to moderating effects related to the system of corporate governance, the measurement of the governance variable, or the particular specifications of discretionary accruals models. Research Findings/Insights: The findings show that the variation in the results of previous studies on CEO duality and audit committee independence are caused by sampling error. In addition, the measurement of dependent variable, discretionary accruals, and the corporate governance system moderate the association between earnings management and some corporate governance variables. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The measurement of variables, especially discretionary accruals, influences the findings found in previous studies. The findings emphasize the need to explicitly consider the legal and institutional setting when one analyzes the effect of mechanisms of corporate governance on discretionary accruals. Future research should include matrix correlations, and consider detailed measures of earnings management and more attributes of boards of directors in order to facilitate research using meta-analysis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The results suggest that board independence, board size, and audit committee independence can improve investor confidence by constraining earnings management. Additional empirical evidence regarding refined measures of ownership and board, specifically board independence, would be very useful in gaining greater understanding of how the different approaches to these constructs influence earnings management.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to understand how business group affiliation, within firm governance and external governance environment affect firm performance in emerging economies. We examine two aspects of within firm governance - ownership concentration and board independence. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data on the top 500 Indian and Chinese firms from multiple data sources for 2007, we found that group affiliated firms performed worse than unaffiliated firms, and the negative relationship was stronger in the case of Indian firms than for Chinese firms. We also found that ownership concentration had a positive effect on firm performance, while board independence had a negative effect on firm performance. Further, we found that group affiliation - firm performance relationship in a given country context was moderated by ownership concentration. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study utilizes an integration of agency theory with an institutional perspective, providing a more comprehensive framework to analyze the CG problems, particularly in the emerging economy firms. Empirically, our findings support, as well as contradict, some of the conventional wisdom, and suggest useful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study shows that reforms in general and CG reforms in particular are effective in emerging economies, which is an encouraging sign for policy makers. However, our research also suggests that it may be time for India and China to stop the encouragement for the empire building through group formation in the corporate world. For practioners, our findings suggest that firms need to balance the need for oversight with the need for advice, while selecting independent directors. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper takes a theory building approach to highlighting variations of agency theory in the unique and complex context of Islamic banks, mainly stemming from the need to comply with Sharia and the separation of cash flow and control rights for a category of investors. Research Findings/Results: The paper provides insights that agency structures in the context of Islamic banking might give rise to trade-offs between Sharia compliance and mechanisms protecting investors' rights. Alternative models of idiosyncratic governance might be effective in balancing the two cornerstones of the agency dynamic. In practice, the paper finds that most of the surveyed Islamic banks appear to recognize the value of governance and institute some basic mechanisms. Nonetheless, some governance flaws relating to audit, control, and transparency are observed, a situation further exacerbated by the fact that investment account holders are not represented on the board, and are not granted control or monitoring rights. This leads to a discussion on the tradeoff between the costs and benefits of such a practice. Theoretical Implications: This study contributes to the agency theory literature by providing theoretical propositions highlighting challenges to this theory whereby mechanisms with the purpose of mitigating agency problems might lead to a divergence from Islamic principles of Sharia. Practical Implications: The paper motivates Islamic banks to improve governance practices currently in place. It alerts policy makers to the need to tailor the regulations to safeguard the interests of all investors without violating the principles of Sharia. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: This paper extends the theory of bundles of corporate governance mechanisms to address agency issues within the Anglo-Saxon system of corporate governance. The focus of our study is to detail the role of firm performance as a key determinant of how the governance mechanisms of monitoring and incentive alignment serve as complements or substitutes in addressing agency issues. Previous research has looked at these mechanisms in isolation from each other, with limited regard for the contingencies of firm performance and external monitoring. We propose that it is best to look at these mechanisms as a bundle of mechanisms to protect shareholder interests, and that firm performance is a key determinant of the composition of this bundle. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce firm performance as a critical contingency that heightens shareholders' concerns over governance issues as they seek to retain control over adverse selection and moral hazard problems. We propose that when firms are performing poorly, outside monitoring by institutional investors can complement internal monitoring by boards of directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We examine governance bundles under both agency and stewardship theoretical lenses to tie together previous empirical research and advance theory. In specifying the role of firm performance in determining the mix of mechanisms within the governance bundle, we reconcile prior disparate findings as to whether or not these governance mechanisms act in a complementary or substitutable fashion. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The conceptualization of these governance mechanisms has practitioner merit in analyzing the challenges that board members face managing agency conflicts through the mix of governance mechanisms, given different levels of firm performance. Our research also shows that, under conditions of poor performance, shareholders can provide effective external monitoring that can improve the overall governance effectiveness of the firm.

This article introduces managers' personal risk considerations into the relationship between organizational decline and innovation. The agency-based perspective is used to complement threat rigidity theory and prospect theory in examining how managerial ownership and slack resources affect managers' innovation decisions when firms experience poor performance. The findings indicate that more managerial ownership decelerates innovation spending. The availability of slack resources also reduces the rate of innovation investments. Firms with more slack resources and higher levels of managerial ownership jointly reduce innovation under circumstances of decline. Last, poorly performing firms that continue investments in innovation exhibit a lower probability of survival. (c) 2009 Sage Publications.

Agency theory has focused on buyouts as a governance and control device to increase profitability, organizational efficiency, and limited attention to growth. A strategic entrepreneurship view of buyouts incorporates upside incentives for value creation associated with growth as well as efficiency gains. In this paper, we develop the complementarity between agency theory and strategic entrepreneurship perspectives to examine the performance implications for different types of buyouts. Further, we study how the involvement of private equity (PE) firms is related to the performance of the post-buyout firm. These issues are examined for a sample of 238 PE-backed buyouts in the UK between 1993 and 2003. Implications for theory and practice are suggested. (c) 2009 Baylor University.

There is considerable variation across countries in both the extent to which large publicly listed firms are family-owned and the dominance of such family-owned firms in stock markets. The literature presents competing theoretical viewpoints on what influences such country-level variation. On one hand, institutional economists suggest that institutional voids can have a strong influence. On the other hand, cultural sociologists suggest that a country's culture can have a strong influence. One type of institutional void is a lack of institutional norms and regulations needed for monitoring contracts (which can discourage owners from hiring professional agents for top management positions in their firms) and another type of institutional void is a lack of financial credit availability in the country. Cultural dimensions include collectivism (i.e. cohesion within in-groups/families) and power distance (i.e. inequalities in society). This country-level empirical study suggests that both national culture and institutional voids influence family ownership patterns around the world, and that institutional voids moderate the influence of national culture. National culture has a stronger influence when a country has institutional voids; however, the influence of national culture weakens when institutional voids are overcome. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Agency theory addresses problems created from the separation of principals and agents in modern corporations. Some agency theorists have investigated the exact relationship between control mechanisms (monitoring and bonding) and suggested that they work as substitutes. We posit that, although monitoring and bonding may be concurrent substitutes in a system of governance, monitoring intensity is positively related to bonding (i.e., compensation) so that over time, they are complements rather than substitutes. In particular, we suggest that increased monitoring intensity shifts risk to managers, who then require greater compensation to offset their increased employment and career risk. Accordingly, they reinforce each other in a negative cycle such that monitoring leads to increased pay, which in turn leads to increased monitoring due to complaints of excessive pay. The result is that in today's economic environment society often criticizes executive pay without realizing that, in part, higher compensation is an outcome of prior increased monitoring intensity. These findings are particularly important as elected officials are increasingly under pressure to monitor and limit executive compensation. An understanding of this relationship also has implications for executive risk taking and entrepreneurial activities.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how a risk management committee (RMC), as a newly evolving subcommittee of the board of directors, functions as a key governance support mechanism in the oversight an organisation's risk management strategies, policies and processes. However, empirical evidence on the factors associated with the existence and the type of RMCs remains scant. Design/methodology/approach Using an agency theory perspective, this study investigates the association between board factors such as proportion of nonexecutive directors, Chief Executive Officer duality, and board size; as well as, other firmrelated factors (e.g. auditor type, industry, leverage, and complexity), and the existence of a RMC, and the type of RMC (namely, a separate RMC versus one that is combined with the audit committee). Data was collected from the annual reports of the top 300 Australian Stock Exchange (ASX)listed companies. Findings The results, based on logistic regression analyses, indicate that RMCs tend to exist in companies with an independent board chairman and larger boards. Further, the results also indicate that in comparison to companies with a combined RMC and audit committee, those with a separate RMC are more likely to have larger boards, higher financial reporting risk and lower organisational complexity. Research limitations/implications Data limited to top 200 top ASXlisted companies, thus restricting generalisability of the results. Originality/value The findings of this study provide additional information on the use and design of RMCs in a voluntary setting. (c) 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Manuscript Type: Editorial Research Question/Issue: This essay identifies some key issues for the analysis of corporate governance based on the articles within this special review issue coupled with our own perspectives. Our aim in this issue is to distil some research streams in the field and identify opportunities for future research. Research Findings/Results: We summarize the eight papers included in this special issue and briefly highlight their main contributions to the literature which collectively deal with the role and impact of corporate boards, codes of corporate governance, and the globalization of corporate governance systems. In addition to the new insights offered by these reviews, we attempt to offer our own ideas on where future research needs to be targeted. Theoretical Implications: We highlight a number of research themes where future governance research may prove fruitful. This includes taking a more holistic approach to corporate governance issues and developing an inter-disciplinary perspective by building on agency theory while considering the rich new insights offered by complementary theories, such as behavioral theory, institutional theory and the resource-based views of the firm. In particular, future corporate governance research needs to be conducted in multiple countries, particularly in emerging economies, if we want to move closer to the journal's aim of producing a global theory of corporate governance. Practical Implications: Our analysis suggests that analytic and regulatory approaches to corporate governance issues should move from a "one-size-fits-all" template to taking into account organizational, institutional and national contexts.

Agency theory posits that the greater degree of control by those with decision-making authority, the greater the overall organizational performance. Conversely, entrenchment theory implies that at extremely high levels of inside control by those with decision authority, organizational performance decreases. Using a nationwide sample of 2,631 privately held and publically traded family businesses, we examined if the relationship of percent family ownership is an agency or entrenchment relationship and found the latter. Specifically, there was a statistically significant negative relationship between percent of family control and sales growth as well as a strong inverse relationship between percent of family controlling the top management team and all measures of financial performance.

We examine auditor choice for listed companies in France where two (joint) auditors are required by law. This unique setting creates more complex auditor choice than the typical Big 4/non-Big 4 dichotomy in other countries, and we study if a firm's ownership structure affects its auditor-pair choice as well the consequences on earning quality. The findings are consistent with agency theory and indicate that a Big 4 auditor (paired with a non-Big 4 auditor) is more likely to be used when there is greater information asymmetry (less family control and more diversified ownership structures), and that these associations are even stronger for firms with two Big 4 auditors conducting the joint audit. We also test if a firm's auditor-pair choice affects earnings quality and find that firms using one Big 4 auditor (paired with a non-Big 4 auditor) have smaller income-increasing abnormal accruals compared to firms that use no Big 4 auditors and, once again, find that this effect is even stronger for firms that use two Big 4 auditors.

Drawing on agency theory, corporate governance, and international business literatures, we develop arguments relating equity ownership structures and CEO compensation mix to a firm's choice of foreign market entry modes. Based on a sample of 432 foreign market entries by 118 non-diversified firms in the US manufacturing sector between 1991 and 1998, our findings indicate that greater equity ownership by institutional shareholders and inside directors is positively associated with a preference for full-control entry modes. In addition, our results suggest that CEOs with a greater proportion of pay tied to firm long-term performance are more inclined to choose full-control entry modes over shared-control modes.

In a broad sense, corporate governance is about how firms should be governed so that they are run effectively and efficiently. This paper takes a broad perspective on corporate governance mechanisms and considers possible synergies between corporate governance and international business (IB) research. We summarize the papers included in this Focused Issue, and draw out their main contributions to the literature. In so doing, we compare and contrast the four theoretical perspectives concerning corporate governance and IB adopted in the five papers: i.e. transaction cost economics, the resource-based view, agency theory, and institutional theory. Finally, we highlight five research themes (international diversification, business groups, entry modes, subsidiary mandates, and new international ownership structures) where future work explicitly addressing governance issues may prove fruitful.

The use of agency theory remains highly controversial among business ethicists. While some regard it as an essential tool for analyzing and understanding the recent spate of corporate ethics scandals, others argue that these scandals might not even have occurred had it not been for the widespread teaching of agency theory in business schools. This paper presents a qualified defense of agency theory against these charges, first by identifying the theoretical commitments that are essential to the theory (in order to distinguish between agency theory itself and certain incorrect interpretations that have been widely promulgated), and second, by specifying more clearly the different ways that agency theory can be used to analyze relations within the firm. The recommendation that follows from this analysis is that agency theory be used as a critical-diagnostic tool, to identify the points at which both firms and markets will be vulnerable to breakdown in the absence of moral constraint.

Drawing on the agency theory, corporate governance, and international business literatures, the authors link board characteristics and managerial incentives to the choice between acquisitions and joint ventures by firms entering foreign markets. Hypothesized relationships are examined in the context of 383 acquisition and 171 joint venture entries undertaken by relatively nondiversified firms in the U.S. manufacturing sector during the period 1991 to 1999. Findings indicate that firms with boards characterized by a higher proportion of outside directors and independent leadership structures (i.e., the absence of duality) are more inclined to favor acquisitions over joint ventures in foreign market entry. Likewise, the data reveal that firms where insiders have greater equity ownership and compensation structures that are more closely linked to long-term firm performance prefer acquisitions over joint ventures. Implications of the findings along with directions for future research are discussed. (c) 2009 Southern Management Association.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines whether ownership concentration affects board and audit committee independence, and whether the impact of board and audit committee independence on firm value is moderated by ownership concentration and dividend payouts. Research Findings/Insights: Using panel data on a sample of Australian publicly listed firms over the period 2000-2005 (1,530 firm-year observations), the study finds that ownership concentration has a negative impact on board independence, but no impact on audit committee independence. Results also suggest that board independence enhances firm value and that performance impact of board independence is stronger in closely-held firms and/or firms having low dividend payouts. A marginally positive impact of audit committee independence, especially among closely-held firms, is also found. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study suggests that the impact of governance mechanisms is moderated by companies' ownership structure and dividend policies. It extends research on the effectiveness of governance mechanisms by distinguishing two types of agency problems and using a simultaneous equations model. The findings underline the important governance role that independent boards and audit committee can play in a country that has high ownership concentration and high levels of private benefits of control. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The results of this study strengthen the idea that independent directors can also play a key role in the governance of closely-held firms. As such, for investors, as far as agency costs are concerned, investments in closely-held firms that have a higher proportion of independent directors on the board and audit committee are sensible. Closely-held firms should be aware of the investor's need for more independent directors, especially when dividends are low. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper examines the relationships between initial public offering (IPO) underpricing, CEO duality, and strategic ownership in 12 Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Research Findings/Results: Using all IPOs from January 2000 until the end of July 2007, we document an average IPO underpricing of 184.1 per cent. Underpricing is higher in IPO firms that have CEO duality. However, strategic shareholders, such as corporations and other industry-related investors, are likely to play a monitoring role whereas underpricing is found to be lower in firms with both CEO duality and strategic shareholder ownership. Moreover, the negative relation between underpricing and strategic blockholding is greater for foreign strategic ownership than it is for domestic strategic ownership. Theoretical Implications: This paper examines the level and determinants of IPO underpricing in the MENA region. It provides evidence on the role played by foreign strategic owners in reducing agency conflicts and information asymmetries within an environment where firms may be affected by the cultural issues related to political ties and family involvement. Practical Implications: Our results contribute to the existing debate on the appropriate regulations for an effective and stable financial system in Arab countries. They offer policy-makers additional evidence on the positive impact of market openness to foreign shareholders. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose The goal of this paper is to provide a broad foundation for future research in the area of strategic sourcing. Design/methodology/approach The foundation is derived by drawing from various wellestablished organizational theories. Specifically, strategic sourcing was viewed from the perspective of institutional theory, resource dependence theory, network theory, systems theory, resource/knowledgebased views of the firm, transaction cost economics, agency theory, strategic choice theory, sociocognitive theory, and critical theory. Findings By viewing strategic sourcing through the lens of ten organizational theories, this research provides multiple insights into many interrelated strategic sourcing questions, such as when to make, buy or ally, how many and which suppliers, and how to manage sourcing relationships. The paper offers a rich and diverse foundation to foster future theorybuilding activities in sourcing and supply management research. Originality/value While some of these theory bases have been utilized, to some degree, in the supply management research, the paper offers a more holistic perspective of theoretical insights for strategic sourcing. Each of these organizational theories could be utilized as a foundation for future studies. Further, the paper offers competing and/or complementary theory bases to enhance possible insights into many strategic sourcing questions such as when to make, buy or ally.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: We assess the corporate governance role and the impact of private equity. Research Findings/Results: Private equity firms are heterogeneous in their characteristics and activities. Nevertheless, a corporate governance structure with private equity involvement provides incentives to reduce agency and free cash flow problems. Additionally, private equity enhances the efficacy of the market for corporate control. Private equity investment is associated with performance gains, with such gains not simply being a result of transfers from other stakeholders. In the short term, the benefits appear clear to outgoing owners and to the new owners and management while in the longer term the benefits are less clear. While non-financial stakeholders argue that other stakeholders suffer in the short and long term, the evidence to support this view is at best mixed. Theoretical Implications: By reviewing a comprehensive selection of theoretical and empirical papers published in refereed academic journals in finance, economics, entrepreneurship, and management as well as publicly available working papers and private equity industry studies, we develop a more complete understanding of private equity investment. Agency theory has shortcomings when applied to the broad sweep of private equity-backed buyout types, as in some cases pre-ownership change agency problems were likely low (e.g., family firms), in some cases the exploitation of growth opportunities owes more to the entrepreneurial behavior of managers than to improved incentives, and in some institutional contexts outside Anglo-Saxon countries traditional agency issues are different and stakeholder interests are more important. There is a need for further theorizing on the heterogeneity of buyout and private equity types and the contexts in which they occur. Particularly useful perspectives seem to be entrepreneurial perspectives (e.g., entrepreneurial cognition, strategic entrepreneurship), stewardship theory, and institutional theory. Stakeholder governance theory (e.g., relating to employee ownership and participation) may also be useful for explaining wider distribution of gains. Practical Implications: Private equity investment is a positive feature of the corporate restructuring landscape. There is a need for managers and their advisors to be aware of the heterogeneity of the opportunities to create value and the expertise of different private equity firms. Policymakers designing mechanisms to regulate private equity need to be aware of the systematic evidence that shows a more positive impact of private equity than some have claimed, but also that there are heterogeneous effects relating to different types of buyouts and private equity firms that need to be taken into account.

This article uses agency and stewardship theories to explain different motivations for contracted providers to properly use service monitoring tools. To examine different motivations for proper tool use, seven case studies were conducted on early childhood programs in three communities in Upstate New York. The case studies specifically focused on the reporting forms that the early childhood programs completed. Data sources included (1) interviews with government agency and contracted provider employees, (2) content analysis of key documents relating to the service monitoring tools, and (3) attendance at meetings between government agencies and contracted providers on the service monitoring tools. This article finds support for both agency and stewardship theories.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Prior to China's split-share structure reform, domestic A shares were divided into non-tradable and tradable shares. Non-tradable shareholders represent the government, hold roughly a two-thirds majority, and manage the firms, while tradable shareholders have little power to affect the decisions made by non-tradable shareholders. This is a typical structure to exhibit agency problems. The 2005 structure reform program stipulates that non-tradable shareholders have to bargain with tradable shareholders in order to gain liquidity. The price that non-tradable shareholders pay to tradable shareholders for gaining liquidity is defined as "compensation." We explore the issue of why corporate governance might play an important role in affecting the level of compensation. Research Findings/Insights: Firms with a weak governance structure or severe agency problems are required to have a higher level of compensation. The level of compensation is positively correlated with the non-tradable shareholding, the pledge ratio, and related-party transactions, and is negatively correlated with foreign shareholdings. The same set of variables dictates the ex-post wealth effect of tradable shareholders, but in the reverse direction. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The share reform provides a natural setting that allows tradable shareholders to reflect their concerns with agency problems. The mechanism could ameliorate the agency problems. Corporate governance, in a broad sense, is related to compensation and the ex-post wealth effect of tradable shares. Practitioner/Policy Implications: A successful mechanism should be designed to have minority shareholders involved in the process and have the final compensation reflect the quality of corporate governance.

We use agency theory to predict the influence of related and unrelated product diversification on a firm's level of debt financing. Further, we argue that the link between diversification and capital structure is moderated by the environment in which firms operate. Using SAS PROC MIXED, we fit a mixed-effects model to our unique six-year longitudinal dataset (1995-2000) of 245 publicly listed Singapore firms. Our data spans the period of the Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998). We find that firms pursuing unrelated product diversification take on less debt financing in stable environments, but more debt financing in dynamic environments. Using longitudinal structural equation modeling, we find a reciprocal relationship between a firm's product diversification strategy and its debt financing level. (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper aims to highlight the opportunity to contribute to our understanding of strategic entrepreneurship by exploring the construct through the lens of agency theory. In particular, we claim a fundamental link between a new venture's control of critical resources and the distribution of equity between the principal and agent. According to agency theory, assigning top executives ownership in the firm provides arrangements that are compatible with the incentives of the owners of the firm. This paper suggests that agency theory has special relevance when considered in a strategic entrepreneurship context. This is because the function of managers in entrepreneurial new ventures is fundamentally different from their counterparts in large established, incumbent corporations. While both types of managers have to provide managerial and organizational expertise, managers in entrepreneurial new ventures have an additional function that is essential to the competitive advantage and performance of the new venture-providing knowledge and human capital, which, in many cases, is intrinsically linked to the capital resources of the new venture. Our framework is tested using patent ownership as a proxy for both relationship-specific investments and indispensable human capital of the top manager of the new venture. The empirical results support the main hypotheses posited by the entrepreneurial governance model. In particular, patent ownership of the top manager significantly increases the percentage of equity held, while the number of patents held by the firm significantly decreases the percentage of ownership.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the associations between the board of director's choice to integrate non-financial performance measures into the CEO bonus plan and two other governance mechanisms - board independence and CEO ownership - in a sample of publicly traded Canadian firms. Research Findings/Results: The results provide evidence that the use of non-financial performance measures in the CEO bonus plan varies predictably. Growth opportunities are positively associated with the firm's choice to integrate non-financial information into the CEO bonus plan. The results are also sensitive to our proxy for board independence and CEO ownership in firms with high growth opportunities. Theoretical Implications: Agency theory states that any costless performance measure providing incremental information about the agent's effort will improve the efficiency of the contract with the agent. In contrast with most of the literature in this area, which investigates pay-performance sensitivity and governance structure, we examine an important component of pay-for-performance plans used to align and compensate executive actions that might not be reflected in traditional financial performance measures. Practical Implications: This study documents that boards choose performance measures that best reflect the CEO's contribution to firm value, taking into account the firm's monitoring environment. This study therefore has policy implications regarding the need for enhanced disclosure of CEO compensation to improve investor understanding of the alignment between executive pay and firm performance.

Entrepreneurs with firm-specific human capital represent both a potential source of competitive advantage and a threat to appropriate the rents that are ultimately generated by a new venture. This situation presents interesting agency and resource dependence challenges. While potential investors in these ventures will want assurances that their interests are protected, they will also want to ensure that these key entrepreneurs remain with the organization. Using agency theory and resource dependence theory, we examine the types of governance mechanisms that are implemented in firms going through an initial public offering comparing those ventures which indicate a dependence on these critical entrepreneurs versus those that do not. Our analysis reveals that ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs are associated with higher insider and outsider ownership by the board, greater start-up experience by the board, greater use of contingent compensation, and greater use of involuntary departure agreements.

This study investigates the relations of board structure, ownership concentration, and ownership type with the performance of banks operating in Turkey from an agency theory and resource-dependency perspective. We use financial ratios and established measures of board characteristics and ownership structure. Our results indicate that board size and duality do not significantly influence the returns on assets of Turkish banks. On the other hand, the tenure of board members is negatively related to performance. Our analysis of board composition reveals a curvilinear relationship with banks' performance, implying that boards composed of a majority of either insiders or outsiders enjoy high performance. Also, ownership concentration and ownership type do not influence firm performance. The results of the financial variables are robust in all models. Copyright (c) 2009 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Recent research has shown evidence that larger firms are more likely to destroy shareholder wealth through acquisitions. Those findings suggest that managers of larger firms are less likely to be disciplined by the market for corporate control than managers of smaller firms. With a sample of nearly 8000 acquisitions over the period from 1980-1999, this paper offers evidence to the contrary. The results suggest that larger firms are more likely to be the target of a disciplinary takeover than smaller firms. Further tests indicate that CEOs of larger firms are significantly more likely to be replaced following a series of poor acquisitions than CEOs of smaller firms. In total, managers of the largest firms continue to make the worst acquisitions despite the evidence that they are more likely to be punished for doing so. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Motivated by agency theory, we explore the potential impact of managerial entrenchment through staggered boards on dividend policy. The evidence suggests that firms with staggered boards are more likely to pay dividends. Among firms that pay dividends, those with staggered boards pay larger dividends. We also show that the impact of staggered boards on dividend payouts is substantially stronger (as much as two to three times larger) than the effect of all other corporate governance provisions combined. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the notion that dividends help alleviate agency conflicts. Thus, firms more vulnerable to managerial entrenchment, i.e., firms with staggered boards, rely more on dividends to mitigate agency costs. Aware of potential endogeneity, we demonstrate that staggered boards likely bring about, and are not merely associated with, larger dividend payouts. Our results are important, as they show that certain governance provisions have considerably more influence than others on critical corporate activities such as dividend payout decisions.

We propose a research agenda that can assist in developing a dynamic and comprehensive theory of boards of directors. It is based upon the concept of temporality, with time being organised around the life-cycle metaphor, and integrates research on agency theory, decision-making theory and resource dependence theory. We identify three key roles of boards of directors: 1) Monitoring and controlling top management 2) Involvement in strategic decision-making; and 3) Providing access to resources and networks. Our analysis suggests that boards perform all three roles, but that these roles change over time. We propose clear researchable questions for each stage of the organisational life cycle as well as the transition between the stages.

While both financial and behavioral theories suggest that cash holdings may be beneficial to R&D-intensive firms, agency theory would suggest that strong monitoring may be needed to ensure that cash holdings are not squandered. We contend that transaction cost economics provides a valuable lens for understanding the performance implications of cash holdings because not only does it explicate the benefits and costs of cash holdings in a single unified theoretical framework, but it further clarifies how environmental uncertainty critically moderates these relationships. Empirical tests on a large sample of US corporations yield strong support for our theory. (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Contracts are a ubiquitous part of the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Despite this, they are poorly understood by practitioners and academics. This paper empirically tests a conceptual model of the contract that seeks to improve our understanding of contracts. This model argues that the contract should be viewed as a managerial tool that provides the structure within which we accomplish the project tasks. The choice of the appropriate contract facilitates a process that allows the parties to achieve superior performance. The model views the contract as a multidimensional instrument that addresses three critical questions: (1) what is the structure of the organizational relationship between firms; (2) what is the disposition of risk and reward for involvement in the project; and (3) how will conflicts between firms be resolved? This paper empirically examines the first two dimensions. In order to address these distinct but intertwined questions, theories from Transaction Cost Economics and Agency Theory are brought to bear. The results of the study suggest that the conceptual model explains some of the variation in project performance, and therefore holds promise as a strategic management tool. (c) 2009 ASCE.

Our study investigates differences in CEO turnover between focused and diversified firms to determine whether diversification strategies are necessarily associated with governance efficiency in family businesses. We find that large family CEO firms are more likely to engage in corporate diversification than are small non-family CEO firms and their CEOs are seldom replaced. Large family CEO diversified firms also have lower turnover sensitivity relative to focused firms. The results imply that the CEOs of diversified firms have entrenched themselves, thereby increasing agency costs within family businesses. However, we fail to find diversification discounts in family businesses. It is interesting that CEOs tend to diversify their businesses in order to decrease firm risk. Founding families favor risk reducing decisions in order to maintain family wealth and prestige; suggesting that family businesses are more interested in survival than growth. Although family businesses may benefit from risk reduction, a negative relationship between diversification level and CEO turnover is still evidence of poor corporate governance. Agency theory may not completely account for the adoption of diversification strategies in family businesses and corporate diversification may weaken the effectiveness of internal monitoring mechanisms.

In this study, we analyze the determinants of the corporate dividend policy using a sample of firms listed on New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZSE). NZSE firms traditionally have high dividend pay-outs compared with companies in the US. This raises the question whether the existing dividend theories are applicable the NZSE firms. Our findings provide strong support to the agency cost theory and partially support transaction cost and residual dividend theory. We find that a dividend payout ratio is positively related to the degree of ownership dispersion and negatively related to the degree of insider ownership. We also find that firms that experience recent growth in revenues tend to pay lower dividends. There is a weak evidence to support the imputation tax credit hypothesis. We do not find evidence to support the dividend stability theory and the signalling theory. (c) EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether anti-director laws and legal director liability rules affect the diligence of directors in setting the compensation of CEOs. The study uses a world-wide data set covering 27 countries for the period 1995 to 2005. Research Findings/Results: Controlling for a number of legal and economic determinants, we find that independent of managerial risk-aversion, CEO pay is always less generous under stricter anti-director rules and a stronger rule of law. Director liability rules are associated with more generous pay schemes. The results persist once we control for the presence of institutional investors and cross-listing in the US. Theoretical Implications: Our results suggest that there exists an agency conflict between shareholders and outside directors reflected in the degree to which directors act diligently when negotiating the pay contract with the CEO. However, this conflict may be alleviated by specific legal rules making boards more accountable to shareholders. Private measures of shareholder protection do not seem entirely capable of substituting for legal institutions. Practical Implications: Reducing managerial agency cost is commonly viewed as a desirable policy goal. We advocate the view that specific legal institutions that strengthen procedural rights of shareholders' voting on directors and the overall quality of the legal system help to achieve this goal. Director liability rules, however, appear to be ineffective for this purpose. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This article examines empirically the effect of ownership structure on the corporate financing decision from the agency theory perspective. This article contributes to the literature by examining the static and the dynamic effects of managerial insiders and large shareholders' ownership on the capital structure. Based on panel data analysis for a sample of Jordanian industrial firms during the period 2001 to 2005, the study provides empirical evidence indicating that the debt ratio is negatively related to managerial ownership and inconclusively related to individual block-holders' ownership. Moreover, the study finds no significant relationship between debt ratio and institutional ownership. These results are consistent with the entrenchment behaviour of managers and passive monitoring by institutions. Finally, supporting the results of previous literature, this study reveals that the capital structure is affected by firm's profitability, size and growth. (c) 2009 Taylor & Francis.

Previous studies have primarily focused on the relative success of collectively owned enterprises (COEs) in China during the early years of reform, but they have ignored the agency problems inherent in this type of organizational form that may be an obstacle to further improving performance in a changing environment. Drawing on agency theory and the privatization literature, we argue that the transformed COEs in the ongoing organizational transformation process may achieve better performance by reducing agency costs. We examine a sample of COEs in Chinese manufacturing industries and track their ownership statuses from 2000 to 2005. Our findings reveal that the transformed firms achieved better performance than the traditional, untransformed COEs by mitigating agency problems. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study examines the impact of shareholder rights on the wealth effects of privately negotiated stock repurchases. Our results show that wealth gains are lower when shareholder rights are more suppressed. We also find that the premium paid for shares is inversely related to the strength of shareholder rights, and this suggests that managers pay higher premiums when shareholder rights are more restricted. These findings imply that managers use shareholders' funds to eliminate blockholders who are more likely to monitor them when shareholder rights are relatively weak, thereby entrench themselves. Consistent with this view, we further show that significant positive abnormal long-run returns after private stock repurchases are limited to firms with stronger shareholder protection. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the predictions of agency theory. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Management and organization literature has treated conflicts in numerous times and from various perspectives. Still, the theoretical literature holds different views about the essence of owner-manager relationship, including the view that the top manager and the owner are seen as subjects with different goals and interests. And these differences may cause conflicts created within this relationship. The research question here is about the subject of CSR as an enhancing factor in the deepening of special interests of the owners and the managers, as well as in emphasising their different roles. The in-depth interviews contained 60 questions and were recorded. With nearly all questions, two aspects were addressed: on the one hand, the difference between the periods 1995-1999 and 2000-2004, and on the other, between enterprises based on foreign and domestic capital. By the beginning of the former period - that is 1995 - the privatisation period in Estonia was predominantly over and the first legislative framework concerning the operation of corporations in the Western sense started to develop. The second turning point is represented by the year 2000, when the "purge" following the Asian and Russian crises presented new demands on economic activities and economic thinking as a whole. A total of 25 individuals were interviewed: 7 owners, 12 top managers and 6 of those who had been both as owners and top managers. This article concentrates on the results that concern the possible sources of conflict between the managers and the owners and their perception of social responsibility and the links between those questions. When summing up the opinions of the interviewees it should be admitted that the responses reflected the insignificance of the conflicts issue rather than their serious topicality. As the respondents remarked on several occasions, the existence of owner-manager conflicts is not considered normal or built-in; as the respondents added, this should not be considered such. Thus the claim of built-in conflicts in the owner-manager relations, derived from the agency theory (at least the classical agency theory) should be questioned according to the responses of the Estonian owners and managers. At the same time this does not mean that the responses coincide with the standpoints of stewardship theory, because the results of the interviews do not enable to make general conclusion that Estonian managers tend to act in the best interest of their principals. The results of the interviews lead us to conclude that the difference between the way top managers and owners understand ideas and activities is quite clearly presented in the context of social responsibility; despite the fact that the respondents usually do not admit the existence of conflicts when discussing them in general. When comparing the opinions of the owners and top managers about social responsibility, considering the theoretical literature, we may claim to certain extent that owners and managers have a different perception of social responsibility and this leads to the conflicts between them. To conclude, the authors present the understanding that the context of CSR brings out the conflicts between managers and owners more clearly, or even intensifies the conflicts between them. Results from an empirical study, undertaken in Estonia, are used.

By employing the theoretical template provided by agency theory, this article contributes a detailed clinical analysis of a large multinational Canada-headquartered telecommunications company, Nortel. Our analysis reveals a twenty-first century norm of usual suspects: a CEO whose compensation is well above those of his peers, a dysfunctional board of directors, acts of income smoothing to preserve the confidence of volatile investors, and revelations of financial irregularities followed by a downfall. In many ways, the spectacular rise and - sudden - fall of Nortel illustrates excesses of actors within, and contradictions of the system of corporate governance implied by the agency model. Furthermore, this case illustrates limitations of the agency framework in complex situations with short-term oriented investors. (c) 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Purpose - The importance of top management commitment for the success of major change initiatives has been emphasized in the literature, while the role of boards of directors (the board) has been in less focus. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how the boards affect the sustainability of major organizational change. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on three case studies of the diffusion of total quality management (TQM), Toyota production system (TPS), and lean production (LP). Findings from these case studies are then compared to literature on management and organization and corporate governance. Findings - A TQM/TPS/LP transformation is a longterm process. In the case studies, top management commitment is crucial for the sustainability of the implemented change programs. However, a committed top management does not "last forever." The issue of sustaining change therefore falls back on the governance structure. If the board does not understand the essence of an organizational change, the risk is that top management is replaced with new leaders, who are given new directions by the board. Issues identified as important in order to create board commitment for sustainability of major organizational change are: board competence and experience, board meeting dynamics, board as a provider of critical resources, and the process of replacement of chief executive officers. The dominating agency theory within corporate governance also needs to be questioned and complemented by more recent theories such as the stewardship and the resourcedependence theories. Originality/value - This paper provides insights into the board's role in sustaining major organizational change. (c) 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Prior research has located the issue of "professional" conduct with consultancy predominantly within the relationship between the manager and the consultant. However, recent studies provide indications that dealing professionally with consultancy may fail because of goal divergences between the individual managers and the organization. The first aim of this article is to re-examine this assumption theoretically, by drawing on agency theory, and empirically, by focusing on a single case study. Through this approach certain attitudes exhibited by managers are identified, which hinder dealing with consultancy in a professional manner across the entire organization. This observation motivates the second aim of the article: since the managers' attitudes deviate from the company's goals in dealings with consultancy, the adequacy of governance measures needs to be analyzed. Several researchers have observed that companies primarily use control-based measures, like central procurement rules or policies, to govern managers dealing with consultancy. However, these measures are not readily accepted by managers. In view of the above, this study investigates alternative measures, which are summarized as incentive-based measures.

The relationship between managerial share ownership and the firm's change in leverage around a security issuance is examined. We find that entrenched managers are not more likely to issue equity, however they do affect lower leverage by choosing debt issuances which are smaller and equity issuances that are larger than those chosen by managers that are not entrenched. The magnitude of the decline in leverage that occurs from before the issuance to after the issuance is positively related to managerial share ownership. In addition, this relationship is confined to only the "entrenchment" range of managerial share ownership. The market reacts negatively to an issuance announcement when managerial share ownership is high. (c) 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This paper shows that the role of managerial incentives is highlighted by a relatively complex relationship between technological competence and international diversification. By studying a sample of Standard & Poor's 500 member firms, we explore the relationships between technological competence, managerial pay, and international diversification. Results indicated a curvilinear relationship (an inverted U-shape) between technological competence and international diversification. In line with agency theory, contingent pay (stock options and bonuses) was positively related to international diversification. Beyond these direct effects, both contingent and non-contingent pay (cash compensation) moderated the relationship between technological competence and international diversification.

This paper studies the case of a French multinational company which doubled its size and geographical spread of activities because of acquisitions of Anglo-Saxon multinational companies. It analyses the rationale behind the introduction of a competency-based leadership model in this multinational company through the frameworks of agency and neoinstitutional theories. The interpretation of the data through agency theory leads to the following conclusion: globalization means strengthening agency problems and therefore an increase in agency costs. It is argued that the multinational company introduced the competency-based leadership model as a means of cultural control. A formalized and common reference for leadership development and evaluation makes it possible to reduce information asymmetry, diminish the possibility of opportunistic behaviour among managers and thereby reduce agency costs. While agency theory justifies the introduction of the competency-based leadership model, it does not explain the modalities of its choice. This theoretical perspective ignores the institutional context of HRM choices. The results obtained through the frameworks of neoinstitutional theory show that the choice of the competency model was based on the mimetic mechanisms of institutional isomorphism. Furthermore, the introduction of the competency-based leadership model allows the multinational company to gain both internal and external organizational legitimacy. Consequently, the paper suggests that agency theory has to be combined with insights from the neoinstitutional theory in order to explain the introduction of organizational practices. While agency theory provides the rationale of the model's introduction, neoinstitutional theory explicates the nature of the selected organizational practice.

This qualitative study examines the motivations for venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to act opportunistically toward one another. Structured interviews with 14 employees and five investors in a VC-funded startup revealed that venture capitalists expect opportunistic behaviour from entrepreneurs during investment rounds, but largely trust entrepreneurs between financing rounds. Both the venture capitalists and entrepreneurs reported that venture capitalists act opportunistically towards the entrepreneur and other venture partners during all stages of the startup development. These findings have important implications for entrepreneurship research, most notably, the applicability of agency theory as a theoretical perspective from which to view the complex relationship between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.

This paper examines the firm specific characteristics - as a proxy for positive accounting research - that are associated with the propensity of companies listed on the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges (CASE) to comply with the newly harmonised Egyptian Accounting Standards (EASs) issued in 1997 and that are close to the international accounting standards (IASs). Although having an international audit firm is the dominant factor associated with disclosure and measurement/presentation compliance, ownership concentration, share trading, size as measured by market capitalisation and internationality are also associated with compliance. However, the results show that profitability, liquidity and leverage do not seem to affect the extent of compliance with EASs and the performance of manufacturing are at par with non-manufacturing firms. Also the performance of private sector firms is at par with public sector firms. This may indirectly imply that the positive accounting perspective may not be entirely applicable for de facto compliance in Egypt. Hence, it cannot be entirely inferred that listed Egyptian companies may use de facto compliance with EASs as a means of reducing agency costs, raising capital, reducing political costs or signalling to the market that they are high quality firms.

Agency theory postulates that an organization needs to achieve a balance in its organizational architecture, to develop its activities and to attain its objectives effectively. The non-profit organizations have the same requirements in their internal organization, although measurement of their efficiency is a very complex task. This paper has a twofold objective: first, to evaluate the relationship between a balanced organizational architecture and the level of efficiency and, secondly, to show that the DEA methodology is an adequate tool for measuring the efficiency of non-profit organizations. We estimate this relationship with a sample of non-governmental organizations involved in the international cooperation sector (NGO). The information was collected by means of personal interviews in 2003. The results show that NGOs with a more balanced organizational architecture have higher levels of efficiency.

It is common for host organizations that operate conventions to employ professional conference organizers (PCOs) to perform a variety of professional services relating to the organization, management and operation of the event. As such, a productive relationship between the host and PCO is essential to the successful operation of the event. Yet, the relationship is often strained as the host organization may feel uncertain about the selection of the PCO or may have reservations about its performance. Such an arrangement represents a classic principle-agent relationship that can be examined through agency theory. This study examines this relationship from the perspective of the host organization. It found that hosts do express concerns about adverse selection and moral hazard, but that these concerns can be mitigated by a series of pre- and post-contract awarding control measures.

This study examines the importance of external monitoring and public reporting on the performance of firms in the global apparel industry. By focusing on the relevance of company reputation in the global community, the authors examine financial performance and stock market reaction to the release of information describing the manufacturing practices of firms made available by a third-party monitor. Using agency theory as a predictive framework, industry-wide changes in market measures of company risk as a result of third-party monitoring are found, suggesting that society values such external reports. The authors' findings are important to business and society because they bridge the gap in knowledge about how voluntary compliance programs are supplemented by external monitoring and reporting for firms operating in the global environment. This work suggests that external monitoring is valuable to business and society by reducing information asymmetry between the two groups and encouraging accurate assessment of the risks associated with global operations.

This article considers the role of hurdle rates in the analysis of investment decisions, analysing a sample of business units from the PIMS (Profit Impact of Marketing Strategy) databank of North American companies, which provides rarely observed data on hurdle rates. Although the standard literature suggests that firms should only invest if the return exceeds the cost of capital, there are several theories that explain the use of investment hurdle rates that differ from discount rates. In fact, our data show that instances where hurdle rates are either above or below the discount rate are common. In a statistical analysis, we find that this behaviour can be explained by a combination of agency theory and real options theory. We take this as important evidence that a full explanation of capital investment cannot be accomplished without a consideration of behavioural and strategic influences on the investment decision.

In the 1990s, the role of the chief executive officer (CEO) of major United States corporations underwent a profound transformation in which CEOs went from being bureaucrats or technocrats to shareholder partisans who acted more like proprietors or entrepreneurs. This transformation occurred in response to changes in the competitive environment of U.S. corporations and also to the agency theory argument that high levels of compensation by means of stock options helped to overcome the agency problem inherent in the separation of ownership and control. Some critics charge that this new CEO role is objectionable for a variety of reasons, which may also be applicable to the current financial crisis in which CEO misconduct may have played a part. These objections are based largely on a team production model of corporate governance, which is held by these critics to be superior to the standard agent-principal model. This article examines the objections offered by critics of the changed role of the CEO and argues that their negative assessment of this development and their use of the team production model to support their conclusions are not warranted. CEOs have changed from hired hands to co-owners, and this change may have contributed in some measure to the current financial crisis. However, in determining the morally preferable role of the CEO, care must be taken not to discard what is sound in the changed role. (c) 2009 Business Ethics Quarterly 19:4 (October 2009).

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the Agency Theory in order to understand the true nature of the corporation by determining the respective roles of shareholders and directors/managers within a corporation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper compares the economists' depiction of the firm with the legal conception of the corporation. It then analyses the legal concept of ownership and proves that the shareholders are the owners of their shares only and not of the corporation which is a separate legal person. The theories of corporation and relevant case law are also analysed. Findings - The analysis reveals that currently there are two distinct models of the corporation. The economists view a firm in terms of a nexus of contracts like a partnership where shareholders are the owners of the firm and the directors/managers are their agents. The law, on the other hand, regards the corporation as a separate legal entity with rights and liabilities of a natural person that is not subject to ownership. This doctrine of legal personality is the grund norm of corporate law from which other principles like limited liability, perpetual succession, transferability of shares and independent board are derived. However, both economic and legal models converge upon the purpose of corporation i.e. maximization of shareholders value. Originality/value - The paper highlights the distinction between economic and legal models of the firm. It points out that from a legal perspective, neither the shareholders are the principals nor the managers are their agents as proposed by the Agency Theory. The economists assume conflict of interests between the shareholders and directors and devise mechanisms to reduce agency costs. Law, on the other hand, determines manifestly the rights and liabilities of each participant in corporate structure. The directors owe their duties to the corporation and manage it without interference from the shareholders. Such arrangement is a product of historical process and qualifies a corporation as a sui generis form of business organization. (c) 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

This paper analyzes the role of compensation methods in the process of fostering corporate entrepreneurship. Drawing on agency theory and expectancy theory, hypotheses relating compensation methods to employees' entrepreneurial behavior are empirically examined in the context of defense products firms aiming at encouraging their employees' innovations at the civilian markets. The results show that entrepreneurs prefer compensation that is related to the internal venture's performance. Managers' willingness to take on civilian projects is higher if they are assured that they will be personally compensated for the project's success. Surprisingly, the more entrepreneurial employees preferred staying in the defense market rather than converting to civilian markets. (c) 2009 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study aims to evaluate the suitability of Taiwan's minimum shareholding requirement for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to examine whether stewardship theory and both incentive and entrenchment effects can characterize the ownership-performance relationship simultaneously. Research Findings/Results: We apply new empirical methods to a balanced panel dataset including 496 firm-level observations of 62 Taiwanese SMEs publicly traded from 1999 to 2006. The results show a nonlinear ownership-performance relationship, first negative then positive, with a single threshold value of insider ownership (5.4 per cent). This indicates that both effects combine and that the current regulated minimum level of insider shareholdings for public SMEs may be too high. Theoretical Implications: Our evidence supports both convergence-of-interests and entrenchment effects and suggests a better specification that prevents spurious relations obtained from traditional methods. The stewardship theory does work in Taiwan. Insiders behave as loyal stewards rather than motivated by desire for entrenchment. Our empirical evidence suggests an avenue of future research, specifically to form better strategies for those involved in corporate governance. Practical Implications: We suggest that Taiwanese authorities should lessen ownership obligations, thereby leading to improved corporate governance by increasing the independence of the boards of directors. Emerging markets can learn from the Taiwan experience and then formulate their own regulations. Publicly traded SMEs could offer compensation to insiders such as stock options and performance shares. Asymmetric information problems often experienced by outside stockholders and foreign investors can be alleviated by these signals of insider ownership. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

How do export producers and intermediaries structure their dyadic relationships? This study examines the factors that guide the behaviour and relationships between export producer and intermediary dyads. We examine both sides of a dyadic transaction and develop an export producer-intermediary behaviour typology by using a grounded theory method through qualitative interviews. We propose three forms of export producer-intermediary dyads based on the degree of information sharing, intensity of price negotiation, level of transaction costs, and partner satisfaction and propensity to export directly. These three forms are as follows: (1) competitive, (2) cooperative and (3) mismatched relationships. Copyright (c) 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

A good understanding of the nature of the firm is essential in developing corporate strategies, building corporate competitiveness, and establishing sound economic policy. Several theories have emerged on the nature of the firm: the neo-classical theory of the firm, the principal agency theory, the transaction cost theory, the property rights theory, the resource-based theory and the evolutionary theory. Each of these theories identify some elements that describe the nature of the firm, but no single theory is comprehensive enough to include all elements of the nature of the firm. Economists began to seek a theory capable of describing the nature of the firm within a single, all-encompassing, coherent framework. We propose a unified theory of the firm, which encompasses all elements of the firm. We then evaluate performances of Korean firms from the unified theory of the firm perspective. Empirical evidences are promising in support of the integrative theory of the firm. (c) 2009 Institute of East and West Studies.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the governance structure of the firm undergoing a complete buyout cycle (reverse leveraged buyout). Its purpose is to empirically explore the evolution of corporate board structures as a unique source of value creation, in addition to the agency mechanisms of the discipline of debt and incentives of equity participation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors rely on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to develop sets of hypotheses that examine changes in the board composition of 65 R-LBOs and 65 matched continuing firms spanning a 25-year period (1979-2004). Findings: The empirical results reveal numerous insights about why R-LBOs go private, to what extent boards restructure during the buyout phase, and how those changes relate to firm performance. Taken together, the findings give strong credence to the argument that boards represent a supplemental source of value creation in the buyout process. Research limitations/implications: For scholars, the study presents a platform for further inquiry into the role of boards of directors in R-LBOs as well as the inclusion of resource dependence theory to inform on the phenomenon. Practical implications: The study helps to address this new source of value creation for practical interest. It offers a benchmark for buyout firms to compare their board characteristics by establishing linkages between pre-buyout deficiencies, post-buyout modifications, and post-SIPO performance. Originality/value: The results shift scholarly attention away from the structural governance tools to the group dynamics of the board. The findings call into question the restricted attention given by buyout researchers to leverage and ownership as value drivers by prompting a closer evaluation of the relationship between buyout board structures and related structuring of debt and managerial equity participation. Furthermore, the inclusion of the resource-dependency perspective alongside agency theory as an explanatory theory allows for a richer account of the LBO phenomenon and its sources of value creation.

The paper examines the role of debt in affecting the performance/value of a firm (DVF relationship) in the developed financial market. There is no consensus on the DVF relationship in this market. In addition, literature about the DVF relationship in the developed market lacks the interpretation of results by taking into account different business, management and financial theories. The study addresses the gap in the literature by utilizing the panel data of 60 companies for the year 2000 to 2003 from the developed (Australian) financial market. The result of the study suggests that higher debt has a negative relationship with the value of a firm supporting agency theory in this market. The result also supports the second trade off theory and the foundation of developed market as debt in the presence of the dispersed shareholding deteriorates the value of a shareholder. The results relevant to the role of control variables in affecting the value of a firm show that smaller board, liquid market and information efficiency improve the firm's performance in the developed financial market. The results of the study are of value to both academics and policy makers.

Remuneration is considered to be closely connected with financial performance (positively), firm size (positively), the organizational structure (negatively) and corporate governance mechanisms (negatively). Furthermore, a connection of ownership structure and executives' remuneration has been well established (theoretically and empirically) in the literature (agency theory). The paper examines if these relationships are valid in Greece. Greece hasn't the characteristics of an Anglo-Saxon country. Overall the study has shown that remuneration levels in Greece are defined by a different set of factors than the ones that are prominent in an Aglo-Saxon country. Notably, fundamental financial measures of performance are more widely used. The age of firms and corporate governance quality have a catalytic impact on remuneration levels.

Agency theory has been widely applied to the governance of business corporations and to good advantage. The formal framework of agency theory pertains as well to polities, wherein citizens are the principals and politicians the agents. Where takeover efforts occur irregularly for corporations, they occur at regular intervals through elections for polities. Timothy Besley's Principled Agents uses the agency theory to argue that electoral competition will generally select competent and public-spirited politicians. This claim follows from his formal framework, but that framework ignores some questionable and unsettled matters that challenge Besley's relatively roseate view of the qualitative character of electoral selection.

During the 1980s and 1990s the argument that "maximizing shareholder value" results in superior economic performance came to dominate the corporate governance debates. In this paper, I outline the rationale for the shareholder-value perspective, and show that, rooted in agency theory, it lacks a theory of innovative enterprise. Hence it cannot be used to analyze the conditions under which the stock market supports or undermines the process of value-creation. To go beyond agency theory and its shareholdervalue perspective, I present a framework for analyzing the functions of the stock market in the business corporation and the influence of these functions on the social conditions of innovative enterprise. I then use this framework to explain why in the United States since the 1990s there has been a widespread trend in corporate stock repurchases, including a sharp acceleration in buybacks since 2003. Focusing on a list of the largest corporate repurchasers in the United States, I raise questions concerning the relation between stock buybacks and value-creating investments in the US economy as a whole. I conclude with a discussion of why companies do stock repurchases, and in particular whether they can be justified as a contribution to innovative enterprise. I argue that the ultimate justification for stock repurchases is the ideology of "maximizing shareholder value" - an ideology that works to the direct benefit of corporate executives who make corporate resource allocation decisions and who derive high levels of remuneration from munificent stock option awards.

Neoclassical and strategy frameworks stipulate that managers promote corporate performance and shareholder interests in their resource allocation decisions. Agency related works anticipate that executives seek their own personal interests at a cost to performance and shareholder wealth in their resource allocation choices. In this study, an attempt is made to resolve these conflicting anticipations. We propose that changes in levels of resource allocations (advertising expenditure, R&D spending, capital intensity) may be more positively associated with changes in levels of subsequent corporate performance for firms with greater external monitoring or with higher CEO ownership incentives. We also propose that changes in levels of resource allocations may directly (inversely) affect changes in levels of subsequent performance of the actively (passively) monitored enterprises, lacking (possessing) free cash flow. Additionally, we propose that changes in levels of resource allocations may directly (inversely) affect changes in levels of subsequent performance of firms with high (low) CEO ownership incentives in the absence (presence) of free cash flow. Regression models are utilized to test our proposals on a longitudinal sample obtained from the Compustat database. The empirical findings are generally supportive of our proposals.

This paper examines the relationship between corporate governance characteristics and corporate financial distress. There are two main theoretical factors of interest: the structure of the monitoring process, and the personal characteristics of non-executive directors (NEDs). The first approach is basically agency-theory oriented, and emphasises relationships that complicate proper control, such as dependents on the board (Jensen, 1993). The second approach refers to the resource dependency theory, which focuses on the quality of the director(s) involved (Hillman and Dalziel (2003). The relevant relationships are tested on a newly built database consisting of 52 listed companies in the Netherlands that became financially distressed in the period from 1993 to 2003 and a control sample of 167 listed companies. We collected data on NEDs such as age, education, dependency, other board positions (and chairmanships), workload, and the number of executive and non-executive board members. A positive relationship with financial distress was found to exist if the average workload of NEDs on the board was high, or if there was a foreigner on the board. If one of the NEDs has inside knowledge, this is negatively related to financial distress. As a final conclusion, the hypothesis originating in resource dependency theory, which is that the human characteristics of NEDs are important in avoiding financial distress, cannot be rejected with regard to the Netherlands as examined in the period from 1993 to 2003.

In the first section, I explain the historical evolution of basic theoretical concepts like the theory of firm, the theory of market process and the theory of property rights. The second section is dedicated to the explanation of the general concept of agency problem extended with the problem of asymmetric information leading to adverse selection and the problem of moral hazard, in context of previous historical connections. In the last section, the author provides some suggestions for the further theoretical and empirical research. (c) Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka V Praze.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance model in Asia. The paper finds that all of the investigated Asian economies issued new corporate governance codes to promote best practices in the Anglo-Saxon model after the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. In our sample, the majority of listed firms in Asia implement a separate CEO/chairperson position and appoint a significant number of non-executive directors on the board. The result of this study also indicates that the prediction of the agency theory is valid under the Asian context. Using the combined sample of all Asian economies, we find that ownership concentration has a positive relation on firm performance and the controlling shareholder's ownership has a decreasing positive link with firm value. In addition, firms with a board dominated by non-executive directors are associated with higher performance, and smaller boards are linked with better performance. The paper also finds that the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance model is more effective in Asian countries adopting the continental law system and without the influence of Confucian values.

This article documents significant improvements in the quality of corporate governance in Estonian listed firms between 1999 and 2007. Basing our approach in the agency theory framework, we construct a corporate governance index reflecting the specificities of transition economies in general and Estonia in particular. We base our index on best practice using a number of widely recognised sources. Using hand-collected publicly available data for 1999 and 2007, we calculate a corporate governance score for every listed company. Comparing the scores, we find an overall improvement in corporate governance during the period, which coincided with Estonia's accession to the EU. We find evidence that some corporate governance practices are better in cross-listed firms and those which were already in existence in 1989 and which were subsequently privatised. We identify some areas of corporate governance where practices could be enhanced.

This paper examines the impact of corporate governance and audit quality on risk taking in the U.S. property casualty insurance industry. The evidence shows that some corporate governance variables, as well as some audit quality variables are related to risk taking. We find that longer board tenure is associated with low underwriting risk. But the higher percentage of financial experts on the board is associated with high underwriting risk. The possible reason is that financial experts possess a deep understanding of a firm's financial situation and may encourage the management to take higher risk in anticipation of a higher return for a positive net present value project. The results are consistent with agency theory and wealth transfer hypothesis in that high risk taking is consistent with shareholder interest maximization. In addition, we find a non-monotonic relation between insider ownership and leverage risk. Finally, we do not find evidence that the Sarbanes-Oxley act have impact on the risk taking behavior.

In a knowledge economy, the management of an organisation's human capital is critical and prudent management often translates into the attainment of a sustainable competitive advantage. The interaction of knowledge workers with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has presented a particularly interesting dynamic to researchers who study changes in related behavioural phenomena. One such phenomenon is self-monitoring. This paper examines the economics of self-monitoring and the integral role of ICTs in enabling knowledge workers to self-monitor. By merging Foucault's power/knowledge ideas with classical agency theory, we gain a richer understanding of human capital dynamics in a knowledge economy.

I conduct a panel data analysis by following each of the 68 non-financial firms listed on ISE over a time span of 8 years. In total, I collect 544 firm-year observations over the entire 1994-2005 period. I find a non-linear relationship between the retained proportion of the insiders' share holdings after IPO and the dependent variables (OPROA, ROA and Tobin's Q). There is no significant relation between executive remuneration and post-IPO operating and market performance. This may be due to the low pay for performance sensitivity of the executive remuneration data used in this study. I find a significant relation between ownership concentration as measured by Herfindahl indexes and the performance measures. I also distinguish mainly four types of contractual privileges (contractual devices or lock-on-control mechanisms) given to the controlling shareholders from the IPO prospectuses; "right to receive a pre-determined amount of dividend, right to buy new shares from the existing shareholders, appointment of the pre-determined number of board members and right to cast more than 1 vote for one share". I also find that these privileges have important implications for post- IPO performance in Turkey. (c) International Economic Society.

The paper reviews and discusses the literature on the concept of incentive in management; the visions of ancient Greek philosophers, classical economists, scientific management, agency theory, contracts, property theory and transaction costs theory. The discussion shows that the transaction costs theory, with its central idea of forms of governance, constitutes a comprehensive view of incentives that explains what are the inexplicable paradoxes for other theoretical perspectives. The paper analyzes the relations between incentives and helps to build up a theoretical and useful formal model of incentives.

This paper examines the link between equity compensation and executive risk taking in the merger process. We develop our hypotheses based on agency, prospect, and behavior agency theories. Based on a sample of 668 mergers during the period of 1993 to 2005, we find that acquiring firms'CEOs and executives have significantly higher equity compensation as a ratio of total compensation and their value of equity compensation enjoys a higher sensitivity to share price and return volatility compared to target firms prior to the initiation of the merger. When management is compensated with more stocks or options and the pay-for-performance sensitivity of their compensation is higher, they are more likely to acquire risky and high growth targets. This implies that stock and option grants induce risk-taking decisions for management, suggesting that equity compensation provides management with incentives to align with a firm's desired risk taking behavior.

We examine the determinants and implications of Chinese corporate cash holdings in the 1993- 2006 period. Agency theories assert that firms with a large controlling shareholder have relatively large cash holdings because of the greater ability of the controlling shareholder to extract private benefits from the cash holdings. Our findings show a very strong inverse relationship between cash holdings and firm valuation in high government ownership firms. Also, we find that in firms with high government ownership, dividend payouts are highly valued. We conclude that Chinese investors see government ownership as a factor that reduces firm value. They prefer relatively higher dividends from firms having high government ownership. Conversely, investors assign much higher value to firms with relatively low government ownership and they tend to be neutral about the dividends payouts of such firms. Also, investors value highly the presence of foreign investors in Chinese firms and tend to be neutral about dividend payouts of firms with high foreign ownership concentration.

Bondholder governance through the use of bond covenants and the interactions between shareholder and bondholder governance mechanisms has been recently highlighted in the corporate governance literature. In this paper, we study bondholder governance mechanisms through takeover-related bond covenants (i.e., poison puts), confirm with agency theory on the characteristics of firms that are more likely to use these covenants, and emphasize the importance of bondholder governance in the overall structure of corporate governance. We find that poison puts are often bundled with asset sale, payout, and financing restrictions, which is consistent with agency theory. We also find that high growth firms, large, profitable, low-leverage firms are more likely to use poison puts. In addition, our results on free cash flow, insider and institutional ownership provide support for agency explanation. Lastly, we find that poor bond market performance and good equity market performance are likely to motivate the incidence of poison put bond issuance. Volatility of interest rate and volatility of bond index returns motivate more issues of poison put debt. Finally, greater market term and default premiums promote the use of poison puts.

This study investigates variables that explain why bidding firms raise their offer price following a negative capital market reaction to a takeover announcement. We find that whilst an increasing number of blockholders restrains the pursuit of unprofitable takeovers, greater institutional ownership and takeover hostility increases the likelihood a bidder will raise their offer price. Multiple bidders and board independence are unrelated to an increase in takeover price. Inconsistent with agency theory, management ownership and free cash flow do not explain bidder actions.

As a consequence of the paradigm shift from an industrial society to an information society, the role of the entrepreneur ought to change from being an inventor of product/services to become a value creator. Hence, the focus of entrepreneurial ventures should be shifting towards creating viable business models rather than superior product/services. One major implication of the shift of entrepreneurial endeavour from product/services towards creating new business models is that hands on investors behind companies' have to be involved closer to the inception of new ventures in order to contribute to their portfolio companies.

Agency theory suggests that firms with very high cash balances ("cash hoarders") are likely to misinvest their funds. However, if investors do not fully recognize the implications of a high cash balance, then future returns may be predictable for cash-hoarding firms. We find that cash hoarders significantly underperform over the two years following their identification as hoarding. In subsequent analysis, we find that returns are significantly negative in the year that a prior cash-hoarding firm reports a significant decrease in cash. Our results suggest that investors do not fully appreciate the implications of a high cash balance for future returns, but do recognize problems when that cash is subsequently spent.

Agency theory and resource-based view explain the competitive advantage of family firms from the perspective of agency cost and resource in family firms. However, their explaination all overlook the competitive environment in which family firms are embedded. This paper tries to explain the competitive advantage of family firms from the perspective of organizational flexibility. More specifically, it: (a) reviews the theoretical studies on the competitive advantage of familyfirms from agency theory and resource-based view; (b)explors the relationship between characteristics of family firms and organizational flexibility; (c)summarizes the determinants of organizational flexibility of family firms.

Should a landlord adopt a wage labor, a crop sharing or a fixed-payment land rental contract with a particular tenant? The emergence of the agency theory to the contract choice in the 1970s and 1980s has generated a substantial body of theoretical and empirical research on why and under what conditions each contract is chosen. This paper reviews the literature on the contractual arrangements in agriculture, focusing on the principal-agent theory. After reviewing the agency theory we provide a synthesis and integration of the main contributions to contract choice in agriculture, highlighting current controversies over results. We find this theory provides a coherent and useful framework to answer sharecropping questions, but we also observe that there is weak empirical support for many of the central tenets of agency theory that need to be addressed. Finally, we discuss the implications of these issues and outlining directions for future theoretical and empirical work.

This article takes a broader perspective that encompasses both traditional agency-based explanations of buy-outs as well as recognizing the buy-out phenomenon as a vehicle for entrepreneurial innovation. Although early studies suggested that buy-outs involved both agency cost reduction and entrepreneurial aspects, they did not formally conceptualize these two approaches. The agency theory approach conceptualizes buy-outs as a tool that facilitates cost efficiencies. The entrepreneurial perspective sees buy-outs as a means for implementing new innovations and strategic change that enable fuller exploitation of firm resources that may have been blocked by prior ownership arrangements, such as being part of a large diversified firm or a privately-owned firm with leadership succession problems. The article first elaborates the definitions and sources of buy-outs. Secondly, it reviews theoretical perspectives relating to buy-outs, notably the agency approach and an entrepreneurial perspective which draws on the theory of entrepreneurial cognition. The third main section reviews a model to explain different types of buy-out drawing on these two perspectives. The fourth section reviews studies of the effects of buy-outs, identifying evidence consistent with agency and entrepreneurial views of buy-outs. The final section provides discussion and conclusions. (c) Oxford University Press, 2006. All rights reserved.

The dual-board corporate governance mechanism adopted by publicly listed companies in China combines the board of directors found in the American system and the supervisory board in the German system. Using agency theory, this study investigates the effects of the characteristics of the supervisory board, and in particular its monitoring functions, on the financial risk-taking decisions made by corporate boards. We find that the frequency with which a supervisory board meets can be divided into monitoring-driven and non-monitoring-driven components, and that its monitoring effects on financial risk-taking behaviors are non-linear.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the determinants of stock options attribution. We hypothesize that the equity held by managers, the ownership concentration, the liquidity constraints, the firm risk and the firm size are related to the firm's attribution of stock options. Using a sample of 44 companies listed in Euronext Lisbon, we find that only equity held by managers and firm size are related to the firm's attribution of stock options, documenting a positive relationship for both.

Agency theory predicts that managerial ownership reduces agency cost and increases firm value. However, empirical evidence on the ownership and firm value relation is, at best, mixed. To date, there is no evidence on how exactly managerial ownership affects firm value and through what channel ownership improves value. Our paper fills in the void in the literature by addressing these issues. As a firm's operating efficiency is an important indicator of its managerial performance, we uses changes in managerial ownership as an argument to evaluate changes in firm value and hypothesizes that changes in managerial ownership affect firm's operating efficiency, which in turn drives firm value. Using a large panel data set (4,451 observations for 1,162 firms for year 1990-2001), we find significantly positive relation between changes in managerial ownership, operating efficiency and changes in firm value. Larger increase in managerial ownership provides greater alignment of managerial interests with those of shareholders, hence greater improvement in firm value. However, this relation is not monotonic. The positive impact on firm's value increases at a decreasing rate. Our simultaneous equation tests remove the endogeneity concern between managerial ownership and firm value.

The implementation of teamwork has been growing steadily in the last decade. Companies suppose that the use of teams improves their performance and supports the achievement of their strategic goals. The high relevance of teams in the business world is reflected by an increasing literature on teamwork, team success and the management of teams. One central question concerning the management of teams is the design of pay systems, especially of performance-based pay systems for teams. This aspect has not yet been fully explored in the literature with regard to the agency problems that are associated with managing teams and teamwork. This paper aims to close that gap by exploring how performance-based pay systems for teams should be designed from an expanded agency theory perspective with regard to possibly arising agency problems.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: We examine the business case for the inclusion of women and ethnic minority directors on the board. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the number of women directors and the number of ethnic minority directors on the board and important board committees and financial performance measured as return on assets and Tobin's Q. Research Findings/Insights: We do not find a significant relationship between the gender or ethnic diversity of the board, or important board committees, and financial performance for a sample of major US corporations. Our evidence also suggests that the gender and ethnic minority diversity of the board and firm financial performance appear to be endogenous. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Reasonable theoretical arguments drawn from resource dependence theory, human capital theory, agency theory, and social psychology suggest that gender and ethnic diversity may have either a positive, negative, or neutral effect on the financial performance of the firm. Our statistical analysis supports the theoretical position of no effect, either positive or negative. Our results are consistent with a contingency explanation because the effect of the gender and ethnic diversity of the board may be different under different circumstances at different times. Over several companies and time periods, the results could offset to produce no effect. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The results of our analysis do not support the business case for inclusion of women and ethnic minorities on corporate boards. However, we find no evidence of any negative effect either. Our evidence implies that decisions concerning the appointment of women and ethnic minorities to corporate boards should be based on criteria other than future financial performance.

In this study, we view the contracts of top managers from an integrated agency theory-trust perspective, arguing that two conditions reflecting CEO risk bearing, top management team (TMT) behavioral uncertainty and CEO vulnerability, are negatively related to a CEO's perceptions of TMT benevolence toward him-/herself, which in turn influence the protective features of TMT contracts. Model tests on data from 122 family-owned firms in Spain support our hypotheses overall. Agency theory may be enhanced by accounting for a CEO's perceptions (as principal) of TMT benevolence and for the effect of those perceptions on contracts with TMT members (as agents).

Much of the literature on corporate acquisitions has focused on managerial incentives for making acquisitions but has underemphasized the role played by the social context of major shareholders. This study of Fortune 1000 firms argues that the priorities and risk preferences of family owners can have important implications not only for the volume but also for the diversifying nature of their acquisitions. Agency and family business perspectives are used to derive expectations concerning the acquisitions behavior of family owners. Consistent with both perspectives, and owners' desire to reduce business risk, we find that family ownership is inversely related to the number and dollar volume of acquisitions. However, whereas agency theorists differ about how ownership concentration influences whether acquisitions are diversified, the family firm literature is more definitive. The latter suggests that given family owners' desire to retain control of their firms for offspring, their wealth must remain concentrated. Hence they can most easily reduce the risk of their wealth portfolio by diversifying the business-that is, through diversifying acquisitions. Consistent with this logic, we found the propensity to make diversifying acquisitions to increase with the level of family ownership. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines performance effects of ownership concentration and two types of private equity investors (venture capitalists and business angels) in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO) in the United Kingdom and France. We expand and contextualize nascent understanding of multiple agency theory by examining heterogeneity of private equity investors and by suggesting that multiple agency relationships are affected by different institutional contexts. We employ a unique, hand-collected dataset of 224 matched IPOs (112 in each country). Controlling for the endogeneity of private equity investors' retained share ownership, we find support for the agency theory argument that concentrated ownership improves IPOs' performance. The research also shows that the two types of private equity investors have a differential impact on performance, and the legal institutions in a given country moderate this impact.

This paper focuses on talent management failure by multinational enterprises (MNEs). It examines barriers to corporate advancement of talents located in subsidiaries and more specifically on promotion of talent already employed by the MNE to be part of the upper echelon management team at its centre. Drawing on agency and bounded rationality theories, we discuss the underlying causes of talent management failure in MNEs. At the subsidiary level, we draw on agency theory to delineate self-serving mechanisms displayed by subsidiary managers that might hinder effective talent management systems throughout the MNE. At the headquarter level, we use bounded rationality to explain how decision-making processes, and information top management teams use to make decisions about talent management results in overlooking talents at subsidiary level.

We draw from legal theory to offer a fundamental rethinking of agency theory along three key dimensions: redefining the principal from shareholders to the corporation, redefining the status of the board from shareholders' agents to autonomous fiduciaries, and redefining the role of the board from monitors to mediating hierarcha. These dimensions contrast with classic agency theory, offering novel conceptions that can inform further theorization and empirical research in corporate governance. (c)Academy of Management Review.

This research extends agency theory by exploring the influence of varied, competing, principal interests on executive actions. Findings reveal that ownership of a firm by dedicated institutional investors, who hold concentrated portfolios over time, is positively associated with firm use of strategic competitive actions. Ownership by transient institutional investors, who hold broad portfolios and make frequent trades based on current earnings, is negatively associated with strategic competitive actions and positively associated with tactical ones. Appreciable ownership of the same firm by these two classes of investors influences both strategic and tactical competitive actions. These results have broad implications for executives, investors, and policy makers. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Agency theory suggests that managerial mischief may occur when the interests of owners and managers diverge and that a solution to this agency problem is alignment of owner and agent interests through agent compensation and equity ownership. We develop the theoretical concept of CEO return and measure and estimate financial alignment as the relationship between CEO and shareholder returns. Our results, based on this new conceptualization and corresponding measurement, suggest stronger alignment than reported in previous work. The magnitude of this alignment is associated with subsequent firm performance, but in ways not clearly articulated or tested in prior research. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

This paper examines the impact of multiple directorships on stockholder wealth around the announcements of mergers and acquisitions. Grounded in agency theory, we argue that multiple directorships affect the quality of managerial oversight and thus influence agency conflicts in acquisition decisions. We show that acquiring firms where directors hold more outside board seats experience more negative abnormal returns. This adverse effect, nonetheless, does not extend across the entire range of multiple directorships. Rather, the detrimental impact is significant only when the number of outside board seats surpasses a certain threshold. We interpret this result as suggesting that directors serving on multiple boards allow value-destroying acquisitions when they become too busy beyond a certain point, and the effect of directors' busyness on acquisition performance appears to be nonlinear. We employ several alternative definitions of directors' busyness and obtain consistent results. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the relationship between corporate governance quality and dividend policy in Canada. Based on the agency theory predictions, we consider the effect of two conflicting hypotheses about the effect of corporate governance on dividend payouts: the outcome and substitution hypotheses. The effectiveness of firm-level governance mechanisms is assessed through the Globe & Mail annual corporate governance index and four sub-categories scores (board composition, shareholding and compensation issues, shareholder rights issues and corporate governance disclosure policy). Using a sample of 714 firm-years listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange over the period 2002-2005, our results show that firms with stronger corporate governance have higher dividend payouts. Among the four components of the corporate governance index, we document that board composition and shareholder rights' policy are positively related to payout ratios. We also find a positive association between firm size, the level of free cash flows and dividend payouts. Finally, we document a negative relationship between firm risk, US cross-listing and dividend payouts. Taken together our results are consistent with the outcome model of dividend policy.

We provide an overview of the articles and commentaries devoted to theories of family enterprise in this special issue and link them to the concept of trust. Trust is a governance mechanism and theoretical construct of particular relevance for family firms, encapsulating some of their advantages and disadvantages. Trust is also linked to theoretical frameworks such as agency theory, stewardship theory, social capital theory, and transaction cost economics that are often used in family business studies, including those found in this special issue. Consequently, we advance trust as a bridging concept to reconcile and enhance our understanding of family firms as a unique organizational form. (c) 2010 Baylor University.

A wealth of research indicates that both executive characteristics and incentive compensation affect organizational outcomes, but the literatures within these two domains have followed distinct, separate paths. Our paper provides a framework for integrating these two perspectives. We introduce a new model that specifies how executive characteristics and incentives operate in tandem to influence strategic decisions and firm performance. We then illustrate our model by portraying how executive characteristics interact with a specific type of pay instrument- stock options-to affect executive behaviors and organizational outcomes. Focusing on three individual-level attributes (executive motives and drives, cognitive frame, and selfconfidence), we develop propositions detailing how executives will vary in their risk-taking behaviors in response to stock options. We further argue that stock options will amplify the implications of executive ability, such that option-heavy incentive schemes will increase the performance of talented executives but worsen the performance of low-ability executives. Our framework and propositions are meant to provide a starting point for future theorizing and empirical testing of the interactive effects of executive characteristics and incentive compensation on strategic decisions and organizational performance.

This exploratory study sought to investigate how well 98 firms in three industries, across 10 countries, are addressing climate change through five specific governance practices. The findings suggest that non-US firms demonstrate higher performance on the governance dimensions than their US counterparts. Further, by separating firms into low versus high performers on the governance dimensions, some board structure variables, such as number of directors and an independent board chair, were associated with higher performing firms. The study contributes both to institutional and agency theory. For example, coercive isomorphisms in regions of the world, such as Europe, might be driving firms to demonstrate that they are addressing climate change at the governance level in order to gain legitimacy. As for agency theory, this study offers both confirmatory and contradictory results regarding board independence. For example, firms who separated the CEO-board chair role achieved better governance on climate change, while at the same time firms who demonstrated lack of independence with respect to the inside versus outside director ratio also achieved better governance on climate change. This paves the way for additional research in understanding how board structure influences organizational phenomena. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

There is a commonly held conviction among governance scholars and practitioners that increasing the number of non-executive directors may have beneficial effects on board practices. This view has gained momentum after each wave of scandals. Given the relevance of the issue in governance studies and practices, the aim of this paper is to investigate how independent, competent and incentivized non-executive directors should be according to governance scholars and board best practices. To answer this question, we conducted a review of the literature on non-executive directors. We then collected corporate governance codes developed worldwide at the end of 2005, and made a comparative analysis of their recommendations about the independence, the competencies and the incentives of non-executive directors. Our results show that (i) non-executive directors' independence is a commonly recommended governance practice, the meaning of which differs widely among countries; (ii) non-executive directors' competencies and incentives are not considered a governance issue to be regulated in detail; (iii) agency theory and the search for appropriate board demography tend to dominate the recommendations of governance literature and codes. Our findings have implications for both research and practice. (c) 2009 British Academy of Management.

Purpose: In view of a lack of understanding of the consequences of performance-based contracting (PBC), this paper aims to reveal deeper insights into the mechanisms inherent to PBC and explore which benefits and uncertainties may result for providers and customers. Design/methodology/approach: Conducting a comprehensive literature review and drawing on insights from agency theory as a framework, the auhtors analyzed a broad range of academic publications on the benefits and uncertainties of PBC and developed testable propositions from the provider's and the customer's perspective. Findings: With PBC, in comparison to the conventional selling and supporting of machinery or equipment, the manufacturers are more likely to acquire customers for highly innovative technologies, to increase their profit, and to improve customer loyalty. Manufacturers, however, have to deal with uncertain revenues and costs which affect their profit. The customers are more likely to receive increased performance at decreased costs. Concerning the performance, however, the customers enter into an uncertain relationship of dependence. Originality/value: This is the first paper to analyze the benefits and uncertainties of PBC in manufacturing industries systematically from an agency theory perspective. The paper further develops extant research by outlining the mechanisms of PBC and relating the benefits and uncertainties that are scattered over a broad body of literature. The paper proposes several promising avenues for further research. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to better understand the antecedents of shareholder activism targeted at firms located in three common law countries (i.e., USA, UK, and Australia) and three civil law countries (Japan, Germany, and South Korea) during the 2003-07 time period. Research Findings/Insights: Our findings suggest that the antecedents of shareholder activism vary by the motivation of the activist. We demonstrate that activists target firms with two motives (a) to improve the financial performance, and (b) to improve the social performance of the firm. With respect to the target firm level antecedents, we find that firm size is unrelated to financial activism, but positively related to social activism; ownership concentration is negatively related to both financial and social activism; and prior profitability is negatively related to financial activism, but positively related to social activism. Further, these relationships in the case of financial activism are generally stronger in common law legal systems, whereas those in the case of social activism are generally stronger in environments with a greater level of income inequality. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings suggest that future research should differentiate between the motivations of the activism event. Further, we find that while agency logic works well for financial activism, institutional theory provides stronger explanations for social activism. Overall, we demonstrate the complementary nature of these two theories in explaining shareholder activism. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We found that the "exposure" to shareholder activism varies by the motivation of the activist, and the nature of the firm and its national context. An understanding of these issues would help firms develop proper response strategies to activism events. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Understanding the nature of family representation in public firms has been an important topic for entrepreneurship research. Because CEO compensation is a key tool that boards use to align the interests of shareholders and managers, researchers have taken steps toward understanding how family representation affects CEO compensation. Prior research has painted family-member CEOs as stewards who accept lower compensation. Based on agency theory, we describe a different scenario wherein family representatives engage in strategic control that reduces family-member CEOs' compensation. Thus, family-member CEOs accept lower compensation only when additional family members are represented in management or on the board. In comparison with CEOs at nonfamily firms, we find that family-member CEO compensation is 13% lower when multiple family members are involved, but 56% higher when the CEO is the lone family member.

abstractBy combining insights from relational network theory and agency theory we identify the boundary conditions to the embeddedness approach to partner selection decisions in interfirm collaborations. Employing a longitudinal dataset comprising the investment syndicates for the population of UK management buyouts between 1993 and 2003, we find that relational embeddedness is less important for selecting partners when agency risks are low, allowing firms to expand their networks. Furthermore, reputational capital may act as a partial substitute for relational embeddedness, again permitting firms to expand their networks. Our findings enhance understanding of the boundary conditions associated with the relational network approach to partner selections and network behaviour. (c) 2010 The Authors.

Using a sample of 56 Italian IPOs issued between 1999 and 2005, several hypotheses are tested on the interplay between corporate governance, family ownership and performance. Specifically tested is which approach among all agency, stewardship, and contingency theory is most appropriate for Italian family firms. Findings suggest that board independence increases with family disinvestment at IPO, presence of venture capitalists, establishment of large and active boards, and existence of appointment and compensation committees. At the same time, results indicate that the presence of independent directors affects performance positively but with little statistical significance, while family involvement and the presence of execution committees negatively impact share performance.

To many, the principal-agent model is the obvious lens through which executive pay should be viewed. Such a sentiment sits uncomfortably with a large number of empirical studies suggesting that the process of determining executive pay seems to be more readily explained by recourse to arguments of managerial power and influence. This article investigates the micro-underpinnings of boardroom behavior in order to explain this departure from principal-agency theory's argument that executive compensation serves to align interests between the owners of the company and its senior managers. We find that there are strong interaction effects among social influence variables and the social setting of boardroom activity. Generous pay awards, bearing only a weak connection to corporate performance, are explained in the context of the social psychology of the boardroom. These results and a review of the empirical research, suggest the need for a more comprehensive model of executive compensation that incorporates both economic and psychological determinants.

We study the relation between stability of the nonprofit organization's environment and its board structure and the impact of this relation on organizational performance from the perspectives of both Agency Theory and Resource Dependence (Boundary Spanning) Theory. The impact of board characteristics on organizational performance is contextual. Specifically, we predict and show for a sample of U.S. nonprofits that board mechanisms related to monitoring are more likely to be effective for stable organizations, whereas board mechanisms related to boundary spanning are more effective for less stable organizations. We find that the two theories are complementary and address different aspects of nonprofit performance, but the results are statistically stronger and more often consistent with resource dependence than with agency theory. Overall, this study supports Miller-Millesen's (Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 32: 521-547 2003) contention that, because the nonprofit environment is often more complex and heterogeneous than the for-profit world, no one theory describes all tasks of nonprofit boards.

Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a panel of firms in Spain for 2000-2007, we found that ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholder erodes corporate reputation, whereas contestability of the main shareholder's power enhances it. Insider ownership shows a non-linear relationship with corporate reputation, with lower corporate reputation at low and very high levels of insider ownership. Finally, if the largest shareholder is either a pressure-resistant or a pressure-sensitive institutional investor, as opposed to other types of largest shareholder, corporate reputation is lower. This last finding markedly differentiates our sample of firms in Spain, a civil law country, from firms in common law countries such as the US and the UK, where studies have found a positive relationship between institutional investors and corporate reputation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Drawing on signaling and agency theories, our paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to analyze the influence of ownership structure on corporate reputation in civil law countries. Practitioners/Policy Implications: This study suggests that managers and directors should recognize how each characteristic of ownership structure influences the expectations of stakeholders. Low levels of ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholders, low differences in ownership concentration between first and second largest shareholders, and moderate levels of insider ownership are positive signals that should be communicated to foster corporate reputation. High levels of ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholders or high differences in ownership concentration between first and second largest shareholders impair corporate reputation and should be compensated by introducing corporate governance mechanisms that favor corporate reputation, such as increasing the number of independent directors or avoiding CEO duality.

It has been argued by researchers that agency theory has limitations as the underpinning theory for governance given its inability to recognize the wider environmental influencing forces impacting on organizations. This paper provides a case for incorporating a number of management-based theories to augment agency theory in recognizing these wider environmental influencing forces and the consequent extended governance paradigm it creates. Through a theory building approach that reviews and critically analyses the extant literature, a case is built to integrate four existing theories that complement each other to recognize these wider influencing forces. The paper argues that the proposed approach will narrow the theoretical practical gap in governance and will consequently have policy implications on governance guidelines. Further research is suggested to validate the approach with a wide range of real life organizational settings. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose using agency theory for assessing the likelihood of quality fade in buyersupplier relationships and prescribing contractual mechanisms for reducing quality fade. In this paper, quality fade, an element of supply chain vulnerability, is defined as the unforeseen deterioration of agreed to or expected quality levels with respect to product and/or service requirements. The use of outcomebased, behaviorbased, or mix contracts can be used to reduce the likelihood of quality fade and illustrate preferred scenarios for buyer and suppliers. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a conceptual model for using agency theory to explain and address a type of supply chain vulnerability called quality fade. A 2x2 matrix is proposed that contrasts outcome measurability with outcome uncertainty to illustrate buyer and supplier vulnerability and to suggest contractual mechanisms that can be used to mitigate vulnerability for both parties. Findings - A typology of governance mechanisms is presented and described with the use of a manufacturer thirdparty logistics provider example to illustrate the theoretical framework. Four different scenarios are discussed and described. Contractual mechanisms are provided to mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce quality fade. Originality/value - Quality fade is a term that has not been described extensively in academic literature but is a term that is relevant in the broader discussion of supply chain vulnerability. Given that quality fade is a behavioral, as opposed to process oriented, approach, it requires a theoretical framework rooted in behavioral considerations. Agency theory is an appropriate framework for studying governance options. (c) 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

This article discusses how organizations exchange with one another in China, focusing on the type of organizational ownership and the form of governance mechanism. The theoretical foundation builds on institutional theory, resource dependence theory, agency theory, and evolutionary theory. Given the three main forms of organizations in China - state-owned enterprises, privately owned enterprises, and foreign-invested enterprises - we show how these organizations choose between two types of governance mechanisms, contracts and guanxi, to manage interorganizational exchanges. We then analyze the possible modes of interaction between organizational forms. We argue that the relative importance of guanxi is likely to decline or that guanxi will shift from being primary in some organizations to complementary in all organizations with the progress of market transition. This conceptual framework is expected to help provide the momentum for further theoretical exploration and empirical study in this area. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

We critique transformational leadership education in university business schools based on a literature review, a study of the websites of 21 leading business schools, and an analysis of two presentations to business school students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University by the former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. Our critique draws attention to the unresolved tension between two motivating ideas that underpin much teaching in business schools: collective interest ideas that permeate transformational leadership education; and self-interest ideas derived from agency theory. Transformational leadership tends to be depicted as a process by which leaders exert a 'top-down' influence over the activities of others, while simultaneously asserting that their organizations have a common purpose and pursue a collective interest. We highlight the risk that business schools are producing graduates who will attempt to appeal to common needs (guided by precepts of transformational leadership) but who will simultaneously enact contradictory performance management systems (guided by agency theory). We encourage business school educators in leadership to adopt approaches which are more critical, relational and reflexive. We suggest some general directions for an alternative leadership prospectus, based on followership, the promotion of critical upward communication within organizations, and the recognition of leadership as a contested, discursive and co-constructed phenomenon.

This study uses a sample of 213 Brazilian firms listed between 1995 and 2004 to examine the effect of the presence or absence of growth opportunities on the subsequent effect of leverage, dividend payout, and ownership concentration on firm value. First, we find that leverage plays a dual role: whereas it negatively affects the value of firms with growth opportunities (i.e., underinvestment theory), it positively affects the value of firms without growth opportunities (i.e., overinvestment theory). Second, we find that dividends play a disciplinary role in firms with fewer growth opportunities by reducing free cash flow under managerial control. Finally, the results show that ownership structure has a nonlinear effect-that is, ownership concentration initially improves the value of most firms. However, after a certain threshold, in firms with growth opportunities, the risk increases that large shareholders expropriate wealth at the expense of minority shareholders. Copyright (c) 2010 M.E.

In industrial selling situations, the questions of what factors drive pricing authority delegation to salespeople and under what conditions price delegation is beneficial for the firm are often asked. To advance knowledge in this area, we (1) develop and empirically test a framework of important drivers of price delegation based on agency-theoretic research and (2) investigate the impact of price delegation on firm performance, taking into account agency theory variables as potential moderators. The study is based on data from a sample of 181 companies from the industrial machinery and electrical engineering industry in Germany. The results indicate that the degree of pricing delegation increases as information asymmetry between the salesperson and sales manager increases and as it becomes more difficult to monitor salespeople's efforts. Conversely, risk-aversion of salespeople is negatively related to the degree of price delegation. Furthermore, we find a positive effect of price delegation on firm performance, which is amplified when market-related uncertainty is high and when salespeople possess better customer-related information than their managers. Hence, our results clearly show that rigid, "one price fits all" policies are inappropriate in many B2B market situations. Instead, sales managers should grant their salespeople sufficient leeway to adapt prices to changing customer requirements and market conditions, especially in firms that operate in highly uncertain selling environments.

We analyze bank governance, share ownership, CEO compensation, and bank risk taking in the period leading to the current banking crisis. Using a sample of large U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs), we find that BHCs with greater managerial control, achieved through various corporate governance mechanisms, take less risk. BHCs that pay CEOs high base salaries also take less risk, while BHCs that grant CEOs more in stock options or that pay CEOs higher bonuses take more risk. The evidence is generally consistent with BHC managers exhibiting greater risk aversion than outside shareholders, but with several factors affecting managers' risk-taking incentives.

Manuscript Type: ConceptualResearch Question/Issue: The aim of this research study is to theorize about the antecedents of the "board independence norm" (BIN), defined as the standard of having independent directors on corporate boards. The research approach is a comparative analysis of two governance settings - Sweden and the UK. Research Findings/Insights: The UK governance system uses a BIN of power balance from a shareholder perspective, while the Swedish governance system uses a BIN of social connectedness from a stakeholder perspective. However, our findings also suggest that exogenous variables such as pressures to conform to global "best practice" are antecedents of the BIN in the governance codes. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Any global theory of board independence must integrate differences in board structure and ownership patterns, as well as social connectedness in corporate networks. Furthermore, in addition to economic welfare, social welfare and stakeholder balance should also be considered. A synthesis of the "Varieties of Capitalism" and "New Institutional" perspectives considers that corporate governance is embedded in economic, cultural, and social contexts, yet also addresses institutional forces of conformity that are exogenous to the governance system. This seems to be a more promising framework for comparative governance research than "Contingent Agency Theory."Practitioner/Policy Implications: Multi-national regulative frameworks should focus on general principles of board independence. Local standard setters might then focus on developing a BIN that fits the specific institutional setting. We provide suggestions about how standard setters in Sweden and the UK can make their BINs more consistent with their settings. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyse the governance structure of monasteries to gain new insights and apply them to solve agency problems of modern corporations. In an historic analysis of crises and closures it asks, if Benedictine monasteries were and are capable of solving agency problems. The analysis shows that monasteries established basic governance instruments very early and therefore were able to survive for centuries. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a dataset of all Benedictine abbeys that ever existed in Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg, and German-speaking Switzerland to determine their lifespan and the reasons for closures. The governance mechanisms are analyzed in detail. Finally, it draws conclusions relevant to the modern corporation. The theoretical foundations are based upon principal agency theory, psychological economics, as well as embeddedness theory. Findings: The monasteries that are examined show an average lifetime of almost 500 years and only a quarter of them dissolved as a result of agency problems. This paper argues that this success is due to an appropriate governance structure that relies strongly on internal control mechanisms. Research limitations/implications: Benedictine monasteries and stock corporations differ fundamentally regarding their goals. Additional limitations of the monastic approach are the tendency to promote groupthink, the danger of dictatorship and the life long commitment. Practical implications: The paper adds new insights into the corporate governance debate designed to solve current agency problems and facilitate better control. Originality/value: By analyzing monasteries, a new approach is offered to understand the efficiency of internal behavioral incentives and their combination with external control mechanisms in corporate governance.

Extending the perspective of agency theory, this study incorporates both professional and local knowledge asymmetry into a model of relationship satisfaction between global professional service firms and their local clients. The model also includes learning orientation and adaptation that are theorized to regulate the impact of knowledge asymmetry on goal incongruence, which ultimately affects relationship satisfaction. China was selected as the setting of the study because it is the largest emerging market, has seen double-digit growth of advertising expenditures for the past two decades, and is home to many multinational advertising agencies that have increasingly pursued local clients as revenue sources. Multiple informants from 177 domestic Chinese firms and their multinational advertising agencies were personally interviewed, and the dyadic data were used to test the model. Results show that both types of knowledge asymmetry lead to goal incongruence, which causes client dissatisfaction. The role of learning orientation varies, as does the role of adaptation, in moderating the impact of knowledge asymmetry on goal incongruence and the impact of goal incongruence on relationship satisfaction. Theoretical and managerial implications of the findings are discussed, along with the limitations of the study and future research directions.

This paper studies the implications of risk-related agency theory on corporate cash holdings. Cash holdings are less risky but negative NPV projects from the investment perspective. Agency theory predicts that a risk-averse CEO keeps more cash holdings to reduce firm risk at the expense of shareholder value. We use a measure of CEO risk incentives based on executive stock options, and study its relation with corporate cash holdings. We find that firms with higher CEO risk incentives have less cash holdings. We find that the value of cash holdings is higher in firms with higher CEO risk incentives. These findings are consistent with risk-related agency theory. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Combining a behavioral agency perspective with research on multiple-agency conflicts, this article examines factors affecting the implementation of equity-based incentive schemes in initial public offerings (IPOs). With a unique sample of U.K. IPO companies between the years 1998 and 2002, it shows that conditional (performance-related) incentive schemes are negatively associated with share ownership and board power of the IPO's founding directors. However, the retained ownership of venture capital firms is positively associated with the probability of conditional incentive schemes. Board independence weakly effects on the toughness of executive compensation. The article's interesting findings suggest a number of avenues for a future analysis of the governance development process in threshold firms. (c) 2010 Southern Management Association.

Much of the existing research in corporate governance has been directed at examining the consequences of board leadership structure on various organizational issues, with little to say about the determinants of this structure. By exploring either agency theory or stewardship theory, researchers provide contested conclusions regarding board leadership structure. The underlying premise of both theories is that 'one universal structure fits all'. However, the main argument of this paper is that the appropriate board leadership structure varies with some contextual variables and certain actors in a given environment. Econometric analysis demonstrates that board leadership structure varies with firm size, age and ownership structure. The implication of this result is that the assertion of both agency theory (CEO non-duality structure) and stewardship theory (CEO duality structure) may be valid under certain conditions. Thus, existing theories might need to be treated as complementary viewpoints, each of which draws upon a part of the whole picture, because depending on just one single perspective is more likely to result in misleading conclusions about the structure as a whole.

This paper investigates the effects of certain corporate governance mechanisms on the performance of firms listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Based on a sample of 93 firms for the period 1996 through 1999, our results show an optimal board size of ten, favour concentrated over diffused ownership, and support separation of posts of CEO and chair. Moreover, while director shareholding is found to be an insignificant factor affecting firm performance, the results show expatriate CEOs performing better than their local counterparts. We need to err on the side of caution as sampling selection was based on data availability rather than any probability criterion. Copyright (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Agency theory offers a foundation for explaining the impact of project monitoring on project success. This study applied agency theory to survey 428 information systems project managers concerning their project monitoring, shirking by systems developers, and project success. Greater project monitoring via planning and meetings predicted less shirking, while greater monitoring via responsibilities and comparison did not. Less shirking via poor focus predicted increased project success, while less shirking via loafing did not. These findings have implications for project managers and project management researchers.

Due to the significant role of non-profit organizations in the development of modern societies, these organizations must adjust their boardrooms. Since traditional theories of corporate governance appear to be limited in explaining the changing non-profit world, we propose an extended model of governance that integrates the traditional arguments of agency theory with a cognitive dimension. Based on a sample of Spanish foundations, we present evidence on the effect of the board composition on foundations' organizational efficiency. We show that board size and independence do not have a definitive effect on the entity's efficiency. Instead, the knowledge diversity inside the boardroom and the active character of trustees have a positive influence on resource allocation. The cognitive dimension of the extended model of governance is critical to explaining how boards impact on organizational performance. (c) 2009 British Academy of Management.

Our research seeks to develop understanding of the factors explaining venture capital investment managers' attitudes towards investment in the unique context of academic spin-outs. We provide a novel integration of both VC fund characteristics and investment managers' human capital characteristics with a unique hand-collected dataset of 68 early stage VC investment managers in Europe. Attitudes toward academic spin-out investing are positively affected by the presence of public sector capital and by investment managers who are more intensively involved with the entrepreneur. Specific human capital in investment managers who had worked in an academic environment is more likely associated with investment in academic spin-outs. In terms of general human capital, financial experience is positively related while entrepreneurial experience is negatively associated with investment attitude towards academic spin-outs. There may be a need to facilitate the attraction of people from industry and investment banking into public VC funds in particular. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The question of the influence of ownership structure on corporate diversification strategy incites debate. Past research has led to controversial results whether it is based on agency theory, strategic approach or stewardship theory. We propose new empirical evidence by applying this question to the context of family businesses in France. We find that family businesses are more diversified than non-family businesses, which contradicts past results of studies based on US samples. This finding underlines the importance of considering the diversity of international contexts. Our analysis also shows that there is a negative relationship between the presence of a shareholder block and the level of diversification only for non-family businesses. This result emphasizes the particularity of family businesses in terms of the links between governance structure and business strategy. Furthermore, our results reveal that there is no difference between family and non-family businesses in terms of the choice of diversification type (related or unrelated). (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Agency theory suggests that governance matters more among firms with greater potential agency costs. Rational investors are unlikely to value safeguards against unlikely events. Yet, few studies of the relation between governance and firm value control for investor perceptions of the likelihood of agency conflicts. Shleifer and Vishny [Shleifer, A., Vishny, R.W., 1997. A survey of corporate governance. Journal of Finance 52, 737-783] identify investment-related agency conflicts as the more severe type of agency conflicts in the US. We measure the perceived likelihood of this type of agency conflict using free cash flow (Jensen, M.C., 1986. Agency costs of free cash flow, corporate finance, and takeovers. American Economic Review 76, 323-329). We find that firm value is an increasing function of improved governance quality among firms with high free cash flow. In contrast, governance benefits are lower or insignificant among firms with low free cash flow. We show that not controlling for this conditional relation between governance and firm value could lead to erroneous conclusions that governance and firm value are unrelated. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose-This study examines the factors influencing Corporate disclosure transparency as measured by the level of voluntary disclosure (VD) in the annual reports of the active share trading firms in Egypt. Design/methodology/ approach-The design and research method are empirical using archival data to collect information on the dependent variable (VD) and independent variables (corporate governance characteristics and company characteristics). A transformed multiple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model was used to test the association between the dependent variable of VD and the independent variables. Findings-The findings indicate that the extent of VD is affected by the highly secretive Egyptian culture. This implies that the introduction of a new corporate governance code has not improved information symmetry as the overall level of VD is very low at just 19.38%. In addition, several corporate governance and company characteristics variables were found significant in explaining levels of VD by the sample companies. Research limitations-The findings have generalizability limitations as the study focuses only on the actively traded companies operating in the Egyptian stock market. Practical implications-The results of this study should alarm the regulators and financial investors from the quality of financial information being provided in the Egyptian market. These results are more alarming since the investigated companies are the top 30 actively traded companies on the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX). It is logically expected that the status of disclosure would be lower in the other less actively traded companies on EGX. Originality/value-This study provides evidence regarding three variables, for the first time in Egypt, namely ''ownership structure'' and ''number of independent directors on the board'' and ''existence of audit committees'' as explanatory variables of the level of VD. This research study will stimulate further research in understanding the importance of the role of corporate governance in promoting more transparency in other emerging economies and the need to build models that include country level factors to explain the level of VD.

We examine how small and medium enterprises manage their international partners across different market servicing modes, namely exporting, joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries. The international business literature has placed emphasis on soft issues of international partner management (such as trust, cultural sensitivity etc.) in each mode category independently. Since network arrangements and knowledge sharing are involved in all these modes, we contribute to the literature by providing evidence on the mechanisms of international partner management across market modes. Specifically, based on agency and knowledge-based theories, we seek to understand the extent to which small and medium enterprises assign rights to make decisions to partners abroad, and the types of incentives and performance monitoring schemes they use. These mechanisms are drawn from agency theory. In-depth case studies were carried out in 14 Greek small firms that employed different modes to collaborate with their partners abroad. Seven of these firms had high levels of international performance while the other seven had low levels. We identify two distinguishable combinations of governance mechanisms being implemented by these two sets of firms: high performers pursue situational decision-making with outcome-oriented incentives/performance monitoring schemes, whereas low performers pursue centralized decision-making with behaviour-oriented incentives/performance monitoring schemes.

This study examines if the CEO duality influences firm performance in Bangladesh. It also examines the interaction of industries in influencing the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. From an observation of 825 firm years the study uses a 2-stage least square regression (2SLS) analysis. The finding is that there is a negative (non-significant) relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. However, when the industry interaction terms (the role of industries as moderating variable) are added, the CEO duality and firm performance is found to vary across industries. The findings of this study suggest that the CEO duality and firm performance is contingent; no single leadership structure is universal; both the leadership structure has cost and benefits. It is beneficial in some situation supporting the stewardship theory while it is not in other situations supporting the agency theory. This study contributes to the literature on CEO duality and firm performance in the context of developing countries.

We employ three views of agency theory in unison to investigate managerial risk-taking in uncertain markets. Using 124 firms that filed to go public toward the end of the technology boom (2000-2002), we explore the influence of CEO ownership on the decision to continue or withdraw an initial public offering (IPO) in deteriorating public equity markets. We find an inverse U-shaped relationship between CEOs' equity participation and the decision to proceed with a public offering: the probability of IPO cancellation in weak capital markets increases as CEOs hold too little or too much ownership. Our results also indicate that a firm's debt levels are positively linked with the IPO decision. CEO ownership and leverage intensity interact to influence the decision to take a firm public.

The dominance of agency theory can reduce our collective scope to analyse private equity in all its diversity and depth. We contribute to theorisation of private equity by developing a contrasting perspective that draws on a rich tradition of virtue ethics. In doing so, we juxtapose 'private equity' with 'public good' to develop points of rhetorical and analytical contrast. We develop a typology differentiating various forms of private equity, and focus on the 'take private' form. These takeovers are where private equity funds are used to buy all a firm's publicly listed shares. Take private deals reduce reporting requirements and lessen the amount of public scrutiny a firm comes under. They allow greater control of a firm's assets and resources but also have effects in terms of the wider social fabric. The 'public good' and virtue ethics offer an alternative basis for theorisation of these deals. This provides a needed contrast to accounts of private equity based on agency theory.

The agency theory, transactional cost economics, and traditional strategic management perspectives have provided several key corporate financial policies. However, these policies have generally been discussed and established separately. This study explores the causal structure of corporate financial strategies for the high-tech firms in Taiwan and China. By employing path analysis and directed graphs model, this paper explores the causal relationships among investment, financing, dividend policies, and corporate performance. The results show that the investment expenditures by Taiwan's firms positively affect financial performance and the increased borrowings jeopardize company's profits. However, the financing decisions of China's firms have a positively effect on their capital expenditures. The findings suggest that firms across the Strait adopt different strategies in financial decision environments. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: We examine how various types of shareholder activists (such as pension funds and large blockholders) impact the relative use of equity incentives at the middle management level of the firm and compare this with the impact on CEO incentive alignment. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of 124 US technology firms over the period 1997-2001, we find evidence indicating voice activist shareholders, using communication pressure, are associated with the greater use of equity incentives, and higher total compensation at middle managerial levels, relative to exit activists, who exert economic pressure. The results for CEO equity incentives are similar. We also find that as the presence of institutional ownership siding with management (banks and insurance companies) increases relative to voice activists, the use of equity incentives at middle managerial levels declines. Results for CEO equity incentives are not the same. Theoretical/Academic Implications: In agreement with contingent agency theory, we predict and find evidence of differing governance mechanisms used by voice activists (e.g., public pension funds) and exit activists (e.g., large shareholders). Voice activists face a higher cost of monitoring managers as compared to exit activists, and thus they will advocate for the heavier use of equity incentive compensation at the middle managerial level. In agreement with a managerial power perspective, however, we also find the use of equity incentives for middle managers decreases as the proportion of institutional ownership siding with the CEO increases. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Shareholder activism plays a key role in aligning managerial interests below the CEO level; however, different types of shareholders have different economic and political interests in how equity compensation is shaped to achieve this. Exit activists use monitoring and voice activists substitute equity compensation for monitoring. Shareholders siding with management may also reduce the use of equity incentives for middle managers. These differing interests should be considered in crafting policy responses. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

While much has been written on specificity (e.g., in texts on new institutional economics, agency theory, and team production theory), there are still some insights to be learnt by business ethicists. This article approaches the issue from the perspective of team production, and will propose a new form of corporate governance: enlightened corporate governance, which takes into consideration the specific investments of employees. The article argues that, in addition to shareholders, employees also bear a residual risk which arises due to their specific investments. This residual risk presents a valid and legitimate basis for residual claims. In this way, employees can be seen as residual claimants due to the fact that their income depends upon a hazardous quasi rent. Therefore, this article will call on the fiduciary duty of board members to protect those employees who are exposed to such residual risks and may thus be vulnerable as a result. This leads to a fundamental change of perspective on the "theory of the firm" - a change which will adopt the theories of new institutional economics, agency theory, and team production theory in order to promote business ethics research. Against this background, enlightened corporate governance aims to follow the criterion of specific investments as a legitimate basis for residual claims. Furthermore, it seeks to understand the consequences for board members, and to promote the sharing of control and ownership. The article will close with some discussion of the implications and future prospects for business ethics. (c) Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

Purpose - Diversified business groups have become active players in Chinese economy in the recent years. While several studies have been conducted to examine the role of external factors such as market imperfection on firms' decisions to diversify, relatively few efforts have been made to investigate the impact of internal factors such as ownership structures on such decision. Building on agency theory, this paper attempts to examine the impacts of ownership type and ownership concentration on Chinese business groups' diversification strategies. Design/methodology/approach - Year 2000 annual reports of publicly traded companies on Shenzhen Stock Exchange were used to identify business groups and collect data. Multiple regression analysis was used to conduct the data analysis. Findings - The results indicate that compared to other ownership structures, governmentowned business groups tend to be more diversified, while ownership concentration seems to be related to lower levels of diversification. Industry membership also plays a significant role, but previous performance is not significantly related to diversification levels. Implications and future study directions are also discussed. Originality/value - This study contributes to the understanding of the impact of ownership structure on companies' diversification strategies in a transitional economy such as China.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The study seeks to understand whether the proximity of the largest shareholder (controller) to the locus of management - whether the controller is a top executive, a board member, or an outsider - determines the value of US dual-class firms. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of 209 US dual class firms from the year 2000 and a corresponding control sample of single-class firms, we run cross-sectional regressions to determine the effect of the controller on firm value. We present robust evidence that dual-class firm value is negatively related to controller proximity. Dual-class structure overall is unrelated to firm value, because despite its negative effects with high proximity controllers there appear to be benefits when controller proximity is low (when the largest shareholder is an outsider). Theoretical/Academic Implications: Ownership structure is a widely studied subject but most studies focus on insider ownership. More nuanced aspects of ownership such as controller proximity are needed in empirical studies and theoretical models. These nuances could help us better understand the interplay between the incentive of various parties (e.g., managers, large shareholders) and the opportunity available for extraction of private benefits. Practitioner/Policy Implications: A practitioner implication is that shareholder of high-proximity dual-class firms must seek additional control mechanisms to curb agency costs. A policy implication is that investor protection (laws and institutional structure protecting shareholders) works only to a limited extent - it curbs overt acts of expropriation, but cannot eliminate acts engineered by insiders.

Many works have analyzed franchising and identified the major research lines regarding the scientific works published until that moment (Elango and Fried, 1997; Diez de Castro and Rondan, 2004). The present paper tries to follow this process. Moreover, it is identified the theories used by researchers to study franchising -agency theory, resource scarcity theory, risk extension theory, contractual theory, transaction cost theory, as well as signaling theory-, and explained its contributions to the literature. Subsequently, four research lines are highlighted in conjunction with main literature about the topic, and emphasized those studies developed by Spanish researchers under the form of papers, conference proceedings, books, book's chapters, as well as dissertations. In doing so, we attempt to offer a whole vision about franchising literature from the 60s up to date.

Tournament theory provides the basis for an assessment of the impact of pay disparity on performance. New evidence is provided regarding tournament theory by assessing two questions: (1) whether pay disparity leads to incentives for managers to engage in strategies that benefit the shareholders of the firm and (2) whether governance quality moderates the pay disparity-performance relationship, consistent with agency theory. Four measures of corporate governance are examined in order to assess governance's moderating role on the relationship between pay disparity and firm performance. The results suggest that while pay disparity can provide incentives for better performance, consistent with tournament theory, it can become destructive if it is reflective of agency conflict.

In this paper we use agency theory to present a process of the dichotomization of the Israeli workforce into two structures, each representing distinct organizational cultures. The first structure is the private sector, led by the high-tech industry; a model where the principal has strong control over the activities of the agent. The second is the public sector, an opposing model in which the principal has virtually no control over the activities of the agents and as a result, the effectiveness within this sector deteriorates. We argue that such conflicting systems cannot exist side by side without affecting each other and we suggest a role for human resource management (HRM) in future developments. Within the public sector it is the responsibility of the principal, the Israeli government, to gain more control over the agent and employ professional HRM systems for this purpose.

The main objective of this paper is to explain how management accounting developed and the reasons that have been advanced in academic literature to support this development. Since the field is so broad, we chose to study the evolution of management accounting but focused on management control systems. The ultimate purpose of this paper is to explain how management accounting evolved and current state of the main theories behind management accounting so as to guide researchers and advanced business students. In addition to identifying the management accounting theoretical development, the paper identifies the main criticisms of these theories, thus creating a ground for future research.

Drawing a framework from agency theory, we use a panel data design to examine the factors motivating the level of demand for reinsurance in the rapidly developing Swedish property fire insurance market during the interwar period 1919-39. We find that as hypothesised, reinsurance enabled Swedish fire insurers to mitigate underwriting and solvency risks and thus increased their capacity to underwrite new business in uncertain economic times. This in turn helped to increase the supply of indemnity coverage for property (buildings) fire risks in the Swedish insurance market. We also find that as expected, investment earnings are inversely related to reinsurance purchases. However, contrary to what was hypothesised, reinsurance appears to be positively related to liquidity levels, suggesting that over our period of analysis, fire insurers could have been reinsuring to 'protect' earnings and accumulated cash reserves therefore enabling investment opportunities to be realised. Analysis of the sub-period 1919-28 further supports this contention, while our results for the economic depression years after 1929 show that reinsurance helped mitigate underwriting and insolvency risks, suggesting that the reinsurance decision of fire insurance companies could be motivated by macroeconomic factors.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: We ask two research questions: (1) How do CEO stock ownership and options influence the amount of equity capital that a foreign firm raises in US capital markets? (2) How does the foreign firm's home-country risk moderate these relationships? Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we use a sample of firms from 40 countries that raised equity capital via ADR offerings between 1994 and 2005. Using a full-information maximum likelihood approach to estimate a model that accounts for sample selection associated with non-capital raising ADRs and non-listed ADRs, as well as hot and cold equity markets, we found that CEO stock and option ownership lead to a higher level of equity capital raised. Interestingly, the level of home-country risk of the issuing firm weakens the relationship between the CEO stock ownership and the amount of equity capital raised, but strengthens the relationship between CEO stock options and ADR equity capital raised. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We develop a framework that draws on behavioral decision making and agency theory to suggest that executive risk taking varies across countries and different forms of monitoring (stock ownership versus options) and that agents may exhibit risk-seeking as well as risk-averse behaviors. We also examined the potential corporate governance costs associated with principal-principal conflict as it relates to CEO stock-based compensation and the implications for raising equity capital. Because stock ownership and stock options have different risk profiles, and foreign firms operate in countries with different home-country risk, we theorize how home-country risk will moderate the relationship between CEO stock ownership or options with the amount of equity capital raised by a foreign firm in US stock markets through the issuance of American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that US investors pay attention to the types of stock-based executive compensation used by firms that raise capital in the US. In particular, CEOs of firms from higher risk countries need to consider US investors' perceptions of their stock-based compensation because it may hamper the firm's effectiveness in raising capital in the US.

Motivated by the inconsistent findings of the linkage between early supplier involvement practice and new product development success, this study adopts both the resource-based perspective and agency theory to investigate dynamic relationships between the manufacturer and supplier during the collaboration process. Survey data were used to empirically examine the impact of the resource factor (i.e. collaboration effect) and agency factors (i.e. interaction effect) on project team effectiveness. The results showed that selecting suppliers with appropriate knowledge and resources is necessary yet insufficient to improve project team effectiveness. The agency problem plays a dominant role in determining the quality of collaboration. In particular, the study identified information sharing and task programmability as two key governance mechanisms to curb suppliers' opportunistic behaviour. The study provides insightful managerial and policy implications for firms considering early supplier involvement practice in their innovation process.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the influence of corporate governance and internationalization on research and development (R&D) investments in USbased international firms. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws from agency theory to examine the influence of corporate governance mechanisms and internationalization on R&D intensity by the use of longitudinal data from 1991, 1994, 1997, and 2000 in a sample of large, manufacturing US firms with international operations. Findings - The paper finds that CEO total compensation is positively associated with R&D intensity, whereas equity voting power, insider ownership, and duality are negatively associated. Research limitations/implications - The findings regarding insider ownership confirms agency theory, in that agents will tend to make decisions to maximize their own utility and thus would be expected to reject R&D investments. In terms of duality, the augmented discretion that CEOs assume when they also hold the chairmanship position may reduce the monitoring function of the board, making it easier for the CEO to avoid engaging in shortterm risky ventures. Additionally, CEOs are likely to demand larger salaries when faced with risky decisions because their employment stability and reputation are at stake. Practical implications - Boards concerned with firm innovation should focus their decisions on CEO salaries on total compensation rather than on shortterm performance. Total compensation may motivate CEOs to commit to R&D investments that lead to innovations despite the risk of failure and detrimental impact on shortterm profits. Firms should be cautious in granting ownership to board members. Although ownership often stimulates commitment to strategic decisions, overinvolvement of board insiders may result in risk aversion, leading to decreases in R&D efforts. Originality/value - This paper extends the literature by integrating agency theory and organization learning in a comprehensive framework, showing that governance and internationalization play a significant role in firm R&D intensity.

Efficient information management is of high relevance for the success of young and entrepreneurial service companies. These ventures face a high level of uncertainty due to their lack of knowledge about market development, customer acceptance and customer behaviour. In consequence, one of the main marketing challenges is to deal with and thus lower uncertainties perceived by service entrepreneurs and their customers. Following the information economics approach, we argue that efficient information management can be theoretically framed as an essential ingredient to entrepreneurial marketing. A qualitative empirical study is used to verify the findings and to gain deeper insights into the marketing information management of young and entrepreneurial service ventures.

Purpose - Previous empirical research interprets results from pay-performance studies in the light of either agency theory or managerial power theory. This paper aims to directly estimate the relationship between CEO power, and compensation structure, level, and performance-sensitivity. In doing so, it seeks to test the crucial assumption in managerial power theory according to which more powerful CEOs are able to enjoy higher and less performance-sensitive compensation. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested on a detailed dataset, covering compensation for CEOs in virtually all Dutch stock-listed companies, for the period 2002-2006. The paper tests whether the findings are robust against different lag structures and firm size classes. Findings - In general, most of the multi-dimensional measures of power do not appear to have a strong effect on compensation, with one exception: non-Dutch CEOs receive more variable compensation, and receive higher and less performance-sensitive pay than their Dutch colleagues. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the extant CEO compensation literature, which to date relies on interpretations of findings in pay-for-performance studies to argue for either agency or managerial power theory. The direct test of the relationship between power and compensation emphasises the importance of one dimension of a multidimensional power construct. As strong effects of performance of compensation are not found either, the paper suggests that the bipolar debate be extended to include other explanations of compensation arrangements.

This article studies the effects on accounting performance and financing decisions of Colombian firms after issuing a corporate governance code. We assemble a database of Colombian issuers and test the hypotheses of improved performance and higher leverage after issuing a code. The results show that the firms' return on assets after the code introduction improves in excess of 1%; the effect is amplified by the code quality. Additionally, the firms leverage increased, in excess of 5%, when the code quality was factored into the analysis. These results suggest that controlling parties commitment to self restrain, by reducing their private benefits and/or the expropriation of non controlling parties, through the code introduction, is indeed an effective measure and that the financial markets agree, increasing the supply of funds to the firms.

This paper examines whether post-merger board composition affects the premiums paid to target shareholders. Using a sample of 207 stock-for-stock mergers from 1996 to 2004, we show that target merger premiums vary inversely with target director representation on the post-merger board. We also provide some evidence that both inside and outside target directors may trade shareholder wealth for board seats in the combined firms. However, we do not find board ownership moderates the relation between target merger premiums and post-merger board composition. Consistent with previous studies of management incentives in mergers, our empirical evidence supports the non-perfect agency theory. That is, target directors may sacrifice target shareholder interests to obtain a seat on the post-merger board. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Internet-based affiliate marketing programs have emerged as one of the fastest-growing methods for online retailers to acquire customers and increase sales by tapping into the power of independent web sites to reach a large, diverse audience of potential customers. However, while these programs have proven effective in increasing website traffic and sales, illegal or inappropriate activities on the part of affiliates could negatively impact a retailer's brand in the eyes of customers. This study is an exploratory analysis of governance mechanisms (formal contracts, partner selection, incentives and monitoring) in one-to-many affiliate programs in Spain. Agency theory and transaction cost analysis provide the theoretical background. The conclusion is that there is a significant lack of transparency in the guidance and restrictions communicated to affiliates, and a lack of systematic monitoring of affiliate behavior, which increases the risk of opportunism or misconduct. General recommendations for managers of affiliate programs are considered. Copyright (c) 2010, IGI Global.

Decades of research on corporate boards of directors resulting in diverse and often inconsistent findings have not dampened scholarly interest in the topic. Instead, researchers are attempting to more effectively model the board-firm relationship. One such modeling approach considers the power of the board in relation to top management. Drawing on upper echelons thinking (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) and the concept of managerial power (Finkelstein, 1992), this conceptual study develops the notion of board power in relation to CEO duality. Based on a framework composed of structural, ownership, expertise, and prestige power of the board, the study develops several propositions predicting the impact of board characteristics on a key aspect of managerial power - the appointment of the CEO to the position of board chair. This work contributes to scholarly understanding of the role of agency theory in explaining corporate governance phenomena by extending upper echelons thinking to the study of boards.

This paper considers the role of opportunism in three contractual theories of the firm: rent-seeking theory, property rights theory, and agency theory. In each case I examine whether it is possible to have a functioning contractual theory of the firm without recourse to opportunism. Without opportunism firms may still exist as a result of issues arising from (incomplete) contracting. Far from posing a problem for the theory of the firm, questioning the role of opportunism and the ubiquity of the hold-up problem helps us understand more about the purpose and functions of contracts which go beyond mere incentive alignment.(c)2010 Mohr Siebeck.

The Austrian School's conventional theory of the firm is based on an attempt to synthesize Coase's concept of the firm as a centrally planned hierarchy with the Austrian theory of entrepreneurship and monetary calculation. This paper is a critique of that program as well as an attempt to outline the alternative theory of the firm, one based on the synthesis of the contractual agency theory of the firm (Alchian-Demsetz, Jensen-Meckling) with the same Austrian arguments about entrepreneurship and calculation. The firm in this paper is defined as a nexus of various markets for goods as well as for labor and managerial services rather than as a hierarchy or "organization." Both the neoclassical and Austrian critiques of the latter concept are utilized to prove that a clear distinction between the market and the firm cannot be established. That distinction is based on the misunderstanding of the firm's dynamics as exclusively tied to the managing/transaction costs ratio as well as on the mischaracterization of inter-firm relations as commanding ones (Demsetz-Alchian, Jensen, Meckling, Fama, Cheung). On the other hand, the central planning view of the firm is equally at odds with the key Mises's argument that rational economic planning is impossible in the absence of market prices (Mises, 1990). If this is so, the firm, as understood in a Coasian paradigm, would not have any reason to exist, or any reason to contribute positively to economic efficiency, because it would simply represent a centrally planned "island of incalculability" in a wider market setting (Rothbard, 2004). Since the firm is a nexus of various markets, its operation is contrary to the Coaseian assumptions led by the price signals. Only insofar as the internal firm's operation is driven by the price signals can the firm be efficient. (c) 2010 Berkeley Electronic Press and IES-Europe. All rights reserved.

While the process of pursuing an initial public offering (IPO) provides new capital with which new ventures might pursue significant opportunities, research suggests that many IPO firms decrease in value subsequent to the new offering. Using an agency perspective, we argue that the IPO process itself may not only raise direct governance costs (due to increased monitoring and bonding), but may also create a distraction for managers who need to remain focused on the strategy to effectively use a large infusion of capital from the IPO. Likewise, we argue that governance participants, especially board members, will be distracted by the work necessary to take the firm public and, as such, may not be focused on the strategic monitoring necessary for continued firm's viability. This lack of monitoring may also allow managerial opportunism to be more prevalent, especially given the large amount of capital available to managers once the IPO is completed. Accordingly, we argue that excessive governance costs (both direct and indirect) may be associated with the IPO process and subsequent IPO firm performance.

This article has two main aims. One is to reconcile Berle and Means' conclusions in 1932 about management control in large US corporations with the earlier views of Thorstein Veblen, who from much the same starting point reached a seemingly contrary position. The explanation offered in terms of changes in financial control puts many subsequent developments in a different light. The other aim, drawing on the views of Paul Samuelson about product market competition, is to question the precise contribution of the 'financialization of corporate strategy' to the institution of 'the era of shareholder value'.

Universities are changing. In order to understand and organize this change, this contribution deals with four structural images of university. They represent underlying mental frameworks which influence the organizational changes. First, three currently dominant images - named faculty federalism, presidential feudalism, and individualistic negotiationism - are described and discussed in terms of transaction analysis as well as of agency theory. Subsequently, internal dynamics among these images as well as the current dramatic effects of emergent change patterns are reflected. The concluding outlook points out solutions which are derived from organization theory. In particular, university corporatism is regarded as a workable future option.

The study investigates the relationship of corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structure and the Egyptian firm performance. This study utilizes a sample of 50 firms using the accounting and market data available for the period 2004-2006. The sample firms are all listed in either the Cairo or Alexandria Stock. The cross-sectional regression analysis is employed to test the hypotheses of the study. The results indicate a positive significant relationship between firm performance and the percentage of outside directors in boards and the existence of institutional representatives in boards. Furthermore, a significant negative relationship exists between firm performance and board size, role duality and the existence of firm's website. The results also reveal a significant, positive relationship between firm performance measures and the percentage of women members in boards of directors in Egyptian firms. Our results support previous literature and show consistency with the agency theory.

This study examines the impact of corporate governance mechanisms namely audit committee characteristics, internal audit arrangements, and managerial ownership on external audit fees. Using a sample of 539 firms listed on the main board, the results of the study document a positive relationship between audit committee independence and audit fees. Consistent with the capital reputational theory, the result suggests that independent audit committee demand for higher quality audit in order to protect their capital reputation as an expert. Contrary to our prediction, this study documents a negative relationship between audit committee expertise and audit fees indicating that auditors perceived firms with more audit committee members that possess accounting and finance expertise to be less risky and thus charged less audit fees to these firms. Furthermore, findings indicate that firms with their own internal audit function pay higher audit fees in comparison to those firms that outsourced their internal audit activities. Consistent with agency theory, the result suggests that the demand for audit services would be lower for firms whose managers own higher percentage of shares due to lower agency cost as compared to those firms with higher outsiders? ownership.

From the agency perspective, literature studying links between investor protection and governance profiles argues that family is more disposed than other shareholders to divert private benefits in countries with a poor legal framework: the question is empirically puzzling. From the stewardship perspective, the degree of familiness affects the stewardship attitude of the firm. We do not find that family firms perform worse or better than non-family counterparts. Some evidence is found as regards the entrenchment effect: family CEOs seem to weaken firm performance. Stewardship attitude - not familiness - does matter: moderate levels of stewardship improve performance and increase risk-taking.

For companies quoted on the Stock Market, the question is to make sure that the CEOs' decision-making process corresponds to a process of wealth-creation for the shareholders.

Modern corporations have been widely accused of promoting values of managerial autonomy that can result in managerial waste and opportunistic behaviour, leading organizational theorists to suggest the adoption of alternative organizational forms that should normatively and structurally limit such autonomy. However, this mixed-methods study of an alternative organizational form - income trusts (1995-2005) - finds that income trusts were also characterized by excessive managerial autonomy. Managers strategically used the income trust form in discretionary ways such as by providing little information on important decisions to external parties, limiting investors' right to oppose managerial actions and retaining firm earnings to a great extent. Thus, the article concludes that alternative organizational forms do not necessarily promote an ethical business culture since they are unable to overcome deeply institutionalized values of managerial autonomy.

Do entrepreneurs work less or harder when they borrow more? This article tests how entrepreneurial effort is affected by the firm's financing choice. In line with the typical agency theory prediction, entrepreneurial effort is negatively related to the magnitude of the equity financing. Furthermore, accounting for firm and entrepreneur heterogeneities, I find that entrepreneurs work less when they use more debt financing, and higher firm risk leads to greater entrepreneurial effort reductions.

This study examines the relationship between ownership concentration and the extent of financial ratio disclosures (EFRD) in the 2007 annual reports of Australian listed firms. Using agency theory as theoretical background, it is suggested that firms with more concentrated ownership structures are less likely to provide voluntary disclosure of financial ratios information. The univariate tests demonstrate that profitable firms, those firms audited by Big4 auditors and firms belonging to financial services industry communicate more financial ratio information. OLS regressions show that more dispersed shareholding firm's? are significantly associated with EFRD. Profitable and larger firms audited by independent and Big4 audit firms additionally reported more extensive financial ratio information.

this article essentially thinks the western traditional principal-agent theory is a kind of corporate governance theory aimed at the companies with the main character of diversified equity. Obviously it is not fit for being used as the analysis framework of the governance problem of the companies with the main character of the relatively concentrated equity or highly concentrated equity. For that matter, the article indicates that, for the companies with the main character of the relatively concentrated equity or highly concentrated equity, the explaining power of double principal-agent theory is stronger. In other words, it is more favorable to reduce the double agency costs of those companies and realize the maximization of all the stockholders' interest of the companies. This article, finally, discusses how to further perfect the corporate governance of Chinese state-owned overseas companies based on the double principal-agent theory. (c) 2010 IEEE.

Agency theory indicates that management ownership might reduce the conflict of interests between managers and stockholders. Several studies have supported the argument that executive compensation plans can motive executives to enhance firm performance and maintaining profit. This paper examines whether the compensation of executives through stock options influences the firm's restructuring or liquidation decisions. The findings suggest that, the higher equity incentive and the lower the value of executive stock option in executives' compensation plan, the more restucturing decisions the executive will make, even when these choices could accelerate the firm's failure. Nevertheless, there is only weak evidence that replacing the executive will increase the likelihood of restructuring decisions over liquidation decisions when the firm is facing financial distress.

The main purpose of this study is responding to the question: "which economic performance criteria posit a significant relationship with the board of director's bonuses, and what is the effect of the industry in this evaluation?" For this purpose, on the basis of the agency theory concept, required data were collected from all qualified firms accepted in Tehran Securities Exchange (TSE) for 2003 to 2007. Then, four basic hypotheses for investigating the statistical relation between board of directors' bonus amounts and economic value added; board of directors' bonus amounts and market value added; relative changes in bonus and economic value added growth; and relative changes in bonus and market value added growth, were specified. Consequently, by utilizing adjusted R square, analysis of variance and a linear regression model, the relationship between boards of directors' bonuses of the selected firms with economic performance evaluation measures were investigated. Each of these hypotheses was examined at the level of selected industries as secondary hypotheses. The results of the research at the level of all corporations demonstrate that, only the relationship between the market value added and board of directors bonus amount is significant. Similarly, examining hypotheses at the level of investigated industries, suggest that there is a stronger correlation between board of directors' bonus amounts and the market value added in each industries. Furthermore, by substituting relative changes in the board of directors' bonus for the bonus amounts, the results of the hypotheses were weakened, in such a way that would specify there is not any significant relationship between relative changes in board of directors' bonuses with economic value added and market value added growth.

The diffusion of public agencies seems to characterize the European approach to public management. We analyze the governance mechanisms and, according to agency theory, the related accountability requirements in order to investigate if there is a conflict between public agency autonomy and political targets achievement. According to a multiple case study analysis, we consider three Italian public agencies: the Revenue Agency (AE), Social Security National Institute (INPS), and National Procurement Agency (CONSIP). Thus, we propose a model highlighting, for each public agency, the factors that are crucial to verify both the decision-making autonomy and coherence with public policy.

We investigate the long-run M&A performance of the listed firms in China based on a sample with a comprehensive 67 transactions. Using the Calendar-Time Abnormal Return method (CTAR), this paper finds that the performance of acquirers generally underperforms after the mergers. More over, the performance of acquirers marked by related party transactions, strong management ability or small size underperforms significantly compared with the performance of those marked by non-related party transactions, weak management ability or big size. In general, M&A activities in China actually destroy the shareholders' wealth of acquirers. It is indicated from our results that the traditional synergy theory can not explain M&A activities in China well. In contrast, tunneling theory, agency theory and hubris theory can better account for the long-run performance and motives of M&A within Chinese listed firms. (c)2010 IEEE.

An organization's board is an important governance mechanism to incorporate corporate governance provisions in financial markets. Previous studies on board size and the value of a firm relationship (BVF) are inconclusive and lack a comparative and comprehensive analysis of this relationship which incorporates the role of additional factors present in the developing financial market. This study bridges the gap in the literature by providing some additional empirical evidence about the BVF relationship. This evidence is provided by performing a comparative and comprehensive analysis of the firms in developing and developed financial markets. Based on a sophisticated data set for the selected markets, two separate models are run and their results are compared. The results for this study suggest that in the developing market a bigger board improves the value of a firm, supporting the relevance of stewardship theory. On the contrary, in the developed market a smaller board improves shareholders' value, supporting the agency theory. The study has reflected the differences in the efficiency of institutional framework and the sophistication of financial development in a selection of countries, in the results on the BVF relationship. Furthermore, these results make the applicability of different business theories explaining market operations in these markets different from each other. The results are innovative and valuable to academics, analysts and industry professionals in both developing and developed financial markets.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of ownership structure and board structure on performance in VC-backed firms. Using 106 French VC-backed firms, our methodology in this paper is to estimate four equations. A regression analysis is then used to study the impact of ownership structure and board structure on performance and also to analyze whether ownership structure (ownership concentration, director ownership, venture capital ownership and employee ownership) and board variables (size, outside directors, COE-chairman duality, proportion of VC directors, proportion of employee directors and board meeting frequency) are significant determinants of VC-backed firm performance. Results indicate a strong positive relation between ownership concentration and performance and between director ownership and performance measured by ROE. And strong negative relation between ownership concentration and performance and between director ownership and performance measured by ROA. No strong relation was found between venture-capital ownership, employee ownership and firm performance. Results show also a strong negative relation between board size and performance measured by ROE and positive relation between board size and performance measured by ROA, Tobin's Q and MVA. The proportion of independent outside directors on the board was positively associated with ROE and negatively associated with ROA. The presence of a dual leadership structure is negatively associated with ROE and positively associated with ROA. No strong relation was found between the proportion of venture-capital in board, the presence of employee in board, or board meeting frequency and firm performance.

This paper presents empirical evidence related to a CEO's tenure, compensation, and performance. It reviews some generally accepted assumptions that have driven the rationale for CEO compensation packages, performance, and monitoring by the boards in charge of corporate governance. The empirical results of this paper provide only partial support for the underpinning basis of many of the compensation and corporate governance packages in today's corporate world. The paper uses data that was available to management and shareholders prior to the onset of the asset bubble that imploded during 2007-2009 period, and shows that there was already by then room for concern. The empirical findings presented here suggest that there is a mild positive relation between improvement in firm performance and the compensation package but even this is more evident in firms where the CEO service has a longer tenure compared to firms with a shorter tenure serving CEO. The results also support the findings from earlier studies that it is desirable to have an incentive scheme contingent on future returns, not only on the short time horizon. The findings presented here also confirm that CEOs who have passed the "early probation" test of time and skills and gained time to develop experience to lead the firm and its business have a stronger relationship between compensation and firm performance. However, the relatively low statistical relationships between compensation and firm performance for the whole sample overall leave room for concerns about the limited extent of their effectiveness. This paper also raises indirectly also concerns that the theoretical motivations of some compensation packages and the actual practices in the real world were not well aligned despite the large number of studies and efforts aimed at improving the relationship between CEO compensation and firm performance.

The purpose of this paper is to study the determinants of the presence of independent directors on boards of directors. Based on the agency theory, we study the different factors influencing the nomination of independent directors. The tests were applied to a sample of 79 companies belonging to the SBF120 index from 1999 to 2001. The results suggest that ownership concentration, the size of the company and institutional investors activism explain the presence of independent directors inside French board companies.

Recent literature asserts that board size is one of the crucial determinants in board monitoring. We conjecture optimal board size leads to effective and efficient decision-making. Using a U.S. firm sample from year 1996 to 2005, we examine whether board size has any impact on one of the main tasks of board monitoring - appropriate compensation for CEOs. Specifically, we investigate if board size is associated with CEOs' pay-performance sensitivity. Agency theory suggests top managers' compensation be structured in alignment with shareholder wealth. If a board is vigilant, managers who create (destroy) wealth should be rewarded (penalized). By using value added models, we construct a new sensitivity measure of CEO compensation to wealth added per share. Our findings indicate that there is a non-linear relationship between board size and CEO pay-performance sensitivity. As the board size becomes bigger, the pay-performance sensitivity follows a pattern that first increases and then decreases.

This paper tests the effect of managerial (inside) and block-holders (outside) ownership in relation to agency theory in Malaysian business environment. This study tests the agency relationship in different culture and social contact and provides evidence whether agency theory in non-western organizations have equal impact in Asian organizations. Consistent with agency theory and the convergence of interest hypothesis, managerial ownership (insiders) in Malaysia indicate a negative relationship with the demand for monitoring. This finding may be due to the fact that as the managers are also the owners, there is less conflict, less information asymmetry and less hierarchical organization structure in the companies, which lead to lower monitoring costs. However, another ownership structure, outside block-holders appear to demand more monitoring. This positive relationship may be explained by their effort to compensate their lack of involvement in the daily transactions and internal decisions of the company, especially in the concentrated business environment in the country.

This article studies the relation between a risk capitalist's investment strategy and the financed companies' performance. The exploratory nature of the study and the scarcity of this type of entity in Colombia led to the decision of using a case study to analyze the experience of the Comfandi risk capital fund. After interviewing the different stakeholders and reviewing the Comfandi contracts and files, the fund investment strategy at the beginning of the investment period was identified as well as the changes that have occurred, which enabled establishing the associated problems. In the Colombian context, the results appear to confirm that the risk capitalist's investment strategy does influence the performance of the financed companies. Indeed, companies financed by a risk capitalist with an active strategy would have better performance than companies financed by a risk capitalist with a passive strategy.

This study investigates the relationship between strong firm environmental performance and board characteristics that capture boards' monitoring and resource provision abilities during an era when the natural environment and the related strategic opportunities have increased in importance. The authors relate the proxy for strong environmental performance to board characteristics that represent boards' monitoring role (i.e., independence, CEO-chair duality, concentration of directors appointed after the CEO, and director shareholding) and resource provision role (i.e., board size, directors on multiple boards, CEOs of other firms on the board, lawyers on the board, and director tenure). The authors provide evidence consistent with both theories of board roles. Specifically, consistent with their agency theory-driven predictions, the authors find evidence of higher environmental performance in firms with higher board independence and lower concentration of directors appointed after the CEO on the board of directors. Consistent with resource dependence theory, they show that environmental performance is higher in firms that have larger boards, larger representation of active CEOs on the board, and more legal experts on the board. Their findings are generally robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. These findings have implications for managers, firms, shareholders, and regulators who act on behalf of shareholders, if they are interested in influencing environmental performance.

There is controversy in the literature about the effects of ownership on strategy and performance. Some scholars have taken agency explanations as definitive, arguing that closely held firms outperform. Empirical studies, however, show conflicting findings for firms with concentrated ownership: lone founder firms outperform, family firms do not. Such conflicts may be due to the failure of agency theory to distinguish between the social contexts of these different types of owners. We argue that explanations of performance must take into account not simply ownership, but who are the owners or executives and how their social contexts may influence their strategic priorities. Family owners and CEOs, influenced by family stakeholders in the business, are argued to assume the role identities and logics of family nurturers and thus strategies of conservation. By contrast, lone founders, influenced by a wider set of market-oriented stakeholders, are argued to embrace the identities and logics of entrepreneurs and strategies of growth. Family founders and founder-executives are held to blend both orientations. These notions are supported in a study of Fortune 1000 companies. (c) 2010 The Authors.

This paper provides a foundation for future marketing research on sustainability through the application of nine prominent organizational theories. Specifically, we consider the implications for sustainability offered by transaction cost economics, agency theory, institutional theory, population ecology, resource dependence theory, the resource-based view of the firm, upper echelons theory, social network theory, and signaling theory. We consider how each theory can help researchers to better understand the ways that firms engage in sustainable marketing and business practices, and we develop insights that emerge from simultaneous examination of complementary or competing theoretical perspectives.

In this paper, we contribute to the agency and corporate entrepreneurship literatures by focusing on board antecedents of research and development (R&D). Some researchers in this stream find outside directors negatively influence R&D spending, yet popular opinion suggests boards should be composed of outsiders, and at the same time, firms should be innovative and entrepreneurial. We begin to address this conflict by extending agency theory and incorporating resource dependence views in order to explore the influence of a wider range of director characteristics on R&D spending, a precursor of innovation and entrepreneurial activity. Our empirical results demonstrate that aspects of directors' human and relational capital (e.g. education, entrepreneurial finance experience, technical experience, and interlocks) significantly influence R&D spending. Our findings illustrate that boards can be configured to improve efficiencies, thereby reducing R&D spending, and/or to augment R&D spending. They reveal the merits of considering inside and outside directors separately and show how the independence (i.e. inside/outside status) of directors shapes the effect of their human and relational capital on R&D spending.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Does corporate governance explain US bank performance during the period leading up to the financial crisis? We adopt the factor structure by Larcker, Richardson, and Tuna (2007) to measure multiple dimensions of corporate governance for 236 public commercial banks. Research Findings/Insights: Findings reveal corporate governance factors explain financial performance better than loan quality. We find strong support for a negative association between leverage and both financial performance and loan quality. CEO duality is negatively associated with financial performance. The extent of executive incentive pay is positively associated with financial performance but exhibits a negative association with loan quality in the long-run. We find a concave relationship between financial performance and both board size and average director age. We provide weak evidence of an association of anti-takeover devices, board meeting frequency, and affiliated nature of committees with financial performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We apply agency theory to the banking industry and expect that the governance-performance linkage might differ due to the unique regulatory and business environment. Results extend Larcker et al. (2007), especially regarding the concave relationship between board size and performance, and the role of leverage. Given the lack of support for our agency theory predictions, we suggest that alternative theories are needed to understand the performance implications of corporate governance at banks. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer contributions to regulators, especially for ongoing financial reforms of capital requirements and executive compensation. Specifically, we show a consistent negative association between leverage and performance, which supports the current debate on Tier I capital limits for banks. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Agency theory and optimal contracting theory posit opposing roles and shareholder wealth effects for corporate inside directors. We evaluate these theories using the market for outside directorships to differentiate among inside directors. Firms with inside directors holding outside directorships have better operating performance and market-to-book ratios, especially when monitoring is more difficult. These firms make better acquisition decisions, have greater cash holdings, and overstate earnings less often. Announcements of outside board appointments improve shareholder wealth, while departure announcements reduce it, consistent with these inside directors improving board performance and outside directorships being an important source of inside director incentives.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to develop and test a theoretical model of the determinants of Islamic banks' social disclosures. In testing the hypotheses, the level of social disclosure in Islamic banks' annual reports is gauged based on a benchmark derived from Islamic principles. Design/methodology/approachApplying the principles of systems-oriented theories such as political economy, legitimacy and stakeholder theories, as well as agency theory, hypotheses linking Islamic social disclosure and its determinants are developed. The sample comprised 47 Islamic banks in 14 countries and the data related to the dependent (Islamic banks social disclosures) variable are collected mainly from the annual reports, while data for the independent variables (determinants) are collected from various sources. Regression analysis was conducted to test the hypotheses. FindingsCorporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure by Islamic banks varies significantly across the sample. According to the regression results, variation is best explained by the "influence of the relevant publics" and the "Shari'ah (SSB supervisory boards) corporate governance mechanism" variables. Using alternative variable measures, the regression results suggest that "level of social and political freedom" and "the proportion of investment account deposits to total assets" are also significant determinants of Islamic banks' CSR disclosure. Research limitations/implicationsThe major limitation of this paper is the small sample size of only 47 Islamic banking institutions. Future studies may expand the sample size used here. Practical implicationsThe results indicate the significance of the SSB as a governance mechanism that may increase the CSR disclosure of Islamic banks. Thus, from a policy perspective, bodies that regulate Islamic banking should consider mandating the SSB for all "Islamic banks". Originality/valueThis research is the first to provide an a priori basis for CSR disclosure of Islamic banks and to test using empirical data. The findings of this research should be of significant value to regulators, shareholders and deposit holders of Islamic banks. In a more general context, this paper is one of a few that has operationalised Gray et al.'s conception of "levels of resolution of perception" and empirically tested the concept using non-traditional organisations (Islamic banks) in a non-Western context. This adds further credibility to systems-oriented theories in explaining CSR disclosures of non-Western organisations operating in non-Western cultures.

New ventures often require debt financing but face difficulties convincing lenders of their creditworthiness because of agency problems. Researchers have shown that social capital can help small firms reduce lenders' agency concerns but new ventures do not yet have their own social capital. We propose that family involvement increases a venture's ability to borrow family social capital for the purpose of obtaining debt financing. Empirical tests with 1267 new ventures suggest that family involvement directly and indirectly improves a new venture's access to debt financing. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We empirically examine the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on CEO compensation using a large sample of the US firms from 1996 to 2010. We develop and test two hypotheses, the overinvestment hypothesis based on agency theory and the conflict-resolution hypothesis based on stakeholder theory. We find that the lag of CSR adversely affects both total compensation and cash compensation, after controlling for various firm and board characteristics. Our estimates show that an interquartile increase in CSR is followed by a 4. 35% (2. 78%) decrease in total (cash) compensation. We also find an inverse association between lagged employee relations and CEO compensation. Our results are robust to the correction for endogeneity using instrumental variable approach. Taken together, our results support the conflict-resolution hypothesis, but not the CSR overinvestment argument. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This paper argues for a greater focus on an agency theory (AT) perspective in understanding corporate governance in multinational enterprises (MNEs) since, despite recent developments, the traditional internalization theory approach limits our understanding of the behaviour of these firms. We analyse the contribution of an AT perspective to understanding various aspects of corporate governance in MNEs: internationalization, international joint ventures (IJVs), headquarters-subsidiary relationships, and new forms of global business groups. From this analysis, we suggest that even with the emerging AT literature's focus on the role of ownership as a key governance factor, there is substantial need for research on several key corporate governance mechanisms; namely, the role and nature of dominant owners, the composition of boards of directors, the separation of CEOs and board chairs, executive remuneration, and the role of the market for corporate control. There is scope to examine further the implications of different institutional environments for AT perspectives on the behaviour of MNEs. (c) 2010 The Authors.

Motivated by agency theory, we investigate how a firm's overall quality of corporate governance affects its dividend policy. Using a large sample of firms with governance data from The Institutional Shareholder Services, we find that firms with stronger governance exhibit a higher propensity to pay dividends, and, similarly, dividend payers tend to pay larger dividends. The results are consistent with the notion that shareholders of firms with better governance quality are able to force managers to disgorge more cash through dividends, thereby reducing what is left for expropriation by opportunistic managers. We employ the two-stage least squares approach to cope with possible endogeneity and still obtain consistent results. Our results are important as they show that corporate governance quality does have a palpable impact on critical corporate decisions such as dividend policy.

Purpose: This paper aims to construct a comprehensive theoretical framework for interpreting voluntary IC disclosure practices by organizations. Design/methodology/approach: Four most-commonly used theories in the area, namely agency theory, stakeholder theory, signalling theory, and legitimacy theory, were integrated in terms of the interrelated concepts relating to voluntary IC disclosure. Findings: The constructed theoretical framework includes three concepts: to reduce information asymmetry; to discharge accountability to various stakeholders; and to signal organizational legitimacy and excellence (or superior quality) to society, which are seen as motivations for organizations to disclose their IC on a voluntary basis. Research limitations/implications: The framework ignores some other theoretical perspectives which are also relevant to voluntary IC disclosure; the framework is not justified by any empirical evidence. Originality/value: This research is the first attempt to construct a comprehensive theoretical framework for the voluntary disclosure of IC; the constructed framework can be employed as a theoretical foundation for future empirical studies in relation to voluntary IC disclosure.

This paper offers a new explanation of the gender pay gap in leadership positions by examining the relationship between managerial bonuses and company performance. Drawing on findings of gender studies, agency theory, and the leadership literature, we argue that the gender pay gap is a context-specific phenomenon that results partly from the fact that company performance has a moderating impact on pay inequalities. Employing a matched sample of 192 female and male executive directors of U.K.-listed firms, we corroborate the existence of the gender pay disparities in corporate boardrooms. In line with our theoretical predictions, we find that bonuses awarded to men are not only larger than those allocated to women, but also that managerial compensation of male executive directors is much more performance-sensitive than that of female executives. The contribution of attributional and expectancy-related dynamics to these patterns is highlighted in line with previous work on gender stereotypes and implicit leadership theories such as the romance of leadership. Gender differences in risk taking and confidence are also considered as potential explanations for the observed pay disparities. The implications of organizations' indifference to women's performance are examined in relation to issues surrounding the recognition and retention of female talent.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the risk-related disclosure (RRD) practices in annual reports for 2005 Portuguese companies in the non-finance sector. Design/methodology/approach: The paper conducts a content analysis of a sample of 81 companies (42 listed and 39 unlisted). In considering corporate governance effects, the sample is reduced to the 42 listed companies that are required to disclose a corporate governance report. Findings: Implementation of IAS/IFRS and the European Union's Modernisation Directive in 2005 did not affect the quantity and quality of RRD positively. Disclosures are generic, qualitative and backward-looking. Public visibility (as assessed by size and environmental sensitivity) is a crucial influence in explaining RRD: companies appear to manage their reputation through disclosure of risk-related information. Agency costs associated with leverage are important influences also. In listed companies, the presence of independent directors improves the level of RRD. Research limitations/implications: Content analysis does not allow readily for in-depth qualitative inquiry. The coding instrument is subject to coder bias. Information about risk can be provided in sources other than annual reports. The study is confined to one year/one country and pre-dates the global financial crisis (GFC) (2008) and the implementation of IFRS 7 (2007). Originality/value: The results point to the desirability of enhancing accountability by mandating further disclosure of substantive and relevant risk-related information in company annual reports. The RRD observed are shown to be explained by a confluence of agency theory, legitimacy theory and resources-based perspectives. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Scholars and practitioners have recently devoted considerable attention to boards of directors, but far more research is needed. We still know little about how boards actually work and how their behavior may be improved to contribute to value creation. During more than two decades agency theory has been the dominant theory in studies about boards of directors. When relaxing some of the assumptions in agency theory several new pathways for new research arise. To present new perspectives on board research we follow in this essay some of the pathways arising from relaxing agency theory assumptions about complete contracts. Alternative theoretical approaches, research questions and methods are suggested. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Purpose - The aim of this empirical study is to explore the factors that affect the capital structure of manufacturing firms and to investigate whether the capital structure models derived from Western settings provide convincing explanations for capital structure decisions of the Pakistani firms. Design/methodology/approach - Different conditional theories of capital structure are reviewed (the trade-off theory, pecking order theory, agency theory, and theory of free cash flow) in order to formulate testable propositions concerning the determinants of capital structure of the manufacturing firms. The investigation is performed using panel data procedures for a sample of 160 firms listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange during 2003-2007. Findings - The results suggest that profitability, liquidity, earnings volatility, and tangibility (asset structure) are related negatively to the debt ratio, whereas firm size is positively linked to the debt ratio. Non-debt tax shields and growth opportunities do not appear to be significantly related to the debt ratio. The findings of this study are consistent with the predictions of the trade-off theory, pecking order theory, and agency theory which shows that capital structure models derived from Western settings does provide some help in understanding the financing behavior of firms in Pakistan. Practical implications - This study has laid some groundwork to explore the determinants of capital structure of Pakistani firms upon which a more detailed evaluation could be based. Furthermore, empirical findings should help corporate managers to make optimal capital structure decisions. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that explores the determinants of capital structure of manufacturing firms in Pakistan by employing the most recent data. Moreover, this study somehow goes to confirm that same factors affect the capital structure decisions of firms in developing countries as identified for firms in developed economies.

Extant research considers the IT governance choice to be a trade-off between the cost-efficiency of centralization and the responsiveness provided by local information processing. This view predicts that firms tend to decentralize IT governance in more uncertain environments. We investigate this issue by studying the relationship between environmental uncertainty and IT infrastructure governance in a sample of business units from Fortune 1000 companies. The key proposition in this paper is that the relationship between environmental uncertainty and decentralization in IT infrastructure governance is best characterized as a curvilinear relationship. That is, when environmental uncertainty increases from low to high, firms tend to first decentralize their IT infrastructure decisions to the business units to enhance their responsiveness; and then centralize their IT infrastructure decisions to the headquarters as uncertainty increases further, to achieve the benefits of coordination and to mitigate the potential agency problem in uncertain environments. Moreover, the study proposes that business unrelatedness between business units and their headquarters moderates the curvilinear relationship between environmental uncertainty and IT infrastructure governance. We find that both the propositions are supported by the data. (c) 2011 INFORMS.

As corporate managers interact with nonshareholder stakeholders, potential tradeoffs emerge and questions arise as to how these interactions impact shareholder value. We argue that this shareholder-stakeholder debate is an important issue within the overall corporate governance and corporate policy domain and examine one such stakeholder group - employees - by studying labor-friendly corporate practices. We find that announcements of labor-friendly policies are associated with positive abnormal stock returns. Labor-friendly firms also outperform otherwise similar firms, both in terms of long-run stock market returns and operating results. In addition, we find that the probability and benefits of labor-friendliness increase with the demand for highly skilled labor. Our analysis of excess executive compensation suggests that top management derives no pecuniary benefits from labor-friendly practices. We interpret our results as consistent with a genuine concern for employees translating into higher productivity and profitability, which in turn facilitate value creation. It appears that the benefits of labor-friendly practices significantly outweigh the costs and that what is good for employees is good for shareholders. (c) Springer 2010.

We use panel data from multiple wards from two hospitals spanning a three-year period to investigate the impact of automation of the core error prevention functions in hospitals on medical error rates. Although there are studies based on anecdotal evidence and self-reported data on how automation impacts medical errors, no systematic studies exist that are based on actual error rates from hospitals. Further, there is no systematic evidence on how incremental automation over time and across multiple wards impacts the rate of medical errors. The primary objective of our study is to fill this gap in the literature by empirically examining how the automation of core error prevention functions affects two types of medical errors. We draw on the medical informatics literature and principal-agency theory and use a unique panel data set of actual documented medical errors from two major hospitals to analyze the interplay between automation and medical errors.We hypothesize that the automation of the sensing function (recording and observing agent actions) will have the greatest impact on reducing error rates. We show that there are significant complementarities between quality management training imparted to hospital staff and the automation of control systems in reducing interpretative medical errors. We also offer insights to practitioners and theoreticians alike on how the automation of error prevention functions can be combined with training in quality management to yield better outcomes. Our results suggest an optimal implementation path for the automation of error prevention functions in hospitals. (c) 2011 INFORMS.

This paper contributes to multiple agency theory by examining how the compensation schemes awarded to outside directors and the CEO jointly affect firm-level risk taking. Using data of the S&P 1500 firms from 1997 to 2006, we find support for earlier arguments that providing the CEO, the outside directors, or both with stock options increases risk taking. More importantly, we find that compensating outside directors with stock options has significantly stronger effects than CEO stock options. Finally, contrary to what one would expect, we find that these effects are mutually substituting; that is, if both the outside directors and the CEO are provided with stock option compensation, outside directors' incentives weaken the effect of the CEO's incentives on firms' risk taking.

The benefits of corporate social responsibility (CSR) affect the entire supply chains a firm participates in. However, not every firm is in a position to force the implementation of CSR in its supply chains as some, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), lack the necessary power. Chain directors can implement it acting as a principal, whereas the other chain members can act as agents. In the principal-agent framework, two main problems occur due to information asymmetry: adverse selection and moral hazard. This paper examines how a code of conduct (i.e. Social Accountability 8000) can help address the principal-agent problem, for SMEs, between chain directors and partners. The research method involves four case studies on CSR practices as implemented by Italian and Dutch SMEs within their supply chains. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is twofold: to evidence the disclosure practices of Spanish companies in relation to a voluntary typology of strategic information; and to determine the factors that explain these practices. Among the factors considered, the study seeks to focus on the role of the Board of Directors in depth. According to Agency Theory, strategic information has positive consequences on external funds costs. On the other hand, Proprietary Costs theory limits these practices, given that they can lead to competitive disadvantages. Design/methodology/approach: First, online strategic information disclosure practices are analysed by examining non-financial quoted Spanish firms. A disclosure index is created, and subsequently, certain factors related to corporate governance - Activity, Size and Board Independence - as well as other factors traditionally analysed, are used to explain the volume of strategic information disclosed on the internet. Findings: The results indicate that Spanish companies, on average, give out little strategic information, mainly related to objectives, their mission, and the company's philosophy. "Company annual planning" and "Information on risks" are scarcely disclosed. The findings also emphasise that companies where the Chairperson of the Board is the same person as the CEO and, moreover, in which there is a lower frequency of meetings, disclose a greater amount of strategic information on their web sites. Practical implications: The findings suggest that the disclosure of strategic information is a decision taken by executives with the aim of satisfying the demands of creditors and investors. The Board of Directors represents the shareholders' interests, but it does not participate in strategic decision-making disclosure, maybe due to the fact that the proprietary costs lack influence. Originality/value: The link between corporate governance and strategic information disclosed online has scarcely been analysed in previous literature. This study provides interesting insights into how several Board characteristics can affect the disclosure of strategic information on the internet. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We employ agency theory to argue that the effects of family (and founder) ownership versus management will be quite different: the former is expected to contribute positively to performance, the latter is argued to erode performance. Previous studies, due to problems of multicollinearity have been unable to distinguish these effects. Using a Bayesian approach that avoids these problems, we find that whereas family and founder ownership are associated with superior performance, the results for family and even founder management are more ambiguous. Our study is the first to assess the distinctive performance effects of family and founder presence in both ownership and management using a Bayesian approach. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we examine whether the presence of a founder influences the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and company performance in a sample of European, publicly traded, family firms. Our findings contradict the widespread belief that smaller and more independent boards as well as nondual leadership structures always lead to better firm performance, suggesting that agency theory is limited in its explanation of the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. We find a positive effect of board size on business performance in nonfounder-led family firms and a negative effect of board size on founder-led family businesses. The presence of independent directors on the board has a positive effect on performance when a firm is run by its founder. However, when descendants lead the firm, the presence of independent directors has a negative effect on performance. Although the effect of board meetings on firm performance is positive, this relationship is weaker when the family business is run by its founder. Finally, CEO duality improves firm performance when descendants run the business, although CEO duality has no effect on performance when the firm is led by the founder. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Microbanks serve micro-enterprises and poor people with financial services. This study examines how various aspects of international influence affect microbanks' financial and social performance. Grounded in agency theory and resource-based theory, we argue that there are multiple ways that the internationalization of microbanks might affect performance. Specifically, we argue that one can distinguish between four sources of such internationalization effects; international initiator, international directorship, international debt, and international affiliation/networks. This study utilizes data from 379 microbanks in 73 developing countries - assessed between 2001 and 2008. We find that the internationalization of microbanks to a large extend enhances social performance, but does not enhance financial performance. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates (1) whether agency variables are associated with the relative size of the internal audit function (IAF); (2) whether the IAF is complementary to other monitoring mechanisms such as independent board members and an active audit committee; and (3) the impact of the control environment on the relative size of the IAF. We use data from a sample of Belgian firms. We find evidence of a monitoring role for the IAF in corporate governance. Specifically, the relative IAF size is positively related to management share ownership. Also, we find evidence for a substitution effect between independent board members and the IAF. Finally, it turns out that a supportive control environment also has a positive impact on the relative size of the IAF. Our results can benefit companies interested in assessing the current size of their IAF and the role that it can play in corporate governance. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: This paper aims to explore the complex relationships between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, pay satisfaction and job satisfaction at the retailer that uses a pay-for-performance plan for front-line employees. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on a single organization case study across seven stores, and uses a survey, archival documents, open-ended questions and researcher interaction with employees and managers. Findings: The results provide some support for the complementary nature of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation was positively associated with pay and job satisfactions, whereas extrinsic motivation was negatively associated with job satisfaction, and not associated with pay satisfaction. The qualitative insights indicate that pay fairness is important, and those who perceived pay was not fair generally made comparisons with others or felt that pay did not reflect their effort. It is also found that the majority of employees perceived that goals were clear. Research limitations/implications: The dominance of extrinsic motivation without including behavioural, social, and psychological factors in agency theory research is questioned. The research finds no support for "crowding out", but rather finds some evidence of "crowding in" where intrinsic motivation is enhanced, to the detriment of extrinsic motivation. Practical implications: The findings highlight that managers should enhance both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and pay employees well to increase job satisfaction. Originality/value: Few studies examine incentives for front-line employees, and there is evidence that minimum wage employees can have high intrinsic motivation. Perceptions of pay fairness can vary across motivation levels, age, and gender. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper focuses on the relationship between one of the main corporate governance dimensions - ownership structure - and income smoothing. The paper investigates whether family-controlled companies differ from non-family-controlled companies with respect to income smoothing. Due to different incentives of management and owner investment horizons, we hypothesize that income smoothing is less likely among family-controlled companies than among non-family-controlled companies. Additionally, we hypothesize that among family-controlled firms income smoothing is less likely when CEO and Board Chairman are members of the controlling family. Various definitions of "family control" are applied. A sample of Italian listed companies is used for the empirical analysis. Research Findings/Insights: We find evidence that income smoothing is less likely among family-controlled companies than non-family-controlled companies. Moreover, among family-controlled companies, income smoothing is less likely for firms whose CEO and Board Chairman are members of the controlling family. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper fills a gap in the literature, suggesting that not only the level of ownership concentration or insider ownership but also the nature of the dominant shareholder (family versus non-family) should be considered when addressing the motivations for income smoothing. Furthermore, our findings indicate that agency theory and stewardship theory are complementary in explaining the role played by family control in income smoothing decisions. While in non-family-controlled companies the traditional owner-manager agency problems tend to prevail and motivate income smoothing, in family-controlled companies such agency issues become less relevant and a stewardship attitude emerges, rendering income smoothing less likely. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study is of interest to financial statement users, including analysts and investors, as it shows that different company types (e.g., family versus non-family) have a different attitude towards income smoothing. In particular, these results aid users in interpreting the company's reported profitability and its potential variability. The conclusions also are of interest to auditors when evaluating the reliability of the reported income of companies characterized by various ownership structures. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Whether voluntary or mandatory in nature, most recent corporate governance codes of best practice assume that board structural independence, and the application by boards of outcome-based incentive plans, are important boundary conditions for the enforcement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) pay-for-firm-performance; that is, for optimal contracting between owners and executive agents. We test this logic on a large Australian sample using a system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach to dynamic panel data estimation. We find that Australian boards exhibiting best practice structural arrangements - those chaired by non-executives and dominated by non-executive directors at the full board and compensation committee levels - are no more adept at enforcing CEO pay-for-firm-performance than are executive-dominated boards. These findings suggest that policy makers' faith in incentive plans and the moderating influence of structural independence per se may be misplaced. Our findings also hold significant implications for corporate governance theory. Specifically, the findings lend further support to a contingency-based understanding of board composition, reward choice and monitoring; an approach integrating the insights afforded by behavioural approaches to Agency Theory and by social-cognitive and institutional understandings of director outlook, decision-making and behaviour.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Recent research from the United States has advocated increasing ownership concentration and aligning ownership and control to mitigate principal-agent conflicts for entrepreneurial firms. By contrast, this study aims to demonstrate that the major governance problem in an emerging economy is principal-principal conflicts, and that increasing ownership concentration and aligning ownership and control will instead reinforce such conflicts and IPO underpricing. Research Findings/Insights: Using data from 525 IPO firms in Taiwan, an emerging economy, this study finds that increasing family ownership and institutional ownership and introducing CEO duality increase IPO underpricing, while employing independent outside directors mitigates IPO underpricing. These results are consistent with our hypotheses concerning principal-principal conflicts. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results are quite different from those of prior research using US data, in that institutions are weaker in an emerging economy than in the United States, where principal-agent conflicts are the main concern. Consequently, corporate governance research, particularly when conducted outside the US, should consider institutional contexts, which agency theory fails to do. As such, institutional theory offers a promising approach. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Government policies designed to address principal-agent conflicts, such as increasing ownership concentration and aligning ownership and control, may make principal-principal conflicts worse and increase IPO underpricing in an emerging economy. To mitigate principal-principal conflicts and IPO underpricing, regulatory reforms need to reduce ownership concentration, separate ownership, and control, and strengthen formal institutions that help minority shareholders monitor firm decisions.

While the franchising literature has typically relied on agency theory, efficiency considerations may not fully explain decisions to expand through franchising or company ownership. In this study, I re-examine franchising decisions using insights from institutional theory. The key tenet of institutional theory is that decisions are influenced by isomorphic pressures arising from the environment. Economic rationales such as the achievement of efficiency are thought of as less pervasive concerns. I begin by investigating whether institutional theory explains variance in franchising decisions beyond what is explained by agency theory. Then, I explore the extent to which institutional considerations moderate the relationships between agency considerations and franchising decisions. Hypotheses are tested on a unique database of 132 French franchise chains. Empirical results suggest that successful competitors' use of franchising explains variance in the focal chain's use of franchising beyond what is explained by the importance of local managerial inputs and the threat of franchisee opportunism. In addition, the threat of franchise opportunism is less strongly related to the focal chain's use of franchising when successful competitors have a high proportion of franchised outlets. Overall, findings from this study suggest that researchers should supplement agency theory with institutional theory to adequately explain franchising decisions. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Using insights from the upper echelon perspective and agency theory, this paper examines the effects of TMT characteristics on internationalization and the moderating effect of independent directors on the TMT characteristics - internationalization relationship. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a panel of listed firms in Taiwan, this study finds positive associations of TMT tenure and international experience and a negative association of TMT age with internationalization, supporting the upper echelon perspective. There is also some support for agency theory. The findings suggest that the positive relationships of TMT tenure and international experience with internationalization are stronger as more independent directors are included on the board, supporting the view that independent directors as monitors and resource providers may offer better advice and counsel to executives and enhance their strategic action capabilities in moving toward internationalization. However, the support for agency theory is limited, as this study finds no evidence of a moderating effect of independent directors on the relationship between TMT age and internationalization. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study contributes to corporate governance knowledge by bridging the gap in the relationship between TMT characteristics and internationalization via an empirical inquiry into the influence of independent directors on the TMT. Specifically, it reinforces the important role of the TMT in the strategic decision to internationalize and highlights the significant influence of independent directors on the TMT characteristics - internationalization relationship, expanding our understanding of the important strategic role of boards involved in TMTs' strategic action in a contextually appropriate manner. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that the board of a firm realizing that internationalization is a necessary strategy may consider choosing executives who are younger and have a longer tenure and more international experience in order to develop and execute international operations effectively. To improve board effectiveness and the quality of corporate governance, this study also demonstrates that a firm should include more independent directors on the board.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of managerial ownership in relation to agency theory in the Malaysian business environment. In addition to examining the total managerial shareholdings, this study also investigates the association between direct and indirect managerial shareholdings with agency costs. Design/methodology/approach: The data for the study is obtained from two sources, namely primary (questionnaire) and secondary (annual reports) data. The sample companies are 235 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ended 2006. Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the relationship between the variables. Findings: The results of the study indicate that managerial ownership in various segments has an inverse relationship with total monitoring costs as predicted in agency theory. This finding is consistent with earlier studies in western countries and supports the convergence of interest hypothesis. Originality/value: This study gives a unique contribution to corporate governance studies relating to the effect of ownership structure in relation to agency theory in Malaysian companies, one of the countries in Asia. Previous studies claimed that it is unknown whether the agency theory findings in western countries have equal impact in Asian organizations. Previous literature also indicates that there is a possibility that given the cultural differences, the typical nature of agents in agency theory may not be the case with regard to non-western countries. Thus, this study provides evidence that support prior research findings in western countries relating to the effect of managerial ownership on the agency relationship which is reflected in its agency costs.

Much has been discussed in various disciplines about the determinants of executive compensation. The importance of these scholarly inquiries has been underscored by the recent condemnation of high executive remuneration levels in the face of corporate failures and financial declines. Most researchers confine their analyses to single equation models that test various determinants and different measures of compensation. In this paper, we expand this approach to a multi-equation model that examines the determinants of executive compensation within a broader framework. Our specification explicitly allows for the endogeneity of executive compensation, firm financial performance, and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Chief among our findings is that this endogeneity assumption is supported, which means that financial performance and social performance are determined simultaneously. We further show that CSR is among the determinants of CEO pay, which indicates that pay-for-performance does not sufficiently explain compensation.

This study uses organizational theory to explore why nonprofit organizations conduct evaluations and how they use evaluation information. According to rational choice theory, managers of nonprofit organizations will conduct evaluations to make sure they are making good decisions about how to improve their services and achieve their goals. Yet, according to data gathered about the experiences of 31 nonprofit organizations, this assumption about the evaluation practices of nonprofits rarely holds true. Rather, other organizational theories, such as agency theory, institutional theory, resource dependence theory, and stewardship theory, which make different assumptions about how organizations operate and how managers behave, provide a more accurate description of why nonprofits engage in evaluation and how they use evaluation information. The findings from this study are important because they help to identify strategies that would encourage nonprofit organizations to use evaluation in more productive and meaningful ways.

This purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of board and audit committee meeting frequency. The determinants studied are related to the ownership structure and to the board characteristics. The study is conducted in an agency setting featured by high ownership concentration and large insider shareholders. Hypotheses are developed based on agency theory. The empirical evidence is provided by a sample of Italian listed companies. Negative binomial regression is used in the multivariate analysis to test the relationships. Robustness checks provide further empirical support. The paper finds that insider ownership negatively impacts -- either on the board or on the audit committee meeting frequency -- whilst the proportion of independent directors in the board has a positive impact. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that insider ownership and board independent monitoring are substitute control mechanisms. The findings also show that audit committees are more active in larger firms. The paper provides an agency theory-based explanation of the board and the audit committee meeting frequency, in a setting featured by large controlling shareholders.

Agency theory stipulates that executives will use their superior information to exploit owners unless effectively monitored or incentivized to do otherwise: Agents here are held to be opportunists and owners responsible parties. However, sometimes agency theory misses the mark and the reverse holds true. It may be the owners who exploit their firm and compromise its long-term interests, and steward-like agents who use their superior information to benefit a firm and its stakeholders. This analysis provides an inspiring historical example of how that can happen and illustrates some conditions under which one might expect similarly happy circumstances to arise.

The influences of profitability and leverage on firm value have long been critical with regard to financial decision making. The greater the profitability of a firm, the more assignable profit there is, and the higher is the value of the company. Profitability thus has a significantly positive influence on firm value. The pecking order theory holds that highly profitable corporations are not over-dependent on external funds, and thus profitability has a significantly negative influence on leverage. However, when the leverage increases, both agency and bankruptcy costs increase rapidly as a result. Since leverage generally has a markedly negative influence on firm value, leverage becomes the mediator variable in the influence of profitability on firm value. In addition, two moderator variables exist in the research ? industry type and firm size. It is noted that when industry type the acts as a moderator variable, it interferes with the relationship between profitability and leverage. When firm size is the moderator variable, it also interfere the relationship between profitability and leverage. The moderating effect happens in the first stage. (c) Li-Ju Chen, Shun-Yu Chen, 2011.

We investigate the impact of board independence on earnings management on a sample of family controlled firms listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Using panel data over the period 2000-2004, we find evidence of earnings management among family controlled firms in Australia, an environment of high investor protection and private benefits of control. Findings show that a higher proportion of independent directors on boards is effective in reducing earnings management, thereby mitigating agency problems associated with entrenchment and expropriation in family firms. We also find that managers of family firms are less aggressive in managing earnings via discretionary long-term accruals compared to non-family firms. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

For decades, managers' powers and their freedom to make strategic decisions were taken for granted in the field of corporate governance. The present crisis has revealed that their managerial latitude is in reality much weaker than thought. The growing influence of shareholders has undermined the historical and professional legitimacy of managers, who are now viewed as 'agents' controlled by 'principals'. This paper makes two contributions. First, we hold that the crisis is not a purely economic or financial crisis but a fundamental crisis of management, with its function of regulating the relationship between the firm and society. Second, we show that this crisis is rooted in law, since corporate law does not actually protect the autonomy of management. Until now, management theory has underestimated the role of law in the evolutions of corporate governance; we argue that management research needs to open its boundaries and specifically to re-examine corporate law. We suggest new governance rules to ensure managers have the latitude to organize collective creation processes in a way that is both efficient and legitimate. And we discuss some avenues for reflecting on a post-crisis business law. (c) 2011 The Author(s). British Journal of Management (c) 2011 British Academy of Management.

Offshore outsourcing of administrative and technical services has become a mainstream business practice. Increasing commoditization of business services and growing client experience with outsourcing have created a range of competitive service delivery options for client firms. Yet, data from the Offshoring Research Network (ORN) suggests that, despite increasing market options and growing client expectations related to service quality and cost efficiency, clients typically renew provider contracts and develop longer-term relationships with providers. Based on ORN data, this paper explores drivers of this phenomenon. The findings suggest that providers promote contract renewal by making client specific investments in software, IT infrastructure and training, and by involving clients in outsourcing operations, thereby increasing relation specific joint equity and creating opportunities for client monitoring and control. Interestingly, these strategies apply to routine rather than knowledge-intensive tasks, and are more likely to be applied by large rather than small providers. Surprisingly, high degree of contract specification makes contract renewal less likely. The paper contributes to the growing literature on strategic outsourcing of business services and the importance of governance mechanisms addressing "hidden costs" as well as "hidden benefits" of offshore outsourcing relationships.

In developed markets including the United States, family-controlled firms, in particular founder-controlled firms, have been associated with higher firm performance than their nonfamily counterparts. Such family-controlled firms have concentrated ownership, which, according to agency theory, reduces agency costs and leads to superior firm value. Extant research, however, is not clear whether it is the family control or concentrated ownership that bestows the advantages that lead to enhanced firm performance. By examining different types of concentrated ownership, this study evaluates whether family ownership adds value beyond that provided by concentrated ownership. Based on analyses of panel data from the Indian corporate sector, we find that, in general, firms with concentrated ownership outperform firms with dispersed ownership. Surprisingly, and more importantly, however, we find there are no significant performance differences among family-controlled firms and firms controlled by either foreign corporations or the state. This result is consistent with the notion that concentrated ownership, not family control, is a key determinant of firm performance. (c) 2011 Strategic Management Society.

In this work, the author analyzes agency costs and their effect on efficiency in the context of small family firms. In particular, the author examines the effect that factors such as self-management, having related managers, and family employees exert on firm efficiency. The author offers some reasoning that may help to clarify agency problems for small firms. The author uses stochastic frontiers to measure and explain efficiency. The author's focus is on small firms in the fishing sector, which are very important entities for the development of certain local communities. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

Our analysis of more than 1,000 Chinese listed firms, 2003-2005, reveals a positive association between state ownership (SO) and firm performance. Arguably, if SO "causes" performance, it must be through the channel of agency cost. Therefore, our paper checks the robustness of this positive SO/performance finding by analyzing the role of agency cost as a mediator. It emerges that SO in the Chinese context may represent a strategic asset rather than an agency burden. However, it is not clear whether this is an outcome driven by efficiency or power.

In the slipstream of several large-scale corporate scandals, the board of directors has gained a pivotal position in the corporate governance debate. However, due to an overreliance on particular methodological (i. e. input-output studies) and theoretical (i. e. agency theory) research fortresses in past board research, academic knowledge concerning how this important governance mechanism actually operates and functions remains relatively limited. This theoretical paper aims to contribute to the promising stream of research which focuses on behavioural perspectives and processes within the corporate board, by delving into one of the research areas perhaps plagued most by these predominant approaches: board leadership. In adopting a team perspective on the board of directors our study goes beyond traditional board leadership research, which has turned a blind eye on actual leadership dynamics, by examining leadership processes and behaviours inside the board team. Specifically, we develop a conceptual framework addressing a novel and ethical approach to team leadership within the board, i. e. shared leadership, which has previously been demonstrated to result in performance benefits in various other team settings.

The aim of this study is to understand the ability of stewardship theory, as compared with agency theory, to explain motivation of the staff in a Not-for-Profit (NFP) organisation. Agency theory is seen as providing an explanation of motivation in the business sector however we argue that the different cultural and organisational conditions weaken the explanatory power of agency theory in the NFP sector. In pursuing this investigation, we were mindful of Brinberg's (2009) encouragement for a more outward-looking approach to management accounting issues and in particular his call for the use qualitative research methods and to allow practice to inform theory.Interviews were conducted with staff of a NFP organisation to gauge the impact of the introduction of a bonus scheme. The interviews sought to provide answers to three questions: what is the main source of motivation in the organisation? Were tensions created in the organisation by the introduction of the bonus scheme? Was there a change in the culture of the organisation, comprising camaraderie between staff, having fun at work, trust between management and staff, and an attitude of service to clients? Practical implications: This finding has important implications for the management of NFPs. To maintain and improve motivation, management needs to look to the goals, or mission, of the organisation - in particular, to see that the goals include care of and service to clients. Originality/value: The originality and value of this paper stems from the fact that the data was gather in a NFP organisation that had introduced an extrinsic reward scheme. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the influence of firm-level corporate governance on the capital structure pattern of non-financial listed firms, using a case study of Bangladesh. The agency theory suggests that better corporate governance will reduce agency costs and improve investor confidence, which in turn will enhance the ability of a firm to gain access to equity finance, reducing dependence on debt finance. Conversely, the controlling shareholders of poorly governed firms are likely to prefer debt, in order to retain absolute ownership and control rights. The OLS regression framework uses a questionnaire-survey based Corporate Governance Index (CGI). The study results seem to support agency theory, with a statistically significant inverse relationship between corporate governance quality and the total as well as long-term debt ratios.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Prior evidence suggests that investor protection enhances corporate valuation. Focusing on a key investor protection measure, namely, self-dealing regulations, this study examines whether and to what extent the private and public control components of that measure affect firm value. Private control of self-dealing regulations emphasize disclosure and shareholder approval mechanisms, while public control of self-dealing regulations imply enforcement through prison terms, fines, etc. Our analysis takes into account potential agency problems resulting from an ownership wedge, i.e., situations in which cash flow rights are not consistent with control rights. Such situations are quite common in many countries outside of the United States. Research Findings/Results: Based on 4,634 firms from 22 countries, our empirical evidence indicates that private control of self-dealing regulations enhances firm value, while public control regulations lower firm value. In addition, a high ownership wedge, which proxies for agency problems between controlling shareholders and minority investors, dampens the positive association between private control of self-dealing regulations and corporate valuation. However, ownership wedge has no impact on the negative association between public control of self-dealing regulations and corporate valuation. Theoretical Implications: This study represents a refinement and extension of prior work on the value implication from investor protection regulations. It seeks to better define the implications of investor protection regulations by focusing on some of its key components, thus leading to a better understanding of the relations between investor protection regulations, ownership, and firm value. Moreover, the study contributes to the current debate about the importance of country-level institutions (versus firm-level governance as proxied by ownership wedge) in determining firm outcomes such as value. Practitioner Implications: The paper's empirical findings may help policy markers better understand how investors react to regulations about private and public control of self-dealing, thus enhancing their capability to enact more effective regulations.

Purpose: This paper aims to empirically examine the financing of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) through a financial growth lifecycle model. Design/methodology/approach: Data in publicly available databases are generally unsuitable to examine the financial lifecycle model, thus a questionnaire survey was employed to collect data. Because of the well-documented reticence of SME owners to reveal detailed financial information, data were requested in percentage form. This innovative methodology was successful, as 92 per cent of respondents disclosed detailed financing data. A response rate of 42.6 per cent across six industry sectors provided data to employ parametric techniques. Reporting and analysing the large primary data set across six age categories, a number of statistical tests were conducted to test the financial growth lifecycle model. Findings: Analysis of respondents' capital structures across age groups indicates distinct changes in sources of finance employed by firms over time. Financing choices are consistent with Myers's pecking-order hypothesis, and the importance of profitability in financing SMEs is emphasised. Contrary to conventional wisdom, respondents in the youngest age category report a relatively high use of debt financing. This is explained by the provision of firm owners' personal assets to secure firm debt. Originality/value: The key contribution of this paper is to provide an empirical examination of the financial growth lifecycle model by combining a number of statistical tests. This approach is significantly different to that traditionally adopted in empirical investigations of SME financing, which is to examine the applicability of theories developed in corporate finance on panel data. Additionally, the paper presents data on personal sources of finance employed by firm owners, which is typically not available, even in comprehensive secondary databases.

This paper examines the impact on underpricing and firm market value arising from IPO firms implementing a range of governance attributes such as the separation of CEO and Chairman roles, the founder ceding CEO position, establishment of committees and board size. Furthermore I study the determinants of director retained ownership and the relation between this and underpricing. Using a comprehensive sample of 37 locally listed IPO firm's from across West Africa I find evidence of a mixed impact from the adoption of universally recognised governance mechanisms. Higher levels of retained director ownership increase underpricing in contrast to that of founders. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

How can the internal governance of civil society organizations be conceptualized more adequately by accounting for the dual and simultaneous requirements of controlling and coaching in board behavior? Empirically, we seem to agree that effective governance of a civil society organization is crucial to its sustained viability. Conceptually, however, we observe a lack of consensus on how to best understand CSO governance. By critically juxtaposing two major theoretical lenses to conceptualize governance, namely, agency and stewardship theory, we identify a number of challenges when dealing with board-management relations that deserve our attention. While agency theory privileges controlling behavior, stewardship theory emphasizes the coaching behavior of boards. The purpose of this article is to offer a concept of governance that is informed by a paradox perspective advancing a subtler, more adequate conceptualization of board governance that accounts for these often conflicting demands on CSO governance. Drawing on illustrations from a longitudinal interpretive case study, we exemplify our propositions empirically. The article concludes with discussing the implications of our argument for CSO governance research and practice.

We revisit the relationship between attendance and performance in the undergraduate university setting and apply agency theory in the instructor-student context. Building on agency theory propositions in the educational setting advanced by Smith, Zsidisin, and Adams (2005), we propose that the student and instructor must align goals to promote the student's achievement of performance learning outcomes, and attendance functions as a behavior-based alignment mechanism to encourage the convergence of faculty and student interests. Further, we propose that attendance does not equally affect lower- and higher-performing students and that absences are also negatively related to students' cumulative grade point average. We test these hypotheses with data from undergraduates enrolled in management courses at a state university in the southeast. Our results show that attendance is positively related to exam performance, there are more pronounced negative effects of an absence for lower-performing students than for higher performers, and absences are negatively related to a student's cumulative grade point average. We discuss the implications of our findings for students, instructors, and universities as well as practice in teaching and learning.

This work shows how tenets of agency theory can be linked with institutional analysis to improve their explanatory power in the context of an emerging country such as Brazil. This study assessed the authors' propositions in a single-case analysis of a Brazilian multiple family firm. The results show that in the initial phase, characterized by less severe agency problems, the firm's competitive advantage matured, supported by the strong presence of trust derived from an extended family structure. As the company grew in complexity, the informal monitoring mechanisms that characterize collectivist societies allowed agency problems to escalate. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study examines the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries maintain active boards of directors. Active boards are in this study defined as boards that perform tasks beyond fulfilling local legal requirements. We focus on both monitoring and service roles. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a sample of 83 foreign subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is a world mandate subsidiary, which has worldwide responsibility for a product line and performs a broad scope of value-added activities. Moreover, a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is larger relative to the multinational enterprise (MNE), if it has a higher level of local responsiveness, and if its past performance is poorer. Additionally, the presence of an active board in a foreign subsidiary is related to other control mechanisms deployed in the subsidiary. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results highlight the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries are likely to maintain active boards. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that agency theory and resource dependence theory are relevant and complementary in the analysis of active boards in foreign subsidiaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that an active board may be a control mechanism to govern foreign subsidiaries and an instrument to deal with the external environment. Corporate governance regulators may consider developing governance recommendations that emphasize the importance of subsidiary boards in the oversight of foreign subsidiaries.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: Previous studies have reported the relationship between corporate governance and corporate liquidity (cash holdings). Factors affecting corporate governance, such as securities laws and control of corruption, should have bearing on corporate liquidity and its value. This study focuses on national-level predictors of cash holdings such as securities laws and control of corruption and examines their impact on corporate liquidity, as well as its value from the agency perspective.Research Findings/Insights: Using comprehensive data on 47 countries from 1996-2007, this study demonstrates that when benchmark variables are controlled, corporate liquidity is lower in countries with more effective securities laws or higher control of corruption. In addition, cash can increase firm value. This positive relation is more pronounced in countries with effective securities laws or high control of corruption. Furthermore, excess cash can reduce firm value in countries with ineffective securities laws or low control of corruption as opposed to other countries; however, this value-reducing effect can be mitigated or reversed when control of corruption or securities laws improve.Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study establishes that securities laws and control of corruption, in addition to the traditional cash determinants, play important roles in determining corporate liquidity and its value, and should therefore not be ignored in future liquidity studies. In addition, securities laws and control of corruption reinforce each other in the reduction of internal agency problems. Furthermore, this study provides empirical support for agency theory to explain corporate cash holdings.Practitioner/Policy Implications: Multinational firms should consider the potential impact of different securities laws and control of corruption of foreign countries in deciding the amount of cash to hold. Results suggest that firms should decrease target cash level in countries with more effective securities laws or higher control of corruption because investor protection is stronger, and the agency problem is less severe. In addition, excess cash should not be held in countries with ineffective securities laws or low control of corruption because these circumstances can reduce firm value, unless these countries substantially improve their control of corruption or securities laws. As for policy makers, caution has to be exercised when improving securities laws or repressing corruption; the concurrent improvement of both is more effective for stronger investor protection and better corporate governance.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of independent directors and ownership structure on voluntary disclosures of Vietnamese listed firms. Design/methodology/approach Year-ending 2008 annual report disclosures of 45 Vietnamese listed firms are analyzed. Voluntary disclosure is measured using a Vietnamese Disclosure Index adapted from prior literature. Descriptive and inferential statistics (ITT/IT-test, analysis of variance, multiple regressions (ordinary least squares)) are employed to generate empirical insights. Findings The results indicate that the level of voluntary disclosure among Vietnamese listed firms is relatively low (24.23 per cent). There are higher levels of disclosure relating to director and senior management details but far lower in regards to social issues. State ownership and managerial ownership are negatively and positively related to the extent of voluntary disclosure respectively. Moreover, bigger firms are found to be positively associated with voluntary disclosure. Research limitations/ implications The results of this study are limited to one year 2008 and thus, could be biased as disclosures can change over time. Practical implications Vietnamese regulators should focus on strengthening the regulations governing the level of corporate communication in firms with high state ownership as well as encouraging more disclosure of non-financial information to strengthen its market information transparency. Originality/value This study is one of the first examining the level of corporate voluntary disclosure practices among Vietnamese listed firms. Evidence from this study extends the existing voluntary disclosure literature on emerging economies whilst providing valuable insights to Vietnamese policy makers in the process of developing and improving its financial reporting regulatory framework.

This paper examines the performance effects of family ownership and influence on board structure and its composition in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO) in the North African region. Using a unique and comprehensive hand-collected sample of 63 locally listed IPO firm's from across North Africa we find considerable evidence of a sizeable differential between family and non-family controlled firms. I find considerable evidence supporting increased participation of family members at board level while contrastingly the wider dispersion of family ownership facilitates monitoring and surveillance and mitigates underpricing. Equally in line with the extended network and relationships involved in family firms business angels provide the optimal form of governance in contrast to the more formal private equity and venture capital industry.

Although discretion among employees at organizations' lower levels seems to be increasing, it is uncertain whether this is a desirable HRM policy. To understand this issue better, this study tests competing organization theory predictions about the performance consequences of middle managers' perceived discretion. Discretion is defined as the freedom of action or decision authority available in managing subordinates. Survey data from a multinational, European sample of research and development (R&D) units were used to assess the effect of managers' perceived discretion on unit performance. The results show that a combination of ecology theory and strategic choice theory best predicts the relationship between discretion and unit performance. Greater perceived managerial discretion was linked to increased unit performance in a relationship moderated by managerial experience and limited by unit size. These findings have implications for HRM theory and practice, particularly regarding policies related to empowerment and leadership development. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Hedge funds tend to be highly activist investors who exercise their "principal power" over their portfolio firms. We observe that, compared to other investor types, hedge funds appear to be even more activist than is predicted by a comprehensive Investor Activism Model, due to the unexpectedly large role of several antecedent variables. This conclusion suggests that the relatively lightly regulated environment of hedge funds affects the weighting of conventional activism-antecedent variables. We explore how their access to several investing and trading strategies is allowing hedge funds to redefine investor activism. In the process, we find that, while hedge funds and their activism tend to benefit fellow investors, the potential exists for some specific hedge fund types to expropriate value from minority shareholders, creating "principal-principal" conflict. The potentially detrimental impact of hedge fund activism on other equity investors is demonstrated, illuminating several current policy concerns. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine the governance role of private equity (PE) firms in post-LBO companies in the US. We propose and test whether PE firms remove entrenched CEOs or CEOs who cause agency problems. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a sample of 126 PE sponsored LBOs in the USA between 1990 and 2006, we document a CEO turnover rate of 51 per cent within two years of an LBO announcement. We find that the boards of directors replace CEOs in companies with high agency costs, as measured by low leverage and a high level of undistributed free cash flow. In addition, unlike the boards of directors in public companies, the boards in post-LBO companies tend to replace entrenched CEOs. Finally, the boards are more likely to replace CEOs if pre-LBO return on assets is low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: According to the agency theory, a PE-sponsored LBO is a new organizational form that reduces agency costs by enhancing corporate governance. This study uses CEO turnover as a setting to test that prediction. We find that PE firms replace CEOs who can cause agency problems, thus providing empirical support for the proposition that PE firms improve corporate governance in LBO companies. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers who are interested in regulating PE firms. Our results suggest that, in the US, PE firms provide effective corporate governance mechanisms by replacing incompetent and entrenched CEOs. In addition, our results provide a set of factors for PE firms to consider when they make CEO retention decisions. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The study investigates the under-researched relationship between capital structure and dividend policy in emerging markets with regard to the Jordanian market. The empirical analysis focuses on the estimation of both single equation models and structure equation models using the reduced form equations to examine the joint determinants of capital structure and dividend policy. The study investigates whether capital structure and dividend policy theories can explain the financial decisions in emerging market such as the Jordanian market. Namely, the study examines agency theory, signalling theory, pecking order theory and bankruptcy theory. The results indicate that there is a positive relationship between debt-toasset ratio on the one hand, and asset tangibility, profitability, market-to-book, liquidity, firm size, and industry classification on the other hand. Also, there is a negative relationship between debt-to-asset ratio and profitability. In addition, there is a positive relationship between dividend payout ratio on the one hand, and profitability, asset tangibility, market-to-book and industry classification on the other hand. Finally, the results of the reduced form equations show that capital structure and dividend policy have the following common factors: profitability; asset tangibility; market-to-book; industry classification; and limited evidence of institutional ownership. Therefore, the determinants of capital structure and dividend policy in emerging markets such as the Jordanian market share the same set of suggested factors with the developed markets.

Purpose: The growing prominence of knowledge workers in contemporary organisations has led to a considerable amount of research into their role and activities, however, despite this growing interest, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the relationship of knowledge workers to management. This paper aims to respond by investigating the features of knowledge work that impose barriers to traditional managerial control methods and exploring the extent to which alternative approaches to influence are available to knowledge work managers, and the circumstances under which these different approaches are indicated. Design/methodology/approach: The paper utilised agency theory to investigate the implications of knowledge asymmetry in principal-knowledge worker exchanges, and argues against the utility of models of control based on principles of scientific management on which agency models are typically based, towards models of control based on reciprocity and commitment. Findings: The paper has two main outputs. First, it argues that situations in which knowledge-based specialists are hired to perform tasks requiring expertise can be viewed as principal-agent exchanges (Mills) and are therefore open to analysis through an agency theory lens. The second endeavour is to discuss the implications of knowledge asymmetry in principal-knowledge worker relationships for managerial control and influence, and posit alternative modes of managerial control based on normative influence and valiant rewards. Further, it develops propositions relating to the factors likely to moderate the utility of each managerial influence strategy. Originality/value: By undertaking this investigation, the paper responds to calls by Frenkel et al. to understand process and dynamics of control in managing knowledge workers. It moves away from models of control based on principles of scientific management on which agency models are typically based, towards models of control based on reciprocity and commitment. It develops testable propositions regarding specific sources of influence in knowledge work and the circumstances under which the employment of these influence strategies is indicated. This responds to calls by authors such as Tampoe; and Lord to develop a detailed understanding of the manner and extent to which influence strategies need to complement specific knowledge worker characteristics.

This paper examines the interrelations among ownership, board and manager characteristics and firm performance in a sample of 54 firms listed at the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE). These governance characteristics, designed to minimize agency problems between principals and agents are operationalized in terms of ownership concentration, ownership identity, board effectiveness and managerial discretion. The typical ownership identities at the NSE are government, foreign, institutional, manager and diverse ownership forms. Firm performance is measured using Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Dividend Yield (DY). Using PPMC, Logistic Regression and Stepwise Regression, the paper presents evidence of significant positive relationship between foreign, insider, institutional and diverse ownership forms, and firm performance. However, the relationship between ownership concentration and government, and firm performance was significantly negative. The role of boards was found to be of very little value, mainly due to lack of adherence to board member selection criteria. The results also show significant positive relationship between managerial discretion and performance. Collectively, these results are consistent with pertinent literature with regard to the implications of government, foreign, manager (insider) and institutional ownership forms, but significantly differ concerning the effects of ownership concentration and diverse ownership on firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: This paper seeks to complement agency and stewardship perspectives regarding the governance of top managers by using insights from social categorization theory. Research Findings/Insights: This paper looks inside the black box of the control-performance relationship. We acknowledge that boards can positively influence organizational functioning by monitoring the top management team. However, we also argue that board control contains a hidden cost. The model we develop describes how control can highlight the distinction between principals and agents thereby causing the top management team to adopt a biased and less cooperative "us vs. them" orientation towards owners and their representatives. We contend this results in an increase in negative discretionary behavior and a decrease in positive discretionary behavior, which dampen the positive influence of control on firm performance. We also describe techniques for mitigating this unintended outcome of control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Agency and stewardship theories offer alternative views of human nature and provide divergent prescriptions for governance. This paper presents social categorization theory as a complementary lens emphasizing a situational and social view of human nature that helps explain top managers' discretionary behaviors that influence firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Ongoing governance scandals are costly illustrations of unchecked managerial opportunism. They demonstrate the need for vigilant control. A control approach to governance, however, does not consistently improve firm performance. This paper offers an explanation. It acknowledges that board control is necessary, while arguing that it can have unwanted side effects. We describe two tools (individualization and social recategorization) that can be used to ameliorate these effects. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the domain of security analysts' earnings forecasts as a valid measure of firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: A survey instrument was developed and sent to 1,350 security analysts to ascertain the criteria they used in evaluating firm performance. Findings: Factor analysis indicates strong support for organizational level variables, such as top management, CEO ability, corporate culture, size as opposed to environment and industry level variables. Research limitations/implications: The domain of security analysts' earnings forecasts is broader than traditional accounting- and market-based measures and more closely matches the realm of the strategic management field. Practical implications: The study presents new evidence that key organizational variables influence security analysts' earnings forecasts. Originality/value: The present study is the first to the best of one's knowledge that ascertains the factors that security analysts utilize in making earnings forecasts for the firms they follow.

Agency theory provides a valuable lens for understanding the role and importance of many varied governance mechanisms. We argue that transaction cost economics (TCE) provides a complementary theoretical lens for studying corporate governance because it illuminates the various contingencies that moderate the importance of alternative governance mechanisms. Using agency theory, we argue and find evidence that the confluence of advancing CEO age and large CEO stock holdings will cause the CEO to become overly risk-averse. Moreover, we use TCE to more fully explicate the ensuing performance consequences as well as the contextual factors that critically moderate this relationship. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: During the last decade, there has been an increasing focus on commercialization of knowledge and technology from universities. However, universities report financing as being the main impediment to successful university spin-off companies (USOs) creation, leaving valuable inventions un-commercialized. The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual model in order to explain financing challenges experienced by USOs. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a conceptual model illustrating financing challenges met by USOs, and provides an explanation why TTOs report that obtaining financing is their biggest impediment to spin-off creation. Two different theoretical perspectives back this conceptual development: Knightian uncertainty and agency theory. Findings: This theoretical examination suggests that increasing levels of uncertainty affect the investor's willingness to fund new companies in a negative way. Through the literature review, clear indications were also found for the increased uncertainty with which USOs are faced. It is therefore natural to conclude that investors are more reluctant to invest in USOs because of the level of uncertainty compared with other entrepreneurial companies. Research limitations/implications: This study made a generalization of USOs as a homogeneous group of companies, which is an oversimplification. Further research should address how different business models, types of resources and their institutional link affect USOs' capital requirements and their problems in raising the required capital. Originality/value: The main contribution from this paper is the combination of theoretical insights from the concepts of Knightian uncertainty and agency theory. These combined with insights from previous empirical studies explain why USOs face specific challenges in order to raise risk capital. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are rapidly becoming the foundations to the decision support systems of many organizations, but have all too often failed to deliver their expected benefits. Most ERP implementation projects are carried out using implementation consultants hired from outside the client firm. The current study treated the consultants as agents and the clients as principals, and applied agency theory to test the consultant- client relationship as a predictor of ERP implementation project success. A survey collected responses from 192 client project managers who worked on the ERP implementation process in their organizations. Data analysis via structural equation modeling showed that more consultant monitoring predicts less moral hazard (i.e., consultant shirking), that less moral hazard predicts greater ERP project success, and that more monitoring directly predicts such success. However, the analysis failed to support expectations that more pre-qualification efforts (i.e., screening of the consultant) would lead to less adverse selection (i.e., the consultant's misrepresentation of skills) or that less adverse selection would lead to greater ERP success. Surprisingly greater incentive alignment predicted greater moral hazard, thus suggesting the potential of incentives to de-motivate rather than motivate. This study contributed by extending agency theory to outsourced information systems project implementation. It provided new, validated measures of prequalification efforts, monitoring, incentive alignment, moral hazard, and adverse selection constructs. The findings suggest that future researchers may want to learn more about incentive alignment and its impact, and that information systems project managers may want to monitor more to improve ERP and other large-scale system implementation success.

Franchisors monitor their franchisees to ensure that the latters' performance is consistent with the franchise agreement. Though agency theory suggests that monitoring and subsequent corrective action lead to improved performance and reduced opportunism, the psychology literature argues that, in certain circumstances, monitoring can "crowd out" the very behavior it was designed to eliminate (i.e., opportunistic behavior). Our results show that the extent and ease of monitoring reduce the crowding out effects of monitoring, whereas monitoring enforcement heightens these effects. Our findings also show that the exchange norm of relational solidarity fully mediates these effects. (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper proposes a principal-agent model of labour market discrimination. In this model, the firm manager is a taste-based discriminator and has to make unobservable hiring decisions that determine the shareholder's profits, because workers differ in skill. The model shows that performance-based contracts may moderate the manager's propensity to discriminate, but that they are unlikely to fully eliminate discrimination. Moreover, the model predicts that sectors with high skill leverages discriminate less. Finally, the impacts of a wage gap between groups and of a diversity premium are investigated.

The relationship between board leadership, firm financial performance and agency costs is examined on behalf of a sample of multinational company subsidiaries (MNCs) and local public companies (LPCs) in Sri Lanka. Five years of data for 86 MNC subsidiaries and 113 LPCs, are collected and observations are analysed using a dynamic panel GMM estimation. This study provides empirical support for stewardship theory and contingency theory when firms are multinational subsidiaries. Moreover, findings support agency theory when firms are local public companies. Finally, this study indicates that there is no optimal board leadership structure. Hence, when companies commence their exploration of corporate governance practices, firms need to recognised that firm characteristics and contingency perspective boost the impact of board leadership structure on corporate financial performance.

The non-profit sector of the US economy is a special class of entities with an expansive array of organizations and activities dedicated to the common good and well-being of others. Even though this sector has constructed creative and forward thinking initiatives, obstacles remain which interfere with the accomplishment of significant achievements. In order to stay competitive, non-profit organizations are constantly assessing their current capacity to deliver unique needed services. Today, many umbrella associations of non-profits have implemented accreditation and certification programs intended to improve organizational contribution to member organizations. Throughout the sector, non-profit organizations are now seeking to become more ethical, accountable and credible in the eyes of stakeholders. Guided by institutional and agency theories, the research reported herein is designed to offer preliminary insights regarding the organizational and economic implications of pursuing accreditation. Technological enhancements in this context are also examined. (c) 2011 Eastern Academy of Management All rights reserved.

This paper reports the interview findings of a study designed to appraise differential agency challenges arising between unit owners and resident managers in three distinct types of strata titled tourism accommodation (STTA) operation. The three distinct contexts of STTA management delivery investigated are: 1) management service provision by small independent owner-operators in a single STTA apartment complex, 2) management service provision in strata titled hotels, and 3) management service provision by organizations that manage multiple STTA apartment complexes. Using the four dimensional agency theoretical framework developed by Lambert (2001), it has been found that the potential for agency challenges appear to be greatest in the context of an STTA complex managed by a small independent owner-operator.

Manuscript Type: Perspective Research Question/Issue: The evolution of corporate governance thinking and its implications for theory building. The 19th century concept of the corporation still underpins corporate governance practice today: If the company was re-invented to meet contemporary circumstances, what might it look like today? Research Findings/Insights: The original corporate concept was superbly simple and brilliantly successful. Subsequently, the growing diversity of corporate objectives, confused ownership structures, and complex corporate groups, has led to abuse. Society has lost the control which it originally demanded for the right to incorporate companies in which shareholders' had no liability for corporate debts beyond their equity stake. Faced with government bail-outs of failing companies, allegedly excessive executive remuneration, and a growing concern for corporate social responsibility and sustainability, the time has come to re-think the rationale, the purpose, and the governance of the joint-stock, limited-liability company. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper has been written in response to the editor's initiative to seek contributions that might provide alternative theoretical insights into corporate governance issues. By taking a historical, evolutionary perspective, this paper looks at corporate governance through a different lens than those of agency theory, stewardship theory, or the growing philosophical interest in corporate social responsibility. The primary theoretical call is for a taxonomy of corporate entities that differentiates them according to the way that power is exercised over them. The paper also highlights three unresolved paradoxes in corporate governance orthodoxy - governance by principles or rules, independent directors' ignorance of the business, and the unitary board's dual responsibility for both performance and conformance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The paper offers an alternative paradigm for the governance of corporate entities introducing the concepts of the governing body, executive management, and the sakeholder liaison groups. It is also suggested that external auditors should report to regulators, not directors. The underlying argument is that limited liability is a privilege granted by society, not a right. What society grants, society can take away if it is not satisfied with the way companies are managed or governed. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

We examined CEO attributes, board composition, and ownership structure for their relationship to the share performance of the acquiring company around the acquisition announcement. Based on 273 acquisitions by Canadian firms from 1998 through 2002, we have shown that the levels of CEO and director ownership as well as the level of board independence were positively associated with the short-term financial performance of the acquirer. Board size was negatively related to value creation. Finally, cash-based deals and cross-border transactions were also positively related to increases in shareholder wealth for the acquirer.

This study evaluates the impact of managerial ownership on the firm's performance and financial policies in the context of Pakistani market for sixty non-financial firms included in KSE 100 index for the period of 2000 to 2007. The analysis support that the concentration of managerial ownership affects the firms financial policies, mainly the leverage and dividend policies. The empirical analysis find out that leverage policy variable influenced managerial ownership negatively, supporting that the lower leverage level leads to high profitability firms engage in low managers' ownership program. The result also determines a negative and significant association among the mangers ownership concentration and dividend policy of the firms. This result is supported by the agency theory prediction suggesting that as a firm has high managerial ownership, the asymmetric information will decrease and directly decrease the effectiveness of the dividend policy. Beside this the firms with higher managerial ownership decrease their perquisites, so the conflict between manager's shareholders can be settled. It is also observed that the managers' ownership concentration in general has a positive relationship with the performance in the corporate culture of Pakistan, where major firms are the family oriented. When the managerial ownership is divided in three levels, low level (0 -5%), moderate level (5%-25% and high concentrated (above 25%), the performance positively affect only at low and moderate level. The ownership beyond 25% has a negative association with performance and support the entrenchment theory. (c) Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2011.

This article considers the 'obvious' relationship between human capital (HC) and agency theory (AT) with two goals in mind. First, to show how principal-agent theory (PAT) - the AT variant most understood by agency theory - clarifies HC as a way of describing individuals in the organizational context. Second, to explore how PAT's own shortcomings illuminate possibilities implicit but underexplored in the HC literature; for while a workplace relationship between PAT and HC seems obvious, it is conceptually complicated. The article begins with a review of the two concepts' history and the research programs from which they emerged. After considering the PAT-HC interaction, it shows how HC might contribute to the theory of the firm. Many see the firm as a socioeconomic context in which HC and agency issues collide under management's direction as other forms of capital enter the mix. (c) Oxford University Press 2011.

The choice of the financial policy is one of the most important decisions that the company will ever take. It consists on determining the optimal capital structure of the companies. Recently, the capital structure has increasingly gained importance sine many companies have experienced financial distress and bankruptcy caused by the last financial crisis, it has drawn the interest of many researchers and it was a subject of considerable debate in both theoretical and empirical studies. This paper analyzes the explanatory power of some of the theories that have been proposed in the literature to explain changes the in the capital structures across companies. In particular, this study investigates capital structure determinants of companies traded on Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange based on a panel data set over 2008 and 2009 comprising 33 companies from different industries. In the literature, there are many potential factors that could affect the capital structure such as: the tangibility (asset structure), the non-debt tax shield, the profitability, the size, the expected growth, the uniqueness, the income variability, the industry classification dummies, the ownership structure and the age of the company. The purpose of this study is to examine the link between a number of potential capital structure determinants and the debt level of the companies included in our analysis. In the financial literature, there are several measures of the financial leverages (long-term, short-term, and convertible debt divided by market and book values of equity) but because of the non availability of the data, we will limit our study to the leverage measures in terms of the book values rather than the market ones. Our book leverage measures are decomposed into short-term and long-term debt ratios to highlight the magnitude of the components of the capital structure. At the first look of the capital structure of the companies, we can easily confirm that they are on average highly leveraged but it stays to determine the relationship between the potential determinants of the capital structure and the different leverage measures.

This paper deals with the relationships between plural form and performance in franchising networks in Europe. It is proposed that a franchisor's life cycle stage and human capital assets influence the relationship between plural form and performance. The model has been estimated using panel data on 41 publicly listed European franchising networks in the 1998-2007 period. The proportion of network-franchised units to the total number of its units in its distribution system is used as the indicator of its plural form (franchise proportion). Following an instrumental approach, the network performance is measured at the franchisor level by its industry-adjusted Return on Assets (ROA) and a relative stock market valuation measure of intangible human capital is used. The early results show that the impact of franchise proportion on performance is greater for franchisors with high intangible human capital compared to franchisors with low intangible human capital. Overall, results provide support for the contention that the franchisors' performance is contingent on the "fit" between governance structure (franchise proportion) and resources (critical human assets). In contrast, evidence that the governance/performance relationship is contingent on life cycle stage or franchisor's age is not found. However our results suggest that franchisor's age could weaken the relationship between franchise proportion and performance. These results might suggest that younger franchisors with high human capital should increase their franchise proportion to enhance their financial performance.

This paper examines the impact of ownership structure on the voluntary disclosure in the annual reports of Malaysian listed firms. The result shows that there is an increase in the extent of voluntary disclosure in Malaysian listed firms over the eleven-year period from 1996 to 2006. Ownership concentration consistently shows positive association with voluntary disclosure. Firms with higher foreign and institutional ownership have a significantly positive association with voluntary disclosure levels while firms with family ownership exhibit lower voluntary disclosure. Consistent with agency theory, different ownership structures have varied monitoring effects on agency costs and clearly influence firm's disclosure practices. The findings provide insights to policy makers and regulators in their desire to increase transparency and accountability amidst the continual enhancement of corporate governance. The findings provide evidence that optimized ownership structure in any jurisdiction should be considered in any regulatory process that seeks to improve transparency.

Purpose - This research seeks to investigate the role of key corporate governance mechanisms in determining a firm's post-bankruptcy performance following reorganisation. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on agency theory and uses a unique sample of 111 filing companies whose reorganisation plans have been confirmed by the Thai Central Bankruptcy Court during the period 1999-2002. Findings - The results indicate that monitoring and incentive mechanisms are significant determinants of a firm's post-bankruptcy performance. The key monitoring mechanism is ownership concentration, measured by shares held by the largest shareholder, whereas the critical incentive mechanisms are cash compensation and percentage of common shares held by the plan administrator. The results indicate that these mechanisms can mitigate agency problems in previously insolvent companies and increase post-bankruptcy performance over a three year period. Originality/value - The study is timely given that many organisations are facing rebuilding programs following the impact of the global financial crisis. Prior research in Thailand and elsewhere has not measured bankruptcy reorganisation outcomes in terms of the difference of actual financial performance to predicted performance and in relation to the governance factors of the reorganisation process. Neither has this aspect been considered within an agency theory framework. This provides a unique opportunity to consider these variables based on the theoretical framework of agency theory and to evaluate the importance of governance mechanisms in reorganisation proceedings.

The sustainable supply chain has become a major research topic and has given rise to a large number of academic works. These studies focus on how supply management integrates environmental, social and economic criteria allowing a network of interlinked organizations to achieve long-term economic viability. The objective of this research is to explore the paradigm shift that buyers must undergo when adopting a sustainable development approach. This new vision extends and surpasses the traditional dyadic buyer-supplier relationship that has historically dominated the field leading to a new global supply chain dynamic. The case of the Cite des Sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris is used to question the ability of a hub firm to ensure component traceability from first-tier and second-tier suppliers and thus consolidate their corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. Indeed, second-tier supplier failure to comply with CSR requirements, even if the first-tier suppliers meet these requirements, may damage customer perception of the hub firm's strategic positioning. This research mobilizes the agency theory conceptual framework to illustrate that hub firms tend to trust first-tier suppliers with verifying CSR requirements in the upstream supply chain to reduce direct agency costs (monitoring and bonding expenditures). If this approach becomes widespread, it is highly likely that CSR expansion along the global supply chain will be ineffective.

This chapter explores entrepreneur-investor relations from a cognitive perspective. I show that entrepreneurs' and investors' specific mindsets matter for the perception and realization of strategic opportunity. Differences in cognitive structure and process thus influence value creation beyond economizing on agency costs. I define and add concepts of cognitive cost and cognitive value to a basic agency model, which allows me to explain why some entrepreneur-investor relations create more value than others, although they may have the same level of agency costs. This enhanced framework also helps understand why external funding may not be available to certain ventures, even if agency conflicts can be kept under control through proper incentive alignment. The concepts of cognitive cost and value are shown to be especially relevant in the context of entrepreneurial finance, where uncertainty is typically high, and knowledge about value creation opportunities is ambiguous. An investor's appreciation of the value of entrepreneurs' knowledge about strategic opportunity depends on the closeness of their respective mindsets. Some investor types such as venture capitalists (VCs) share certain of the entrepreneurs' mental features and develop specific skills to identify valuable ventures at a low cognitive cost while adding cognitive value through strategic advice and mentoring, especially when entrepreneurs are still inexperienced.

We examine the design of control rights of external financiers, and how these interact with the firm's security issuance and capital structure when the firm's initial owners and managers may disagree with new investors over project choice. The first main result is an ex ante managerial preference for "soft" financial claims that maximize managerial project-choice autonomy, which is in contrast to agency theory. Second, a dynamic "pecking order" of cash, equity, and debt emerges. Additional results explain equity issuance at high prices, the drifting of leverage ratios with stock returns, cash hoarding, and debt usage without taxes, agency, or signaling. (c) 2011 The Author.

This book provides a framework for the study of financial ethics built on a broad review of research published in finance and economics journals. This book demonstrates that ethics is already an important part of financial research, and therefore the approach taken here is more of a "rediscovery" of the ethical dimension of financial economics. The book adopts a positivist framework for the field of financial ethics within which it is proposed that many "finance" problems are actually "ethics" problems; and that many economic phenomena can be explained as mechanisms for controlling moral risks. The text discusses several examples in which an ethics-centered approach to understanding economic phenomena is similar in spirit to other frameworks which have been applied in positive financial research including: the framework used for understanding corporate governance mechanisms as devices for mitigating agency costs and "moral hazards" in contractual relationships; the transaction "governance structure" framework that can explain the existence of hierarchies relative to markets when opportunistic behavior is assumed; and the roles of reputation and corporate culture in making credible commitments of trust in exchange. The book argues that these "financial ethical technologies" are not mutually exclusive but, rather, mutually enriching ways to deepen our understanding of the same economic phenomena. They are financial technologies because they enhance economic value; and, they are ethical technologies because their value enhancing contributions are produced by mitigating moral risks in exchange.

Agency theory has been discussed widely in the business and management literature. However, to date there has been no investigation about its utility and implications for problems in training & development. Whereas organizations are still struggling to develop and implement effective training programs, there is little emphasis on the self-interest behaviors of the trainers and how these motivations may impede the training process. Agency theory can help inform our learning and understanding of possible outcomes in this scenario. Consequently, this article is the first to explore agency theory within the training & development framework and offers propositions for research and practice. Implications for organizational policy and performance outcomes are also discussed. (c) SAGE Publications 2011.

This paper studies the relationship between personal stock donation by top executives and board of directors (insiders) of publicly traded corporations and their personal tax, shareholders' returns, and social responsibility. The study finds evidence that the timing of stock donations is driven by personal tax gain. The study further shows, comparing stock gift corporations relative to their non-stock gift cohorts, that personal stock gifts are associated with lower short-term and long-term stock returns to shareholders. This implies that stock donation driven by insiders' personal gain adversely affects shareholder wealth. However, the likelihood and intensity of insiders to make personal stock donation is reduced when firms have strong corporate social responsibility (CSR). Agency theory explains insiders' opportunistic behavior, stakeholder theory is also supported by evidence that stock donation is negatively related to CSR, and stewardship theory offers a different view to explain the rationale behind insiders' stock donation and shareholders' reactions to stock gifts.

In response to equity compensation contracts that encourage managers to commit fraud as well as provide productive effort, ownersmay choose to monitor the manager to limit the fraud. We examine the firm owners' incentives to perform both ex ante monitoring, such as internal controls, and ex post monitoring, such as audits, in a model that includes the reputational damages caused when a fraud is discovered. We provide conditions under which the owner prefers either more or less monitoring, and examine the effect of additional monitoring on the optimal equity package and equilibrium level of fraud.

Financial reporting quality has been under scrutiny especially after the collapse of major companies. The main objective of this study is to investigate the audit committee's effectiveness on the financial reporting quality among the Malaysian GLCs following the transformation program. In particular, the study examined the impact of audit committee characteristics (independence, size, frequency of meeting and financial expertise) on earnings management in periods prior to and following the transformation program (2003-2009). As of 31 December 2010, there were 33 public-listed companies categorized as Government-Linked Companies (GLC Transformation Policy, 2010) and there were 20 firms that have complete data that resulted in the total number of firm-year observations to 120 for six years (years 2003-2009). Results show that the magnitude of earnings management as proxy of financial reporting quality is influenced by the audit committee independence. Agency theory was applied to explain audit committee, as a monitoring mechanism as well as reducing agency costs via gaining competitive advantage in knowledge, skills, and expertise towards financial reporting quality. The study is important as it provides additional knowledge about the impact of audit committees effectiveness on reducing the earnings management, and assist practitioners, policymakers and regulators such as Malaysian Institute of Accountants, Securities Commission and government to determine ways to enhance audit committees effectiveness and improve the financial reporting of GLCs, as well as improving the quality of the accounting profession.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to compare the governance structures of two distinctive governance forms&colon; the family firm and the leveraged buyout &lpar;LBO&rpar;. The paper also explores the relative performance of these two organizational forms over the course of the economic business cycle. Design&sol;methodology&sol;approachThe paper provides a theoretical treatment of the family firm and the LBO using the stewardship perspective and agency theory. The analysis anticipates the board structure for each organizational form and relates family firm and LBO governance to performance over the business cycle. FindingsFrom a conceptual treatment, the family&hyphen;owned concern exhibits board characteristics reflecting the longer&hyphen;term orientation of the firm, with boards empowered to include non&hyphen;economic, as well as economic, goals. LBOs are structured to maximize shareholder value over a shorter time horizon. LBOs may take advantage of expansionary environments whereas family firms may be better prepared for economic down&hyphen;cycles. Research limitations&sol;implicationsThe paper takes a holistic approach to contrasting two organizational forms that fit their respective theoretical frames and compares some of their more salient governance characteristics and performance over the business cycle. Practical implicationsManagers and boards can structure governance to manage the business cycle. Stakeholders can selectively engage firms that portray vital governance characteristics for their benefit and may also pressure boards and top management to make necessary governance improvements. Originality&sol;valueThe paper offers an introductory comparison between family firms and LBOs in terms of governance and managing the firm over the business cycle. This paper makes the case that some organizational forms are better suited to certain types of economic climates. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The main purpose of this paper is to test for relative performance evaluation (RPE) using assumptions derived from an examination of firms' disclosures about their RPE use. Prior empirical evidence supporting the use of RPE in executive compensation is mixed. This is puzzling since studies of firm disclosures indicate that firms claim to use RPE based on both accounting measures and stock returns. Those few studies that do find empirical support observe it with either an accounting performance measure or stock returns, but not both. The lack of strong consistent empirical support for RPE is due, in part, to the fact that the preponderance of tests for RPE incorporate unsubstantiated assumptions about the way firms apply RPE. This includes the compensation measure to which RPE is applied and the way in which firms use firm-own and peer group performance when determining compensation. Our test results provide support for the use of RPE among 1998 S&P 500 firms with both stock returns and return on equity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to find support for RPE with both stock returns and an accounting performance measure. Through a series of sensitivity analyses, we also provide insight into the amount of detail researchers need to build into their empirical tests in order to find support for RPE.

Based on annual report data for a sample of 118 companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, this study provides further empirical evidence of the association between the voluntary disclosure of segment information and a firm's level of diversification; controlling for firm size, industry membership, the level of minority interest, leverage, and ownership diffusion. The period examined falls between the introduction of the first Australian standard on segment disclosure in 1986 and its subsequent revision in 2001. In particular, the study focuses on segment information that was not required to be disclosed in the original standard but which standard setters subsequently felt sufficiently important to include as part of the mandated disclosure requirements in the revised standard. Consistent with expectations, based on both agency theory and proprietary costs theory, our logistic regression results confirm that greater levels of diversification are likely to be associated with additional voluntary segment disclosure.

Controlling shareholders who are normally also the executive directors tend to set their own levels of remuneration as a means of expropriating minority shareholders. This study tests the relationship between ownership concentration and executive remuneration, using panel data for a sample of 191 Malaysian public listed companies over the 2002-2007 period. This study finds a non linear relationship between share ownership of executive directors and their levels of salary by using the fixed-effects (FE) model. The model exhibits a negative, positive and negative relationship which corresponds to the occurrence of convergence-of-interests, managerial entrenchment, and convergence-of-interests effects. The positive relationship between 23 to 76 per cent between executive ownership and salary for levels of executive ownership indicates the existence of expropriation. Despite the occurrence of expropriation, salary and remuneration received by executive directors are positively related to market-to-book ratio. A positive association is also found between bonus paid to executive directors and firm's accounting profits. Independent non executive directors and the remuneration committee are able to exert a downward effect on directors' remuneration and bonus. But external blockholders do not possess such an influence in reining in the salary, bonus, or remuneration of executive directors.

In this research, the effect of corporate governance on choosing audit firms by companies accepted into the Tehran Stock Exchange has been investigated. The sample consisted of 545 observations (year-company) from 2004 to 2008. The audit firm size has been considered an audit quality criterion. The results of testing the research hypotheses by using a logistic regression model by means of the backward elimination method at the levels of all companies show that increasing the percentage of outside directors will increase the possibility of choosing high-quality audit firms. The percentage of institutional ownership (first hypothesis) has a negative meaningful relationship with the possibility of choosing high-quality audit firms as opposed to what was expected. Therefor only the fifth hypothesis of this research has been accepted regarding all companies. After the industry types were separately observed, the industry type was revealed that as a modifying factor it has an important effect on improving the statistics of the model and that it increases the potential of the power of prediction of the presented models.

This paper offers an agency-based explanation for the junior priority status of convertible bonds. Using a simple economic model, I show that when convertible and straight debt have equal priority, shareholders can prefer value-decreasing projects, which results in wealth transfers from bondholders to shareholders; and I prove that this problem is solved when convertible debt is subordinated. Empirical evidence supports the theory. I find that firms with greater potential for investment-based agency conflicts are more likely to issue subordinated convertible debt, and firms with senior convertible debt are more likely to deviate from the optimal investment policy.

This study examines Indonesian Accounting Regulatory Compliance measurement (IARCm) and Indonesian Accounting Regulatory Compliance disclosure (IARCd) through an agency theory-based analysis of 220 Indonesian listed companies' 2006 annual reports. To measure the level of regulatory compliance of Indonesian listed companies, this study uses a 29 item index derived from Indonesian accounting standards on inventory, fixed assets and depreciation. Analysis reveals a moderate level of 69.70% measurement and 54.20% disclosure compliance with accounting rules. Statistical analysis shows that firm size is the best predictor of compliance. Surprisingly, corporate governance factors fail to explain compliance. However, more profitable firms do demonstrate increased measurement compliance. Although Indonesian firms may have complied with more than 50% of the key accounting rule provisions, regulatory intervention is still strongly advocated for making Indonesian firms fully comply with Indonesian accounting regulations.

Family businesses differ from other ventures. However, also within its group we find different forms of family businesses. To differentiate them, we have developed the 3-dimension-model with the dimensions ownership, investment, and governance. Those three dimensions are based on a theory or logic: complexity (ownership), portfolio theory and risk diversification (investment), and agency theory (governance).

Purpose - This paper aims to examine the extent of financial ratio communication from an agency theory perspective. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical positivist approach is utilised to explore the predictors of disclosure within the 2007 annual reports of 300 Australian listed companies. Findings - Overall, the extent of financial ratio disclosures is very low (5.3 per cent) with more extensive disclosures within the sub-categories of share market measure, profitability and capital structure. A far lower liquidity and cash flow ratio information is reported. Larger firms with more dispersed share ownership provide more extensive financial ratio information than the others. Further, profit-making firms and Big4 clients exhibit more extensive financial ratio disclosures. Resources firms present significantly lower incidents of financial ratio than the financials and services sector. Corporate governance and capital management initiatives do not have predictive properties. Originality/value - Financial ratio disclosure, although important, is under-researched. A comprehensive set of predictors are investigated. The findings highlight the need for Australian regulators to consider more explicit guidelines or mandatory requirements.

Purpose: There are two purposes of this study. First, it aims to discuss some measures managers would take on the basis of an empirical case study - Dell's pricing mistakes on the web site - and find out the underlying motivation regarding consumers' attitude toward Dell. Second, there appears to be a fruitful opportunity to explore whether consumers' requests or different degrees of compensation will have any impact on organizational reputation (intangible assets). Design/methodology/approach: The survey investigates consumers' attitude toward the Dell crisis case, including how and why it affected the reputation of the company. The main questionnaire survey was conducted after the Dell pricing mistakes. In total, 433 samples were found valid and kept for further examination. The study tests the proposed hypotheses by structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: By taking Dell's pricing mistake on the web site as an example, the study finds that managers sometimes opt for solutions unfavorable to the whole organization, in order to ensure self interest, including over quota coupons to reimburse consumers, which would be harmful to other stakeholders. Managers face not only consumers' interests but also other stakeholders' as well as corporate intangible assets. Also, consumers have different backgrounds and these characteristics will exercise influence on perceived crisis management. Originality/value: Although the academic literature has given much attention to the internet issues or crisis management, little attention seems to have been paid to the crisis potential coming from the internet. The power of consumers may hugely increase in the internet age and make the crisis graver, because the internet changes the ability of external commentators to make their opinions widely known, and hurts the reputation of corporations more deeply. A major theoretical contribution of this study is comprehension and filling the gaps in the existing literature. Agency theory and stakeholders' view provides a logical explanation of how and why these things happened. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - Firms that pursue invention face special conditions that heighten the potential conflict between managers and shareholders. High R&D spending increases the information asymmetry between managers and shareholders because the invention process is rooted in tacit knowledge. Because tacit knowledge is difficult to communicate to external parties, shareholders will have problems monitoring whether managers are spending R&D in a manner that maximizes firm value. Design/methodology/approach - Using agency theory, it is argued that managerial ownership is one solution to this problem and that high levels of R&D intensity will necessitate high levels of managerial ownership to counteract agency problems. However, it is also argued based on signaling theory that a firm's patenting activity reduces ownership requirement as well as moderating the managerial ownership-R&D relationship. Findings - Using a sample of firms from the knowledge-intensive biotechnology industry, a positive relationship was found between R&D spending and managerial ownership. It was also found that this relationship is most strongly moderated by patenting activity. Research limitations/implications - The findings would be strengthened by replication using samples from other knowledge-intensive industries. Future research should examine how the critical determinants of success in other industries affect managerial ownership of firms in those industries. Practical implications - The study shows that top managers have some control over the contracting environment. By aggressively pursuing patents managers can reduce their level of ownership in the firm. Originality/value - The study finds evidence that in order to prevent agency problems firms undertaking inventive activity may require their managers to take larger ownership or aggressively pursue patents. High managerial ownership levels and patents can provide a signal to shareholders about the growth potential of the firm. (c) 2011, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In international franchising the control over franchisees' actions is becoming increasingly difficult. Franchisors must allocate a certain portion of decision rights to franchisees to enable effective decision making and maximize residual income, while still retaining control over the network. This conceptual paper combines the perspectives of the property rights, agency theory and transaction cost theory to reveal the differences in the allocation of decision rights between master franchising and direct/multi-unit franchising, as well as to understand the franchisors' choice between these two modes when entering new markets. The property rights theory predicts that the allocation of residual decision rights depends on the impact of intangible knowledge assets on the residual surplus generation. The agency theory hypothesis suggests that the decision rights allocation is influenced by the monitoring costs due to the information asymmetry between the headquarters and the foreign local partners. The analysis involves two determinants of monitoring costs: the geographic and cultural distances of the host markets. Finally, under the transaction costs view, attention is directed towards environmental and behavioral uncertainty, as determinants of the entry mode choice and the allocation of decision rights.

This study examines if the CEO duality influence the firm economic performance in Bangladesh and the moderating effects of board composition in the form of outside independent directors. While doing so, it examines the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance during the pre appointment of outside independent directors and post appointment of outside independent directors (the role of other corporate governance mechanism as moderating variable). The finding is that there is there is a negative (non-significant) relationship between CEO duality and firm performance before appointment of outside independent directors in the board. However, independent leadership structure and firm performance is found to be positively related following the acquisition of resource (outside independent directors in the board) supporting the 'resource dependence theory'. The findings of this study partially support the 'agency theory' and 'resource dependence theory' but do not support the stewardship theory. This study contributes to the literature on CEO duality in the context of less a developed country.

Based on stakeholder theory, agency theory and control mechanisms, the individual competency model has been put into wide practice in Chinese government and enterprises, especially with the separation of the enterprises' right of management from the right of ownership. The related research in this field defines our research direction and choice of management practices, as all kinds of organizations in China are trying to recruit, select, cultivate, utilize and develop talents found to be scarce by human resource evaluation practices. By reviewing the competency models of the position of sales managers, this contribution compares the current application of their evaluation in China and the U.S., setting out the conclusions on the differences between the two countries, and further discusses its application in different fields of human resource management, such as recruitment, training and development, career planning, development and management. The research results help us to establish the difficulties in the current situation and improve the efficacy of human resource evaluation systems in both Chinese government and enterprises.

Based on agency theory, this paper studied on the relationship between corporate governance structure and diversification strategy. Choosing 520 listed companies in Shanghai stock on December 31, 2009 as research samples, the paper did an empirical study on the impact of corporate governance structure on diversification strategy. The result showed that concentration of ownership, proportion of legal person shares and proportion of independent directors all had negative correlation with diversification degree significantly; proportion of state owned shares, board size and management compensation all had positive correlation with diversification degree significantly. The empirical result confirmed the theoretical hypothesises and supported the explanation of diversification discount under agency theory. (c) 2011 IEEE.

In this issue, Miller and Sardais challenge the established wisdom that agents are preordained to play costly villains in their contracts with shareholders in modern corporations. The key exhibit in support of their assertion is an angel agent in the form of Pierre Lefaucheux, the CEO of Regie Renault in early postwar France. Lefaucheux is shown to be a model agent, refreshingly free of the symptoms that afflict the archetypal economic agent of neoclassical agency theory. In this counterpoint, I provide a more restrained view of angel agents, question their wider presence and argue that one angel agent does not negate the overall theory of agency, and conclude by noting that the angel agent model has never really gained wide currency. Finally, I note that the inability of Renault to remain profitable in the late 1970s and the early 1980s raises questions about the longevity of programs left in place by well-intentioned angel agents.

This work aims to contribute to the field of research on Agency Theory, based on an approach that is different from the previous literature. It focuses on analysis of characteristics of the structure of the Board of Directors as mechanisms for control over the level of remuneration awarded to executive personnel, both in the context of "concentrated" as well as "dispersed" share ownership, with the aim of determining whether or not the postulates of this theory are applicable to both. To achieve this objective, the study is based on a sample of 80 traded Spanish companies for the period 2004-2007, to which crosscutting and panel data models are applied. The results obtained show that the characteristics that define the structure of the Board of Directors constitute efficient mechanisms for supervision and control of compensation received by Top Management, although its influence in this regard is conditioned by the concentration of ownership.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the presence of a particular financial intermediary such as venture capitalist (VCs) on the resulting governance structures. This article investigates the composition of boards of directors in VC-backed firms and analyses whether board structure has an impact on performance. Using 106 French VC-backed firms, our methodology in this paper is to estimate four equations. A regression analysis is then used to study the impact of board structure on performance and also to analyze whether board variables (size, outside directors, COE chairman duality, proportion of VC directors, proportion of employee directors and board meeting frequency) are significant determinants of VC-backed firm performance. Results indicate a strong positive relation between board size and performance measured by ROA, Tobin's Q and MVA and negative relation between board size and performance measured by ROE. The proportion of independent outside directors on the board was positively associated with ROE. The presence of a dual leadership structure is negatively associated with ROE and positively associated with other measure of performance. No strong relation was found between the proportion of venture-capital in board, the presence of employee in board, or board meeting frequency and firm performance. Venture capitalists may have a more important role to play in corporate governance. By creating boards with low number of member and with greater independence, venture capitalists play a role in mitigating principal-agent problems and improve performance. The involvement of VCs in the entrepreneurial firm may be able to create value. This paper contributes to the limited literature by establishing the important role of venture capitalists in board structure. Other contribution is to use a French VC-backed firm in the sample. This is the first paper to study French context in regard of impact of board structure on performance. (c) EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.

Motivated by agency theory, this study investigates how staggered boards influence accounting discretion. The results indicate that staggered boards do affect accounting discretion. In fact, the impact of staggered boards on accounting discretion is substantially larger (about seven times stronger) than the effect of all other corporate governance provisions combined. Firms with a staggered board exercise less income inflating accounting discretion. Further evidence reveals that accounting discretion has a benign effect on subsequent firm value. Yet, the presence of staggered boards reduces significantly the favourable effect of accounting discretion on subsequent firm performance. The evidence is robust to a large number of control variables including other governance provisions. The evidence is in line with the notion that staggered boards improve managers' job security, reduce managerial myopia, and thus induce managers to exercise less short-term transitory accounting discretion.

Drawing on Agency Theory this article investigates the relationship between board size and European firms' performance. The focus is on the implicit differences between financial and non-financial firms. In particular the paper addresses the following questions: does board size influence firm performance? Is financial intermediaries' corporate governance different from that of non-financial companies? The study analyses the governance of the largest listed European companies which make up the Eurotop 100 index. Companies come from 12 different countries and are subject to different regulatory and self-discipline codes. Referring to the Eurotop index the focus is on the relation between the overall size of the board of directors and the level of performance measured as Tobin's Q and Return on Assets. Diverging results emerge depending on the typology of the firm. In particular, results suggest that for non-financial companies large boards negatively influence firm performance, whereas financial intermediaries seem to be different because of the non-relation between their board size and performance.

Agency theory suggests that conflict interests between managers and owners cause management shirking and associated agency costs. An audit is a monitoring mechanism that provides an independent check on accounting information and reduces agency costs (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Therefore, given severe owner-manager agency problems, higher audit quality should be associated with lower client company owner-manager agency costs. The purpose of this study is to empirically test this relation. In China, owner-manager agency problems are severe given extremely low or no management ownership. Moreover, there is a lack of variations in management holdings across Chinese public companies. Such an environment allows us to examine the role of audits in reducing owner-manager agency costs. Using a sample of Chinese listed companies, we find that observations with higher quality audits show lower owner-manger agency costs. Such a result suggests that in an emerging market, higher quality audits more effectively reduce agency costs. Copyright (c) 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The study investigates the change in performance of French public firms post to their Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and its relationship with the changes in the managerial ownership around the time firms to their IPOs. We develop three hypotheses: (1) Agency theory, (2) Entrenchment, (3) Curve-linear link between managerial ownership and firm performance. Tests are conducted on a sample of 65 companies going public during 2000 to 2006 on the Paris stock exchange. Overall, we observe an average decrease in managerial ownership and accounting performance two years after going public. The majority of our results show there is a significant negative relation between post-IPO change in performance and equity detention by the managerial ownership. Therefore, the most of the results are opposed to the predictions resulting from the assumption of agency (alignment of interests) but contribute to retain the entrenchment hypothesis and specially the assumption of the timing in the sense that it is beneficial for manager to plan the introduction at a time when performance is particularly high to ensure its success. This facilitates later, his entrenchment. Accordingly, a steeper decline in performance after IPO for the group of companies, where owner-managers hold a large share of ownership. Some of our results support the alignment of interest hypothesis. (c) 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Purpose: Reward research has focussed on level (what individuals are paid) and structure (relationship between different levels of reward). Less emphasis has been given to reward mix decisions, i.e. the relative proportions of each element making up overall reward. This paper seeks to examine the determinants of reward mix. Design/methodology/approach: Interview based research with reward consultants as key organisational observers and participants in reward mix decision making. Findings: Benchmarking has led to the development of reward mix norms. Organisations are under pressure to conform to these norms, moderated by leadership beliefs, the occurrence of events and the extent to which organisations' change capability can overcome strong institutional forces. Research limitations/implications: The results question agency theory based explanations of reward mix determination and point towards resource dependence and institutional theory perspectives being more suitable theoretical frameworks. Practical implications: The model developed allows reward managers to consider how the moderating variables, to the dominant mimetic pressure faced, could be manipulated for their firm to allow greater differentiation of the reward mix. Originality/value: Academically the work contributes to a programme of research into reward determination from a constructionist perspective and aims to provide greater theoretical robustness to the subject. Practically, the findings may prompt practitioners to think more consciously about the drivers of their firm's reward mix. Policy makers may use the stronger theoretical base for understanding the determinants of reward mix choices and the extent to which organisational free choice and institutionally determined choice influence final choices in reward policy decision making.

Whereas extant literature has explored the question of why foreign R&D is present in China, we still know almost nothing about how these R&D operations are managed. This applies specifically to the management of Chinese R&D staff who conventionally are not known for their respect of foreign firms' intellectual property rights (IPR). However, foreign R&D units in China are likely to have developed management techniques to deal with such problems. In this paper, we engage in qualitative and quantitative exploration of how foreign R&D units in China manage their Chinese R&D staff. For exploration we develop a conceptual framework on the basis of agency theory and the theory of trusted relationships. Our findings show that those R&D units that have developed adequate measures to manage their Chinese R&D staff have succeeded in making Chinese employees loyal to the R&D unit. These results have important implications for both practitioners and future empirical research. (c) 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Stock options are theoretically adopted to better align the interests of the managers and shareholders, thereby reducing agency costs, and consequently increasing corporate performance. The critical question is whether stock options have this impact in practice. Consequently, this study investigates if stock options attribution has impact on corporate performance of Portuguese listed firms on the Euronext Lisbon. The results suggest that stock options grant is negatively related with firm's performance. Hence, this study corroborates the rent extraction hypothesis, the crowding-out hypothesis and the multi-tasking effect, which suggest that stock options may affect adversely firm's performance.

This paper examines the performance effects arising from initial primary offering (IPO) firms retaining their existing bank as a lead manager together with the effects of foreign and domestic lead managers, corporate insiders and private equity investors across West Africa. Using a unique and comprehensive sample of 37 locally listed IPO firm's from across West Africa, I find evidence of a considerable reduction in underpricing and costs of equity in firms listing on civil code as opposed to common law markets. Furthermore, I find evidence that firms employing their existing bank as lead manager have higher costs of equity while the employment of a foreign as opposed to domestic lead manager imparts a reduction in underpricing and cost of equity.

Using two theoretical approaches-agency theory and trust theory, this paper analyzes the banking relationship between branch manager and loan officer of a bank branch in India. The analysis is performed across five dimensions-supervisor subordinate relationship, delegation of authority, assumption of risk in lending, goal congruence and mutual dependence. This analysis provides a theoretical foundation for examining bank relationships in India. The role of culture in this relationship is also examined as it is an important contributing factor in business relationships in India. Since Trust theory can explain situations involving multifaceted relationships such as one between branch manager and loan officer using stakeholders' perspective, this study concludes that the trust theory is a better descriptor of the banking relationship between branch manager and loan officer in Indian banks.

The present study's major objective consists in providing an empirical examination of the effect of the information asymmetry variables on the IPOs underpricing on the French market, based on the agency theory. The results have shown that the securities' underpricing can be explained by variables related to information asymmetry between the different actors in the stock market introduction including the issuing firm, the introducing intermediaries and the investors. The ex-ante uncertainty about the equilibrium value of the newly introduced securities is an indicator of information asymmetry which is, in turn, connected to certain variables pertaining to the issuing firm's characteristics as well as the issuance ones. Our results have shown that the ex-ante uncertainty is positively associated with the underpricing level. In addition, they have indicated that underpricing can also be explained by the revelation of favourable information by the informed institutional investors in the book building procedure. This eventually highlights the presence of a price partial adjustment phenomenon on the French market. (c) 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The family firm preparing generational change, the partnership that welcomes new partners, and the shareholders of a firm that chooses to go public are making decisions that will have an impact on strategy and management. Conversely, a change in strategy such as a move to diversify or a decision to take on more risk in a business can make the firm more attractive to some shareholders and less attractive to others and is therefore not ownership neutral. Opening the black box of agency theory, Korine and Gomez show how management and ownership interact to shape the strategy of the firm. In their view, the critical question to ask is not what is the best strategy, but rather, who is the strategy for? With numerous detailed examples, Strong Managers, Strong Owners is an invaluable resource for company owners, board members and executives, as well as their advisors in strategy and governance.

This study investigates the impacts of family presence and board independence on corporate financial performance in 131 large listed firms from India, an emerging economy dominated by the presence of large business groups having concentrated ownership. Family presence includes the extent of family ownership and appointment of family CEO and family chairperson. Employing a multiple linear regression model, this study first detects a positive relationship between family ownership and financial performance. Second, a negative relationship is found between family CEO and firm performance, indicating that family firms with non-family CEOs perform better than firms having family CEOs. Third, the proportion of Board outsiders ' (i.e. independent non-family directors) is found to have no significant relation to financial performance, thus challenging agency theory's need for independent monitoring in family firms to enhance performance. These results are interpreted in the context of historical Indian family business practices and modern changes.

A considerable amount of research has been done on the figure of the CEO, approaching it from many angles. Our analysis focuses on the role played by the independent director in the supervision and turnover of the chief corporate executive. In the process, we have carried out a comprehensive reflection on the independent director, consulting the latest literature and including the results of the most recent empirical evidence. We have noticed that the role of the independent director often goes beyond the tasks that are usually considered specific to this function, namely, supervision of the company's senior management. However, the directors' independence cannot be built by requirements. It is a personal quality of the individual that transcends the various problems raised by agency theory. We believe that correct CEO supervision can only be effectively undertaken if the independent directors have these personal qualities. It seems that companies with a larger number of independent directors are more likely to replace the CEO when performance is not as expected. This can only happen if the independent directors enjoy effective independence.

This paper examines the specificities of the governance system in Tunisian companies through the remuneration policy for executives, the board and the ownership structure in the period before the revolution. The purpose of this work is to identify possible dysfunctions and subsequently propose ways of to rehabilitate governance mechanisms and optimize their effectiveness. The agency theory identifies the necessary conditions for effective controlling. Empirical validation on a panel of 30 Tunisian companies listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange and observed for two years (between 2008 and 2009), Shows firstly that the policy of executive compensation is not a mechanism for effective governance, and secondly that the impact of internal control mechanisms on performance, through its components, seems mixed.

This study considers the legitimacy of shareholder activism as a means of exercising influence in the corporate decision-making process and identifies self-reformed boards as a superior solution to the issues that activists attempt to address. We conceptualise the board of directors' role as representing the interests of multiple principals. When any one principal is able to serve its own interests by influencing corporate decision-making through shareholder activism, other principals' interests may be compromised. We argue that a better long-term solution lies not with activist shareholders, but with culturally reformed boards. We suggest a set of self-reform initiatives that would help them to achieve their potential. We develop a conceptual framework for the arguments in favour of boards taking a leadership role in corporate engagement with shareholders and stakeholders. To the extent that boards are unable to implement self-reform, governments may need to develop public policy initiatives for corporate governance reform. (c) 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The objective of this work was to verify the determining reasons for Brazilian companies to repurchase shares in the period from 1995 to 2008. The explanatory variables used in the statistical tests were based on previous studies (DURAND, 1952; JENSEN; MECKLING, 1976; SPENCE, 1973). The data were obtained from the Economatica database and the empirical tests consisted of multiple regression with pooled data, with the help of least squares and Tobit methods. Pooled and Tobit regressions were applied to verify the statistical robustness of the results. The study was based on the capital structure adjustment, agency, dividend substitution and signaling theories. The reasons for share repurchases tested were adjustment of the capital structure, reduction of available cash flow, substitution of dividend payments and firm undervaluation. The only statistically significant reason for share buybacks was reduction of available cash flow. In light of agency theory, this indicates that firms with available cash can repurchase their shares with the intention of minimizing the principal-agent conflict.

Through the lens of agency theory, the paper examines the conflicts of interest arising among the actors (citizens, Local governments, private shareholders, service providers, etc.) that, at various levels, are involved in local public utilities governance systems. The main results of a multiple case study analysis on ten Italian listed local public utilities are summarized by identifying different and co-existing situations of conflict of interest among multiple principals and agents. Although governance mechanisms (e.g., the board of directors) have different roles and functions and may prevent and mitigate such conflicts, our findings pointed out that various problematic issues exist. First, the effects of the ownership structure on board composition and functioning needs to be further explored. Second, higher numbers of independent directors do not mean actual board independence. Third, service charters as tools for promoting transparency, accountability and public participation are not well implemented yet. The chapter contributes to the debate on local public utilities governance suggesting possible agency theory developments by focusing on different forms of citizens' participation (e.g., co-production).

Although much has been written about creative accounting we can see repeated processes and financial crisis in which allegations are directed toward professional accountants. These practices are considered as distort reported financial statements and basic aims of accounting regulation. The objective of this paper is to highlight aspects regarding creative accounting, connecting this issue with the corporate governance and motivational theories context. In order to achieve this aim our research includes two stages. First consisted in finding information about creative accounting, our start point being the context of the international scandals. The second stage consisted in making an introduction to the theory of agency. The utility of such research contributes to the insurance of the premises for the development of future research, looking to test the reaction of the professional accountants in our country, regarding the phenomenon of creative accounting.

An agency theory perspective is adopted to explain the high levels of non-compliance with recommendations concerning board structure of the Australian Stock Exchange's (ASX) Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations. The study compares groups of compliers and non-compliers drawn from members of the ASX All Ordinaries Index. The results indicate that, in the presence of mitigating factors such as less complexity, higher levels of managerial ownership of equity and higher ownership concentration, entities are less likely to comply with the recommendations on board independence. The results suggest that the compliance decision might be influenced by mitigating factors that reduce the need for board independence.

Combining insights from the agency theory and sociopolitical perspectives, this study examines the extent to which factors such as ownership structure, CEO power, and firm performance influence firms' adoption of board independent reform advocated by shareholder activists. Event history analysis using extensive data on 1083 Standard & Poor's 1500 companies from January 2002 to December 2004 shows that firms with more powerful CEO were less likely to adopt supermajority-independent boards, while both poorly performing firms and large firms were more likely to adopt such board structure. We also find that higher institutional blockholder ownership increased the likelihood of the adoption in firms managed by less powerful CEOs, while external non-institutional blockholder ownership decreased the likelihood of the adoption.

This paper discusses the role of short sellers and the concerns which are expressed in the news media about their activities. In particular, it examines the problem of optimism in analysts' forecasts which might initially lead to 'high' share prices and the limitations of both agency and stakeholder theory in providing short sellers with a legitimate role. With the help of the existing empirical literature, we argue that short sellers can be regarded as carrying out a useful information function in financial markets. Indeed, encouraging short sellers to operate more effectively in the market as well as requiring fuller disclosure of their activities could provide a useful antidote to some of the share price rises which have been seen in recent years in failing companies.

Corporate governance is a set of practices and processes of board and executives coordination and control that aims at protecting the interests of shareholders and others affected by the value of the company. The discussions and disputes involving shareholders in Brazil and a new corporate law aimed at improving governance practices in the country, reducing the cost of capital of the company and contributing to national economic growth. In this study, we compared the theoretical evidence on the governance structure of airlines with the reality of a large company in the sector in Brazil. The results indicate that a wrong architecture of ownership and control combined with the non-corporate governance system may result in financial distress for an organization.

In 1995, the federal government started five pilot Franchise Funds (FF), to study their feasibility for improving productivity through the introduction of competition, and capitalizing on specialization and economy of size. This chapter describes the current approach to the use of FF. It suggests that the relationship between the FF and those that contract them for service resemble what economists call "principal-agent relations" and what they study as "agency theory." The chapter concludes that the vast research on agency relations may help the development of a theory or a conceptual framework for studying and managing FF and contracts with them.

Many claim that direct market competition is the key to achieving high levels of performance in the public and private sectors. In the public sector, products and services are not subject to direct market competition. With the new entrepreneurial environment, managers in the public sector now are being asked to consider replacing their traditional production and service models with new models that make use of contracts. These arrangements-based on the claim that free competition yields optimal performance- are problematic because this market competition has not been tested yet within the theoretical frameworks of neo-institutional economics, thereby neglecting the transactional costs and economic reality. The principal-agent perspective can provide a better understanding and improved application of utilizing contracts. The insights from this perspective, used effectively, can help reduce the dysfunctions associated with performance measurement, use of incentives, and hiring. As affirmed in a factual case study, contractual relationships present significant and serious managerial implications: managers who gain the latitude to contract also acquire a new source of power and the ability to substitute their own interests for the interests of other stakeholders.

The business and public policy arena began a paradigm shift towards more competition and efficiency about 1980. The lure of innovation, creativity and more freedom captured our spirit. Deregulation, privatization, contracting out, franchising, reengineering and reinventing followed. Entrepreneurial management was thriving. Along the way dysfunctions of excessive competition and efficiency became increasingly apparent. In the world of business, public policy and finance, we had to deal with the savings and loan crisis which many argue cost taxpayers $500 B. Then came: Enron, Andersen, Worldcom, Tyco, Global Crossing, Qwest, Adelphia and more. Increasing standards have been applied to control these problems, such as new legislation like Sarbanes-Oxley and McCain Feingold, and legal actions like those of Elliot Spitzer in New York and Attorneys General in other states as well. Our seeming passion to save a few dollars with efficiency management led to overuse of under trained Argenbright and Wackenhut security screeners at airports contributing in part to the terrorism disaster of 9-11. Implementing more effectiveness and collaboration oriented organizations to enhance security and safety was realized with the development of the Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. FEMA's collapse with Hurricane Katrina is an example of abandoning the effectiveness and collaboration emphases that had made FEMA a strong organization not long before. Overemphasizing efficiency at the time of Katrina became a model for organizational collapse. The authors in the first edition of this book were contacted and given an opportunity to update their material or decline to be included in the second edition. They all reviewed and modified their material as appropriate. Several new authors and their manuscripts were also added. This second edition has changes by the following. Al Hyde and Dorothy Olshfski have a chapter on Service Quality in the Internet Economy. Linda de Leon has added Enron, Andersen and similar cases to her Ethics and Entrepreneurship chapter. Arie Halachmi has substantially increased his chapter on Agency Theory and Transaction Analysis. And Bill Waugh has updated his chapter dealing with perceptions of evil from hurricanes to his chapter dealing with university governance. Van Johnston and Claire-Lauren Shultz have a new chapter on Hurricane Katrina and FEMA. Chapters on Entrepreneurial Budgeting, Information Technology and Reinventing Government by Tom Lynch with his colleagues Peter Cruz and Cynthia Lynch; and on Privatization by Paul Seidenstat; And on Optimizing Productivity through Privatization and Entrepreneurial Management by Johnston remain much as they were, and provide a solid base for the rest of the book. An addition that brings a new dimension to the book is a chapter on The Greening of Industry Through Government Supervised Self Regulation by Dan Mazmanian and Daniel Press. Dan Mazmanian is the current President of NASPAA and the Bedrosian Chair in Governance at the University of Southern California. He is also the former Dean of the School of Policy, Planning and Development at USC. Daniel Press is Professor and Chair of Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz. The Second Edition of ENTREPRENEURIAL MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY also has a new Part IV featuring a new chapter by Wendy Haynes, President of the American society for Public Administration, and her colleague Robert Wright. Haynes and Wright use the new Entrepreneurial Management and Public Policy Integrative Model developed for this edition of the book for an extraordinary analysis of the development of the Department of Homeland Security. In the final chapter, Johnston develops the integrative Entrepreneurial Management and Public Policy Model and applies it to: NASA (the Challenger and Columbia disasters; Terrorism (1993 World Trade Center attack and the 9-11 disaster); business, public policy and finance (the S & L Bailout and the Enron, Andersen et al financial ethics collapse; and FEMA (the Northridge Earthquake and Hurricane Katrina). The Model is then adjusted to demonstrate how moving from extreme efficiency towards more effectiveness, and from extreme competition towards more collaboration can provide more professional and more productive organizational performance in the 21st century.

There is a world trend to reinforce the regulation of financial markets and of public sector enterprises, as a means to protect the interests of the principal. One way to reduce investor exposure is to improve corporate governance practices in businesses which use public funds. This article analyses the following questions in the light of the agency theory: Will best corporate government practices protect investors? Are there differences in the short and long term? Does regulation designed to improve corporate government help to improve and capital structure? In the long- and short-term in the Mexican financial market, and globalization, privileged information and convergence between Mexican businesses and their foreign counterparts seem to have an influence on risk and yield.

Family business researchers and practitioners have long been confused about the way of governing family managers in family firms, especially those under the influence of Chinese family culture. Agency theorists assume a self-interested nature of family managers and suggest imposing control mechanisms on them to improve performance. Stewardship theorists, however, believe a self-actualizing nature of family managers and argue against the use of control mechanisms. Based on a sample of 186 family businesses in China, this study investigates their ways of controlling family managers, and the effects of control mechanisms on firms' performance. Our results indicate that family business owners in China adopt a series of control mechanisms on their family managers, and obtain higher performance by doing so. The findings empirically validate the assumptions of agency theory in the context of Chinese family business, thus suggesting the existence of agency relationship between Chinese family business owners and their family managers.

In this article, we examine the empirical association between corporate governance (CG) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement by investigating their causal effects. Employing a large and extensive US sample, we first find that while the lag of CSR does not affect CG variables, the lag of CG variables positively affects firms' CSR engagement, after controlling for various firm characteristics. In addition, to examine the relative importance of stakeholder theory and agency theory regarding the associations among CSR, CG, and corporate financial performance (CFP), we also examine the relation between CSR and CFP. After correcting for endogeneity bias, our results show that CSR engagement positively influences CFP, supporting the conflict-resolution hypothesis based on stakeholder theory, but not the CSR overinvestment argument based on agency theory. Furthermore, firms' CSR engagement with the community, environment, diversity, and employees plays a significantly positive role in enhancing CFP. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The present work summarizes the theoretical foundations and empirical findings regarding the relation between family involvement and firm performance. From a theory-based perspective we integrate evolutionary psychology and agency theory and describe how conflicting predictions can be made regarding the relation between family involvement and firm performance. Similarly, we describe how the empirical landscape is equally conflicted. Findings from this meta-analysis summarize the observed effects from multiple studies and provide an estimate of the relation across the entire population. Results illustrated that family involvement did not significantly impact firms' financial performance (r= .006). Based on these data, there is no relation between family involvement and a firm's financial performance. Furthermore, we examined multiple conceptual and methodologically-based potential moderating influences-none was statistically significant. Overall, these findings provide the foundation for multiple new areas of inquiry as the domain of family business studies evolves. Moving forward, we advise future research in this area to search for additional moderator effects and explore the defining characteristics, other than performance, that make family businesses distinct from non-family businesses.

We build on a stakeholder-agency theoretical perspective to explore the impact of particular corporate governance mechanisms on firm environmental performance. Our empirical evidence shows that several important corporate governance mechanisms such as the board of directors, managerial incentives, the market for corporate control, and the legal and regulatory system determine firms' environmental performance levels. These results suggest that these different governance mechanisms resolve, to some extent, the existing divergence of interests between stakeholders and managers with respect to environmental activities.

We challenge critics of agency theory who suggest that agency theory's value does not extend outside a narrow context dominated by egocentric agents seeking only to maximize wealth at the expense of the principal. Instead, we argue that agency theory's flexibility allows for its application to a variety of non-traditional settings where the key elements of agency theory, such as self-interest, information asymmetry, and the mechanisms used to control agency costs can vary beyond the narrow assumptions implied in traditional agency-based research. We suggest that extending agency theory to diverse settings using a deductive approach can be accomplished by formally recognizing and incorporating the institutional context surrounding principal-agent (P-A) relations into agency-based models. Thus, criticisms that agency theory fails to acknowledge the social context in which P-A relations occur provides not a barrier but an opportunity for extending our understanding of P-A relations to a variety of diverse contexts.

Most research linking compensation to strategy relies on agency theory economics and focuses on executive pay. We instead focus on the strategic compensation of nonexecutive employees, arguing that while agency theory provides a useful framework for analyzing compensation, it fails to consider several psychological factors that increase costs from performance-based pay. We examine how psychological costs from social comparison and overconfidence reduce the efficacy of individual performance-based compensation, building a theoretical framework predicting more prominent use of team-based, seniority-based, and flatter compensation. We argue that compensation is strategic not only in motivating and attracting the worker being compensated but also in its impact on peer workers and the firm's complementary activities. The paper discusses empirical implications and possible theoretical extensions of the proposed integrated theory. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Grounded in agency theory, this study examines how franchisors' ex ante contracts and extracontractual incentives influence their ex post monitoring and enforcement efforts and how combinations of the ex post governance mechanisms drive franchisee behavior. Integrating three archival data sources and a survey of 206 franchisees across eight automotive brands, the authors find that franchisor reliance on contractual completeness appears to result in reduced ex post behavior monitoring and enforcement efforts, while contractual one-sidedness is associated with higher levels of behavior monitoring but reduced enforcement. Extracontractual incentives, when offered to the franchisee, are associated with increases in monitoring and enforcement. In isolation, franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts are ineffective in eliciting desired franchisee behaviors. However, different combinations of franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts affect franchisee compliance and opportunism, sometimes with counterproductive results. The study provides an initial baseline of understanding on how ex ante governance characteristics and combinations of ex post governance mechanisms function to facilitate or deter franchisee compliance and opportunism.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the influence of firms' ownership structure on their technological innovation performance. First, we have examined whether ownership concentration positively influences technological innovation performance. Then we have investigated the primary reasons for the results derived from the first stage of our analysis by circumstantially exploring the impacts of four different ownership types. Research Findings/Insights: Using five sets of cross-sectional data, consisting of 301 Korean firms, we found that ownership concentration does not have a significant effect on firm technological innovation performance. However, some ownership types (e.g., institutional and foreign) do have a positive effect. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Drawing on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective, our paper is the first to consider a comprehensive treatment of the effect of ownership types on innovation in an emerging country, in particular in contrast to previous studies that have focused on advanced economies. Since only partial predictions suggested by agency and resource dependence perspectives were supported, it appears that neither theory adequately captures the ownership-technological innovation performance relationship. Thus, we suggest that future research should explore the question through a different theoretical lens to better understand the impact of ownership types. We suggest that transaction cost economics can be another path to approach the phenomenon. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that managers should recognize how each characteristic of ownership structure (types) influences the building of firm-specific capabilities for innovation. Policy makers and managers should be aware of the impact of the complete range of ownership types on technological innovation performance when they implement corporate governance reform with greater effectiveness. It also suggests that successful technological catch-up and innovation not only require policies for upgrading technology capabilities, but also the setting up of a suitable supporting ownership structure that favors innovation of firms in emerging countries. We suggest that successful technological catch-up and innovation require a supporting ownership structure. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: The paper aims to explain how agency theory can be used to inform our understanding of the dynamics surrounding supply chain behaviours and relationships. Design/methodology/approach: A structured review of the literature using a three-stage refinement process is used. The articles were sourced through online databases and keyword classifications, such as "agency theory", "principal-agent relationships" and "supply chain management". The search initially identified over 86 articles. After further screening these were reduced to 19 for final assessment and comparison. Findings: Despite agency theory's prevailing descriptive and predictive qualities there is scarcity in its application to the SCM discipline. The authors posit that agency theory provides valuable insights for relationship engineering within supply chains where social, political, legal and behavioural dynamics dominate. Practical implications: It is a critical task for managers to understand and mitigate abnormal behaviours across the supply chain. Agency theory serves this need by providing them with a useful tool to respond to transaction cost dilemmas through contractual and non-contractual remedies. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies that examines the current state of agency theory application in the SCM literature and suggests potential avenues for future research.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Questions: This study investigates the determination of Chinese CEO pay. We focus on three related questions: (1) Is Chinese CEO pay related to firm performance? (2) Are CEO pay dynamics important? (3) Does corporate governance affect CEO pay and equity incentives in China? Research Findings: Using data on CEO compensation in China's public traded firms from 2000 to 2010, we document significant changes in CEO pay, ownership and board structure. We document that CEO pay is positively correlated to both accounting and stock market performance, although the link to accounting performance is more robust. We find that CEO pay dynamics are important as pay in the current year is significantly positively correlated to CEO pay the previous year. We also find that CEO equity ownership and equity grants are influenced by board and ownership structure. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study supplements the standard agency theory approach to executive compensation with insights gained from the dynamics of wage setting theory developed in the labor economics field. It predicts that incomplete information and learning lead to adjustment costs and non-instantaneous changes in CEO pay. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in enhancing the design of executive compensation and internal corporate governance within transition economies.

Purpose: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, the study aims to link board demographic diversity and independence to corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from various sources for a sample of 475 publicly traded Fortune 500 companies between the years 2007 and 2008. Findings: It is found that board gender diversity is positively related to institutional and technical strength ratings, while board racial diversity is positively related to institutional strength rating only. Both the proportion of outside directors and CEO non-duality were negatively associated with institutional and technical weakness ratings. Research limitations/implications: The sample was predominantly large, publicly traded national and international corporations, which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Management personnel should be cognizant of how board configurations and leadership structure may influence their corporate reputation for social responsibility. Efforts should be made to foster a group dynamic that is conducive to effective board functioning. Originality/value: Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between board characteristics and corporate social performance. This study contributes to the literature by examining such associations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is two-fold: to examine two approaches buying firms can utilize to manage supplier quality; and to investigate the ways in which factors inherent in supply chain relationships affect the use of these approaches in supply chain quality management. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on agency theory, this paper proposes a conceptual framework that relates the underlying factors of a supply chain relationship to the use of quality management approaches. Two types of approaches, outcome-based and behavior-based, are discussed in terms of their focuses, purposes, and methods. Propositions are developed about the effects of these factors on the decisions buying firms make about supply chain quality management. Findings: This study suggests that rather than relying on one generic supply chain quality management approach for all suppliers, firms need to choose different management mechanisms for different suppliers based on the salient attributes of individual suppliers and their relationships with the buyers. Five types of agency-based factors are discussed. These factors - information asymmetry, goal conflict, risk aversion of suppliers, length of relationship, and task characteristics - can be expected to influence how firms design and manage their quality management systems for supply chains. Practical implications: A better understanding of the distinction between outcome-based and behavior-based approaches helps managers evaluate which approach is best suited to managing the quality of their suppliers. The propositions pertaining to the key factors provide managers with some guidelines about the critical conditions they should consider when building their firm's supply chain quality management system. Originality/value: Having an effective quality management system of a supply chain is essential for maintaining a smooth supply of high quality products and services to customers. However, little is known about how a firm should design this supply chain quality management system. The paper addresses this gap by applying agency theory to examine the two essential approaches to managing supplier quality and to explore the critical factors that should be taken into account when considering the appropriate approaches for different suppliers.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the issue of forced CEO turnover in China and summarizes the economic consequences of political connections within the framework of corporate governance. Research Findings/Insights: Using a large sample of listed firms in China from 2005 to 2008, we find that politically connected CEOs are less likely to be fired and that the sensitivity of forced turnover to firm performance is weaker for connected CEOs than for their non-connected peers. This suggests that CEOs in a transition economy tend to use their political resources for their own good. We also find a significantly positive relationship between the political connections of retained CEOs and future firm performance only when firm profitability is below the industry median. These findings suggest that the value of political connections is contingent on a firm's operating performance, and that the benefits of political connections may outweigh their costs when firms do not meet their profitability targets. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study is the first to examine how the political ties of CEOs relate to their forced turnover. It integrates agency theory with resource dependence theory and contributes to the ongoing debate on the role of political connections in emerging markets. It also takes a step toward reconciling the mixed evidence for the effects of political connections on firm performance by demonstrating a sharp difference between firms under different operating statuses. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers who are interested in improving corporate governance in transitional economies such as China, where CEOs have close connections with the government. It also provides a deep perspective for the boards in politically connected firms, allowing them to deal with the relationship between top management and the government in a healthy way.

The prevalence of ownership concentration in Asian firms presents a challenge to the influential agency theory-based understanding of the role of corporate boards. In this paper we develop and test hypotheses about board attributes and firm performance that reflect Asian institutional conditions. We present the first meta-analysis of the relationship between board attributes and performance of Asian firms using a varied set of meta-analytical techniques on a database of 86 studies covering nine Asian countries. First, we find that board structure and composition preferences are influenced by the identity of the concentrated owner. Second, consistent with US data, we find very limited evidence of a direct relationship between board attributes and firm financial performance in the Asian context. Third, we find that the relationship between board structure and composition and firm performance is mediated by the revealed strategic preferences of Asian firms specifically by the level of R&D investment.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: In this paper we discuss three assumptions of agency theory: (1) conflicts of interest between principal and agent, (2) nature of risk, and (3) the proposed internal mechanisms to reduce agency costs. We review criticisms of agency theory's pessimistic assumptions of human behavior and its simplistic view about individual risk preferences to argue how the context may influence both the interest and mechanisms for aligning interest of principals and agents. Research Findings/Insights: We draw on alternative theoretical perspectives from behavioral and organizational sciences to describe circumstances under which honesty, loyalty, and trust in agents' behaviors are possible and also the development of cooperative rather than contentious relationships. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study explores the boundary conditions of traditional agency theory in the hope of extending agency theory outside its current contextual boundaries. In doing so, we provide a more robust and exhaustive view of the economic exchange between principals and agents. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to managers about how intrinsic incentives may provide an alternative mechanism of control over agents' behavior to extrinsic incentives prescribed by traditional agency theory. Indeed, intrinsic incentives of personal satisfaction and identification with organizational objects, combined with implicit social obligations and reciprocity may, under certain circumstances, provide stronger restraints on agent opportunism than the use of traditional extrinsic rewards in the form of incentive alignment.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We investigate how ownership structure, board characteristics, and regional differences in law enforcement and stock market development affect the conflict of interest between majority and minority investors in Chinese listed firms. For this purpose, we study related-party transactions as well as labor redundancy, and classify firms as either state- or private-controlled. Research Findings/Insights: We find that related-party transactions grow more extensive as the wedge between the controlling shareholder's control rights and cash flow rights increases. Related-party transactions also rise with voting rights held by the government in state-controlled firms. Next, the state as controlling shareholder exacerbates labor redundancy. The control rights of the second to tenth largest investors can offset expropriation. Regarding board characteristics, we find that a larger fraction of directors affiliated with the dominant owner enlarges related-party transactions, while large boards also increase labor redundancy in state-controlled firms. We find only weak evidence that higher-quality institutions help to restrain expropriation of minority investors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: In Chinese listed firms, a major conflict of interest arises between majority and minority investors. Also, the state may exercise its control rights to achieve imperative social and political objectives, to the detriment of external investors. Yet, as the stock market valuation and financial performance of state-controlled firms rise with the fraction of shares held by the state, future research should better delineate the conditions under which state ownership is either detrimental or beneficial to firms. Next, the results indicate that governance mechanisms suggested by conventional agency theory are deficient in Chinese listed firms. Future research could therefore establish more clearly when internal and external governance mechanisms are likely to work, thereby also taking into account the identity of the controlling shareholder. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Investors should be aware that expropriation in Chinese listed firms has specific implications when the state is the controlling owner. Also, at this stage of development, independent directors and external governance mechanisms can hardly protect the best interests of minority investors. Rather, expropriation is counterbalanced when voting rights are concentrated in the hands of other large block holders. Policy makers should work on ownership restructuring, board independence, and institutional quality to better protect minority rights in Chinese listed firms. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

We offer an institution-based view to the classic inquiry on the relationship between family business and firm performance, which has been dominated by traditional theories such as agency theory and the resource-based view. Specifically, we argue that institutions define family business characteristics such as ownership concentration and family management, and also affect the performance of family business. Our research contributes to a reconciliation of prior inconsistent findings and calls further attention to the embedded nature of family business in institutions.

Grounded in agency theory, this study explores how capital structure is influenced by aggregate corporate governance quality. We measure governance quality using broad-based comprehensive governance metrics provided by the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). The empirical evidence reveals a robust inverse association between leverage and governance quality. Firms with poor governance are significantly more leveraged. It appears that leverage substitutes for corporate governance in alleviating agency conflicts. Further, we utilize empirical methods that control for endogeneity and show that poor governance quality likely brings about, and does not merely reflect, higher leverage. Our results are important as they show that the overall quality of corporate governance has a material impact on critical corporate decisions such as capital structure choices. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: To what extent can group faultlines and their potential value-destroying effects be detected on corporate boards? Task-related attributes of the type of directorship, education, board tenure, and financial background of board members are considered as directors' characteristics that give rise to the faultline phenomenon. The impact of task-related faultlines on firm performance as well as the moderating effects of busy boards, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) tenure, executive directors' (EDs) compensation structure, and the average non-executive directors' (NEDs) involvement in board committees are examined. Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel of FTSE 350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find a strong negative effect of task-related faultlines on firm performance. Further exploration of the moderating effects demonstrates that the condition of a busy board and CEO tenure exacerbate the negative effects of faultlines. At the same time, the executive pay contingency is found to have a remedying effect on boardroom cohesiveness, whereas the involvement of NEDs in board committee work is not likely to make the adverse effects of board faultlines less pronounced. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the arguments of social identity theory, this study shows that task-related faultlines on corporate boards have strong negative value-creating implications. The positive moderating impact of the executive compensation structure renders support to agency theory predictions about executive incentive alignment. This work also underlines the usefulness of the concept of faultlines in the corporate governance literature, because unitary boards, where NEDs and EDs share board responsibility, exhibit pre-existing factions, similar to top management teams of family-controlled firms and teams managing international joint-ventures. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This research points to the importance of a careful selection process of directors by nomination committees. It also underlines the role for active leadership on boards, who should be aware of available strategies to ameliorate the negative consequences of board schisms, such as accentuating superordinate board identity and/ or informal meetings.

Corporate governance research indicates that corporate boards of directors may be overly beholden to management, which can be detrimental to firm value creation. Drawing upon agency theory and the governance law literature, we examine the effects of a new SEC rule designed to lessen managerial power by increasing large, long-term shareholders' influence in the director nomination process. We predict and find support for a positive overall market reaction to the rule's announcement as well as a greater reaction for firms with characteristics that suggest compromised board independence or greater CEO control. Moreover, we examine the implications of greater shareholder voice for another key stakeholder group, firm bondholders, and find evidence that it is also value increasing. We conclude by discussing important implications for theory and practice. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Plural forms exist when managers use two owners to perform one activity. Franchising is a plural form explained by agency theory, however, the theory is unable to explain two franchisor actions: 1) allowing franchisees to own multiple outlets and 2) co-locating company-owned and franchised outlets. We use research that describes a symbiosis between company-owned and franchised outlets to extend agency theory and explain these actions. Our investigation of ownership patterns among 4,339 outlets of 16 plural form franchisors is consistent with our theory that multi-outlet franchising is cost efficient and that co-location occurs when franchisors fill market gaps left by franchisees.

The paper contributes to research on sustainability in dyadic buyer-supplier relationships of logistics services. It presents deeper knowledge on why and how suppliers choose to behave sustainably. The research analyzes how shippers stimulate their LSPs and how LSPs respond by conducting sustainability activities. Agency theory and the stimulus-organism-response model are applied as the theoretical foundations for an explorative case study analysis of three large and five small and medium-sized European logistics service providers (LSPs) active in road transport services. Significant differences are found between the sustainability efforts of SMEs and large LSPs and a tentative taxonomy of the sustainability response types of LSPs is derived. The taxonomy contributes to theory-guided research in sustainable supply chain management and procurement. Thereby, mismatches of stimuli and responses are identified and related agency problems in dyadic relationships in terms of sustainability are discussed. From a managerial point of view, the findings may serve as a starting point for purchasers of logistics services to develop adequate sustainability selection criteria and incentives.

This study investigates the role of ownership and control structure of firms when determining their cash holdings and focuses mainly on the association between excess control rights and cash holdings. Using a sample of Taiwanese publicly listed companies from 1997 to 2009, this study shows that the relationship between excess control rights and cash holdings depends on each firm's characteristics in terms of quantile regression. Fewer excess control rights affect cash holdings positively in low cash holding firms but negatively in high cash holding firms. Additional analysis reveals that when a family member serves as the CEO in low cash holding firms, the amount of cash holding is greater than if the CEO is an outsider. However, family members holding the position of CEO affect cash holdings negatively in high cash holding firms. These results suggest that firms with less cash holdings stockpile more cash reserves to take advantage of investment opportunities. The objective of corporate governance for firms with more cash reserves is to ensure that firms decrease levels of cash to avoid agency problems. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the relevance of currently accepted best practice recommendations regarding board structure on the survival likelihood of new economy initial public offering companies. We argue that industry context determines governance outcomes. Research Findings/Insights: We study 125 Australian new economy firms listed between 1994 and 2002. Each firm is tracked until the end of 2007 for monitoring their survival. We find that board independence is associated with an increase in the likelihood of corporate survival. We also find that the benefits of board independence increase at a decreasing rate. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The standard best practice recommendation of board independence stems from the monitoring role of directors and is based on agency theory. The results from our study suggest that the recommendation regarding board independence does not work well for new economy firms. While the agency theory based model implies a monotonic relation between board independence and performance, our research suggests that the relationship is nonlinear. This variation occurs because of increased monitoring costs faced by outsiders due to higher information asymmetry and complexity of new economy firms. Our empirical results suggest that inside directors play a complementary role to outsiders in mitigating firm failure. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research offers insights to policy makers who are interested in setting best practice standards regarding board structure. Our research suggests that firm/industry characteristics play a crucial role in determining the optimal board structure. In firms/industries where outsiders face significantly higher information processing costs, insiders can play a valuable complementary role to outsiders in enhancing the effectiveness of the board. Thus future hard or soft regulations related to board structure should consider industry context. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

How do managers react in an environment where bribery is likely to bring high rewards, but also presents high risks? We examine the supply side (firms' illicit payments) of bribery in a global setting, using the United Nations' (UN) Oil-for-Food Program, part of UN sanctions on Iraq. Some companies helped Iraq circumvent UN sanctions through bribe payments in the form of illicit surcharges. Our transaction-level analysis of factors affecting bribe payments draws on the economic theory of crime, agency theory, and home country institutions. Results suggest that firms pay larger bribes when there are stronger financial and managerial incentives, but pay less when their home countries have implemented the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. We find little relationship between a widely used country-level corruption perception index and firms' actual bribery. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Although research on corporate entrepreneurship (CE) has attracted increasing attention, risks of CE are not well examined. In this paper, we examine direct and indirect agency risks associated with providing middle and operational managers with autonomy in the hopes of encouraging CE. The key ideas behind our discussion involve two dilemmas of CE. (1) To solve the risk-averseness problem of middle and operational managers and unleash their entrepreneurial ideas, top management needs to encourage autonomous behaviors, which can also exacerbate a different type of agency problem: opportunistic behaviors. (2) Although the generation of new ideas to explore new strategic directions and/or opportunities is important, the very newness of the ideas make them difficult to evaluate, and thus the selection process may be perceived as unfair by some managers. We propose that (a) stock options, (b) passive monitoring, and (c) perceived procedural justice would attenuate the negative side effects associated with CE, such as opportunistic behaviors and perceived unfairness. Although research in CE often stresses autonomy of middle and operational managers for new idea generation as important, examining the whole process in terms of idea generation, selection, and implementation with respect to potential risks will extend the CE literature.

We use agency theory to investigate the influence of CEO dominance on variation in capital structure. Due to agency conflicts, managers may not always adopt leverage choices that maximize shareholders' value. Consistent with the prediction of agency theory, the evidence reveals that, when the CEO plays a more dominant role among top executives, the firm adopts significantly lower leverage, probably to evade the disciplinary mechanisms associated with debt financing. Our results are important as they demonstrate that CEO power matters to critical corporate outcomes such as capital structure decisions. In addition, we find that the impact of changes in capital structure on firm performance is more negative for firms with more powerful CEOs. Overall, the results are in agreement with prior literature, suggesting that strong CEO dominance appears to exacerbate agency costs and is thus detrimental to firm value.

Corporate political activity (CPA) represents a strategy whereby firms attempt to influence government policymaking, to advance their strategic goals; firm owners may benefit from it. However, other research indicates that CPA is uncertain and increases information asymmetries between owners and managers. Hence, this study avoids the assumption that owners and managers have similar views regarding CPA and focuses on the relationship between institutional investors, large investors' ownership and investors' portfolio characteristics on firm CPA. The results reveal that institutional ownership is associated with reduced CPA among S&P 500 firms across five election cycles, but that investors' portfolio concentration is associated with increased CPA. The implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Researchers in international business have long been interested in understanding the impact of internationalization on performance and innovation. However, prior studies of this research stream offer mixed results. This study contributes to this research stream by employing agency theory to investigate how ownership concentration affects the performance and innovation implications of internationalization. Specifically, we examine two primary effects of ownership concentration: the incentive alignment effect, proxied by the controlling shareholder's cash flow rights, and the entrenchment effect, proxied by the divergence between control rights and cash flow rights of the controlling shareholder. Based on a sample of Taiwan's publicly listed firms, we find that the incentive alignment effect moderates the relation between internationalization and performance and innovation positively and the entrenchment effect moderates the relation negatively. These findings shed light on the mixed results of the literature. In addition, most countries outside the United States and the United Kingdom have high ownership concentration; therefore, our results may be generalizable to other settings, providing insight into the role of corporate governance in internationalization.

Recent perspectives on community investments suggest that they are opportunities for firms to create value for shareholders and other stakeholders. However, many corporate managers are still influenced by a widely held belief that such investments erode profits and are therefore unjustifiable from an agency perspective. In this paper, we refine and test theory regarding countervailing forces that influence community-based firm performance. We hypothesize that high levels of available slack will be associated with higher community-based performance, but that this relationship will be moderated by three important governance variables: board independence, investment fund ownership, and CEO ownership. We find support for our hypotheses in longitudinal study of a large sample of U. S. corporations. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This study draws on agency and stewardship theory to evaluate the relationship between alternative governance regimes (founder versus non-founder CEO) adopted at the time of going public on post-IPO economic outcomes in the market for corporate control. We find that the presence of founder CEOs reduces the likelihood of post-IPO change of control but enhances target IPO firm wealth by increasing acquisition premiums. Additionally, we examine whether measures of CEO power over the board moderate the relationship between founder management and target IPO firm wealth. Our results suggest that CEO duality is the most effective instrument of CEO power available to founder CEOs to positively influence target firm wealth. Further, we find that while founder CEOs utilize power derived from CEO duality to increase acquisition premiums, non-founder CEOs use board leadership power to expropriate shareholder wealth.

This paper examines venture capital (VC) governance in innovation processes. The VC literature often presents the relationship between a VC firm and a start-up as dyadic and analyzes it with agency theory. In contrast, this paper deploys the resource interaction framework presented in Hakansson and Waluszewski (2002) to governance and innovation in networks. The paper reports an in-depth case study of Pyrosequencing, a Swedish biotech firm financed with VC. The results from this study reveal how the relationship between a VC and a start-up company is embedded in a wider network and how the governance of the VC spreads in the surrounding network and influences a start-up's possibilities to develop organizational and technical resource interfaces to critical counterparts such as suppliers and customers.

We investigated the effect of financial incentives on performance in a professional organization. Whereas agency theory treats tangible rewards such as money as a potentially powerful motivator for improving performance, the professional control perspective posits that the motivational effects of financial incentives will depend on the intended recipients attitudes toward the incentives relative to their professional values. The study setting was a large network of physician practices that adopted a financial incentive program to improve physician performance in the management of diabetic patients. Consistent with agency theory, performance did improve following the introduction of the incentive. However, consistent with the professional control perspective, physicians' psychologically based attitudes toward the incentive program regarding its impact on their own work autonomy and the importance of the performance goals moderated the effect of the incentive on performance. Study findings indicate that agency theory and professional control are complementary theoretical perspectives for understanding how professionals will respond to the imposition of performance-related financial incentives. In terms of practice, pay-for-performance programs aimed at professional organizations should be designed to take into account the values and goals of an organization's professionals to maximize the effect of financial incentives on performance.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to critically rethink the concepts and the theoretical foundations of IT governance in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on multiple case studies. In total, eight cases of outsourced information system projects where failures occurred were selected. An outsourced information system failure (OISF) is suggested as a failure of governance of the IT in a SME environment. A structure for stating propositions derived from two competing theories is proposed (Agency Theory and Theory of Trust). Findings - The results reveal that trust is slightly more important than control issues such as output-based contracts and structured controls in the governance of IT in SMEs. Practical implications - The world of SMEs is significantly different from that of large companies, and therefore, the concept of IT governance in SMEs needs reconsideration. For researchers and practitioners, it would be more meaningful to focus on actual, working SMEs instead of on a version of their activities derived from those of large companies. Originality/value - The paper offers two contributions. First, it elaborates the limited research on IT in SMEs and second, it brings theoretical foundations for their IT governance. The value of IT governance in SMEs is explained. (c) 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Research to date has identified CEO pay structure as an important factor in the environmental and social performance of the organization but has not considered how pay may influence these sustainability efforts at the middle-management level. We address this void with an experimental manipulation of direct and indirect pay incentives for an environmental sustainability project and production cost savings project. Counter to our predictions, investment in sustainability versus cost savings is significantly lower when incentives for both projects are equivalent, and investment is only comparable when incentives for the sustainability project are superior. Further investigation using qualitative data attributes this to differences in the salient social norms that individuals hold and an apparent undervaluing of the indirect incentive derived through sustainability's contribution to cost savings. The results shed light on primary ways in which human resource management practices may be used to embed support for sustainability initiatives throughout the organization.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether corporate governance plays a role in influencing a firm's choice of financing, i.e., equity versus debt. We hypothesize that the likelihood of equity financing increases with governance because of a reduction in agency costs between investors and managers in these firms. While the reduction in agency costs occurs for both equity and debt financing, we argue that there is a more significant effect on equity financing. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of over 2,000 US equity and debt issuances over the period 1998 to 2006, we find that our measures of corporate governance effectiveness have a positive impact on the likelihood of choosing equity compared to debt. This association is more pronounced in small firms where information asymmetry is higher between managers and investors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings refine and extend the pecking order hypothesis, which suggests that firms will issue equity as their last resort because of the high information asymmetry associated with equity financing. We provide some of the first evidence that the pecking order hypothesis can be mitigated by corporate governance. Specifically, we find that the likelihood of issuing equity increases as governance increases. Further, we find that where agency costs due to information asymmetry are greater, the positive impact of governance on the likelihood of equity financing is also greater. That is, in support of agency cost theory, we find that firms facing high agency costs benefit the most from investing in corporate governance mechanisms that lower the agency costs. We are not aware of any prior study, published or unpublished, that has documented this result. Practitioner/Policy Implications: From a practical perspective, our study suggests that firms wishing to access equity capital markets should pay attention to their corporate governance. Specifically, by investing in corporate governance systems, firms facing high agency costs may be able to obtain easier access to not just debt but also equity markets. From a practice standpoint, in the years prior to securing financing, firms should consider making improvements to their governance (e.g., changes to board structure and/or auditor), carefully weighing the costs of making these improvements against the benefits of securing better and cheaper access to equity markets.

We provide a framework for examining the trade-offs between socio-environmental, organizational, and managerial goals. Using this framework we examine management choices under agency and stewardship theories. We advance a theory of social stewardship to explain behavior inconsistent with both agency and stewardship. We illustrate that social stewardship behavior by managers and principals, while best from a societal perspective, is not a viable management approach under current business and regulatory conditions. This conclusion is vital to public policymakers who seek to foster socially desirable behavior by publicly traded companies. (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Family firms without able and willing family successors are frequently sold to non-family managers through management buy-outs (MBOs). Whether MBOs create value is thought to be dependent upon the ability to reduce owner-manager agency costs. In this article we examine the agency costs of MBOs that acquire family firms. We contribute to theory by arguing that in such situations, value creation by reducing agency costs will depend upon pre-MBO agency costs, the ability to solve the double agency problem, and the relationship between the cost of agency control mechanisms and the residual losses from opportunism before and after the MBO.

The comply-or-explain principle is a common feature of corporate governance codes. While prior studies investigated compliance with corporate governance codes as well as the effects of compliance on firm behaviour and performance, explanations for deviations from a corporate governance code remain largely unexamined. This paper intends to fill that gap. The paper draws on the voluntary disclosure literature and agency theory to examine the association between firm characteristics and the informativeness of explanations for deviations from the Dutch corporate governance code. Applying content analysis to corporate governance statements for a sample of Dutch listed firms for the period 2005-2009, the study finds that ownership concentration and number of analysts following the firm are positively associated with informativeness. Furthermore, there is indicative evidence that board strength and informativeness are positively associated. The study also finds a negative association between leverage and informativeness. Institutional investors, however, do not seem to affect this type of disclosure. Taken together, the findings suggest that certain firm characteristics are associated with a firm's choice to provide either generic and uninformative explanations or more firm-specific and informative explanations. On the basis of the study's findings, I argue that firms having weaker boards, firms followed by fewer analysts, firms having more dispersed ownership and firms relying more on debt finance tend to approach comply-or-explain more symbolically than substantively.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We explore the effect of family control on investment-cash flow sensitivity and disentangle the effects of agency problems of free cash flow and asymmetric information. Excess control rights and board independence may moderate the relationship between family control and investment-cash flow sensitivity by changing agency costs. Research Findings/Insights: Family control lessens investment-cash flow sensitivity by mitigating the problem of asymmetric information. Investment-cash flow sensitivity will be higher in family-controlled firms with excess control rights because Type II agency problems predominate. Family control may affect investment-cash flow sensitivity when firms lack independent directors. Having another blockholder in addition to the controlling family reduces the agency problem and improves the independent monitoring function of the board for family-controlled firms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides a better understanding of the relationship between family control and investment-cash flow sensitivity. It delineates the separate effects of agency problems stemming from free cash flow and asymmetric information and demonstrates that excess control rights and board independence can moderate the effect of family control on investment-cash flow sensitivity. We show the significant role another blockholder plays in internal governance mechanisms. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Investors can better gauge firm value by examining the type of company control and linkages between investment distortion and firm value. Policy makers can better understand how excess control and board independence act as mechanisms to worsen or mitigate the effects of family control. Managers can understand the effects of control type and board independence on the firm's financial constraints. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

We use agency theory to explore how analyst coverage is influenced by the managerial entrenchment associated with the staggered board. The evidence suggests that firms with staggered boards attract significantly larger analyst following. We also document that firms with staggered boards experience less information asymmetry. Staggered boards insulate managers from the discipline of the takeover market. Entrenched managers are well-protected by the staggered board and have fewer incentives to conceal information, resulting in less information asymmetry. The more transparent information environment facilitates the analyst's job. As a consequence, more analysts are attracted to firms with staggered boards. We also document the beneficial role of analyst coverage in improving firm value. Our results confirm the notion that analysts, as information intermediaries, provide oversight over management and thus help alleviate agency conflicts. The positive effect of analyst coverage, however, is severely reduced when the firm has a staggered board in place. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Background: Community hospitals in the United States are almost all governed by a governing board that is legally accountable for the quality of care provided. Increasing pressures for better quality and safety are prompting boards to strengthen their oversight function on quality. Purpose: In this study, we aimed to provide an update to prior research by exploring the role and practices of governing boards in quality oversight through the lens of agency theory and comparing hospital quality performance in relation to the adoption of those practices. Methodology: Data on board practices from a survey conducted by The Governance Institute in 2007 were merged with data on hospital quality drawn from two federal sources that measured processes of care and mortality. The study sample includes 445 public and private not-for-profit hospitals. We used factor analysis to explore the underlying dimensions of board practices. We further compared hospital quality performance by the adoption of each individual board practice. Findings: Consistent with the agency theory, the 13 board practices included in the survey appear to center around enhancing accountability of the board, management, and the medical staff. Reviewing the hospital's quality performance on a regular basis was the most common practice. A number of board practices, not examined in prior research, showed significant association with better performance on process of care and/or risk-adjusted mortality: requiring major new clinical programs to meet quality-related criteria, setting some quality goals at the "theoretical ideal" level, requiring both the board and the medical staff to be as involved as management in setting the agenda for discussion on quality, and requiring the hospital to report its quality/safety performance to the general public. Practice Implications: Hospital governing boards should examine their current practices and consider adopting those that would enhance the accountability of the board itself, management, and the medical staff.

Research Question/Issue: What determines venture capitalists influence on the governance of firms? How do venture capitalists shape the governance of their investees? Are venture capitalists governance practices consistent across countries? These important questions are under-investigated in the extant literature. In this study, we shed light on the effects of venture capital investors on a large set of governance decisions and we discover the existence of striking cross-country differences. Research Findings/Insights: We test our conjectures on a unique hand-collected questionnaire-based dataset of 164 companies in five countries and two regions (Europe and the US). Our empirical results show that there is a strong and positive relationship between VCs' funding and their influence on some factors like decisions on CEO hiring, executive compensation, board decisions and appointments. Employee incentives are also positively related to the proportion of VC funding. On the other hand, results show that the proportion of VC funding is only marginally significant in explaining VC influence on strategy direction and investment planning. Our analysis though, offers a remarkably different view after splitting data into European and American subsamples. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results provide a novel view of the functioning of the Venture Capital industry and its degree of pervasiveness in the management of portfolio companies. Adopting a unique dataset, we add new evidence on detailed governance decisions, thus supporting the idea that the incremental contribution of a professional investor to a new venture is largely exceeding the capital infusion only. Finally, we show that governance decisions exhibit significant country effects. This evidence supports the view that a global theory of corporate governance cannot rely on a single interpretation framework such as agency theory, but needs to be integrated with predictions from alternative views such institutional theory. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Corporate governance is the essential mechanism allowing proper management of financial and corporate resources by aligning incentives of employees and investors, thus enabling oversight and control on companies. Yet, corporate governance rules and mechanisms are costly and have different effectiveness across countries. Our results provide guidance to investors in selecting the appropriate set of governance provisions conditional on a set of investment-specific factors. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into efficient entities has been an important approach in transition economies. However, the transition literature reveals little about how control structure affects firm performance of transformed SOEs. Drawing on agency theory, we distinguish three modes of control in transformed SOEs: state-controlled, dispersedly controlled, and privately controlled modes and argue that actual control after transformation plays a critical role in determining performance. Examining the impact of different control modes in China, we find that the key is who controls the transformed firm.

Over the last thirty years, the shareholder conception of corporate governance has established itself as the foundation of the power structure and management principles of the corporation. It is based on a specific theorization of the firm: agency theory. Our aim is to explain the full significance of this theorization, by considering the context in which it was developed and the project - of a fundamentally political nature - that it conveys. For that purpose, we return to the questions raised during the first half of the twentieth century, in the seminal book of Berle and Means and in subsequent works by Berle; questions of a much broader scope that the relationship between shareholders and managers. We will show that agency theory can be considered a response to the most important ideas advanced by Berle and Means, and then by Berle (and others), after the New Deal and the Second World War. Comparison of these two themes of reflection leads us to identify two theorizations, and two radically different conceptions of the firm and the corporation. To address these issues, we start by considering the questions raised in the early twentieth century about the nature of the corporation and the status of managers; and how, in response to these questions, Berle constructed a certain conceptualization of the corporation and of managerial capitalism; we shall then revisit the contract-based approach of Jensen and Meckling, to assess the theoretical and ideological content and show how it was actually strongly opposed to Berle's vision. Lastly, by way of conclusion, we shall endeavor to show how the opposition between these two theorizations should be seen, above all, as an opposition between two theories that are both "performative" rather than positive, and that the apparent success of agency theory and the dominance of shareholder primacy in corporate governance can only be understood in an institutional and political perspective.

This paper attempts to identify the effects of several variables on the international expansion pursued by Spanish service franchise chains. These include: management and franchising experience, brand awareness, the international franchise ratio, and a franchisor's size. Specifically, the study looks at 125 franchisors doing business in 44 foreign countries in late 2009. Findings allow us to conclude that management and franchising experience, together with brand awareness, the international franchise ratio and company size are significantly associated with (i) the number of countries where the chain has a presence; (ii) the number of operational outlets the franchisor has abroad, and (iii) the number of years the chain has been operating overseas.

The aim of this paper is to identify why independent hotels decide to affiliate and give up their highly valued independence. Based on interviews with 12 independently owned hotels and five affiliations active on the Swedish market, it became evident that independence is important, but factors such as development with technical solutions, internet, the use of smart phones, social media, sales and marketing, central purchasing and loyalty cards are difficult to pursue as an independent hotel. The results also showed that marketing organisations and referral chains are the preferred options, as their offerings are more in line with the view of strategic entrepreneurship that the hoteliers expressed. Even agency-related aspects such as control rights affected the entrepreneurs' aspiration to affiliate, at the same time as the respondents thought their way of running the business was the most efficient. The results from the research add to the knowledge associated with agency theory, strategic entrepreneurship and resource-based view of the firm. More practically, it gives the independent hoteliers a possibility to assess the current situation and decide what options could be valuable, while the affiliations would be able to better align their offerings to attract new hotels.

This paper investigates the effect of new governmental regulations on corporate Boards of Directors (BODs). We have reviewed the literature pertaining to agency theory and resource dependency theory, both of which have been assumed to explain the actions of BODs. We examine the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory regarding both the structure and actions of BODs in times of governmental regulatory change. We then describe four historical events in which radical changes were required by certain governmental regulations, and discuss responses by BODs to each event, and present a discussion of these responses and how they adhere to or stray from the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory. We conclude the paper with recommendations for the direction of further study.

Venture capitalists (VCs) increasingly rely on elaborate formal contracts and incentivization through share ownership to manage their relationships with the entrepreneurial firms in which they invest. This study analyses the impact of a high degree of such 'neoclassical contracting' on entrepreneurs' trust in their VC backers. The results from a sample of 86 Dutch entrepreneurial firms indicate not only that a high degree of neoclassical contracting tends to erode entrepreneurs' trust in their VCs, but also that the use of more informal, relational contracting fails to moderate the negative association between a strong focus on neoclassical contracts and trust. However, entrepreneurs do welcome some level of monitoring, which highlights the enduring tension between trust and control, and the need for VCs to strike a productive balance.

The "China concepts stock" in the U.S. has attracted a great deal of attention among international investors due to the fast growth in Chinese economy. This paper examines the aftermarket performance and the motivations to list in the U.S. for Chinese firms over 1993-2010 by considering the great impact of split-share structure reform in China. We find that the Chinese firms in the U.S. generally underperform the benchmark and industry peers in the post-IPO period of 3 years. The Chinese cross-listing ADRs show superior performance relative to the single-listings in the long run. It seems that more stringent listing requirements and accounting standards help to improve the corporate governance and operating performance of the Chinese firms. The evidence also supports that the Chinese issuers are motivated to cross-list in the U.S. due to over-investment incentives, leverage effects or free-cash-flow signaling, which is consistent with agency theory and signaling hypothesis.

We analyze the determinants of capital structure and its choice by small and medium-sized enterprises in Central and Eastern Europe from 2002 to 2007. We test the relevance of the three main theories: the Static Trade-off Theory, the Pecking Order Theory, and the Agency Theory, which have been derived primarily for developed markets, because our knowledge on their validity for emerging European countries is limited. We confirm the positive impact of size and asset tangibility on the leverage, while rejecting both the positive impact of profitability and tax, as well as the negative impact of business risk and non-debt tax shields. We report that SMEs behave homogeneously, and the relevant capital structure determinants show remarkable steadiness. Our results show a special time varying behaviour, in which the relevant determinants become stronger, while most of the country-specific factors present weakening effects. We argue that firms of the CEE countries remarkably converged their financial decision-making procedure to that of developed countries through the investigated period. The relevance of the Trade-off Theory is weak, as firms respect a one-sided upper threshold rather than converging to a fixed target on both sides, while they are not indifferent to the hierarchy of financing alternatives.

Despite the substantial growth of IT investments, evidence on their impact on firm performance remains inconclusive. An important management question is whether anticipated economic benefits of IT investments are being realized. The intangible benefits obtained from IT are not captured by accrual-based accounting measures alone, and, therefore, call for a comprehensive measure that focuses on segments of performance influenced by IT investments. This study proposes a framework that utilizes nonfinancial measures to link IT investments to their intangible benefits and applies the agency theory to examine the contribution of IT investments by tying managerial compensation to firm value.

Making agency theory institutionally sensitive is a reasonable suggestion, as far as normal science stands. However, we argue that such a move has already been taking place, that it cannot address important problems with agency theory, and that the time is ripe for a critical re-examination of this theory. We suggest that inductive studies can not only be more sensitive to institutional features than deductive studies, but they can also offer deeper understanding of governance practices in specific contexts, as well as the potential for analytical or moderatum generalizations. Drawing from legal theory, we offer an alternative conception of the principal, and of the role and status of the board of directors. We contend that this reformulated agency theory has a greater potential of being institutionally sensitive because it recognizes various stakeholders as team members, rather than just adding specific institutional features as variables to the dominant conception of agency theory.

Economists often argue in favour of market discipline as a means to distribute resources effectively and efficiently. These same arguments likely influence decision-makers as they incorporate market discipline as the third pillar of Solvency II, the European insurance regulatory scheme currently being implemented. Success for Solvency II, then, is dependent in part on the strength of influence found in market discipline. Our research indicates that the German insurance market demonstrates the existence of such discipline, although the actual effect appears smaller than previously found in the U.S. insurance market. Solvency II, therefore, seems to be following an appropriate path, although further research is needed to evaluate whether or not enhancements to market discipline within the European market are warranted.

This paper contributes to the capital structure literature by investigating the determinants of capital structure of Australian Real Estate Investment Trusts (A-REITs) over the period 2006-2009. By using a panel approach and a Global Financial Crisis (GFC) dummy variable, our analysis incorporates the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) shock which appears to have affected the market after December 2007. We find that A-REIT size, profitability, tangibility, operating risk and number of growth opportunities impact similarly to many previous studies of international entities upon the degree of leverage. We also find mixed support for prevailing capital structure theories of Pecking Order, Trade-off and Agency Theory, but find that Market Timing Theory can be rejected over our sample period. With specific focus after onset of the GFC, we find that the relationship between capital structure and our independent variables is somewhat distorted. Consequently, the postulations of theory also become distorted whereby changes to capital structure come about because of the primary goal to survive, rather than managerial opportunism.

Based on agency theory, ownership structure plays a role in monitoring managerial opportunistic behaviour. This study examines how different forms of ownership structures including foreign ownership, government ownership, and managerial ownership moderate the relationship between free cash flow and asset utilisation. This cross-sectional study involves companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. The results of a hierarchical multiple regression analysis show a negative relationship between free cash flow and asset utilisation. This finding indicates that free cash flow may be invested unproductively, thus contributing to inefficient usage of assets. This study has also empirically demonstrated that foreign and managerial ownership provides monitoring on the use of the companies' assets, especially in companies with high free cash flow. The findings contribute to the understanding of the role of the various dimensions of ownership structure in overseeing the use of the firm's assets.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates two questions: (1) What is the relationship between organizational complexity and auditor choice, and (2) Does auditor choice influence the relationship between organizational complexity and firm value? Research Findings/Insights: Examination of a sample of large public US companies reveals a positive association between auditor quality and various proxies for organizational complexity. We also find a positive association between organizational complexity and firm value when the complex firm hires Big N auditors. The results are robust to alternative measures of auditor quality and firm value and to controls for the regulatory environment. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The results extend the agency theory argument that agency costs resulting from information asymmetry between managers and investors affect the demand for external monitoring by auditors, specifically the demand by organizationally complex firms for higher quality audits. We also shed light on how the value enhancement of a complex organization depends on auditor quality. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings offer new perspectives for managers of complex firms that are industrially or geographically diversified. They can use the retention of a larger auditor as a credible signal that their consolidated reports are more informative about their financial performance. Further, the findings provide new insight into the value that investors place on auditor quality when they assess the value of firms with complex organizational structures.

The goal of this paper is to determine the factors that explain voluntary improvements in audit committee activity, independence and financial expertise, both individually and jointly, within a corporate governance environment other than those used in previous works. These audit committee characteristics have been selected because previous authors have found that these attributes improve the effectiveness of this monitoring committee. The findings included a relatively high level of the proxies of audit committee effectiveness for those companies which display the best practices in terms of their board of directors' independence and activities. At the same time, we observed a non-linear relationship of substitution among internal control mechanisms, management ownership and audit committee characteristics. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study researches the influences of CEO compensation on firm behavior to examine the interactive relationship between the behavioral momentum of innovation in R&D and CEO compensation. The models presented in this study are based on evolutionary, institutional, and agency theories to test hypotheses using data from 107 companies in the high-technology sectors in the United States. The results indicate that the pre-succession innovative behavior of these high-technology firms on R&D can positively affect these firms' post-succession innovative behavior towards R&D. That is, positive momentum in R&D innovation prevails in a firm across a change of the CEO. However, for the role of CEO compensation, short- and long-term compensation does not positively moderate this behavioral momentum in R&D. Hence, the moderating impact of short- and long-term CEO compensation to enhance the momentum of innovation in R&D can be romanticized. These findings provide boards of directors with evidence as to how a CEO succession matters to a firm's behavioral momentum in R&D, and whether CEO compensation can be strategized to change a firm's innovation and momentous behavior.

The history of accounting for private railway companies in Germany shows that these companies played a major role in the diffusion of historical cost accounting principles and gave birth, together with big other joint stock companies, to the "dynamic" or second stage of capitalist accounting, at least in continental Europe. If the representatives of such railway companies did not develop new concepts of accounting, notably as concerned depreciation, they had, by 1875-1879, elaborated a new theory of accounting (historical cost or dynamic theory).This theory had a profound impact at least on the German theorists of the late 19th century and early 20th centuries such as Simon, Rieger and Schmalenbach. This new theory was needed to justify a new law favoring shareholders in a hurry for returns on their investments rather than company creditors. It also defeated the ideology of public finance and patrimonial (or static) theories of accounting. This new theory preceded the law which promulgated the new approach and clearly defended the private interests of shareholders as opposed to those of the public in the strict sense. It appears to contradict Watts and Zimmermann's basic hypothesis of the <<theory of market excuses>>. Agency theory seemingly does not to apply either, for the new theory was proposed by managers allied to shareholders, specifically those <<hurried share- holders", against creditors. This is why a kind of <<theory of alliance>> appears to be more consistent with these developments. The main reasons for developing the new accounting theory were linked to the issue of dividends. It was necessary to find an accounting approach which would allow the distribution of dividends at the very beginning of an investment cycle. It was also intended to find an accounting approach which would ensure that profits were distributed as evenly as possible throughout the entire investment cycle and among the different shareholders who had financed the investment. Hence, the second stage of the capitalist accounting development was not connected to measure of performance or information problems (monitoring and bonding) but seems to have been caused by the need to regulate profits and dividends in the interests of managers and shareholders. However, as this change took place within the framework of prudence, it was impossible, at that stage of capitalist accounting, to achieve a perfect smoothing of the rate of accounting profit. The solution to this problem was only to be found at the end of the 20th century with the onset of the third or actuarial stage and the "discovery" of fair value.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Low-quality firms may use share repurchase announcements to send a false or conflicting message regarding firm value to the capital market. This study examines whether firm-level corporate governance mechanisms can alleviate this mimicking behavior by affecting managers' buyback behavior following open-market share repurchase announcements. I further investigate the extent to which differences in corporate governance affect the changes in insider shareholdings and the degree of information content provided in repurchase announcements. Research Findings/Insights: Using unique archival data from Taiwan, I find that the capital market reaction to share repurchases announced for the purpose of signaling undervaluation is more favorable for firms with quality corporate governance. The increasing post-repurchase insider shareholdings confirm the credibility of repurchase announcements for firms with better corporate governance. The buyback outcome subsequent to repurchase announcements is affected by internal corporate governance mechanisms. Furthermore, external monitoring factors, such as having Big Four accounting firms as auditors, listing requirements, and regulatory preset buyback price ranges, also determine the execution rate of repurchase programs. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The signaling hypothesis, the leading hypothesis on open-market share repurchases, suggests that low-quality firms may engage in mimicking behavior to send a false signal regarding firm value when the signal cost is low. This study provides insight regarding the impacts of firm-level corporate governance structures on the signaling effects of repurchase announcements, the subsequent insider shareholdings, and the completion of repurchase programs. In addition, this study is the first to analyze the influence of corporate governance mechanisms on the degree of information content in open-market share repurchase announcements. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that higher quality corporate governance mechanisms lend credibility to a firm's open-market share repurchase announcement, which is also noteworthy in assessing the wealth effect of the repurchase announcements on shareholder value. Moreover, the findings suggest that buyback regulations (e.g., preset buyback price ceiling and floor) in Taiwan influence managers' buyback decisions. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - This paper aims to extend and contribute to prior UK research on the association between information asymmetry and dividends propensity. It seeks to investigate the impact of the number of analysts following firms, a proxy for information asymmetry, on dividends propensity. Design/methodology/approach - Using a 282 UK FTSE-All Share non-financial/non-utilities firms with fiscal year ends on 2007, the paper uses a multiple regression model to investigate the association between dividends and analysts following. Findings - The paper finds that after controlling for firm-specific characteristics, there is a significant negative association between the number of analysts following firms and dividend propensity. The finding suggests that higher coverage of financial analysts for UK firms reduces levels of information asymmetry between managers and shareholders, which results in lower dividend propensity. These findings are consistent with agency theory and pecking order theory, but inconsistent with signalling theory. Originality/value - The paper contributes to prior research related to the drivers of dividend propensity by being the first UK study to examine the association between dividend propensity and information asymmetry.

This paper investigates the impact of corporate board diversity on the financial performance of Nigerian quoted firms using a panel data of 122 quoted Nigerian firms. The aspects of board diversity studied comprise board nationality, board gender and board ethnicity. The Fixed Effect Generalised Least Square Regression is used to examine the impact of board diversity on firm performance for the period: 1991-2008. The results show that gender diversity was negatively linked with firm performance, while board nationality and board ethnicity were positive in predicting firm performance. The study provides insights for practitioners and policy makers on the need to view the board as a strategic resource in line with the resource dependency theory instead of viewing the board solely from agency theory perspective.

Purpose: Since the initiation of the share split reform by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) in 2005, the private placement has become the major source of raising equity after IPO. The purpose of this paper is to investigate why listed firms in China prefer private placements compared to other options of raising capital. Design/methodology/approach: The ordinary least squares regression, the piecewise regression and the cross-sectional regression analysis were undertaken to investigate the determinants and characteristics of the seasoned-equity offerings announcement effects. Probit regression analysis was taken to estimate the probability of a firm choosing private placements. Findings: The authors find positive significant announcement abnormal returns for private placement. The findings also indicate that operating performance deteriorates immediately after announcement and poor operating performance is more likely to be contributed by large size portfolios, which suggests size effect. Research limitations/implications: The paper's evidence contributes to an understanding of the wider implication of the share split reform undertaken by the CSRC. Practical implications: The paper provides insights for policy makers in China and around the world who have and wish to adopt similar practices within their jurisdictions. Similar research can be conducted in other emerging markets to enable better understanding and implications of seasoned equity offerings on firm financial performance. Originality/value: The paper is novel in regard to the data and the wider research paradigm used. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper draws upon the work of Lacan and Callon to interrogate and disrupt the foundational belief of neo-classical economics in the rationality and autonomy of the individual. Lacan's account of the ego's foundation in the 'imaginary' explains how the self may be grasped as if it were indeed autonomous and rational, but also what is 'fictional' about this image. Following Lacan, the credit crisis is explored in terms of the narcissism, paranoia and contempt for the law that in practice characterised the conduct of what economics celebrates as the rational individual. The paper then draws upon Callon's notion of performativity to explore the ways in which economics, and in particular its assumptions about incentives, came to make a reality of the fiction of the 'rational' individual. We suggest that widely adopted incentive pay practices, designed in line with agency assumptions, produced the very self-interested opportunism that they assumed ex ante.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of firms' cash holdings and ownership concentration on the firms' valuation using an unbalanced panel dataset of non-financial listed firms in Australia. Design/methodology/approach - The author used a generalized method of moments approach suitable for unbalanced panel dataset to examine the impact of firms' cash holdings and ownership concentration on firms' q-ratios after controlling for the impact of financing, dividend and investment decisions, respectively. Findings - The paper finds a positive relationship between cash holdings and q-ratio of Australian firms. The ownership structure moderates the effect of cash holdings on q-ratio in asymmetric fashion, i.e. for widely held firms, there is a positive relationship between cash holdings and q-ratio; while for closely held firms, there is significant negative relationship between cash holdings and q-ratio. Furthermore, changes associated with corporate governance reforms, also effect q-ratio besides ownership structure. The paper also examined the impact of cash holdings on the market value of the firms over time. As the author predicted, increase in the cash holdings has a negative effect on the firms' market valuation, and this effect slows down over time. Overall, the empirical analysis finds support for similar findings documented for the developed countries in the literature. Research limitations/implications - The sample consists of non-financial listed firms over the period of 1995 to 2010. Practical implications - The results imply that widely-owned firms have lower cash holdings because managers are able to access capital market easily compared to firms with concentrated ownership, which might have complex agency and information asymmetry problems. These findings are consistent with the agency costs. Managers in less widely-held firms have more discretion over cash holding policies, and the value reduction imposed on these firms may reflect shareholders' recognition of the possibility of managerial expropriations. Originality/value - This is believed to be the first paper to explore agency costs of cash holdings for Australian firms. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to revisit the determinants of audit committee activity in UK listed companies after over a decade since the last investigation of this matter and with numerous significant changes in the regulatory and corporate governance framework globally. Design/methodology/ approach - Underpinned by agency theory, the study undertakes a multiple regression analysis of listed companies in the UK in order to determine the determinants of the activity of the audit committees in these companies. Findings - The study finds that audit committee activity is an increasing function of boards' independence and diligence. Interestingly, it also finds a significant negative relationship between audit committee activity and ownership structure. A higher number of large shareholders with at least 3 percent of the firm's issued equity share capital are associated with a decrease in a committee's activity. Audit committee expertise, size and the availability of an audit committee charter were not significant determinants of audit committee activity. Research limitations/implications - The findings from the study suggest the need for more research into the factors that can explain the determinants of the activity of the audit committees in the UK and elsewhere. It also opens up the discussion on the effects of changing global corporate behaviors on corporate governance mechanisms. Practical implications - This study shows that there is a positive relationship between board independence and the activity of the audit committees. In other words, to improve the performance of the audit committees in UK listed companies, board independence should be increased. There also seems to be substitution between governance mechanisms. The presence of large shareholders slowed the activity of the audit committees, as evidenced in a significant negative relationship. Originality/value - The study revisits the determinants of the audit committees after over a decade since the initial investigation in the UK. However, the study is undertaken in a very different context with far-reaching changes in the corporate landscape and regulations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: There is no previous systematic and theoretical investigation of the interim CEO succession practice. This research attempts to fill the gap by studying this phenomenon and hence advance executive succession research/practice. Design/methodology/approach: Based on agency theory, the authors propose a model and several propositions to predict what determines the origin of interim CEOs, the length of the interim tenure, and the career prospects for the interim CEO after the interim tenure. Findings: Both firm performance and environmental uncertainty play an important role in the dynamic interim CEO succession process. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides the foundations for future empirical research on interim CEO succession. Practical implications: Board members at companies experiencing sudden CEO departures should choose a loyal non-aggressive veteran to be the interim CEO so as to minimize disruption and to smooth the transition. They should use caution when choosing an internal candidate because if such a candidate is not chosen to be the permanent CEO later, a talent may be lost. Originality/value: The research is the first to systematically examine the phenomenon of interim CEOs. The authors make a unique contribution to the literature on CEO succession.

Corporate governance has become increasingly important in developed and developing countries just after a series of corporate scandals and failures in a number of countries. Corporate governance structure is often viewed as a means of corporate success despite prior studies reveal mixed, somewhere conflicting and ambiguous, and somewhere no relationship between governance structure and performance. This study empirically investigates the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and financial performance of listed banking companies in Bangladesh by using two multiple regression models. The study reveals that a good number of companies do not comply with the regulatory requirements indicating remarkable shortfall in corporate governance practice. The companies are run by the professional managers having no duality and no ownership interest for which they are compensated by high remuneration to curb agency conflict. Apart from some inconsistent relationship between some corporate variables, the corporate governance mechanisms do not appear to have significant relationship with financial performances. The findings reveal an insignificant negative impact or somewhere no impact of independent directors and non-independent non-executive directors on the level of performance that strongly support the concept that the managers are essentially worthy of trust and earn returns for the owners as claimed by stewardship theory. The study provides support for the view that while much emphasis on corporate governance mechanisms is necessary to safeguard the interest of stakeholders; corporate governance on its own, as a set of codes or standards for corporate conformance, cannot make a company successful. Companies need to balance corporate governance mechanisms with performance by adopting strategic decision and risk management with the efficient utilization of the organization 's resources.

We follow agency theory to assess the influence of managerial ownership on the market value, performance, and risk of 123 listed banks in 23 countries included in the STOXX Global Index in 2007 and 2010. After controlling for bank characteristics, regulatory restrictions, and macroeconomic conditions, our findings show a positive relation between managerial ownership and both market value (Tobin's Q) and performance (ROA and ROE). Moreover, we find a negative relation between managerial ownership and risk (EDF, NPL/L, and Z-SCORE). Bank market value and performance is a non-linear, inverse U-shaped function of managerial ownership. The negative relation between managerial ownership and bank risk is also non-linear and U-shaped. Our results remain robust to reverse causality. In their effort to immunize the global financial system from systemic risks, central banks and practitioners should find our results relevant for regulation purposes.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper studies whether enhanced regulatory supervision of the banking system strengthens the debt contracting mechanism between borrowers and lenders in emerging markets. Specifically, we investigate: 1) whether the borrowers' accrual-based earnings management behavior is more negatively associated with the magnitude of their bank loans after the government strengthens the monitoring on banks, and 2) whether the enhanced supervision is more effective for firms controlled by the state, the major economic player in most emerging markets. Research Findings/Insights: Using China's 2003 banking reform as a natural experiment, we find that borrowers' earnings management behavior becomes more negatively associated with loan size after the reform. The association is more significant for state-owned borrowers and lenders, consistent with the prediction that although the state-owned parties face lower barriers to collusion, the reform increases the costs of side-contracting. Overall, the findings suggest that such reform is effective in enhancing banks' role in corporate governance in a transition economy. Theoretical/Academic Implications: To date, most corporate governance studies are based on the standard principal-agent theory that analyzes contracting between only two parties. For this reason, the standard agency theory has had limited success in explaining economic developments in emerging markets, where the economy is characterized by high levels of government intervention (i.e., a third party), which creates the possibility of collusion. We study debt contracting in an emerging market by adopting the theory of collusion, an extension of the traditional principal-agent theory to multi-agent settings, such as one in which there are one principal and two agents, one of whom plays the role of supervisor. Our results show that, consistent with theoretical predictions, monitoring by the government (i.e., the principal) of banks (i.e., the supervisor) has an impact on the relationship between banks and borrowing firms (i.e., the agents). Practitioner/Policy Implications: Previous research on corporate governance in emerging markets, which has focused on the disciplining role of the equity holders, has documented that corporate governance is rather weak. As private lending is the most widely used type of financing in emerging markets such as China, this paper takes a different view and shows that private lending has increased its influence on firms' corporate governance since a banking reform. The results confirm that the debt contracting mechanism between companies and banks has developed since such a reform. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Non-executive investors place greater weight on factors related to performance and less weight on human capital factors, while executive investors place greater weight on human capital factors in determining executive compensation. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited in that the sample may not be representative of the population of chief executive officers or shareholders in the USA. Practical implications: Differing factors suggest that there is a misalignment of measures desired to be the foundation of executive compensation. The differing measures used to potentially motivate agents (executives) by principals (investors) results in an agency cost. Originality/value: The authors have documented a difference between executives and investors in factors desired to determine executive compensation. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This article analyses the appointments of outside directors to family firm boards within a sample of 423 observations (year/firm) regarding Italian publicly listed companies. The aim is to test predictions which suggest that efficient performance of control and service tasks by outside directors has positive effects on a company's capacity to raise capital and to grow. Unlike agency theory, which affirms that independents are efficient when performing functions of control, this article suggests that the adoption of outside directors who are also independent has no effect. The results of this research demonstrate that outside directors who have close ties with banks maintain valuable social capital with bankers in periods when such social capital is threatened by large investment policies requiring a great amount of bank financing.

To date, we have only partially begun to develop an understanding of the channels through which innovation is facilitated within organizations. Although talented individuals are pivotal to supporting knowledge accumulation and renewal, they may be more willing to contribute new ideas if they expect to reap some of the gains that these ideas generate for the firm. In considering this perspective, this paper addresses whether organizational incentives affect innovation, and considers the conduits through which this link is established. In particular, this paper uses agency theory to address whether performance-based pay and performance-based promotion foster firm innovation. Our analysis relies upon a survey of 370 Brazilian manufacturing and services firms. Based on estimations of two-stage models, our results indicate that promotion is a more useful tool for encouraging innovation than pay. In addition, there seems to be a threshold above which the use of performance-based promotion is marginal. (c) 2012 Brazilian Administration Review. All rights reserved.

This study provides new evidence on the impact of governance on the performance of privately defined contribution pension plans. Using a hand collected data set on governance factors, the study shows that the external and internal governance mechanisms in pension plans are weak. One explanation for this weakness is the potential conflict between the pension beneficiaries and the fund's owner, which depends on who bears the investment risk in the pension plan. Hence, different governance factors are found to be important for pension fund return on invested assets and also for its economic performance. Consequently, the overall policy conclusion is that more focus should be put on the governance of the pension funds, taking into account the different interests of the beneficiaries and owners as it may determine their performance.

There is currently intense debate in academic circles regarding the principles that have long sustained traditional economic theories in the teaching of business management. One of the most controversial questions being discussed is the concept of human nature as driven primarily by self-interest. Profit maximization and governance mechanisms in order to protect shareholders' interests have become the essence of all good business management practices. This article proposes a change in direction towards a broader and, at the same time, more realistic perspective with respect to the individual's values within the sphere of the teaching of business management.

Boards have become increasingly independent, to the point where some firms have removed all of the insiders except for the CEO. The authors call this phenomenon a "lone-insider board" and submit that it constitutes a fundamentally distinct governance arrangement worthy of inquiry. This paper describes institutional pressures that give rise to increasing reliance on loneinsider boards, and investigates likely outcomes. According to agency theory, the greater the proportion of independent directors, the more effective boards are in monitoring CEOs. The authors submit, however, that a lone-insider board creates a fundamental shift in board effectiveness due to a loss of mutual monitoring and an increase in information asymmetry. Mutual monitoring occurs when members of the top management team actively monitor the CEO. Information asymmetry refers to the disparity in knowledge between the CEO and the board of directors. The authors propose that reduced mutual monitoring causes increased information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and increases rather than decreases CEO power. The authors hope this article will stimulate fruitful inquiry in the area of lone-insider boards.

Using a sample of U.S. dual class companies, we empirically investigate the effects of the divergence between insiders' voting and cash flow rights on market reaction to seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) and long-run stock performance following SEOs. We find that SEO announcement returns and long-run stock performance following SEOs are negatively related to measures of the divergence between insiders' voting and cash flow rights. Our results support the view of agency theory as a plausible explanation of SEO underperformance. Misalignment of interests between insiders and outside shareholders can create managerial incentives to undertake value-destroying investments to extract private benefits, ultimately leading to a reduction in firm value.

The aim of this paper is to analyze to what extent business growth opportunities influence decisions on bank debt. This objective is addressed by considering both the arguments of the positive agency theory and the institutional characteristics of the Chilean financial system. An empirical analysis considers the GMM system estimator applied to panel data of quoted Chilean firms for the period 1997 to 2008. The main advantage of this methodology is that it overcomes the heterogeneity and endogeneity problems. The main finding supports the hypothesis of the existence of a non-monotonic U-shaped relationship between growth opportunities and the level of bank debt. The initial negative relationship is explained by the costs associated with underinvestment problems, whilst the increasing part which reflects the positive relationship among growth opportunities and bank debt is based on the arguments of overinvestment costs. This result is robust to a number of alternative measures of growth opportunities. (c) 2012 de Cladea.

This paper examines the process of delivery of HR practices within Multinational Companies (MNCs). Neo-institutional, resource-based and agency theories are used to explore whether devolvement of HR to line managers is attempted in MNCs. Issues of agency between HR specialists and line managers are found to be a significant barrier to devolving HR within the sample organisations. A higher level of divergence in perception about the delivery and resourcing of devolvement is found to be negatively correlated with perceived subsidiary performance. The analysis is based on a multi-respondent and a multi-unit method which enables comparisons between HR specialists and line managers (over 700 respondents) and comparisons between the domestic and foreign subsidiaries (over 140 organisations and 429 units). The interaction of institutional resource-based and agency factors is extremely complex and requires further investigation. (c) 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a model of corporate governance (CG) extending fiduciary duties from fulfillment of responsibilities toward the firm's owners to fulfillment of analogous fiduciary duties toward all the firm's stakeholders. After considering the place of CSR in the debate about alternative CG modes, a full-fledged social contract foundation of the multistakeholder and multifiduciary model is presented. The chapter shows that CSR is a social norm that would endogenously emerge from the stakeholders' social contract seen as the first move in an equilibrium selection process that reaches the equilibrium state of a CG institution. The social contract provides a model of the impartial mediating reasoning performed by a board of directors striving to balance different claims of stakeholders. It also allows deducing the multistakeholder objective function that socially responsible firms maximize, and then provides a specification of the particular fiduciary duties owed to each stakeholder according to its position.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine whether managerial ownership-induced income smoothing accentuates or attenuates an information asymmetry problem. Standard agency theory suggests that managerial ownership may play a significant role in alleviating agency problems between managers and external shareholders that can arise from information asymmetry. According to this view, managerial ownership-induced income smoothing could convey managerial private information and could, therefore, be considered as informative. However, managerial ownership could also entrench managers with absolute control of firms, and encourage them to engage in earnings manipulation, including earnings smoothing, in order to hide private benefits of control. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses two smoothing measures, and separate total smoothing into its innate and discretionary components. The former is determined by firm fundamentals, whereas discretionary smoothing allows managers the flexibility to use it for either informative or opportunistic reasons. The paper then regresses information asymmetry, as proxied by scaled bid-ask-spreads, on the interaction between managerial ownership and both these smoothing components. Findings - The paper documents that managerial ownership-induced discretionary smoothing has a positive effect on bid-ask spreads. This result seems to support the entrenchment view of managerial ownership. Practical implications - This study offers insights to policy makers interested in enhancing the effectiveness of the managerial ownership aspect of corporate governance in New Zealand. Originality/value - This paper uses agency theory to provide a comparative assessment of the efficient versus the entrenchment hypotheses with respect to managerial ownership.

Upon completion of overseas acquisitions, Western firms typically hire Chinese locals or expatriates to run their Chinese operations. This action is an important consideration because a Western executive's managerial style may impact Chinese employee behavior differently than a Chinese executive's managerial style. Utilizing an experiment with Chinese managers as participants, we examine the effect of the agency problem (when both an incentive and opportunity to act in line with one's self-interest are present) on Chinese managers' discretionary accrual decisions, as well as the role that their executives' culturally based management style (Eastern versus Western) plays in affecting their propensity to manage earnings. We find that Chinese managers tend to override corporate concerns and recommend higher discretionary expense accruals in an effort to maximize their two-year bonus potential when the agency problem is present. Conversely, they tend to recommend lower discretionary expense accrual figures to help achieve corporate goals when the agency problem is not present. Interestingly, we also find that an executive's culturally based management style moderates the impact of the agency problem in that Chinese managers' willingness to manage earnings across agency problem conditions is significantly more pronounced in the presence of a Western (U.S.) executive than in the presence of an Eastern (Chinese) executive.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

Earnings management is found to be driven by different managerial incentives. Previous studies have identified that executive compensation contracts create incentives for earnings management. The agency theory and the positive accounting theory provide explanations for contract-driven earnings management. This study links the agency theory and the positive accounting theory and reviews the early executive compensation studies, bonus plan maximisation hypothesis and equity-based compensation. The aim of this study is to shed light in explaining contractual incentives and provide useful information in understanding the executive compensation contract-driven earnings management behaviour.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess whether ownership concentration, leverage and demand for equity financing is associated with internal corporate governance quality. The paper focuses on dimensions of governance quality that are related to financial reporting quality. Design/methodology/approach - The authors measure internal governance quality by an indicator variable that takes on higher values depending on whether a company has an audit committee, has a sufficient number of audit committee meetings during the year, has financial expertise on the audit committee, has an internal auditing function, a risk management function, a code of conduct and whistle blower provisions in the code of conduct. The sample consists of 91 Swedish listed companies of which 39 companies had to follow the Swedish Corporate Governance Code. The development of hypotheses is based on agency theory. Ordered logistic regressions are used to test the hypotheses. Findings - The paper finds a strong negative association between leverage and the internal governance quality score for companies that do not have to follow the Corporate Governance Code. The paper also finds a positive association between the governance quality score and dispersed ownership among companies that have to follow the code. Research limitations/implications - The negative association between leverage and governance quality is opposite to the typical agency theory prediction. A number of other studies have also documented negative or insignificant associations with leverage in related settings. The research suggests there is a demand to develop theories related to leverage and the implementation of governance characteristics beyond the typical agency theory based predictions. Practical implications - The results raise the question whether lenders more actively directly or indirectly should influence the governance quality of borrowers. Originality/value - Based on the conjecture that governance quality increases with the number of governance elements, the paper studies a governance score that is built up by several elements of good corporate governance. Furthermore, the authors study a setting dominated by voluntary choices of governance quality, which makes it possible to study supply effects. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We examine the corporate governance environment of smaller listed Australian firms to investigate the factors that determine how firms respond to recommendations contained in corporate governance codes. We group corporate governance recommendations into three distinct categories and argue that differences in adoption costs between categories, together with firm specific factors, determine a firm's decision to conform with the recommendation or to explain the reasons for non-conformance. Analysis of the conformance by smaller firms with governance recommendations highlights substantial differences in adoption rates between categories of recommendations. Our results also reveal that the cost of adopting specific recommendations, together with profitability, external audit quality, and ownership dispersion, jointly explain a firm's decision to 'comply or explain'. This study provides insights for policy makers and regulators regarding the appropriateness of corporate governance recommendations for smaller firms.

Purpose - Accounting research has long shown the effect of subjectivity in performance evaluation. This study investigates one form of subjectivity in performance evaluation: flexibility in weighting performance measures examining decisions made by supervisors about weighting. Empirical studies show that the performance-measure weights are only partially consistent with the predictions of the agency theory and they are a still outstanding issue. Methodology/approach - We develop an experiment to analyse supervisor decision-making, manipulating two factors: internal organisational interdependence and the level of managerial performance. We derive hypotheses along with both economic and behavioural approaches. The economic approach is based on agency theory predictions and the controllability principle while the behavioural approach is drawn on the organisational justice theory. We argue that in low interdependence contexts the supervisor's decision confirms the agency theory predictions, while in high interdependence conditions weighting decisions could be driven by behavioural considerations of fairness perceptions of the evaluation process and the level of managerial performance. Findings - We find that in low interdependence contexts the supervisor's decision confirms the agency theory predictions, while in high interdependence contexts it does not. The results indicate that the supervisor's decision stems from the integration of economic and behavioural perspectives. Research and social implications - The theoretical framework can be useful for interpreting the supervisor decision-making and the weighting process. Originality - The economic and behavioural approaches allow us to understand flexibility in weighting performance measures suggesting that, in addition to economic considerations, a behavioural perspective may also be relevant in explaining subjective weighting.

We estimate the short-run stock price response to unanticipated capital expenditures. We use association study methodology to avoid the self-selection bias in event studies and to facilitate construction of a large sample of firm-years likely to exhibit agency problems. We find that the average price response to routine capital expenditures is negative, and that commonly used agency cost measures explain fully the negative response. Subsample results support the conclusion that the market is skeptical of cash flow financed spending by low-q firms and even capital spending by high-q firms when the firm is large and q is only marginally high.

In the modern economy, a division of labor is a division of knowledge. The challenge of limited information and goal conflict within organizations takes on special salience in the presence of technology. In order to manage technical managers, general managers and executives must judge proposals beyond their direct knowledge. Technical managers may, through opportunism or overconfidence, suggest overinvestment in technology. Analyzing a dataset of information technology hardware and staff spending by large multidivisional firms during a growth phase of US IT spending, results suggest that technical managers significantly overspent on hardware, with negative consequences for performance. Chief executive experience significantly altered the effects of overspending. Solutions to the problem of monitoring technical managers are suggested, including socialization, auditing, and incentives. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The paper deals with development of a general theory of the firm. It discusses the demand for such a theory, reviews existing approaches to its generalization, and offers a new variant of general theory of the firm based on the contract theory. The theory is based on minimization of opportunistic behaviour determined by the material structure of production (a classification of ten structural factors is offered). This framework is applied to the analysis of three boundaries problems (boundaries of the job, boundaries of the unit, boundaries of the firm) and five integration dilemmas (vertical, horizontal, functional, related, and conglomerate).

The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the financing life cycle pattern of micro-firms in Sweden from the agency costs theory perspective. The study shows that the financing structures of firms change over the firms' life cycles. Firms generally rely on internal financial sources such as equity capital and retained profits, particularly at the start-up stage. They also use short-term debt as the second most important financial source at this stage. As firms age and develop, the use of short-term debt decreases and the use of both equity capital and long-term debt simultaneously increase. The financing patterns of firms in different industries over their life cycles follow the general pattern of the total sample. The results from the statistical tests support the applicability of the financial life cycle model and the agency costs theory to explain it. Copyright (c) 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Since risk plays a role in setting dividend policy and granting stock options to directors, the paper investigates the effect of director compensation structure on the riskiness of the firm's investment strategy by examining the firm's dividend payout policy. The results imply that stock options to outside directors increase the firm's appetite for risk and suggest that director stock options constitute a major incentive to changing corporate policies. The results also indicate that director stock options align the risk preferences of managers and directors. Finally, the results suggest that stock options do not motivate directors to act opportunistically in setting investment and payout policies. (c) 2012 The Clute Institute.

The aim of this study is to explain the performance consequences of the adoption of a Chief Operating Officer (COO) position by drawing from agency theory. Although, prior research has documented a performance penalty associated with the use of this position, we currently have an incomplete understanding of the factors explaining this penalty. This study suggests that the delegation of CEO decision rights to the COO is explained by information transfer and agency considerations. Largely consistent with agency theory, our empirical analysis suggests information transfer considerations are related to the likelihood of COO adoption, while CEO ownership and board characteristics mitigate the related performance penalty.

This article serves two purposes: to review how the agency and real options perspectives inform us about the venture capital staging decision, and to examine whether the staging decision differs between domestic venture capitalist (VC)-led and foreign VC-led investment projects. The article proceeds as follows. First, it reviews how agency theory informs venture capital staging decisions and analyzes whether domestic VCs and foreign VCs differ in using staged financing to address agency concerns. Then it considers how real options theory informs venture capital staging decisions, and examines whether domestic VCs and foreign VCs differ in using staged financing to tackle project-specific uncertainty and market volatility. It discusses the methods for the empirical test and presents empirical results. It concludes with a discussion of the study for research and practice. (c) 2012 by Oxford University Press.

This article investigates the effects of privatization under Brazil's National Privatization Program (PND) during the 1990s on companies' capital structure. Our model suggests that privatized firms increased their market leverage by 10-14% on average relative to the level before privatization. The effect of privatization on book leverage level was 8-12% on average. These results indicate a positive effect of the privatization process on the levels of leverage of privatized firms, as predicted by signalling and agency theories.

I have never met Lynn Stout. Of course, just like any person even remotely interested in corporate governance and US corporate law, I know her insightful writings. But I do not know her personally. I know for a fact, however, that Lynn Stout is a nice person. And an excessively nice person she must be. Her paper on New Thinking on "Shareholder Primacy" talks about the surge of a new paradigm in corporate law. This is an excessively generous thesis. For we are not witnessing the takeover of an old science by a new one explaining facts better than the old stuff. We are witnessing the surge of a scientific analysis of the legal structure of the firm -and of the role of corporations to structure firms- which is replacing an ideology; not a science.

Agency theory is used to explain many firm marketing activities. However, its assumptions are founded in characteristics of North American actors, particularly in the United States. As such, it is not surprising that work employing agency theory in other national contexts often fails to find support. Taking a comparative institutional approach, this article theorizes how the human assumptions and prescriptions of agency theory differ across countries by utilizing the three pillars (i.e., regulative, normative, and cognitive) set forth by institutional theory. In particular, attenuations of the human assumptions of self-interest, risk-aversion, and bounded rationality of agents are theorized to influence goal alignment, risk sharing, and information processing in the agency relationship and in turn, effect prescriptions of governance and contracting given by the traditional agency model. A series of research propositions are developed to provide insight into the contractual implications in the principal-agent relationship across different institutional contexts. The theoretical attenuations presented provide guidance for marketing academics and practitioners engaged in cross-national agency relationships. (c) 2012, Academy of Marketing Science.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reconcile alternative managerial views regarding self-serving behavior in organizations: while some propose that such behavior is commonplace and detrimental to performance, and suggest policies to counteract such conduct, critics contend that such policies generate distrust and diminish performance. The authors integrate elements from agency and interactional justice theories, and hypotheses that managerial attitudes not related to self-interest can influence behaviors often attributed to the desire to curb self-interest, and vice-versa. Design/methodology/approach - The authors employ structural equation modeling based on survey data from 387 team-leaders from both Brazil and the USA. Findings - An asymmetric relation is found in the aforementioned theoretical "cross-talk:" managers concerned with self-interest tend to devise policies solely focused on curbing self-interest, while managers concerned with justice not only adopt justice-enhancing practices but also certain incentivizing agency-related practices which jointly increase performance. Research limitations/implications - By proposing and testing theoretical interactions between agency and justice theories, support is found for both enthusiasts and critics of self-interestedness, but pointedly they occur in different domains. Practical implications - The results suggest that managers should foster interactional justice, promoting incentivizing agency-related behaviors that may be interpreted as justice-seeking, while avoiding those that send a message of distrust. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first empirical papers directly addressing the ongoing debate raised by Ghoshal and others on the merits of managerial theories based on the assumption of self-interest.

This paper investigates the link between board structure and firm performance. The impact of conglomerate diversification on the relationship between board effectiveness and firm performance is also examined. Boards of director effectiveness, including board composition, board size, institutional ownership, and aspects of board leadership including CEO duality are addressed in the Tunisian context. The study employs a dynamic model to study twenty-eight non-banking companies listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange over the period 1997-2003. The empirical results are mixed and are consistent with previous studies particularly in the Tunisian context. Evidence was found that conglomerate diversification is negative and statistically significant to both board effectiveness and firm performance, which increases the conflict of interest between managers and shareholders and leads to the expropriation of minority shareholders rights. These findings have several implications for understanding the opportunistic behavior of managers. (c) 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The purpose of this paper is to add a meaningful critique to the existing audit committee (AC) literature by providing (i) a critical analysis of the AC literature grounded on agency theory; (ii) a discussion of the emerging new theories of AC, which investigate the people serving on and working with ACs, and (iii) a description of the relationship between these two groups of literature. A number of qualitative AC studies have provided new insights by investigating the actual people serving on and working with audit committees. This review paper summarizes these findings and provides a comparative evaluation with the agency theory-based AC research. This review documents, among others, that the attributes of ACs, as measured by the quantitative literature, have hardly been reflected by qualitative investigation, whereas qualitative analysis of the data contributed by people who have actual experience of ACs questions the fundamental propositions, not only of why ACs exist, but also how they function. This paper provides a cross-examination of the afore-mentioned two paradigms of literature on AC effectiveness and invites corporate scholars to reflect on the differences between the two groups of AC studies.

The literature on managers' compensation points out several factors specific to firms and to the determinants of stock options awards. At the empirical level, most studies focused on market-oriented governance mechanisms [studies on the US context (Yermack, 1995; Tzioumis, 2008)] or network-oriented systems [studies on the Japanese context (Uchida, 2006)]. We attempt to determine the factors behind stock options awards in a country characterised by a mixed governance system (market- and network-oriented) which is France. We conducted our study on a sample of 152 firms listed on the French stock market (the SBF250 index) during the 2002-2009 period. The results supported the hypothesis that the factors behind managers' stock option compensation are firm size, growth opportunities, manager's age, dividend distribution and ownership concentration.

This present work is an exploratory analysis of network governance models that are characterised by widespread distribution of decision-making and control, auditing and supervisory functions in company structure, frequently through stakeholder engagement in the management system. In the study, we verify the way in which NG can involve stakeholder representatives in the governance bodies and in the decision-making process, also preventing opportunistic behaviour of management, according to the stakeholder-agency theory. A case study of network governance is presented regarding the Spanish cooperative Eroski - a self-governing organisation, with direct participation by representatives of the various stakeholder categories in the main governing bodies. In the conclusions, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the network governance system and its implications for theory and practice and we describe an incremental approach, on an entirely voluntary basis, for implementing this governance model in other corporations, including non-cooperative ones.

This paper presents a critical analysis of the choice and design of executive pay incentive scheme arrangements implemented at the time of a company's initial public offering. Using a unique sample of 311 entrepreneurial companies over a five year period ( 1998-2002) it discovers that 172 companies implement executive share option schemes for the first time at their initial public offering. Taking this sub-sample, the paper evaluates and analyses the strategic choices made with regard to incentive pay schemes by the board of directors at this crucial time in a company's development. It finds that company's choices are split between schemes that have performance targets linked to reward and others that are contrary to the guidelines of the UK's Corporate Governance Code and best practice. Furthermore, it shows company characteristics that affect schemes and elaborates on the configuration of incentive schemes in respect of three critical elements: the performance target, comparator, and target level requirement for the shares to vest. In light of this, it proposes strategic reasons as to how these schemes might be set for initial public offerings and proposes that explanations for implementation are not underpinned by traditional agency theory but linked to a resource based view of the firm.

Research comparing family businesses and public companies has generally ignored the economic influence. We examine how public and family businesses fare in different economies. We argue that governance mechanisms may work for large public companies, but may not be suitable for family businesses. We find that during economic slowing down, family businesses tend to perform better than public companies because they have better control of their businesses and hence can make quick and decisive decisions. Another finding is that during economic upturn, duality is negatively related to company performance, however, that negative impact can be offset by family business status.

This study seeks to empirically examine the effect of ownership concentration on mitigating free cash flow agency problem in New Zealand. Following Jensen's (1986) argument that managers have incentives to misuse free cash flows, this study tests whether concentrated ownership structure helps alleviate such a problem or exacerbates it. A natural consequence of this agency problem will be overinvestment and other operational inefficiencies which are likely to have a detrimental impact on firms' future performance. The second objective of this paper is to examine the association between FCFAP conditional on ownership concentration on future firm performance. We measure free cash flow agency problem as the product of positive free cash flows and growth opportunities proxied by Tobin's Q and find that financial institution-controlled ownership structure in New Zealand is positively associated with free cash flow agency problem. We also document that free cash flow agency problem conditional on ownership concentration negatively affects future firm performance. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of the degree of control of large shareholders on the relation between dividend payout and firm value creation. From the perspective of agency theory, dividend payout is highly appreciated for firms subject to highly agency problems. Using a sample of 275 firm-years listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange over the period 1998-2007, our results show that contrary to agency theory predictions, dividend payout of Tunisian firms contributes more to value creation when the firm has low agency conflicts. We find a positive and highly coefficient for the payouts of firms with shared control and with majority financial institution control. These results may be interpreted through the trust assigned by Tunisian investors to firms that have low agency problems. Our results also indicate a strong positive relationship between the return on assets, the level of debt and firm value. Finally, we document a negative relationship between the financial business sector and firm value. (c) 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

Abstract This chapter discusses the recent global economic crisis and posits that capitalism is at a crossroads. It can either continue with a "business as usual" attitude while waiting for the next financial collapse or it can administer reforms that learn from the lessons of history. The voluntary sector has avoided many of the problems associated with the capitalism of greed, short-termism and unethical behaviour despite pressure on the voluntary sector to embrace a managerial style of capitalism and governance rooted in agency theory. Instead, voluntary organizations grounded in selflessness, trust and longevity have continued to enjoy the confidence of the public and have actively campaigned for a responsive regulatory system based on stewardship theory. Voluntary organizations have also embraced and been at the forefront of innovation and change from the slave trade to fair trade. What lessons can capitalism learn from the voluntary sector as opposed to making charities into businesses? This chapter explores characteristics of voluntary sector enterprise and makes a number of suggestions for radical reform of existing organizations, such as the credit agencies and audit firms, on a non-profit basis. The paper also explores the neglected theory of stewardship and suggests that a revised "receptive stewardship" model may be more appropriate than agency theory and would overcome the practical problems of stakeholder theory.

This research work is aimed at determining whether there are any informational asymmetries between the presidents and the members of collegial bodies in Chilean universities. The framework of agency theory, in which the president of a university plays the role of agent while the collegial body serves as principal, assumes that this kind of asymmetry exists. The methodology was based on a closed-ended questionnaire where respondents had to demonstrate their knowledge of supposedly basic topics related to management performance. The results provide compelling evidence confirming the agency theory, which contends that an agent holds more information than a member of a collegial body, and, if internal, the member's knowledge exceeds that of external members.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of both firm-specific and external factors on the risk taking of European insurance companies. The extent of risk taking is quantified through variations in stock prices and these are explained by firm-specific and external factors that proxy the environment in which the insurers are active. Using a two-way panel regression analysis with fixed and random effects, our empirical study covers hand-collected data on 35 German and UK insurance companies for the period 1997 to 2010. We find that differences in company size, capital structure, liquidity, and economic development affect variations in stock prices. The analysis also highlights differences between the market-based UK corporate governance system and the control-based regime implemented in Germany, with the UK exhibiting a higher level of risk, compensation, and board independence. We also document increases in the volatility of insurance stock returns during the financial crisis. (c) 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to measure the degree of the managerial entrenchment and to study its impact on the performance of the firm. The model of the entrenchment's degree is based on both the personal characteristics of the manager and on the ownership structure of the firm. According to our empirical studies carried on 815 firms during the period 2001-2004, the entrenchment's degree depends significantly on the age and on the tenure of the manager as well as on the relative power of the managerial ownership. Moreover, the relationship between the managerial entrenchment and the performance of the firm is not linear. It takes the form of a harmful entrenchment then of a beneficial one as the entrenchment's degree increases. This result shows that the managerial entrenchment is not always harmful to the shareholders' wealth. Empirically, by exceeding a certain critical level (0.81), the managerial entrenchment becomes beneficial to the shareholders. (c) 2014 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Effective from year 2001, the Bursa Malaysia made it mandatory for companies seeking listing to furnish a disclosure on the state of internal control system (ICS) to their shareholders The main objective of this study is to examine, under signaling and agency theories, whether board and audit committee independence as governance oversight mechanism on the voluntary disclosure of ICS able to improve the firm performance. Based on a sample of 68 Malaysian IPO companies listed from year 2005 to 2008, this study discovers that the voluntary disclosure of ICS has a significant positive impact on the firm performance Consistent with the signalling and agency theories, this study also provides empirical evidence that independent-dominated board are more effective in fulfill their oversight roles on the quality voluntary disclosure of ICS index (VDICSI) and subsequently had positively influence on the firm performance of IPOs The present paper provides useful information that offer great value to Malaysian companies, policymakers, academics and other stakeholders to take into considerations in identifying the corporate governance roles on voluntary disclosure of ICS that will subsequently enhance firms performance.

This article contrasts three views or paradigms of the business enterprise and of critical management issues regarding governance. The first two are the agency and contracting paradigms. These dominate most discussion of the governance of corporate activities. The third is the capabilities perspective, which is starting to gain attention in the literature. Agency theory highlights how incentives should be crafted and governance activities focused to bring about better performance for shareholders when ownership and control are separated. Transaction cost economics highlights, as does agency theory, the importance of opportunism. But it adds asset specificity considerations that are also relevant to organizational design choices, including governance mechanisms. The capabilities perspective focuses less on managing opportunism and more on harnessing and managing opportunity. In that sense, it is closer to the essence of capitalism.

This chapter considers the legitimacy of shareholder (also known as investor) activism as a means of exercising influence in the corporate decision-making process and identifies engaged boards as a superior solution to addressing issues that activists attempt to address. Drawing on ideas from multiple principal agency theory, the board of directors' wider role is conceptualized as representing the common interests of multiple principals who have both common and divergent interests. When any one principal is able to serve its own interests by influencing corporate decision-making through shareholder/ investor activism, other principals' interests may be compromised. A set of initiatives available to boards is suggested that focuses on the social dimension of their strategic governance role in mediating among multiple stakeholders to address their concerns while at the same time working towards the long-term sustainability of the business. The chapter highlights the application of multiple principal agency theory to the context of corporate governance, along with other concepts relating to the social dimension and the emerging relational perspective on board competence. From these perspectives it is proposed that the board takes a proactive role in leading this type of engagement, while at the same time recognizing that directors will need better relational skills than has traditionally been expected of them in fulfilling their fiduciary responsibilities.

This study investigates the effect of government ownership structure, business risk and financial leverage among other variables (size, age and growth) on a company's performance in a panel data, using 191 companies from five GCC countries (Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait), during the period 1999- 2006. Our results indicate that government ownership affects the performance and value of GCC firms. Government ownership positively and significantly affects firm's performance ROA. The insignificance of a firm's leverage (LEV) indicates that the firm's performance is irrelevant to its capital structure, and that supports Modigliani and Miller (M&M) (1958) argument. Our finding is that business risk (BETA) significantly and positively affects firm's performance ROE and supports the classic risk trade-off arguments. Furthermore, age was found to have a positive and significant impact on firm's performance ROA and ROE. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the effects of large shareholdings from the agency problem perspective of overinvestment, and retest the role of board independence in the context of concentrated ownership. Using a fiveyear panel data of Chinese nonfinancial listed companies between 2001 and 2005, the paper estimates both a fixedeffects model and a randomeffects model. The paper finds evidence of a significant nonmonotonic relationship between large shareholdings and firm level overinvestment. It also finds that stateowned firms and firms with more independent directors experience lower level of overinvestment. However, firms with more frequent meetings experience a higher level of overinvestment. The paper's findings indicate that concentrated ownership is not always a bad thing. The crux of the matter is how to induce large shareholders' incentive to monitor managers' opportunistic behaviors and restrict their motivation to expropriate minority shareholders. In the context of concentrated ownership, the key to improve corporate governance is to strengthen board independence. The paper provides useful information on nonmonotonic governance effects of large shareholdings in Chinese listed companies and overinvestment. (c) 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

The purpose of this article is to review and systematize prior work on technological innovation in family firms and to open up an agenda to guide future research into this promising area. The study shows that family involvement has direct effects on innovation inputs (e.g., R&D expenditures), activities (e.g., leadership in new product development projects), and outputs (e.g., number of new products), as well as moderating effects on the relationships between these steps of technological innovation. The article uses theories applied in family business research (e.g., agency theory) to discuss opportunities for extending technological innovation frameworks by considering family involvement.

There has been much debate concerning the performance of family firms and the drivers of their performance. Some scholars have argued that family management is to blame when family firms go wrong; others claim that family management removes costly agency problems and encourages stewardship. Our thesis is that these disagreements can only be resolved by distinguishing among different types of family firms. We argue that family CEOs will outperform in smaller firms with more concentrated ownership and underperform in larger firms with more dispersed ownership; they will do neither where firms are smaller and ownership is more dispersed or firms are larger and ownership is more concentrated.

We develop a contingency approach to explain how firm ownership influences the monitoring function of the board - measured as the magnitude of external audit fees contracted by the board - by extending agency theory to incorporate the resource dependence notion that boards have distinct incentives and abilities to monitor management. Analyses of data on Continental European companies reveal that while board independence and audit services are complementary when ownership is dispersed, this is not the case when ownership is concentrated - suggesting that ownership concentration and board composition become substitutes in terms of monitoring management. Additional analysis shows that the relationship between board composition and external audit fees is also contingent upon the type of the controlling shareholder.

We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory and propose that cross-national comparison of corporate governance should consider how the nature and extent of agency relationships differ across different institutional contexts. Building on prior governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory we argue that performance outcomes of boards of directors, ownership concentration, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Institutions may also affect the extent of complimentarity/substitution among different firm-level governance practices producing patterned variations in firm-level governance mechanisms. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational outcomes of various governance practices.

Taking an agency theory perspective of managers as risk averse and self-interest seeking and focusing on externally generated analyst forecasts as the performance target, we propose that managers tend to cut R&D expenses when they are under pressure to meet analyst forecasts, especially when they face an increase in employment risk after missing the forecasts. We further argue that analyst coverage can serve as an external monitoring mechanism to help contain this agency problem. We test these arguments with data from a sample of U.S. manufacturing firms during the period of 1979 to 2005. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Despite increased attention given to family firms in the theory of organization and management, the value of family governance in emerging markets is not clearly understood. We draw insights from agency and institutional economics perspectives to address the debate on whether family governance fills or abuses the void left by weaker market and legal institutions. We propose a dual focus on the pattern of family control and weak institutions to reconcile these opposed assessments. We analyze how various combinations of family control over ownership, strategy, and operations yield different benefits and costs for the operational performance of firms in the absence of strong market and legal institutions. The uneven development of market institutions across industries and the impact of independent directors reinforce the importance of separating different patterns of family control. We find support for our hypotheses when tested on a data set consisting of all publicly listed firms in Taiwan between 1996 and 2005. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of family businesses in emerging markets, highlights the importance of weak institutions in shaping relative agency costs, and illuminates the differential effects of independent directors.

This article aims to increase our understanding of family firms' entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior by looking at the differences between family and nonfamily firms and by studying variations among family firms. We find empirical support for a positive influence of a nonfamily CEO on the family firm's level of entrepreneurial risk taking during the initial years of his or her CEO tenure and a leveling out of entrepreneurial risk taking as the CEO tenure of the nonfamily CEO is extended. We build on the concept of psychological ownership to explain these new findings. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

In this study we investigate how the dispersion of family ownership among family members affects the performance of small-to-medium-size family firms. Based on agency theory and prior research on family firms, we develop arguments pointing to the existence of a U-shaped relationship between the degree of family ownership dispersion and firm performance. We also consider the involvement of family members in top management as a moderating factor of this relationship. The empirical analyses conducted on 494 small-to-medium size private family firms in Italy support our hypotheses and offer further evidence about curvilinear relationships between family ownership and family involvement in management, and performance. Overall, our study represents a theoretical synthesis and extension of the effects of family involvement on the performance of small-to-medium size private firms. It adds empirical evidence to this stream of research, offers new insights into the sources of heterogeneity among the population of family firms, and paves the way for future investigations on other organizational outcomes, especially firm growth, in family firms.

Several unique characteristics of ventures distinguish them from public firms and lead to distinctive monitoring issues. In this article I develop a theoretical framework that links the attributes of the venture and the board composition with venture board monitoring and its implications for firm performance. Contributing to the strategy literature on corporate governance, the framework offers counterintuitive deviations from how agency theory is typically conceptualized, highlights that an unexpected "principal problem" could emerge as the separation of ownership and control is reduced, and presents novel insights about the interdependence between agency theory and resource dependence theory. This framework also adds to the research on entrepreneurial firms by complementing the extant emphasis in the literature on resource provisioning and by offering a richer view of key actors through opening the black box of strategic action in ventures. More broadly, by focusing on an underexamined but important context beyond public firms, this article highlights rich opportunities for developing a contingency theory of corporate governance.

Principals who delegate tasks to agents face the perennial challenge of overcoming agency problems. We investigate whether feelings of ownership among senior managers in the absence of formal ownership can align agents' interests with those of principals, thus turning agents into psychological principals. Using a moderated mediation model, we find that psychological ownership is positively related to company performance through the mediating effect of individual-level entrepreneurial behaviour. We also find that the effect of psychological ownership on individual-level entrepreneurial behaviour and, ultimately, company performance is weaker for high levels of monitoring compared to low levels. These findings offer important contributions to agency, psychological ownership, and entrepreneurship literatures.

Purpose: This study aims to measure the extent of mandatory and voluntary risk reporting and investigate the impact of competition, corporate governance and ownership structure on risk reporting practices in annual reports of Egyptian companies. Design/methodology/approach: A number of theoretical perspectives including proprietary cost, agency theory, stakeholder theory, political cost, signalling theory and legitimacy theory are used to derive research hypotheses and identify the potential determinants of risk reporting practices in the annual reports of Egyptian companies. The annual reports of 105 listed companies for 2007 were examined to measure the extent of risk reporting and examine potential determinants of risk reporting. An unweighted disclosure index, based on Egyptian Accounting Standards (EAS) 25, has been used to measure the level of mandatory risk reporting while content analysis - sentence approach - is used in coding voluntary risk reporting. Multiple regression analysis is used in evaluating the relationships between competition, corporate governance, ownership structure and risk reporting. Findings: The results indicate a low level of compliance with mandatory risk reporting requirements. A low extent of voluntary risk reporting with a tendency to report more backward-looking and qualitative risk disclosure compared to forward-looking and quantitative risk disclosure is indicated. Agency theory and proprietary cost provide explanations for the variation of risk reporting in corporate annual reports. It is suggested that competition, role duality, board size, ownership concentration and auditor type are key determinants of risk reporting practices in Egypt. Research limitations/implications: The scoring and classification process suffers from inherent judgment limitations and subjectivity, which cannot be entirely eradicated. The study applies a cross-sectional approach and examines risk reporting practice and its determinants at one point in time. However, longitudinal research may provide a better understanding of risk reporting practices of Egyptian companies. The use of only one proxy of competition is one of the limitations of this study. Practical implications: The findings regarding mandatory disclosure level and nature of voluntary risk disclosure should be on concern to regulatory authorities and standard-setters. Originality/value: The study aims to contribute to risk reporting research through addressing not only mandatory but also voluntary risk reporting in emerging economies in general and Egypt in particular. In addition, examining the impact of competition on risk reporting is a main contribution of this study. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study addresses a major gap in our knowledge about the allocation of information technology (IT) decision rights between business and IT units at the application level, including the governance of applications delivered on-premise versus those delivered with a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. Building on the findings from a multicase qualitative study of organizations that had adopted the same SaaS application, we draw on three theoretical lenses (agency theory, transaction cost economics, and knowledge-based view) to develop a theoretically grounded model with three organization-level factors, three application-level factors, and application-level IT governance. Hypotheses derived from the model, as well as a set of differential hypotheses about factor influences due to on-premise versus SaaS delivery, are tested with survey responses from 207 firms in which application-level governance is operationalized with two dimensions: decision control rights (decision authority) and decision management rights (task responsibility). Three antecedents (origin of the application initiative, scope of application use, business knowledge of the IT unit) were significantly associated with application governance postimplementation, and the on-premise/SaaS subgroup analyses provide preliminary evidence for the mode of application delivery as a moderator of these relationships. Overall, this study contributes to a growing body of research that takes a more modular approach to studying IT governance and provides theoretical explanations for differing application-level governance designs.

Drawing on a framework from agency theory, we examine the relation between the decision-making power of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and the financial performance of 468 United Kingdom (UK) publicly listed companies (plcs) using a dynamic panel data estimation method for the six years 2003-2008. We measure CEO power using a 'power index' which captures the extent to which the autonomy of the CEO to make unilateral decisions could influence firms' financial performance. To test for robustness, our analysis is conducted using different measures of financial performance. Our results reveal that, consistent with previous UK research, CEO power, as defined by CEO-Chair duality, CEO-tenure and CEO share ownership, is negatively related to financial performance. We also find that concentrated ownership is inversely related to the performance of UK plcs. CEO's compensation and board structure, however, do not appear to be related to the financial performance of the UK plcs. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

An increasing share of the economy is organized around financial capitalism, where capital market actors actively manage their claims on wealth creation and distribution to maximize shareholder value. Drawing on four case studies of private equity buyouts, we challenge agency theory interpretations that they are 'welfare neutral' and show that an alternative source of shareholder value is breach of trust and implicit contracts. We show why management and employment relations scholars need to investigate the mechanisms of financial capitalism to provide a more accurate analysis of the emergence of new forms of class relations and to help us move beyond the limits of the varieties of capitalism approach to comparative institutional analysis.

Driven by the ongoing discussion of corporate responsibility, growing numbers of companies have been publishing what have become known as sustainability reports. These reports have in part been subject to voluntary external assurance. Although the percentage of assured reports is significant, the market for this kind of assurance is still in an early stage of development. In this context the present article will ascertain the theoretical determining factors in the demand for voluntary external assurance and subject these in relation to the markets in Germany, the Netherlands and Great Britain to empirical analysis. In the context of the development of hypotheses shaped by agency theory, the constructs of agency costs and signalling can be distinguished. Variables measuring these constructs will be examined. It can be shown that the type and scope of the reporting (i.e., the choice of the Global Reporting Initiative 'application level'), the existence of a sustainability department, and the size of the company are associated with the demand for voluntary assurance. Additional control variables are examined. Here it appears that the demand for external assurance is highest in Great Britain. Finally, research opportunities in this field will be indicated and recent normative developments briefly sketched. (c) 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

This study examines the idiosyncratic manager-specific influence on corporate cash holdings. Although traditional economic theories such as trade-off theory, financial hierarchy theory and agency free cash flow theory have already contributed to a deeper understanding of corporate cash policy, we examine whether the integration of the Upper Echelons Theory (UET) into these traditional theories provides additional power in explaining corporate cash holdings. We contend that social, psychological and cognitive characteristics of CEOs, proxied by a number of CEO demographics, affect the level of importance that CEOs (and shareholders) attach to the economic arguments provided by the traditional theories, in turn affecting cash policy. We test our hypotheses using a sample of Belgian privately held SMEs. Controlling for the impact of traditional economic theories our findings suggest that older CEOs and CEOs without experience in other industries are more concerned with the precautionary motive of cash and less concerned with the opportunity cost of cash, giving rise to higher cash levels compared to younger CEOs and CEOs with other-industry experience. This indicates that cash policy in Belgian privately held SMEs reflects the natural tendencies of CEOs. Since cash policy affects shareholder value, it is important for stakeholders to consider the demographics of present or new CEOs and to understand their associated inclinations concerning cash policy.

This study explored sport governance practice from the lived experience of one informant spanning a 30-year period in the governance of two sport organisations (basketball and cricket). Hermeneutic phenomenology, the methodological framework used for this study, seeks to grasp the everyday world, and draw insight and meaning from it. The method involves a series of in-depth interviews with one research participant, supplemented by document analysis. Interviews were analysed using an interpretative process which blended the world views of both the participant and researchers. The participant lived through an era of increasing professionalisation within sport. His narrative, which tapped into his governance expertise at state, national and international levels, provides insights into the transition from an amateur to a commercial culture, referred to in this paper as 'two worlds colliding'. From this narrative, three related themes were identified and labelled, 'volunteer and cultural encounters'; 'structural encounters'; and 'adversarial encounters'. In drawing on hermeneutic philosophy, and highlighting that which has been hidden from view, direction for future research and practice within the sport governance domain is offered. These directions invite scholars to think about future sport governance research as it relates to federated structures and how collaborative governance theory can sharpen the focus in this domain.

We develop the concept of stakeholder salience to account for stakeholders who should matter to the firm, even when managers do not perceive them as important. While managers are responsible for attributing salience to stakeholders, they can overlook or ignore stakeholder importance because of market frictions that affect managerial perceptions or induce opportunism. When this happens, corporate financial and social performance can suffer. Thus, we propose that the perceptions of organizational and societal stakeholders should also codetermine the salience of the focal stakeholder to the firm. We also propose that stakeholder dialogue can reduce the impacts that market frictions can have on managerial perceptions of stakeholder interests that should matter to the firm. Finally, we discuss how the refined conceptualization of stakeholder salience might have better predictive validity, be more normative, and make instrumental and normative stakeholder theory more convergent.

Quality-related incidents involving contract manufacturers (CMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent. The quality management (QM) literature, however, has focused mostly on QM within a single firm. Thus, the need for data-driven research on managing quality with outsourced production is evident. We investigate the use and effectiveness of external failure penalties and audits of CMs' facilities to manage inter-firm quality. Building on agency theory and extant QM literature, this study addresses two research questions: (i) whether the control mechanisms of quality audits and contractual external quality failure penalties are substitutes or complements in use and (ii) whether they are substitutes or complements in their effectiveness at aligning the quality interests of customers and their CMs. Our analysis uses dyadic data gathered from brand-owning firms and their CMs representing 95 contract manufacturing relationships in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated industries. The results indicate that more severe external failure penalties correspond to a lower use of facility audits (i.e., they are substitutes-in-use). We also find that both external failure penalties and facility audits have a unique positive effect on the CM's perception of relative quality importance. Finally, some evidence supports the hypothesis that each mechanism is more effective in the presence of the other (i.e., they are complements-in-effectiveness).

We investigate the relationship between firm governance and the board's position in the social network of directors. Using a sample of 133 German firms over the four-year period from 2003 to 2006, we find that firms with intensely connected supervisory boards are (1) associated with lower firm performance, and (2) pay their executives significantly more. We interpret these results as evidence of poor monitoring in firms with directors who are more embedded in the social network. In both cases, simple measures for busy directors that were used by other studies in the past fail to show any significant pattern. The findings suggest that the quality and structural position of additional board seats may play a bigger role than simply the number of board appointments. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Direct transfer (Type I tunneling) means that the controlling shareholders transfer resources from the firm for their own benefit. This study aims to investigate the impact of internal and external governance mechanisms from the perspective of principal-principal (P-P) conflicts on Type I tunneling. Research Findings/Insights: Using hand-collected data comprising 117 Chinese listed companies with 540 firm-year observations during 2001-2005, the results show that state ownership and the number of board of directors' meetings are positively correlated with Type I tunneling, whereas the number of independent directors reveals a negative association. Other internal governance mechanisms including foreign ownership, the size of the board of directors, supervisory board size, number of professional supervisors, and the number of supervisory board meetings were found to have no impact. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Several implications can be drawn. First, this study has modeled tunneling using a well-accepted theoretical perspective - agency theory of P-P conflicts. But the results show that agency theory does not appropriately explain tunneling behavior in China and so institutional theory is suggested as an alternative theoretical perspective for future research. Second, corporate governance reforms relating to supervisory boards have not been sufficient to ensure that they properly fulfill their role of oversight. Rather, such supervisory boards are perhaps playing more of a "rubber stamp" role. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study recommends prescribing the legal responsibilities and obligations for two-tier boards in the Chinese context, allowing them to undertake their duties diligently.

Purpose: Companies implement corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices along their supply chains to fulfil stakeholder requirements. In doing so, failures in which CSR aspects are violated also emerge, caused by single supply chain members. In these situations, quite often the other supply chain members also appear responsible although they mostly do not have complete control over suppliers and sub-suppliers due to information gaps. Therefore, the malpractice of one single company can harm the reputation of related companies. This paper aims to analyse recent CSR failures along food supply chains with the aim of evaluating why these occurred and what possibilities exist to avoid similar failures in the future. Design/methodology/approach: Agency theory analyses information asymmetries in relationships in which one party delegates work to another party. In the considered failures, the downstream company can be regarded as principal by ordering products from the suppliers (agents). Consequently, agency theory contributes towards understanding failures in CSR implementation and highlighting solutions. Findings: The cases analysed illustrate that CSR failures can have negative impacts on the companies' reputation and therefore also financial effects. Implementing a successful CSR policy should therefore be a primary interest of companies. Agency theory proved suitable to illustrate supply chain relationships and point out implications for companies. The instruments of agency theory can help to avoid CSR failures in food supply chains. Originality/value: The paper combines agency theory with failures in CSR along food supply chains. In doing so, new insights into supply chain relationships are gained and implications for supply chain members to avoid CSR failures can be deduced. One special characteristic of the analysed failures is that the principal is not aimed at increasing the quantity of the agent's output but the quality. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on the financial performance of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) listed firms. Design/methodology/approach: Relying on a sample of 95 UAE listed firms affiliated to financial and non-financial sectors, the paper performs a cross-section regression analysis to test whether there is a significant relationship between governance mechanisms (voluntary disclosure, CEO duality, board size, board committee and audit type) and UAE firms' performance while controlling for firm size, industry type, firm listing years and leverage. The paper relies on data published on year 2008 and utilizes the accounting-based measures of Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) as well as the market measure (Tobin's Q) in order to measure the UAE firms' financial performance. Findings: The empirical results show that voluntary disclosure, CEO duality and board size are significantly influencing the UAE accounting-based performance measure, while none of the governance variables significantly affects firms' market performance measure. The results also reveal that firm size is the only control variable that significantly influences firms' performance. This paper provides evidence showing that the accounting-based performance measures are more objective in the years where unstable economic conditions exist. Practical implications: The paper's findings indicate that the underlying principles of corporate governance are applicable in emerging markets. The findings are important to regulators, investors, managers, and researchers aiming at developing new policies that establish better regulatory infrastructure that increases investors' confidence and attracting foreign investment. Originality/value: The paper is one of very few studies that examine the relationship between corporate governance and firms' financial performance under economic turbulent in an emerging market economy, the UAE.

A significant amount of research has examined firms' decisions to adopt poison pills; however, firms today are increasingly repealing or allowing poison pills to expire. Based on agency theory, the authors examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than substitutes. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

This study examines relations between the overall level of effective information technology (IT) governance and five commonly advocated individual mechanisms of IT governance. It extends the examination of individual IT governance mechanisms to include a wider number of mechanisms, justifies the mechanisms investigated via agency theory, seeks to relate these mechanisms specifically to a perceived overall level of effective IT governance in organizations, and attempts to mitigate the problems of limited generalizability and selection bias by employing a survey and generalized sampling research methodology. The results from a survey of professional auditors reveal significant positive relations between the overall level of effective IT governance and three IT governance mechanisms: IT steering committees, senior management involvement in IT, and corporate performance measurement systems. Ex-post sensitivity analyses reveal that the primary findings are qualitatively similar across internal auditors and external auditors, as well as information systems auditors (IS) and non-IS auditors.

This study seeks to understand the underlying relationship between managerial ownership and corporate social performance in privately owned Chinese firms. Agency theory predicts that corporate expenditure on social practices is merely a managerial expropriation in an ordinary business setting. However, the business context of natural disasters in China has been characterized by stakeholder pressure on corporate responsibility. We propose that in our context of study, corporate social performance constitutes an investment and managers who own significant parts of the company are more likely to promote corporate philanthropic actions. Using a hand-collected database that includes firm-level data on corporate contributions after the Sichuan Earthquake on 12 May 2008, we find that higher managerial ownership is associated with a significantly higher probability of donation and charity. Furthermore, we find that corporate board size and political ties with the government moderate this relationship. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

This study examines if Chief Executive Officer (CEO) duality reduces the firms' agency cost in Bangladesh. The agency costs are measured as two efficiency ratios: 'expense ratio' and 'asset utilization ratio'. The finding is that, there is no significant relationship between CEO duality and agency costs. These findings imply that, duality may have given the CEOs enormous powers; it may have reduced the check and balance or board's ability to exercise the governance (monitoring) function, which is not helpful to enhance firm efficiency. This study contributes to the global debate on CEO duality and provides a new avenue of knowledge on CEO duality and firm efficiency in the context of an emerging economy.

Can internal corporate governance mechanisms (such as boards of directors) and external corporate governance mechanisms (such as institutional reform) promote risk-taking behavior in family firms? This paper argues that conflicts between majority and minority owners, known as principal-principal conflicts, and cronyism in the board of directors affect firm risk taking. Moreover, institutional corporate governance reform to appoint outside directors may not have an immediate effect on reducing these problems. Based on a sample of family firms in Taiwan, we find that outside directors reduce the negative relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking. However, when their influence is examined further, it is found that in those sample firms that went public after institutional reform, outside directors did not improve the relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking.

We present empirical evidence on traditional and family firm-specific determinants of cash holdings in the under-researched context of private family firms. We examine, from an agency theoretic perspective, how and to what extent the relation between family firm management and cash holdings is moderated by the ownership structure. Results reveal that descendant CEOs appear to maintain higher cash holdings than founder CEOs. This effect seems to be stronger if there is a low ownership dispersion. Moreover, outside CEOs maintain higher cash holdings than family CEOs if the family firm is owned by a single owner. (c) 2012 The Authors. Accounting and Finance (c) 2012 AFAANZ.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: Given its position as a dominant logic in corporate governance, this paper evaluates the theoretical and practical implications of agency theory on good governance. Agency theory is presented as consisting of two layers, one resting on the assumption of oppositional shareholder-manager interests and the other resting on the assumption of supportive shareholder-society interests. Given the dominance of the simple economic depiction of agency theory, its first layer is heavily researched and supported, while the second layer is largely unsubstantiated and often exploited to obscure inefficiencies in the first layer. Research Findings/Insights: Agency theory is shown to fill a highly institutionalized position in governance, despite often violating the second layer's assumption of aligned shareholder-society interests. We assert that the relationship between societal benefits and value maximization must be reconceptualized from interdependent to correlated but independent. Otherwise, when the second layer of agency theory is undercut, shareholders can eschew their role as societal guardians to partner with managers and engage in mutual managerialism at the expense of society. We detail how inefficiencies in first layer mechanisms (market regulation, monitoring, and contracts) impact agency theory's second layer and present the new mechanisms of oversight boards and expanded founding firm documents to reintegrate a societal orientation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Aligned shareholder-society interests are shown to be frequently undermined, artificially substantiating the second layer assumption that societal betterment can be sufficiently promoted via financial rewards and sanctions. We discuss agency theory's underlying logic and present the possibility that a violated second layer can be exploited to obscure first layer inefficiencies. Ineffectiveness in the first layer's key mechanisms is shown to potentially undercut agency theory's promotion of good corporate governance on an organizational and societal level. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Oversight boards and expanded founding firm documents are presented to make agency theory's second layer explicit, ensuring the assumed supportive nature of the shareholder-society relationship is substantiated. Specifically, oversight boards formalize how members of boards of directors are vetted, oversee societal claims to ensure that appropriate ones are sufficiently presented and addressed, supervise reporting, and sanction firms who fail to enact these duties. Revised founding documents ensure that both economic and social goals are enshrined in the mission of incorporated firms. Together the two help establish the foundation of a measurable approach to socially responsible actions. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between audit committee expertise and financial reporting quality. Since the Sarbanes Oxley Act, 2002, there has been growing interest in the research concerning audit committee expertise, especially as the Security Exchange Commission requires firms to identify their audit committee financial experts. Based on two theories, the resource dependence theory and agency theory, the study examines the association of audit committee experts with financial reporting quality, proxied by earnings management. Samples involved 2008 financial data of 300 firms that were ranked by highest market capitalisation. In total, four types of expertise are developed based on academic qualification, professional qualification and work experience. Presence of non-accounting experts and accounting experts is significant to reduce the magnitude of earnings management. Other than that, leverage and firms size are also found to be significant. The findings show RDT is prevalent in accounting or auditing domain, where there is evidence showing directors bridge firms with external resources such as expertise and experience. Subsequently, contribute to the mainstream accounting literature that the resource dependence theory is also vital in explaining situations where directors' expertise and knowledge are involved.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine voluntary risk disclosures within annual reports in four key South-East Asian countries' (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Australia) manufacturing listed companies over the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) 2007-2009 financial years. Design/methodology/approach - Longitudinal and cross-country analyses test the veracity of agency theory to predict the level of firms' risk disclosures. A comprehensive risk disclosure index (RDI) checklist is created with key predictor variables (country, company size, managerial ownership and board independence) tested to explain the dissemination of CSR information over time. Findings - The findings show that the communication of risk data stays relatively consistent (26-29 per cent across the three GFC 'crisis' years). This is arguably a low level of communication from a social responsibility corporate lens. Multiple regression analysis provides evidence that country, size and board independence are positively significantly associated and leverage is negatively significantly associated with the extent of voluntary risk disclosure. Interestingly, Indonesia, the least developed country with arguably the highest business risk factors, consistently has statistically lower levels of risk disclosure compared with their three neighbours. Research limitations/implications - The sample frame is selected from the stock exchange population of manufacturing companies in key South-East Asian countries. However, for complete generalization the findings should be tested in other countries and other industries. Practical implications - The study findings are useful for firm self-evaluation and benchmarking of risk communication by other corporations across countries. Social implications - The study shows relatively low levels of risk disclosure over the GFC crisis time period. Communication of these items are influenced by key firm characteristics and economic drivers. Arguably, higher risk disclosure leads to better understanding of a company's social responsibility stance. Originality/value - This is a critically important time span to investigate risk disclosures as it encompasses those years most directly impacted by the global financial crisis (GFC).

Research on senior executive reward has typically explored the connection between pay, performance and the alignment of interests of executives and shareholders. This article examines the relationship between reward and motivation, drawing on the psychological, behavioural economics and decision-making literatures. Based on an empirical study of FTSE 350 senior executives, the research examines whether long-term incentive plans are an effective and efficient way of motivating executives, taking into account risk, time discounting, uncertainty and fairness. The article concludes that the way executives frame choices, perceive value, assess probability, evaluate temporal effects and respond to uncertainty means that long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) are generally not efficient and are often not effective in meeting their objectives. It proposes that, in its current form, agency theory does not provide a sound basis for modelling senior executive reward, and suggests five areas for development. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of corporate governance on auditor quality choice by IPO companies in an emerging market setting. It seeks to identify whether efficiency or opportunism is the driving force behind the choice of auditors in Bangladeshi firms going public. We try to see whether ownership concentration in the hands of a owner-CEO wins over foreign shareholders in the contest of ensuring financial reporting quality. Design/methodology/approach - Multivariate analysis has been carried out on all IPOs made during 1990 to 2005 whose financial statements were available. Logistic regression tool has been used to identify client's corporate governance attributes affect their choice of auditors. In total, three corporate governance attributes - CEO-Chair duality, retained ownership, and foreign equity participation - were used to test the impact of ownership structure on auditor choice. Findings - Our findings from logistic regression suggest that CEO-Chair duality and the degree of foreign equity participation are significant determinants of auditor choice while proportion of board ownership is not. In addition, issuer size and whether the issuer is a green field operation also influence auditor choice while the length of a firm's operating history does not seem to matter. The findings support agency theory prediction that (at least one category of) principals (foreign shareholders in this case), are likely to trade-off higher monitoring costs (of hiring a higher quality auditor) with agency costs arising from asymmetric information, primarily borne by absentee owners. Originality/value - The work is based on empirical data directly from company financial statements. It uses audited financial statements and makes objective analysis of auditor choice dynamics in a frontier market that demonstrated significant growth of IPO activity in recent years.

Human resource shared service centers (HR SSCs) are foreseen as improving HR service delivery for their end-users: employees, line managers and decentralized HR professionals. Although the concept expects the benefits of HR SSCs to come from centralizing knowledge and decentralizing the control exercised over an HR SSC, research into these two fundamental shared service characteristics is scarce. The purpose of this research is therefore to explore whether resource bundling, combined with business unit control over an HR SSC, is sufficient to improve HR service delivery to its end-users. Using concepts from intellectual capital and agency theory, we find that the combination of these two characteristics of shared services is not sufficient to improve HR service delivery. Rather, we suggest that (1) HR SSCs have to update the knowledge and skills of their staff; (2) end-users have to effectively maintain the codified knowledge centralized in the HR SSC; and (3) business units and the HR SSC need to collaborate in order for the benefits of an HR shared service to be realized.

This work reports on an investigation of the dynamics of governance over breakthrough innovation within Fortune 1000 firms. The primary research question investigates the boundary of agency theory within the firm. Using agency and stakeholder theoretic perspectives, the study tests the hypothesis that innovation will thrive in firms that combine a board of directors operating in accordance with a high agency theoretic focus in addition to an innovation governance board operating deeper within the firm that employs a strong stakeholder theoretic orientation in its behavior. The model is tested with data from 98 large firms. Results suggest that the relationship between board of directors' behavior and the firm's overall innovativeness is mediated by innovation decision-making boards that (1) promote projects that are breakthrough in scope, (2) incorporate input of diverse constituencies within the firm, (3) exhibit patience with financial results, and (4) engage in frequent, informal interactions with project teams. Firms exhibiting high board of director agency orientation in combination with loyalty to mandate, patient financial capital disposition, inclusiveness, and project team interaction as described above for innovation governance board decision-making prove to be the most innovative as measured by external indicators. For firm innovativeness, consolidated managerial power and behavior is frequently present at the upper levels of the firm, but must be broken down at deeper levels of the firm. This research offers implications to innovation decision-makers as to how to proceed if the intent is to offer commercializably successful breakthrough innovations.

This study integrates the research on corporate political strategy and corporate governance. Using the agency theory perspective, this study examines how corporate governance mechanisms such as institutional ownership, insider ownership, and long-term executive compensation affect a firm's political strategy approach. This study proposes that an agency problem may occur between owners and managers in regard to firms' approach to corporate political strategy. Since a relational approach to corporate political strategy, such as establishing a government relations office in Washington, DC, requires significant resource commitments without guaranteeing a favorable policy change, shareholders might be reluctant to approve such an approach. In a sample of 3,417 U.S. manufacturing firms, over 5 years of data, the results show that institutional ownership and insider ownership are negatively associated with firms' propensity to engage in a relational approach to political strategy.

The philosophy of science offers two different perspectives on how empirical findings contribute to knowledge accumulation. The "law-statement" perspective interprets contributions to the extent that empirical research confirms or refutes general axioms of theory. Alternatively, the "model-theoretic" perspective recognizes contributions from models that improve scholars' ability to represent the world of managers. Management scholars often have limited awareness of the philosophical tradition underlying the model-theoretic perspective, and, consequently, useful contributions from improved models of important phenomena may be overlooked. Drawing on model-theoretic philosophy, we identify three ways in which empirical research contributes to theoretical knowledge without necessarily verifying or falsifying theoretical axioms, through the grafting, contextualizing, and repurposing of representational models. We provide examples of each by focusing on studies investigating incentive alignment. Finally, we discuss how the model-theoretic perspective contributes to an ongoing discussion about improving theoretical precision in management research. (c) Academy of Management Review 2013.

Practice-oriented publications have recently suggested a movement in the Chief Financial Officer's (CFO) role towards a more strategic role. In a family business, the CFO position is often the first into which a non-family manager is hired. However, the role of the non-family CFO in a family business is underresearched. Hence, this article uses previous findings as well as social role theory, agency theory, stewardship theory, and the resource-based view to investigate the role of the non-family CFO in family businesses compared to that in non-family businesses. Nine propositions are developed, which suggest not only a more traditional role for CFOs in family businesses, but also fewer monitoring efforts for the CFO in this setting. The article concludes with avenues for further research and concrete future research questions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Call centres are increasingly being utilised in public sector programmes to facilitate and manage communication between numerous stakeholders. Yet, the impact of call centres on projects has not been investigated. This paper reports on a survey with 92 respondents that assessed the impact of a call centre for a repair and maintenance programme. An empirically verified model is presented to illustrate the relationship between call centre communication and project performance. A balance of frequent informal and formal communication is shown to reduce mistrust and conflict of interest resulting from each party trying to maximise his respective economic position in the principal-agency relationship. The data provides evidence that a call centre improves the communication, collaboration and trust in project principal-agency relationships which, in turn, is perceived to contribute to project performance.

Purpose: Based on the agency theory, the purpose of this paper is to theoretically argue and empirically investigate how ownership structure impacts the capital structure of the listed mid-cap companies in India and whether the capital structure as exogenous variable has a role in determining ownership structure as well. Design/methodology/approach: Simultaneity between capital structure and ownership structure is checked through Hausman specification test on endogeneity. Fixed effect panel regression model is used to analyze five years of data (2005-2009) on the sample units, to find the relation between leverage and ownership structure after controlling for profitability, risk, tangibility, growth and size. Findings: Empirical results on Indian firms suggest that the ownership structure does impact capital structure but not the vice versa. Consistent with theoretical prediction empirical results reveal that the leverage is positively related to concentrated shareholding and has a negative relation with diffuseness of shareholding after controlling for profitability, risk, tangibility, growth and size. The findings are consistent with "managerial entrenchment hypothesis" and "pecking order theory" of capital structure. Practical implications: The findings of the paper will enable the practitioners and analysts to understand as to why, in the bank and financial institution-dominated debt financing system in India, leverage is closely associated with concentrated ownership pattern and why retained earning is a preferred vehicle of financing for the firms with diffused shareholding. Originality/value: The results of the study enrich the literature on capital structure, agency cost and corporate governance issues in several ways. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates the impact of family control on French acquirers' performance.We consider a sample of 239 acquisitions undertaken by French listed companies between January 1997 and December 2006. Comparing both, short-termand long-termperformance,we find that family-controlled firms outperformnon-family firms. We find that the relationship depends on the control level. The higher operating performance of family firms is statistically significant for an intermediate level of control. Around the announcement date, family firms with a high level of control outperform non-family firms. Using the calendar time approach, we find that long-term stock performance of family firms is positive and statistically significant. Robustness tests showthat our findings seem to not be driven by the endogeneity problem. Finally, we find that family wedge, due to the use of the pyramidal structure and the double voting rules, has no statistical significant effect. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This review article seeks to celebrate the deconstruction of the mythology of shareholder value inspired by Lynn Stout, and to dismantle the hegemony of agency theory, which originated the concepts of shareholder value and shareholder primacy. In order to offer a contextualized, historical critique of the intellectual forces that created agency theory and the concept of shareholder value, the analysis presents a broad consideration of the financialization of the Anglo-American corporation in the later decades of the twentieth century. It was in this period that the Anglo-American corporation was crudely transformed from being a wealth-creating vehicle for the wider community of stakeholders and whole economy, into a bundle of assets with the sole purpose of benefiting shareholder interests. This analysis traces some of the historical critique of corporate purpose, and the wider implications of the critique for corporate activity. The article goes on to analyse the interpretations of corporate purpose emerging in modern company law reform. Finally, the article considers the implications of the growing international corporate social responsibility movement for directors' duties, which is arguably in contradiction to many of the fundamental beliefs of shareholder value, and recasts the direction of corporations towards more responsible and sustainable value creation.

This article addresses value creation by corporate centres of multi-business firms through vertical intervention in single business units. Drawing on parenting literature, agency theory, and the resource-based view, we develop a model comprising an interlinked set of hypotheses on value creation. These take into account the administrative as well as the entrepreneurial value creation function of a corporate centre. The model depicts value creation from the perspective of individual businesses in an unrelated-diversified portfolio and is tested in a unique and unconventional research setting. Regarding the necessity to add value to businesses, we consider private equity firms to have a similar role as the centre of an unrelated diversified multi-business firm, and analyse survey data on 267 portfolio companies using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The results show that corporate centres can create value through vertical intervention in single business units, by reducing agency costs through governance mechanisms as part of their administrative function and, interestingly, by also providing businesses access to strategic resources during the course of their entrepreneurial function. In particular, the provision of intangible resources, i.e., the knowledge and networks of the corporate centre, shows to have a value creating effect on business units. Not related to the units' performance is a corporate centre's attempt to create value using horizontal synergy by fostering the cooperation of a business unit with other units. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study has extended existing research on CEO power, pay structure, and firm performance, offering models based mainly on agency theory and managerial power theory, and testing hypotheses using data from 112 companies across a five-year span (2001-2005) in computer-related industry groups in the United States. The results indicated that power from executive directorship positively impacts a firm's return on assets and return on equity, and that CEO power from duality negatively impacts CEO long-term pay and total pay, while CEO power from tenure positively impacts CEO long-term pay and pay leverage, and composite power negatively impacts short-term pay. Evidence for CEO pay as a mediator between CEO power and firm performance revealed that CEO short-term pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance but negatively impacts its market value, regardless of which source of power is being controlled. CEO total pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance, with power from CEO duality, directorship, or composite power being controlled. Hence, and in general, CEO pay fails to significantly mediate the relationships between CEO power and firm performance. The contributions include a multiple-perspective study of CEO power, compensation, and firm performance to comprehensively discover each of their respective relationships. This study has further extended the debate over agency perspectives with stewardship perspectives to fill knowledge and theoretical gaps. Thus, evidence-based findings provide boards of directors with practical knowledge for sound governance with another avenue for future research in corporate governance.

We adopt a construct validity lens to provide a critical reexamination of established corporate governance research. In particular, we focus on the body of work relying on the theoretical bases of agency theory and involving boards of directors' independence, CEO duality, equity holdings, and their relationships to corporate financial performance. We offer a five-step protocol involving the following components: (1) establishing the base rate for the phenomenon in question, (2) evaluating the extent to which the dependent variables are germane, (3) evaluating the extent to which the independent variables are germane, (4) determining whether explanatory power is improved as a consequence of improved measurement, and (5) concluding whether previously established estimates should be revised. We implemented the proposed protocol and used alternative measures that reduce threats to construct validity. Results yielded substantially higher estimates of relationships in corporate governance research. Future research can adopt the proposed protocol to understand whether a similar improvement in explanatory power could be achieved in other research domains. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: The main purpose of the present research is to study the relationship between ownership concentration and the type of ownership, i.e. state, firm (legal persons), individual, family, institutional - on the value of the companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE). Design/methodology/approach: The study applies panel data regression analysis to a sample of companies listed in TSE during the period 2005-2009. Two-stage least-squares analysis is conducted. Findings: The paper finds that ownership concentration is positively related to ROE, and that ownership concentration is negatively related to ROA. Moreover, state, family, and individual ownership are negatively related to performance, and firm (legal person) and institutional ownership are positively related to performance. The paper also finds that higher firm profitability requires a more diffused ownership structure. Research limitations/implications: The results of the present research support agency theory and efficient monitoring hypothesis. The results strongly suggest the failure of state ownership in increasing companies' value and underline the importance of accelerating privatization in Iran. Practical implications: To improve the performance and consequently the value of companies, the process of privatization in Iran must be accelerated and public ownership must be transferred to the private sector. Further, investors must pay special attention to the type of ownership and ownership concentration of companies when deciding to buy their shares. Originality/value: The study builds on prior research in several ways. First, the paper offers new insights into the relationship between corporate governance and economic performance by using data from Iranians listed firms, this new evidence from an emerging market enhances the understanding of corporate governance in Asian countries. Second, the study focuses on five dimensions: ownership concentration, state, firm, individual, family, and institutional ownership which allow one to get a more accurate picture of the ownership structure-firm value relationship.

This paper reconsiders the issue of share price reactions to dividend announcements. We use the difference between the actual dividend and the analyst consensus forecast as obtained from I/B/E/S as a proxy for the surprise in the dividend announcement. Using data from Germany, we find significant share price reactions after dividend announcements. We use panel methods to analyze the determinants of the share price reactions and find evidence in favour of the cash flow signaling hypothesis and dividend clientele effects. We further find that the price reaction to dividend surprises is related to the ownership structure of the firm. The results do not support the free cash flow hypothesis. An additional result of our analysis is that dividend changes are not an appropriate measure to capture the information content of dividend announcements. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The paper discusses the ownership and control structures of local public utilities by showing evidence from the Italian case. In this discussion, the focus is on three main aspects: the ownership structure, the board composition and independence, and citizens' involvement (service charters). The main results from this study reveal that there are controversial aspects, which need further investigation. The existence of a principal-principal conflict is clearly arising from an in-depth analysis of the ownership structures. In addition, the board of directors, because of the lack of actual independence, does not seem to be a useful arena to manage and solve these conflicts. Other governance mechanisms are thus needed, to increase accountability to citizens. Within this, service charters seem to be a useful tool to protect the "public interest". However, service charters content analysis suggests that further implementation actions are due. The paper contributes to the debate on conflicts of interests and governance mechanisms in local public utilities suggesting possible developments of agency theory and discussing implications for further research.

This article examines how ownership, management and governance characteristics and the associated agency problems of family firms impact the divestment decision. Based on the divestment activity of 48 listed family firms in Belgium over a six-year period, I find an inverse U-shaped relationship between family ownership and divestment likelihood, supporting the alignment view at medium levels of family ownership but entrenchment at high ownership levels. In addition to ownership, the governance of the family firm also impacts the divestment decision. Divestiture likelihood is significantly lower when the family exerts its influence through the board of directors, consistent with the entrenchment view that they will use their influence to pursue non-economic goals. Founders, on the other hand, act as active monitors of the firm's activities and do not seem to be hindered by emotional considerations which result in more divestment activity as compared to other family firms.

Alliances are popularly used in delivering infrastructure. However, discussion is ongoing as to what is the optimal gainshare/painshare arrangement. This paper derives a result for the optimal gainshare/painshare between risk-averse parties, where the level of aversion may range from very large to being risk neutral. The derivation is based on solving an optimization problem using concepts from agency theory. The influence of the parties' level of risk aversion and outcome uncertainty is examined. Practitioners were engaged in a designed exercise in order to validate the approach and propositions. The paper shows that: (i) the optimal gainshare/painshare arrangement in alliances is linear in the project outcome; (ii) the optimal gain/pain share to the contractor should decrease with increasing contractor level of risk aversion and/or decreasing owner level of risk aversion; and (iii) the outcome uncertainty has no influence on the optimal gainshare/painshare. The paper provides those who write alliance contracts with recommendations on gainshare/painshare.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Family control in family firms can extend beyond the direct involvement of family members, but identifying these mechanisms is difficult in most markets. We utilize unique disclosures made by Taiwanese firms to examine the role played by family representatives in listed family firms. Family representatives are non-family members that represent the controlling family's indirect shareholdings in the firm. We examine whether family representatives are used in the same manner as family members and whether they provide net benefits or costs to shareholders. Research Findings/Insights: In our sample of listed family firms, we find that omitting family representatives understates the influence of controlling families by 46 percent. We show that family representatives are associated with net costs to shareholders, but to a lesser extent than family members. We also find that controlling families use family members and family representatives differently. Family members are more involved in older family firms and in firms founded by the family. Family representatives are more involved in acquired and second generation family firms and in larger firms with more fixed assets. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We apply agency theory to the use of family representatives and show that family representatives are being used by controlling families to extend their influence within their firms, increasing agency costs to minority shareholders. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For policymakers, our analysis shows that disclosure of family member and representative relationships within firms is important and value-relevant to investors. Furthermore, our results suggest that firm performance could be improved by limiting the involvement of family members and family representatives in family firms. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study seeks to answer the research question 'using reliance as the pivotal consideration, what factors determine the efficient and effective interrelationship between internal and external audit?', within the context of the Australian public sector. A qualitative approach, framed within agency theory, was adopted using a case study and structured interviews. Findings included factors supporting prior literature as well as some unique to the research described here. As a result, this article makes a contribution to the literature examining public sector internal and external audit interrelationships as well as the literature on police audit and performance. It also has practical implications for both the case study site and similar organisations throughout the world. (c) 2013 CPA Australia.

This study investigates how managerial shareholding affects audit pricing for listed companies in Hong Kong. Based on agency theory, we examine the relationship between managerial shareholding and audit fees, from the perspectives of the alignment effect and the entrenchment effect. We posit a non-linear relationship, which is tested by grouping sample firms into three levels of managerial shareholding: low, intermediate, and high regions of management ownership. The empirical results reveal that the association of managerial ownership with audit fees is non-linear: managerial shareholding is significantly and negatively associated with audit fees in the low and high regions of managerial ownership, whereas the association is significantly positive in the intermediate region. These correlations are further confirmed by the results of curvilinear regression analysis. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

We propose that CEO compensation and tenure moderate the relationship between multinational corporations' (MNCs) R&D intensities and their percentages of equity ownership in international joint ventures (IJVs). Transaction cost economics (TCE) suggests a positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, but this relationship has not been confirmed consistently in prior research. We examine the moderating effects of CEO compensation and tenure on the relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, thereby bringing more nuanced explanations from agency theory and upper echelons theory into the discussion. Our proposed relationships were tested using a sample of 202 IJVs formed between U.S. MNCs and foreign partners in high-tech industries for the period 1993 to 2003. We found an overall positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and the percentage of equity ownership in IJVs. Moreover, CEO tenure and bonus compensation each weaken the positive R&D intensity-equity ownership relationship in our sample, while CEO stock options compensation amplifies it. These findings indicate that CEO compensation and tenure influence decision making about equity ownership in IJVs, suggesting that scholars and boards of directors should consider these CEO-related factors when evaluating strategic decisions regarding IJVs.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Based on an analysis of Swedish press material covering two corporate scandals, this paper reveals the institutional logic propagated by the Swedish press pertaining to large shareholders and the relationship between this institutional logic and the attribution of blame for the scandals to shareholders by the press. Research Findings/Insights: The results reveal an institutional logic with a clear notion of what constitutes a "real owner," which is reminiscent of an understanding of ownership and control prevalent in the literature before the emergence of agency theory. Real owners are associated with moderation of management, responsibility, long-termism, and legitimate influence in the firm. In response to scandals, this institutional logic leads the Swedish press to question the "realness" of an existing controlling shareholder or, if no controlling shareholder exists, to blame the problem on the absence of a real owner. Theoretical/Academic Implications: It is important to understand the institutional logic propagated by the press to see how the media functions as a governance mechanism, since a given institutional logic leads the media to "name and shame" in specific ways. The institutional logic propagated by the Swedish press differs from what previous research has indicated is prevalent in the US, suggesting that the media as a governance mechanism has different effects in different countries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper illustrates the importance of understanding prevalent informal norms when predicting effects of corporate governance reform and suggests that these informal aspects are highly path dependent.

Although outsourcing of organisational functions has become a popular practice amongst organisations, the literature provides a myopic and simplistic view of the phenomenon by focusing on either single functions or taking monadic views of a single party. The design of our study overcomes these weaknesses by including the following features: a range of organisational functions were included; the unit of analysis was the outsourcing contract; the level of analysis was at the dyadic level where both service providers and receivers presented their views and the approach was a qualitative one. In practice, this involved interviews with managers in service receiving and providing organisations that were in charge of 10 separate outsourcing arrangements. Using agency theory as a theoretical anchor, we contribute to the outsourcing debate by highlighting its complexity and areas of convergence and divergence between service receivers and providers, thereby suggesting a contingent approach towards implementation of outsourcing arrangements.

In brand licensing, the brand owner (the licensor) grants another firm (the licensee) the right to use the brand. This differs from franchising, in which a contractual arrangement between a franchisor and a franchisee exists to run a business based on the franchisor's business model. Brand licensing helps generate revenues and protect the brand from misappropriation. In such contractual arrangements, agency theory suggests that when parties to the contract engage in moral hazard (i.e., opportunistic behavior), suboptimal outcomes may result. The authors examine how concerns of moral hazard affect royalty rate, a popular form of compensation in brand licensing. From an agency theory perspective, they discuss how market and contract characteristics influence the risk of moral hazard and shape royalty rates in international brand licensing. The results obtained using data from international licensing contracts indicate that a country's intellectual property rights protection enables licensees to benefit from lower royalty rates and market size enables licensors to demand higher royalty rates. The authors also examine impact of other contract characteristics, such as contract duration and exclusivity, on royalty rate. The results imply that concerns of opportunistic behavior on the part of both the licensor and the licensee influence royalty rates. (c) 2013, American Marketing Association.

This paper examines the impact of corporate governance and ownership structure on voluntary disclosure practices of Malaysian listed firms. The extent of voluntary disclosure is determined for a matched-sample of 100 listed firms in three different disclosure regimes during 1996, 2001 and 2006. The findings suggest that regulatory reforms over the 1996 to 2006 period resulted in enhanced corporate transparency and accountability as reflected in more extensive voluntary disclosures. We provide empirical evidence that the extent of voluntary disclosures is significantly associated with the strength of corporate governance structure in 2001 and 2006 and with ownership structure in 1996, 2001 and 1996. The findings of this study are of use to regulators in terms of guiding policy development regarding corporate transparency of publicly listed firms. Copyright (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Family business success rests on implementing a governance system that recognizes a complex nexus of social relationships. While scholars have used existing frameworks such as agency theory to explore the effect of financial incentives on agent behavior and performance, they have not integrated perspectives from psychology and sociology in a way that fully addresses the challenges of effective family business governance. Our research advances current knowledge of governance in family business by examining the implications of accountability theory to explore differences in the perceptions of accountability between family and nonfamily executives as a result of family firm monitoring. We examine the elements and linkages that form the basis of accountability in the context of firm characteristics uniquely common to family business and that are influential in the development of perceptions between executives of contrasting family status. Potential contingencies to the family status-accountability relationship is also considered, as are the implications of effective monitoring for family firm performance. (c) 2013.

Publicly traded Chinese firms recently reformed their ownership structures by converting non-tradable shares, which constituted two-thirds of shares outstanding and were held largely by the state, into shares that could trade on domestic exchanges. To facilitate this reform, tradable shareholders were compensated with stock grants from non-tradable shareholders. Our analysis focuses on the level of compensation, the compensation ratio, the ratio of new tradable shares granted to tradable shares outstanding before the reform. Contrary to the predictions of asset-pricing models, most firms set the compensation ratio around 0.3. We explain this surprising convergence using institutional theory. In doing so, we analyze the power and interests of all relevant actors - not just owners, but also state regulators, executives, and other agents - and draw on insights from resource-dependence and agency theories. We find strong evidence of coercive and mimetic isomorphism, but no evidence of normative isomorphism. Because our dependent variable is continuous (a ratio), we are able to show that the mimetic effects we observe cannot be attributed to coercion or norms. Thus, we not only explain an empirical puzzle, we also advance institutional analysis of isomorphism by clearly distinguishing three isomorphic forces that have been conflated in much previous research.

Purpose: In most European code-law oriented Latin countries, the publication of a CEO's letter to shareholders in a company's annual report is a fairly recent phenomenon. In this paper, the authors seek to determine the characteristics that explain why companies in one such country, i.e. Portugal, published a CEO letter. Design/methodology/approach: The paper's holistic theoretical framework draws on elements of agency theory, institutional theory and signalling theory. To understand the characteristics of Portuguese holding companies that published CEO letters, the authors used a logistic regression model to explore 266 observations over the years 2006-2011. Findings: The publication of a CEO letter becomes more likely if a firm is audited by a Big 4 accounting firm; has a higher level of profitability; and has a high number of foreign subsidiaries. Other findings are that finance companies are slightly more likely to publish a CEO letter than non-finance companies. The number of CEO letters increased to a peak in 2008, and then declined. Practical implications: The increasing number of companies now publishing a CEO letter raises the concern for regulatory authorities of whether the content of the CEO letter should be audited, since any numbers presented in the management report have to be audited in Portugal. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first empirical exploration of the characteristics that explain why companies publish a CEO letter. Mimetic and normative isomorphism is revealed to be a potentially important influence, since there is a tendency of companies audited by Big 4 accounting companies, and with foreign subsidiaries, to publish a CEO letter.

Most principal-agent literature of nonprofit organizations has focused on the relationship between board members and managers. However, in addition to the role as an agent of the board, the manager also performs a role as principal with respect to the nonprofit employees. By using a discrete choice experiment, we identify the objectives of managers and employees in nonprofit organizations and assess the presence of agency problems in this relationship. Our sample consists of 76 headmasters, 161 teachers, and 39 administrative employees in 74 secondary nonprofit schools in Belgium. We find that the six objectives set out in the experiment play an important role for both headmasters and subordinate staff. However, the results also indicate that some of these objectives are significantly more important for the headmasters. In sum, our results suggest that agency theory and stewardship theory are not necessarily in conflict with each other but can be combined into a more general governance framework for nonprofit organizations. Consequently, we argue that incentive structures that incorporate different types of objectives can facilitate the recruitment and retention of employees in nonprofit organizations.

This study develops a property rights explanation of the multi-unit (MU) ownership strategy of the franchise firm. According to the property rights theory, the allocation of residual rights of control (decision and ownership rights) in franchise firms depends on the contractibility of system-specific and local market assets (LMA). We develop and test the following hypotheses: Multi-unit franchising (MUF) is positively related to the franchisor's intangible system-specific assets and negatively to the franchisee's intangible LMA. In addition, we argue that impact of financial assets on the tendency toward MUF depends on the contractibility of LMA. Empirical results from the German franchise sector provide partial support of the hypotheses. Compared to the agency theory, which focuses on (complete) incentive contracts that specify residual income rights between the franchisor and franchisee, property rights theory focuses on incomplete contracts that allocate residual control rights between the franchisor and network partners. Furthermore, compared to the resource scarcity theory, property rights theory explains the impact of contractibility of resources/assets on the ownership strategy of the franchise firm.

The existing literature documents that the financial reporting quality is higher when firms have effective audit committees. However, recent studies find that audit committees are not effective in family firms where agency conflicts arise between controlling and non-controlling shareholders. Extending the previous findings, this study investigates the effectiveness of audit committees in firms with similar agency conflicts when one owner obtains effective control of the firm. Compared to firms with a low level of block ownership, high-blockholder firms face less agency problems due to the separation of ownership and management, but more severe agency problems between controlling (blockholders) and non-controlling shareholders. Using a unique hand-collected sample, using the largest 350 UK firms for three years from 2005 to 2007, and shows that firms with effective audit committees have less earnings management. This study also documents that the monitoring effectiveness of audit committees is moderated in firms with high blockholder ownership. Copyright (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

With growing public and private support of networks of small and medium-sized firms, many networks rely on network boards to ensure effective governance. By integrating agency and embeddedness reasoning, this article argues that network board composition aimed at effective monitoring may be at the cost of lost ability to strategize. In this study, longitudinal data of Swedish government-supported innovation networks demonstrate that network innovation improves as network board size increases, but that returns to such increases diminish when boards become overly large. Similarly, network board independence is beneficial up to a certain threshold, after which further increases in independence become detrimental. The study clarifies how agency and embeddedness theory can be combined to explain boards' abilities to combine monitoring and strategizing at the network level in increasing the levels of network innovation.

Information technology (IT) infrastructure outsourcing arrangements involve multiple services and processes that are interdependent. The interdependencies pose significant challenges in designing appropriate incentives to influence a provider's effort-allocation decisions. By integrating process modeling fundamentals with multitask agency theory, we enumerate the base set of possible interrelationships among different IT service processes and derive corresponding optimal incentives. Our results demonstrate the impacts of risk profile, random noise, value-cost ratio, and process structure on optimal incentive rates. We find that the current practice of treating IT services as essentially independent is optimal only in limited settings where both the service provider and customer are risk neutral. Interestingly, incongruent performance measures require optimal incentive rates to respond in complex ways to the strength of coupling between services and the complementarity and substitutability of services. We also analyze more complex process scenarios using different combinations of the base set. The results demonstrate that, while the findings from the base set largely hold, the value-cost ratio of the services and the performance measure congruity can pose unique challenges in determining incentive rates.

This paper examines the ethical implications of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the United Nation's climate change initiative that provides incentives to countries and firms in developed countries to motivate investments in greenhouse gas reduction projects in developing countries. Using the tenets of agency theory, we present a solid waste management project in El Salvador as an illustrative example of how the CDM can produce a disproportionately high social cost for the most marginalized populations in the developing world. We suggest that the UN needs to reformulate the CDM so that it more effectively aligns the divergent goals of multiple actors and upholds the UN's principles for sustainable development, including ethical firm-level behavior. By providing incentives for environmental, economic, and social value creation, the CDM would not only promote ethical norms for profit-seeking firms that participate in the program but also reinforce the UN's twin pro-poor and environmental objectives.

Corporate governance is usually viewed in the context of strengthening shareholder rights and enhancing shareholders' welfare. However, the impact of corporate governance on bondholders is much less understood. We explore how corporate governance influences the cost of debt financing. Using broad governance metrics encompassing fifty governance attributes reported by The Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), we document that stronger corporate governance is associated with a higher cost of debt. As governance strengthens by one standard deviation, the cost of debt rises by as much as 11 %. The results are robust even after controlling for both firm-specific and issue-specific characteristics. Our results are important because they suggest that corporate governance has a palpable effect on critical corporate outcomes such as credit ratings and bond yields. More importantly, we show that, while corporate governance may mitigate the agency conflict between managers and shareholders, it appears to exacerbate the agency conflict between shareholders and bondholders (the agency cost of debt).

The tenets of agency theory suggest that: 1) managers may pursue investment strategies that are at odds with shareholder value, and 2) effective governance mechanisms can improve the quality of managerial decision-making and enhance the outcomes of corporate investment. Accordingly, using an agency theory lens, we hypothesize that the financial outcomes of global diversification are contingent on the quality of the multinational firm's corporate governance: high (poor) quality corporate governance is associated with positive (negative) financial consequences attributable to global diversification. Using a sample of 5985 firm-year observations over the period 2002 through 2006, we find support for our hypothesis. The results are robust to using three different measures of global diversification, three different measures of financial outcomes (one accounting-based and two market-based measures), and two econometric methods to control for the endogeneity of the diversification decision.

This article examines relationships between governance characteristics and disclosure quality in an emerging economy of Pakistan. Regression analysis supports agency theory and shows that CEO duality is negatively related to disclosure quality, whereas ownership concentration and audit quality positively influence disclosure quality. This article also finds, through an interaction term in regression models, that ownership concentration becomes a negative influence on disclosure quality when firms have CEO duality. This study helps academicians and policymakers to understand how disclosure could be affected by corporate governance. Policymakers could apply the results to further promote good governance in Pakistan. (c) 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

This paper examines the connection between shareholdings by different groups of corporate officers (insiders and outsiders) and market valuation in South Africa. Specifically, we examine the effect of shareholdings by employees, chief executive officers (CEOs), chief financial officers (CFOs), other executive directors, and non-executive (outside) directors on market valuation. We find that total ownership by all corporate officers (insiders and outsiders) is positively related to market valuation. However, when we examine the link between ownership by individual groups of corporate officers and market valuation, our results suggest that firms with higher ownership by CEOs and other executive directors have lower market valuation, but we do not find any evidence that ownership by CFOs has any significant effect on market valuation. In contrast, we find that ownership by employees and non-executive outside) directors is positively related to market valuation. Our findings are generally consistent with the predictions of agency theory. Copyright (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

It has been discussed that whether family ownership perform better or less perform than non-family ownership that might create or destroy agency costs among the managers and shareholders. This paper is to investigate the financial performance of family and non-family owned banks in Malaysia from year 2001 to 2010. This study compares the financial performance of family and non-family owned banks that operate under central bank of Malaysia, (BNM) and are listed on Bursa Malaysia. Multiple regression technique was performed to investigate the relationship between independent variable (ownership structure) and dependent variables (Tobin's Q, ROA and ROE). Findings indicate that Tobin's Q is the best fit as the dependent variable for the regression model. It shows the highest F statistics value, which is 6.247 as compared to ROA and ROE for full sample. Meanwhile, the adjusted R squared of Tobin's Q indicates similar higher value as well that is 0.150 between the dependent variables. Board composition and board size indicate strong influence on the performance of family-owned banks. Smaller board size on the board can help the bank to achieve better performance in term of Tobin's Q and ROE. In contrast, board composition attains better performance in term of ROA rather than Tobin's Q and ROE. This study can provide useful insights of the governance mechanism that could influence the firm performance.

This paper examines the effect of outside block-holders' ownership on the demand for corporate monitoring in relation to agency theory in the Malaysian business environment. The results of this study provide evidence that, given the cultural differences, the agents and the principals may act differently. The findings indicate that blockholders in Malaysia appear to demand more monitoring costs as their shareholdings increase. This positive relationship may be associated with the demand for more monitoring by minority shareholders as a balance against the power of the majority shareholders in the concentrated business environment in Malaysia and the tighten regulations after 1997/98 financial crisis. Further investigation shows that the institutional and non-institutional block-holders react and demand different level of monitoring costs. The institutional blockholders who are mostly government related institutions appear to demand more monitoring costs as their share ownership increase, while the non-institutional shareholders are associated with less monitoring costs as their shares increase.

This paper examines the impact of ownership structure and concentration on firm performance in Sri Lanka, an emerging market in Asia. The study estimates a series of regressions using pooled data for a sample of Sri Lankan-listed firms to investigate the impact of ownership concentration and structure on firm performance based on agency theory framework, using both accounting and market-based performance indicators. The results of the study provide evidence for a strong positive relationship between ownership concentration and accounting performance measures. This suggests that a greater concentration of ownership leads to better performance. However, we found no significant impact using market-based performance measures, which suggests the existence of numerous market inefficiencies and anomalies. Furthermore, the findings of the study show that ownership structure does not have a significant distinguishable effect on performance.

By integrating agency, stewardship and resource-dependency perspectives, this paper associated three characteristics of the board of directors - outside directors, insiders' equity ownership and leadership duality (Executive Officer also being the Chairman of the Board) - with bank's financial performance in Lebanon. Using a panel model, and after controlling for endogeneity problems, we examined 54 listed and unlisted banks from 2005 to 2010. Our results implied that the presence of outside directors on the board and the leadership duality have no statistical impact on performance. It seems that severe regulations by the Lebanese monetary authority act as an external governance mechanism. On the contrary, insiders' ownership promotes convergence of the interests of managers/shareholders and shapes the performance of banks. Our findings may well urge Lebanese bankers and regulators towards further development and implementation of governance practices to enhance the performance and the stability of one of the pillars of the Lebanese economy.

Purpose - Building on new venture internationalization, agency, and signaling theories, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the level of firm internationalization and initial public offering (IPO) performance. Further, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the moderating role of firm ownership structure on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach - The data set for this study is composed of 298 firms that made IPOs in years 1997, 1998, 2001 and 2002 in the US stock exchanges. The study utilizes hierarchical ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses to test its hypotheses. The model developed in this study identified IPO firm ownership structure as the moderator variable, IPO firm internationalization as the predictor variable, and underpricing as the criterion variable. This paper utilized robust regression modeling analyses available in Stata to analyze the data and test their hypotheses. Findings - Results based on data collected from298 IPOfirmssuggest that firminternationalization has a positive impact on IPO underpricing. Results also report that the relationship between firm internationalization and IPO underpricing is moderated by CEO and blockholder ownership, with the relationship being stronger in IPO firms with higher levels of CEO and blockholder ownership. Originality/value - The current paper examines the impact of an IPO firm's internationalization prior to its going public on the subsequent performance of the IPO. In doing so, this paper seeks to help in resolving some of the apparent theoretical and empirical contradictions identified in literature. In addition, the introduction of IPO ownership structure as a moderator variable in the relationship between IPO firm internationalization and performance extends the applicability of agency theory to IPO firms and ensures a multi-theoretic, finer-grained conceptualization of this relationship.

This paper empirically investigates the influence of executive wealth diversification on equity granting patterns. Risk-averse, undiversified executives who hold much wealth in the firm discount the value of their equity holdings. This study investigates how firms respond to changes in CEO wealth diversification that follow equity divestitures. The results suggest that firms provide greater equity incentives following increases in executive wealth diversification. In addition, the proportion of annual compensation in the form of equity increases with CEO wealth diversification. Overall, the results support agency theory predictions that wealth diversification is an important component of contracting with undiversified, risk-averse managers.

This article tests the separation of ownership and control in South African-listed companies that leads to the divergence of interest between shareholders and directors. Where listed companies are owned by so many shareholders that their diffused shareholding results in negligible control over the directors who manage the assets of the company, it is likely that the directors will manage and direct the company to maximise their self-interest to the detriment of the interest of the shareholders. The separation of ownership and control and the maximisation of self-interest are central themes in the agency theory. Researching their validity in a South African context where the market is less liquid and the stock exchange is significantly smaller can add a valuable contribution to the continuing debate on corporate governance in the country. The article analyses 186 listed South African companies using data extracted over four years to test whether there is separation of ownership and control and whether such separation leads to the maximisation of self-interest. Data were extracted for the years 2005 and 2006, using the shareholding in 2006 to determine control, and for the years 2009 and 2010, using the shareholding in 2010 to determine control. Directors' remuneration as a percentage of assets was used as a proxy for the maximisation of directors' interest, and profit attributable to shareholders as a percentage of assets was used as a proxy for the maximisation of shareholders' interest. These proxies were used to test the impact of control during the two controlling periods, namely 2006 and 2010. The article finds that the majority of listed companies in South Africa are controlled by a dominant shareholder. However, there are still a significant number of companies where the directors have de facto control. Contrary to the expectation that companies controlled by directors will aim to maximise directors' remuneration, or companies controlled by shareholders will aim to maximise profit attributable to shareholders, this article finds the opposite to be true. This is possibly an indication that the controlling parties might consider factors other than their direct financial self-interest, or that there is an inherent cost associated with control.

In Brazil, according to Law No. 10.303/2001, the improper use of inside information in the stock market is crime. However, in literature there are studies to indicate the existence of insider trading in this market (BOPP, 2003; BARBEDO; SILVA; LEAL, 2009). Therefore, this study aims to investigate the Probability of Informed Trading (PIN) in stock trading on the BMandFBOVESPA, trying to identify its relationship with stock returns. Based on Efficient Markets Theory and Agency Theory, we analyzed 198 stocks during the year 2011. The information asymmetry was measured (PIN) using the model of Easley, Hvidkjaer and O'Hara (2002) and related to stock returns through the model of Fama and MacBeth (1973) set. The results indicate that there is 22.9% probability of insider trading has occurred, that the segments with higher governance requirements together with the stocks that lower information asymmetry and an increase of 10.0% in PIN leads to an increase of 8.0 % in stock returns.

The separation of ownership and control observed in large corporations is common to other organizations such as large professional partnerships, financial mutuals, nonprofits, and cooperatives. This separation gives rise to control and influence cost problems in cooperatives. However, it is not observed in all Brazilian agricultural cooperatives, where certain members have both residual claim and formal control rights. In this article, we examine the allocation of decision management and control rights and the determinants of ownership structure in a sample of Brazilian agricultural cooperatives. Using survey data, we employ multivariate regression techniques to empirically investigate the factors determining the allocation of ownership rights and the separation of ownership and control. Our findings do not lend strong support to agency theory, but they help inform research seeking to shed light on the determinants of decision rights allocation in agricultural cooperatives.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to establish sufficient potential for a novel perspective that could enhance understanding of the rationale behind voluntary disclosures. In this paper, the authors seek to provide an integrated view from different disciplines that points to a new dimension. This dimension is expected to promote a better understanding of voluntary disclosures in corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the conceptual underpinnings of agency theory and integrate several perspectives from different disciplines. Through the support of simple matrices and a conceptual figure, an interesting finding is proposed that could help provide a new way of looking at voluntary disclosures. Findings: The established view holds that due to information asymmetry between the shareholders and the management, voluntary disclosures are more meaningful for the shareholders of the firm. The authors, however, suggest that since information asymmetry is already embedded in several roles and strategic actions of the board, it leads to the development of a third dimension in understanding voluntary disclosures. Originality/value: Information asymmetry has been well understood as one of the key aspects of the agency theory. The authors' strive to apply this phenomenon while looking at the roles of the board and the strategic actions that result therein. The result is an enhanced understanding of the motivations behind voluntary disclosures. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Our findings show that both voluntary disclosure provided via traditional channels and voluntary performance data released the previous year, as well as media interest, are significantly associated to IPR.

The study concentrates on audit committee characteristics and their influences on free cash flow. A panel of 120 firms from the trading and services industry from the year 2005 to 2008 is examined. The results show a significant and positive relationship between Audit Committee characteristics (size, independence, frequency of meetings) and free cash flows. These findings suggest that effective audit committee governance leads to availability of higher free cash flows. Our study draws upon the lack of understanding on the impact of audit committee characteristics on free cash flow along the two views; agency theory and pecking order/transaction cost theory and finds support for the later.

Fiduciary duties are an integral part of the corporate law landscape. The law and economics analysis of these duties, especially the duty of directors to maximize shareholder wealth, shows that these duties fill contractual gaps, saving on transaction costs. Although duties to shareholders are well settled, duties to other participants such as creditors or employees are heavily debated. In this paper, we use an agency theory framework to address the relative efficiency of a duty to creditors, a duty to refrain from wrongful trading, or contractual devices. Such an analysis makes clear what effect these rules have upon the behavior of shareholders and boards and whether these rules can efficiently address agency problems. The upshot of the analysis is that both types of rules protect creditors, but the same can be said of specific contractual solutions. It is therefore unclear if the rules mitigate costs above and beyond what could be achieved by contract. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the type of bankruptcy system matters as well. Creditor protection is best delivered via a board friendly bankruptcy system instead of with a creditor friendly system that includes a wrongful trading rule. The conclusion is that creditor duties, or wrongful trading rules, are superfluous, while private solutions are still inadequate to solve all the agency problems in a way that the proponents of both types of creditor protections aim for.

This paper investigates the effect of corporate governance on the cost of debt of Malaysian listed firms. This study draws on an agency theory from the perspectives of debt agency and traditional manager-shareholder agency costs to demonstrate that debt holders are sensitive to the quality of firm corporate governance. We utilise a comprehensive corporate governance index, covering 139 items in 6 broad categories, for evaluating corporate governance quality. Using the panel sample between 2003 and 2007, we argue that corporate governance lowers the cost of debt. Debt holders tend to be sensitive to corporate governance practices that affect the extent of expropriation tendencies of managers or shareholders, the validity of financial reports that they use in managing lending agreements and default risk. They view board structure and procedures, board compensation practices, shareholder rights and relations, accountability and audit and social and environmental activities as integral components of a good corporate governance framework.

The paper explains theoretical framework of how corruption hurts economic growth and reveals its application difficulties. Comparing views on corruption in terms of the problem of agency and the problem of rent-seeking we argue that corruption in general is the problem of legal setting and its enforcement and, if badly established, it does not promote economic growth. To verify the theoretical argument we present empirical Granger causality test to demonstrate that corruption precedes economic growth in Central and Eastern Europe. This means that legal setting and its enforcement rather allow for rent-seeking than promote economic growth. As a consequence we emphasize the necessity to focus on institutional framework to fight corruption and support economic growth.

Divestitures of property, plant and equipment (PPE) assets are a common form of corporate restructuring. However, divesting companies do not necessarily attain improved post-divestiture shareholder wealth. Studies show company characteristics and use of divestiture proceeds may influence divestiture outcomes. This paper attempts to determine these divesting company characteristics and use of proceeds associated with improved shareholder wealth based on the Agency Theory. A sample of Malaysian public-listed companies that divested assets within 2002-2005 is used. Logistic regression segregates these companies based on their industry-adjusted operational returns. Companies that improve post-divestiture operational performance require urgent pay out motives to divest. Companies with deteriorated post-divestiture performance divest without urgent pay out motive and tend to retain proceeds. This suggests agency problem of managerial discretion in asset divestitures. In asset selection, divestitures of larger and more inefficient assets were found associated with improved company performance. Malaysian companies prefer divesting assets related to their core businesses indicating a diversified company structure is more beneficial than a focused structure in developing countries.

This study focuses on an agency cost explanation of the long-run performance of debt issuers based on debt issuance data in Malaysia during the period from January 2001 to October 2009. Long-run performance is measured by buy and hold abnormal return (BHAR), while growth opportunities (GO), managerial ownership (MO), ownership concentration (OC) and free cash flow (FCF) are adopted as proxies for agency costs. Using a linear regression method, this study finds that BHAR is positively influenced by GO and OC but negatively influenced by MO and FCF, which supports an agency cost explanation of capital structure. An improvement in the performance of debt issuers is found to be associated with the monitoring of debt by debt issuers. Debt issuers with more concentrated ownership and lower MO benefit from the issuance of debt through a reduction of agency costs.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of the communication of the five major categories of risk (business, strategy, market and credit risk disclosure) over the volatile 2007-2009 global financial crisis (GFC) time period between Indonesia and Malaysia manufacturing listed companies. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 300 firm years data are collected consisting of a random sample of 100 manufacturing listed companies' annual reports for fiscal year-ends from 2007 to 2009. The reports include 50 annual reports of manufacturing companies per country, listed in the stock exchanges of Indonesia and Malaysia for this three-year GFC time period. This research adopts a researcher-constructed risk disclosure index (RDI) to create an index measuring the extent of risk disclosure by listed firms. Findings - Key findings from statistical analysis are that country of incorporation and size help predict risk disclosure levels. Malaysian companies have significantly higher levels of business risk in 2007 and operating risk communication in 2007, 2008 and 2009 than Indonesian companies. These two countries have similar economic scenarios as developing countries which often have higher "business" risk for companies, but Malaysian companies disclose more risk information than Indonesia. The overall low disclosure levels (27.46-32.92 per cent for Indonesian companies and 35.20-39.04 per cent for Malaysian companies) highlight the potential for far higher communication of key risk factors in these two countries. Originality/value - This study is important as it contributes to the literature by providing comparative insights into the voluntary risk disclosure practices of manufacturing companies in the two important Asian countries (Indonesia and Malaysia) over the GFC time period. There is lack of risk disclosure studies in manufacturing companies, especially in these two sample countries. Copyright (c) 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate the risk and return characteristics of dividend investing compared to a passive "market" approach and provide probable explanations for any differences in return and risk. Design/methodology/approach: The research design is a standard time series analysis of two different data sets containing information about return for "dividend portfolios" and the "market portfolio". Findings: Investing in high dividend-paying firms earns abnormal returns in a long short-strategy in the USA and in world indices, confirming earlier studies. Different overlapping strategies and agency theory are used to provide explanations for the dividend strategy's persistence. Research limitations/implications: While the US findings were significant at conventional levels, the results using the world indices had significance levels that were slightly below the usual academic cut off but may be acceptable to practitioners. Practical implications: Seemingly anomalous findings should disappear once reported, yet the high dividend-paying strategy continues to persist and this article provides some explanations relating to the value strategy, beta puzzle and agency theory. Social implications: Paying dividends may be socially responsible since it is explained as a way of deploying free cash flow in an efficient manner rather than wasting money through overpriced acquisitions or buybacks of overpriced shares. Originality/value: By using different databases, earlier research is confirmed and also found to be robust across different time periods. The contribution of this paper is to link the value premium, the beta puzzle and agency issues of free cash flows together to explain the outperformance and persistence of dividend investing from a practitioner viewpoint.

The main purpose of this study is to develop and examine the theoretical model of hospital governance. For this purpose, this study integrates the literature of organizational governance and agency theory to empirically test the relationship between hospital governance mechanisms (structure of board of directors, information disclosure, and decision making) and hospital governance effectiveness (financial, customer, internal process, learning and growth, and social responsibility). This study empirically tested hospital governance related indices from 102 hospitals by using secondary data. The results find that (1) information disclosure and decision making of hospital governance mechanisms are positively related to its governance effectiveness, and (2) the relationship between the structures of board of directors and its governance effectiveness is non-significant. The theoretical and managerial implications and suggestions of future study are provided at the end of this study.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present theoretical explanations for the failure of the largest dairy processing firm in Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) after only about one year of operation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper contains a case study on the establishment and failure of a new firm is presented. Data were collected through mass media reports and interviews with knowledgeable individuals in the dairy industry. The data were analyzed using neo-institutional theories, primarily agency theory. Findings - The core of the explanation is that the various categories of institutions were not aligned. For example, poor contract enforcement created insurmountable agency costs for all parties involved. Research limitations/implications - As this paper is based on a case study it is uncertain to which extent the finding can be generalized. Originality/value - Most case studies describe successes. This paper presents a case where the odds for success were poor, but the project was still initiated. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

One of the main control mechanisms that shareholders have used to rein in rogue managers is compensation. Through a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic incentives, shareholders have tried to provide the right balance to motivate senior managers to perform at their best. Shareholders have often failed in achieving this balance through compensation. In this paper, we argue that this failure is not the result of compensation packages as such, but on the focus of compensation packages on extrinsic motivators such as pay-for-performance bonuses and stock options. Instead, the focus of compensation packages should be on cultivating intrinsic motivators such as firing and prestige.

It is claimed that information system structure can affect the coordination, monitoring and controlling of organisational activities, and in turn reduce the costs involved. This paper aims to investigate how the information system structure of an organisation affects its demand and preference for monitoring costs in Malaysian business environment. About 867 questionnaires were distributed to public listed companies in Malaysia, however, only 235 questionnaires were completed and usable for the purpose of the study. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were carried out to analyze the data. The findings indicate that companies using centralised information system structure have negative and significant relationship with total monitoring costs, this result may be explained by the fact that the agents' self interest behaviour can be monitored by the centralised system. However the information system structure is not significant when the cost of directorship and auditing are compared. But when internal auditing and external auditing costs are compared, the result indicates that companies with centralised information system structure have significantly more internal auditing costs. This paper contributes to the literature relating to the relationship between information system structures and monitoring costs, especially in Malaysian business settings.

Referring to the dual nature of "good" theories in social and management sciences, this article claims that the same theory might generate both good and bad practices, in rational and moral terms. To illustrate this argument, it relies on the positive agency theory case and on two related practices: stock-options, and the carried interest technique which is supported by the private equity organizational structure. This article concludes that management theory and practices may be decoupled. (c) 2013 Lavoisier. All rights reserved.

However, the role of the CFO in family businesses is underresearched. Therefore, this article seeks to synthesize present findings and analyze the role of the non-family CFO in large family businesses compared to nonfamily businesses. As a theoretical background we employ social role theory, agency theory and stewardship theory.

Focusing on the agency conflict between manager and shareholders and on the definitions of tunneling and propping, we delve into the related party transactions between a group and its management. Firstly, the paper examines actual and previous information to disclose for directors board remunerations (as for IAS, Consob and TUF). Such remunerations are based on a contract with legal and moral managers obligations to the companies of the group they run and to the stakeholder of such companies. For this reason, a balance between their remunerations and their performance is necessary to achieve preserving the interests of all the subjects involved in the companies' activities and maintaining the continuity of the group. Then, using regressions, we measure, in a sample of listed companies, if there is a significant and sustainable connection between particular remunerations of the highest paid members of the directors board and the economic group performance.

The purpose of the study is to estimate the magnitude of the votes and the excess of votes of the majority shareholders in Brazilian companies grounded by the agency theory. The ownership structure of Brazilian organizations differs from Anglo-Saxon ones that are the most common studied. Thereby, there is a gap of literature about the conflicts between managers, shareholders and sprayed ownership in the Brazilian context. In Brazil, which has concentrated ownership structure, duality of classes of shares and strong presence of major shareholders, the conflict occurs between majority and minority shareholders. Thus, from a separation of majority shareholder types of Ibovespa companies of the year of 2010, the research is characterized as descriptive and explanatory. The author utilizes bibliographic and documentary resources, using the data system Economatica of IAN's as well as Bovespa website for the analysis. The results showed that the capital structure of publicly traded companies is mainly concentrated on equity, occurring in several cases a considerable distance between the voting power and the power of the majority shareholders' cash flow. The results also suggest that publicly traded Brazilian companies have in most cases, a controlling shareholder - with more than 50% of the shares with voting rights of companies - and in many cases when there is not a controlling shareholder, there is a controlling bloc, formed by the three main majority shareholders of the companies.

A unified framework is presented to characterise the capital structure of firms that face borrowing restrictions - which extends the classic theory of capital by incorporating elements from actuarial and agency theory. It is demonstrated that the bankruptcy and agency costs afforded by these firms can be expressed in terms of the actuarial prices of the underlying exposures. Then the optimal surplus is determined in order to maximise value - which is equivalent to minimise the cost of bankruptcy plus the opportunity cost of capital. The capital principle thus obtained explicitly depends on risk and expectations, and can be applied to allocate reserves both in financial and insurance companies. An optimal decentralised mechanism is also defined that stimulates the exchange of information inside multidivisional corporations. (c) 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Purpose - Agency theory suggests that if managers are not monitored, takeover negotiations may be contaminated by agency conflicts, which may weaken a firm's bargaining position. This paper argues that some blockholders are more effective monitors than others, and tests whether the negotiating power of a target or bidder is influenced by their respective blockholder composition. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper classifies target and bidder outside blockholders as either aggressive monitors or moderate monitors, and tests whether the degrees of monitoring effectiveness influence a firm's share of the total wealth created by the takeover (a proxy for bargaining power). Findings - This paper finds that firms that have the types of outside blockholders with a greater tendency to monitor managers elicit higher takeover gains. This suggests that negotiating power in takeovers is conditioned on the types of blockholders that monitor the target and bidder. The results support the premise that better monitoring leads to higher gains for shareholders in a takeover. In particular, the findings suggest that the greater the tendency of outside blockholders to monitor managers, the lower the level of takeover-related agency conflicts and the stronger a firm's relative bargaining power. Originality/value - These findings imply that agency conflicts on either side of a takeover bid may be reduced by better monitoring, but especially among bidders.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of accounting discretion in a principal-agent setting, wherein accounting information is used in performance evaluation. The agent may choose one from among several allowable accounting methods. However, limited audit resources allow only for verification of only the method the agent chooses, and this is the only one used to determine the agent's compensation. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses the model developed by Penno (1990) and construct relatively simple examples that illustrate the effects of accounting discretion on performance evaluation. These examples may make the implications of Penno (1990) clearer to educators and practitioners. Findings - Accounting discretion can be useful in performance evaluation even if the accounting method chosen is not disclosed. Lower limits on compensation reduce the usefulness of accounting discretion. If the principal declares a preferred accounting treatment, it enhances the usefulness of accounting discretion; in fact, it guarantees that accounting discretion is weakly preferred to no discretion. Practical implications - Accounting discretion is often viewed pejoratively. Those responsible for designing performance evaluation schemes should be aware of the potential benefits of accounting discretion, and those charged with promulgating accounting rules should consider the possibility that rules can be too inflexible. Originality/value - This paper provides accessible illustrations of the effects of accounting discretion on performance evaluation and offer discussion to place the conclusions drawn from the model into a standard setting context.

This chapter summarizes the theory and empirics of capital structure for life insurers and health insurers. The large literature on explaining capital structure for nonfinancial firms is not explicitly applicable to insurers because of the differences in the structures, setting, and the premium financing of insurers. Nevertheless, the fundamental capital structure question is carefully adapted from the debt versus equity theories used for nonfinancial firms to the risk versus capital theories in insurance. The switch follows naturally from the customer-based model of insurer financing. The predictions of agency theory, transaction-cost economics, pecking order, debt-equity trade-off, bankruptcy cost, risk subsidy, and other theories are developed and summarized into the "finite risk" and "excessive risk" hypotheses. The interrelationships between the capital and risks of life and health insurers are examined in this light. For the last two decades, insurers operated under the finite risk paradigm, even during the 2008 financial crisis. (c) Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013. All rights reserved.

In the context of agency theory this study investigates the effect of corporate governance (CG) on Internet Financial Reporting (IFR) disclosure in a concentrated ownership environment, such as Italy. We hypothesize that IFR may be explained in term of increasing transparency in order to defend minority shareholder interest, so we predict, and find, a positive association between the extent of a firm's IFR and its CG and a negative association between IFR and ownership structure. CG is measured by ownership structure, using as a proxy the share held by the first three major shareholders and by managerial ownership, and by board composition, captured through the incidence of independent director (IND) and of a Non-Executive Chair (NEC). IFR is measured taking into consideration the content and format of information present in Investor Relations sections. (c) Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

Dividend is a division of organization profit that is compensated by an organization to its shareholders as a reward for spending in the organization. Dividend is measured as the allocation of the recognized assets among shareholders that could either be paid frequently by organization or called out by shareholders sometime. Over the last decade, several researchers disputed that the dividend policy decisions of firms are vital primarily due to the signaling effect on the firm's future growth. The paper presents the experiential results on the signaling effect of dividends with the support of different theories on dividend policy. (c) Saqib Muneer, Saif-ur-Rehman, Babar Zaheer Butt, 2013.

This study investigates the relationship between ownership structure and the cost of debt of 101 companies listed at Malaysian Bourse between 2003 and 2007. Ownership structure is defined along 4 dimensions: concentrated, family, insiders and government ownerships. Concentrated and government ownerships are found to have significant effects on firms' cost of debt. Debt issuers appear to regard concentrated ownership as an organisational attribute that better protects their interest. Government-owned firms suffer from high cost of debt; thus, appear to be less efficient than other firms. The result is robust with respect to controls for company size and performance, default and financial risks, economic growth, industry and time effects. (c) Zulkufly Ramly, 2013.

Although a concentrated ownership, usually by a single family, is most prevalent in Asian firms, agency costs between shareholders and managers persists to some degree unless there is 100% ownership of equity by management. In addition, with reforms spreading across Asia to promote more transparency of disclosures, more and more firms are adopting Western-style (US and UK) corporate governance measures. As a result, the difference between Asian and Western corporate governance is narrowing. The article reviews the issues of ownership structure, agency costs and liquidity, as they jointly affect firm value. The paper proposes a theoretical framework that illustrates the direct and indirect effects of ownership structure on firm value. (c) 2013 AIBE.

CEO duality-the practice of a single individual serving as both CEO and board chair-has been the subject of academic interest for more than 20 years. In that time, boards' use of CEO duality has fluctuated and the scholarly conceptualizations of the phenomenon have become more complex. As such, the need to understand CEO duality has only increased with time. We review and integrate the disparate literature on this topic so that future attempts to study it will benefit from a more complete understanding of the knowledge already produced. We review the demonstrated antecedents and consequences of CEO duality, pointing out that while much work has been done in this area, much remains that we do not understand. Finally, we offer new theoretical, methodological, and contextual directions that researchers could explore to extend knowledge about CEO duality. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Considerable attention has been focused on the ways in which emerging market firms can obtain and mobilize the knowledge and resources required for innovation. Innovation is a particular challenge in emerging markets because of inadequate external institutions. In this study, we focus on the importance of ownership structure, and in particular on ownership type diversity and ownership concentration. Using transaction cost and agency theories embedded in an emerging market context, we argue that ownership structure provides an important mechanism by which firms can assemble and direct the resources necessary for innovation in the context of inadequate external institutions. Specifically, we hypothesize that ownership type diversity improves innovation performance and that increasing ownership concentration has the same effect, but only up to a point. Using a panel dataset of 487 and 475 Chinese listed companies during 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 respectively, we find supportive empirical evidence for our hypotheses. Our findings also suggest that ownership type diversity is a more important factor in explaining innovation performance than ownership concentration, although most of the extant literature focuses on the latter.

Family firms represent a globally dominant form of organization, yet they confront a steep challenge of finding and managing competent leaders. Sometimes, these leaders cannot be found within the owning family. To date we know little about the governance contexts under which non-family leaders thrive or founder. Guided by concepts from agency theory and behavioural agency theory, we examine the conditions of ownership and leadership that promote superior performance among non-family CEOs of family firms. Our analysis of 893 Italian family firms demonstrates that these leaders outperform when they are monitored by multiple major family owners as opposed to a single owner; they also outperform when they are not required to share power with co-CEOs who are family members, and who may be motivated by parochial family socioemotional priorities.N (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Building on corporate governance research and institutional theory, this paper explores interrelationships between the firm's corporate governance, responsible leadership, and corporate social responsibility approaches in different institutional contexts. We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory with its focus on corporate social responsibility as mere compliance with rules and regulations. We link different leadership orientations and corporate social responsibility approaches to two key process dimensions of corporate governance related to monitoring and incentives. This analysis builds on previous research that differentiates between governance mechanisms based on strategic as opposed to financial controls and explains how these types of control may be related to responsible managerial behavior and the firm's corporate social responsibility strategies. Building on governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory, we further argue that links between corporate social responsibility strategies and corporate governance factors such as boards of directors, ownership patterns, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop a more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational approaches to corporate social responsibility.

Academics, politicians, and journalists are often highly critical of U.S. firms for holding too much cash. Cash holdings are stockpiled free-cash flow and incur substantial opportunity costs from the perspectives of economics. However, behavioral theory highlights the benefits of cash holdings as fungible slack resources facilitating adaptive advantages. We use the countervailing forces embodied in these two theories to hypothesize and test a quadratic functional relationship of returns to cash measured by Tobin's q. We also build and test a related novel hypothesis of scale-dependent returns to cash based on the competitive strategy concept of strategic deterrence. Tests for both of these hypotheses are positive and show that returns to cash continue to increase far beyond transactional needs. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: The performance of service supply chains in terms of service levels and cost efficiency depends not only on the effort of service providers but also on the inputs of sub-contractors and the customer. In this sense, performance-based contracting (PBC) entails increased financial risk for providers. Allocating and managing risk through contractual relationships along the service supply chain is a critical issue, and yet there is scant empirical evidence regarding what factors influence, and how, provider willingness to bear PBC-induced risk. This paper aims to address this gap. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on agency theory and two cases of logistics service supply chains, in the food retail and automotive industries respectively, to identify key influencing factors. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 30 managers of providers and sub-contractors and review of 35 documents, notably contracts and target letters. Findings: Four influencing factors were found: performance attributability within the service supply chain; relational governance in service supply chain relationships; provider risk and reward balancing; and provider ability to transfer risk to sub-contractors. The propositions developed address how these factors influence provider willingness to bear PBC-induced risk. Research limitations/implications: The factors identified are external to the provider mindset and refer to the management of contractual relationships and service delivery interactions along the service supply chain. The paper contributes to agency theory by stressing the risk allocation implications of bi-directional principal-agent relations in service supply chains. Practical implications: The study suggests ways in which providers can increase their capacity to bear and manage financial risk related to PBC design. Originality/value: The paper identifies factors that influence provider willingness to bear financial risk induced by PBC in service supply chains. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We examine changes in firms' dividend payouts following an exogenous shock to the information asymmetry problem between managers and investors. Agency theories predict a decrease in dividend payments to the extent that improved public information lowers managers' need to convey their commitment to avoid overinvestment via costly dividend payouts. Conversely, dividends could increase if minority investors are in a better position to extract cash dividends. We test these predictions by analyzing the dividend payment behavior of a global sample of firms around the mandatory adoption of IFRS and the initial enforcement of new insider trading laws. Both events serve as proxies for a general improvement of the information environment and, hence, the corporate governance structure in the economy. We find that, following the two events, firms are less likely to pay (increase) dividends, but more likely to cut (stop) such payments. The changes occur around the time of the informational shock, and only in countries and for firms subject to the regulatory change. They are more pronounced when the inherent agency issues or the informational shocks are stronger. We further find that the information content of dividends decreases after the events. The results highlight the importance of the agency costs of free cash flows (and changes therein) for shaping firms' payout policies.

Purpose -Drawing on agency theory and legitimacy theory perspectives, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of board characteristics on sustainability reporting of listed companies in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 148 listed companies was drawn from the CSE using stratified random sampling method and data were collected from the 2012 annual reports. The proposed hypotheses were tested using a hierarchical binary logistic regression. Findings - This study documents that board size and dual leadership are positively associated with sustainability reporting and boards with female directors are negatively associated with sustainability reporting. This study also found that sustainability reporting is likely to be influenced by firm size and firm growth. Additionally, the study also reveals that younger firms are likely to adopt sustainability reporting. Originality/value - This is the first study to examine the influence of board characteristics on sustainability reporting in Sri Lanka, considered as a developing economy with an emerging equity market.

Prior studies have examined the importance of economic, strategic, and human factors to decision policies of angel investors and venture capitalists. As more angels professionalize into angel funds and as markets for technologies and ideas become more competitive, it is becoming more important to compare their decision policies with those of venture capitalists. Drawing upon agency theory, we examine whether economic potential, specific human capital, strategic readiness, and passion matter differently to venture capitalists and angel investors. Our study is an experimental conjoint analysis of more than 2700 investment decisions nested within a mixed sample of venture capitalists and angel investors. We find that strategic readiness for funding and affective passion matter more to angel investors, while economic potential matters more to venture capitalists. We also find that both investor types place similar weights on the specific human capital of entrepreneurs. These findings support the agency view that differences in the investment decision policies of angel investors and venture capitalists can be explained by examining the agency costs, market risks, information asymmetry, and control mechanisms that are structured into angel and venture capital deals.

Purpose - Based on the agency theory, the purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the impact of capital structure choice on firm performance in India as one of the emerging economies. Design/methodology/approach - Fixed effect panel regression model is used to analyse ten years of data (2003-2012) on the sample units, to find the relation between leverage and firm performance after controlling for factors such as size, age, tangibility, growth, liquidity and advertising. Findings - Empirical results suggest that leverage has a negative influence on financial performance of Indian firms, which is in contrast with the assumptions of agency theory as commonly received and accepted in other developed as well as emerging economies. Consequently, postulates of agency theory have to be seen with different perspective in India given the underdeveloped nature of bond markets and dominance of state-owned banks in lending to corporate sector. Practical implications - The findings of the paper will enable the practitioners and analysts to understand as to why, in the bank-dominated debt financing system in India, leverage is negatively associated with firm performance. Originality/value - The results of the study enrich the literature on capital structure and agency costs issues in several ways. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

I empirically investigate the relation between chief executive officer (CEO) inside debt holdings and mergers and acquisitions (M&As), and find evidence consistent with the agency theory's prediction of a negative relation between CEO inside debt holdings and corporate risk taking. Further analysis shows that CEO inside debt holdings are positively correlated with M&A announcement abnormal bond returns and long-term operating performance, but negatively correlated with M&A announcement abnormal stock returns. Finally, I find evidence that acquirers restructure the postmerger composition of CEO compensation that mirrors their capital structure in order to alleviate incentives for wealth transfer from shareholders to bondholders or vice versa.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We combine the value-creation and value-protection views of the board of directors to study the impact of board independence (BI) on the value of the firm at the time of its initial public offering (IPO). Research Findings/Insights: We conduct our analysis on a sample of 969 firms that went public in France, Germany, and Italy between 1995 and 2011. We show that BI is a critical factor in the valuation of IPO firms. Our results support both the value-creation and value-protection roles of the board of directors. The relative importance of the two roles of the board varies over time, with value-creation (value-protection) dominating in IPOs of young (mature) companies. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our theoretical framework combines the agency and resource-dependence theories. The impact of BI on IPO valuation depends on the importance of the value-creation and value-protection roles played by the board. The change in the relative importance of the two roles determines a U-shaped relationship between BI and firm age. Corporate governance is particularly important for young and innovative firms (where the resource-dependence theory applies, and governance acts as a value-creation device), as well as for mature firms and for companies where ownership and control are separated (where the agency theory applies, and governance serves as a value-protection mechanism for minority shareholders). Practitioner/Policy Implications: We show that corporate governance is a significant factor affecting the valuation of an IPO company. The importance of BI varies substantially with the knowledge intensity of the industry, the separation between ownership and control, and the age of the listing company.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

Although theory suggests that companies would rationally select into audit even if it were not a legal requirement, many countries impose mandatory audits. This is arguably due to an audit having elements of a public good, which may result in not enough audits being purchased without regulatory intervention. The mandatory nature of public company audit has created problems for researchers wishing to investigate the demand for voluntary audit. Recent events in the UK, however, have provided such an environment. In the UK, private companies must publicly file financial statements and, until recently, they had also to be audited. However, this requirement has now been relaxed for many private companies. We are therefore able to examine the determinants of voluntary audit in a large sample of companies for which we have financial statement data. We analyse a sample of 6274 recently exempt companies, following them for three years post-exemption. We use agency theory and prior evidence to generate our hypotheses and examine them using a more comprehensive set of explanatory variables than has previously been available in the literature. Our results indicate that companies are more likely to purchase voluntary audits if they have greater agency costs, are riskier, wish to raise capital, purchase non-audit services from their auditor, and exhibited greater demand for audit assurance in the mandatory audit regime. We also document a trend away from audit over time. Overall, our results strongly support the idea that companies choose to be audited when it is in their interests to do so.

This research explores the interaction of behavioral theory and agency theory, investigating their joint effects on firm-level R&D investment. Based on the logic of organizational routines driving R&D investment, we rely on the effects of organizational slack, performance relative to aspirations and distance from bankruptcy as the foundation for our research model. We argue that managerial incentives moderate the relationships between these behavioral theory variables and R&D investment, albeit in contrasting directions. Specifically, we hypothesize that stock option pay positively moderates these relationships while managerial stock ownership has a negative moderating effect. Using panel data for 573 publicly-traded manufacturing firms, we find support for several of our hypotheses, highlighting the interdependence of these two perspectives on R&D investment.

Family ownership has been recognized as an important determinant of corporate strategic choices; however, little research investigates the effects of family ownership and corporate governance on internationalization in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper utilizes agency theory and the resource-based view to analyze the relationships between family ownership, institutional ownership, and internationalization. Using a sample of Taiwanese SMEs, the finding of a positive family ownership-internationalization relationship suggests that family ownership may encourage internationalization. The interaction of family ownership and institutional ownership is positively related to internationalization, suggesting that SMEs with high family ownership are more likely to internationalize as institutional ownership increases.

Considerable prior research investigates whether the extent of insider presence on corporate boards is detrimental. However, the majority of past research treats all inside directors as a homogenous group. This study considers that issue in the context of chief financial officers (CFO) serving on their own company's board. Our research is important because individuals in different executive roles bring different skills and knowledge to board interactions, highlighting the potential for differential contributions. As prior research does not specifically distinguish CFOs from other board insiders, the potential benefits of knowledge sharing due to increased communication with other board members may have been masked. Specifically, the CFO is directly responsible for the quality of the financial reporting process and can therefore be associated with specific outcome measures. Our results show that the percentage of CFOs serving on their own boards is not large, likely due to the perspective (consistent with agency theory and reflected in independence guidelines) that company insiders on boards could promote their own best interest at the expense of shareholders. Contrary to this perception, we find that companies whose CFO has a seat on the board are associated with higher financial reporting quality (i.e., a lower likelihood of reporting a material weaknesses in internal controls or having a financial restatement, and better accruals quality). Yet, we also find potential drawbacks in that CFOs with a board seat tend to have higher excess compensation and lower likelihood of termination following poor performance, signaling greater entrenchment. While our results provide information to companies considering appointing the CFO to the board, both costs and benefits are demonstrated, and thus we conclude that each board should consider this decision based on its own circumstances and composition.

This study examines the influence of key corporate governance factors on the internationalization decisions of emerging economy (EE) firms. By integrating the resource-based view and agency theory, it investigates the effects of controlling owner identity, non-controlling shareholder ownership, and the interactions of these with CEO power, in order to reveal their individual and joint effects on the outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) propensity of EE firms. This empirical study of 224 Chinese publicly listed firms found positive effects of ownership of domestic institutional investors and foreign corporations on the OFDI propensity of the firms, which were moderated by the power of the CEOs in these firms.

With recent legislation mandating that publicly traded corporations submit their CEOs' compensation for a nonbinding shareholder vote, a systematic understanding of shareholder preferences has never been so important. In spite of this, relatively little is known about what impacts shareholders' preferences and, subsequently, their ultimate voting behavior. We integrate two theories to help frame the question and to help predict shareholder behavior. Per agency theory, shareholders, as principals, will disapprove of high CEO rewards and poor firm performance, symmetrically assessing gains and losses. Per prospect theory, shareholders will be loss averse, responding much more strongly to being in a loss position than to being in a gain or neutral position. We combine these theories' predictions in two lab experiments in which we simulate a shareholder say-on-pay vote, hypothesizing that shareholders will be concerned with agency costs, but only when they are in a loss position. The results of these simulated votes suggest that shareholders do value pay for performance, in keeping with agency theory. However, shareholders exhibit this focus on agencynormative prescriptions asymmetrically, showing loss aversion in keeping with prospect theory. This finding has significant implications for both theory and practice as shareholder votes become a regular and high-profile occurrence. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Extant theories agree that debt should inhibit diversification but predict opposing performance consequences. While agency theory predicts that debt should lead to higher performance for diversifying firms, transaction cost economics (TCE) predicts that more debt will lead to lower performance for firms expanding into new markets. Our empirical tests on a large sample of Japanese firms support TCE by showing that firms accrue higher returns from leveraging their resources and capabilities into new markets when managers are shielded from the rigors of the market governance of debt, particularly bond debt. Furthermore, we find that the detrimental effects of debt are exacerbated for R&D intensive firms and that debt is not necessarily harmful to firms that are either contracting or managing a stable portfolio of markets.

Research has examined the effects of managerial share ownership on business diversification, typically from the incentive alignment perspective. Yet, share ownership also shifts risk to managers (the efficient managerial contracting perspective). Furthermore, the effects of managerial ownership on international diversification are unexplored. We examine how managerial ownership influences both international and business diversification in light of the trade-off between incentive alignment and risk bearing. Based on the differing risk profiles of the two types of diversification, we argue that incentive contracts with higher levels of managerial ownership will be inefficient, i.e., counter to shareholder interests - reducing international diversification and increasing business diversification. Our findings support our arguments for international diversification. We find no significant effect for business diversification after accounting for endogeneity and serial correlation.

Nonfinancial measures (NFMs) are a common feature of strategic performance management frameworks. We examine the role of one widely used NFM: customer satisfaction, in one aspect of strategic performance management: CEO compensation schemes. Drawing on agency theory precepts, we hypothesize that the extent to which firms link CEO compensation to customer satisfaction is influenced by satisfaction's ability to act as a leading indicator of future profitability (lead indicator strength). We further hypothesize that the extent to which customer satisfaction's lead indicator strength influences the weighting of satisfaction in CEO compensation schemes has a positive influence on future shareholder value. Our empirical results offer strong support for both hypotheses and extend research on the use and efficacy of NFMs in CEO compensation schemes. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study analyses the distribution of power among the several blockholders of a firm and the identity of those blockholders as a determinant of firm leverage. Using a sample of 694 firms from 12 Western European countries, our results support a negative relationship between ownership concentration in the hands of the main blockholder and firm leverage. Moreover, we detect that the presence of a second and third large shareholder (beyond the first blockholder) has a significant positive effect on the leverage ratio. In addition, the results show that contestability in family firms plays a more relevant role. Finally, we show that family firms do have significant impact on firm leverage level, and this impact varies depending on the legal framework and institutional environment. In our main sample the results show family firms negatively affect market leverage, supporting the theory that family firms are more averse to an increase in the debt level due to the risk of bankruptcy and financial distress as a result of having an under-diversified portfolio. In contrast, the opposite effect is found in the sample that excludes the United Kingdom. This last result cannot be explained by agency theory, given that family businesses are those that suffer less from Type I agency problems. This result suggests either some difficulty in financing their investments by issuing new equity or the need to use debt as a signal of the quality of its investments. Our results prove to be stable against a battery of robustness tests. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The incentive dilemma refers to a situation in which incentives are offered but do not work as intended. The authors suggest that, in an interorganizational context, whether a principal-provided incentive works is a function of how it is evaluated by an agent: for its contribution to the agent's bottom line (instrumental evaluation) and for the extent it is strategically aligned with the agent's direction (congruence evaluation). To further understand when incentives work, the influence of two key contextual variables-industry volatility and dependence-are examined. A field study featuring 57 semi-structured depth interviews and 386 responses from twin surveys in the information technology and brewing industries provide data for hypothesis testing. When and whether incentives work is demonstrated by certain conditions under which the agent's evaluation of an incentive has positive or negative effects on its compliance and active representation. Further, some outcomes are reversed in the high volatility condition. (c) 2013 Academy of Marketing Science.

This study focuses on the relationship and identity changes within and between a project team and its organization following top management intervention in the context of a large international construction project. The study follows the project-as-practice orientation, examining the actions and behaviors of the project team through participant ethnography in the "praxis" of the project site over its entire duration. The longitudinal case allows the examination of the way the transition process established a new governance culture undermining the initial trust-based one and changed it from a virtual absence of mechanisms toward far more potent mechanisms of control, monitoring, and punishment. Simultaneously, the initial stewardship relationships and collectivist identity of the project team shifted toward agency relationships and individualistic identity. The triggers for the transformation process were identified as CEO succession, project failure, top management intervention driven changes in governance mechanisms, and perception of organizational betrayal of the project team.

Agency theory suggests that independent outside board members may have an important monitoring function of the financial reporting process. As a result, boards with more independent directors have a tendency for increased monitoring and are therefore expected to insist on better earnings quality. This study examines whether board independence improves earnings quality by reducing earnings management in Portugal, a country with significantly different institutional and legal characteristics from the Anglo-Saxon countries. Using ordinary least square (OLS) and two stage least squares (2SLS) techniques to control potential simultaneity problems between board independence and earnings quality, we find evidence that independent board members improve earnings quality by reducing earnings management for a sample of Portuguese listed firms. This result suggests that strengthening the independence of boards by appointing more independent board members is a positive step toward improving earnings quality.

This paper examines the evolution of the international franchise research with special focus on the governance modes of the international franchise firm and develops a new model for the franchisor's choice of the international governance modes. International governance modes in franchising refer to wholly-owned subsidiaries, joint venture franchising, area development franchising and master franchising. Although many studies on the governance modes of the international franchise firm have been published in the last two decades, no prior study develops an integrative framework that investigates the determinants of the international governance modes by combining organizational economics and strategic management perspectives. Specifically, this study explains the governance modes of the international franchise firm by applying transaction cost theory, agency theory, resource-based and organizational capabilities theory and property rights theory.

In 2013, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) proposed an amendment to Auditing Standard No. 12 (PCAOB 2010) that would require auditors to consider executive compensation in audit planning because of potential fraud risk associated with equity incentives.We use the association between audit fees and CEO and CFO equity incentives to infer whether auditors increase audit scope and perceive greater risk as equity incentives increase. Equity incentives are defined as the sensitivity of the value of executives' equity portfolios to changes in share price (delta incentive) and to changes in return volatility (vega incentive). We find a positive association between audit fees and vega, but not delta. However, when we interact vega with proxies for residual auditor business risk, we find that the fee premiums for risk decrease as vega increases. Our results suggest that auditors do consider executive compensation in audit planning.

Family offices are organisations dedicated to the management of entrepreneurial families' private wealth. Based on agency theory, we analyse types of family offices with regard to the families' goals and the control mechanisms used to ensure goal achievement. Family-dominant management and private client structures involve stronger emphasis on non-financial goals in single and multi-family offices than in non-family-dominant management and open client structures. Variations in family involvement, ranging from family dominance to the complete absence of family ownership and/or management, and diverse client structures justify the differential reliance on formal and informal control mechanisms.

Purpose - This paper aims to develop a framework of connotative meanings afforded to the term "corporate governance". Design/methodology/approach - An examination of academic publications from 1985-2012 containing the term "corporate governance" was conducted. The articles are sorted into the theoretical constructs that influence the contemporary connotative meaning of corporate governance. Findings - That a combination of a weak definitional base coupled with strong motivational forces have aided the development of competing theoretical perspectives of the meaning of corporate governance. The dominant meaning is written from an agency theory perspective. Research limitations/implications - Theoretical analysis was restricted to articles found in academic journals published since 1985. Practical implications - This study provides a very useful analysis into the connotative meanings and theoretical bases used by academic writers in the study of corporate governance. Originality/value - This paper provides an updated and developed analysis to the theoretical dimensions that underpin the contemporary use of the term "corporate governance".

Since 1988, cash holding of the UK companies has increased from 10.6% to 16.4% of total assets. To explain this increase, we develop a panel vector autoregression and analyse the dynamics between cash holding and its closest substitutes, trade credit and short-term bank finance. Impulse response functions confirm the signalling theory, as trade credit facilitates access to bank finance. Firms experiencing liquidity shocks resort to cash or trade credit but not to bank finance. Cash holding improves access to trade credit. Additional cash and trade credit trigger a slowdown of the cash conversion cycle explained by agency theory. Cash-rich firms have accumulated more cash than predicted because of an unexpected decline in short-term debt, stressing the role of banks in explaining the increase in cash holding.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore the franchise relationship in China, focusing on the relational constructs of power, control, support and conflict in this developing franchise environment. Agency theory has dominated franchise research. A more rounded theoretical interpretation of the franchising relationship is offered by employing both agency theory and institutional theory perspectives.
Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts an interpretive approach, employing in-depth interviews with franchisors and franchisees in nine franchise organisations operating in the retail sector in China. It contributes a fuller understanding of how to manage the research process in China.
Findings - The study reveals how the relational constructs of power, control, support and conflict are manifest in the franchise relationship in China. The explanatory power of agency theory is apparent when viewed in terms of the vertical agency problem. However, free-riding outside the franchise system, in the form of counterfeiting, mitigates against the occurrence of free-riding within it. With regard to institutional theory, we demonstrate that the regulatory institutional pillar is a crucial foundation for the franchise relationship.
Practical implications - The study offers insights for franchisors and franchisees considering franchise relationships in China.
Originality/value - For the first time in the literature, this study offers insights into key elements of the franchise relationship in China. Employing both agency and institutional theories facilitates a rounded explanation of the developing franchise environment in China. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Remuneration to executives has risen sharply, even during the recent economic decline and financial crisis, giving rise to public outcries and harsh criticism. At the same time, there has been a shift toward more performance-based remuneration, which is generally awarded over the long term. Coincident with these observations is an evolving literature aimed at studying executive pay and its determinants to learn if a pay-for-performance link exists. Although most studies focus on corporate financial performance (CFP) as a compensation determinant, which is based on shareholder theory, others broaden performance to include activities linked to corporate social responsibility (CSR), which relies on stakeholder theory. In this latter case, a nexus is identified between the pay-for-performance relationship and that between CFP and corporate social performance (CSP). In this research, we use a system of equations to form this connection and examine the influence of short-term versus long-term compensation measures on the resulting interrelationships.

This theoretical study contributes to the debate in the field of strategic HRM on whether HRM systems should differ across employee groups within the firm. It explores differences in the efficacy of two HRM systems-high-involvement HR and internal labor market systems-across top management teams, middle managers, and professional employees. In addition, it examines factors that may prevent the adoption of effective HRM systems for these groups of knowledge workers. A model is proposed depicting how four job-level moderators influence the HRM-performance relationship and how these moderators apply to each of the three employee groups. Short-term performance pressures and favoritism in staffing are proposed as factors that may hinder the adoption of effective HRM systems. Finally, HRM systems for different employee groups are classified based on their gains potential and barriers to implementation, yielding four categories of strategic HRM activity metaphorically labeled low-hanging fruits, high-hanging fruits, peanuts, and barren land.

This paper draws on labor process theory (LPT) to explain how capitalism creates conditions that give rise to a demand for internal auditing. Internal auditing developed from the metamorphosis of capitalism during the twentieth century, when capital gradually succeeded in institutionalizing structural control of labor processes to address the problem of control in inherently antagonistic capital-labor relationships. In this control context employees, management, and the board of directors are responsible for achieving the required rate of return on capital. With the premise that the literature has not adequately theorized the role of internal auditing in this context, this paper proposes an initial theorization of the role of internal auditing as a mechanism employed by management and the board of directors to control the labor process in the generation and realization of surplus value. Internal audit's assurance services to execute business activities according to management's conceptions, and its advisory services to enhance efficiency and effectiveness, are interpreted within the firm's overarching goal of maximizing the rate of return on capital employed. Future research agenda and methodological considerations are discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Microfinance Institutions provide financial services to poor people. Governance of these organizations is important so that they can operate efficiently and sustainably. This study analyzes the influence of stakeholders (donors, employees, customers, and creditors), on board structure (board size and CEO duality), and on organizational performance. We use a global data set of 379 microfinance institutions from 73 countries, collected from rating organizations. Supported by stakeholder theory, agency theory and resource dependence theory, we find stakeholders to be important and have various influences on microfinance institutions. We find donors to be associated with small boards, non-duality and better performance. Employees are associated with large boards, while customers are associated with duality and good financial performance. Creditors opt for duality and better social performance. Implications and areas for future research are discussed. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The phenomena of financialisation has had a universal and pervasive impact upon economies and societies in recent decades. Global finance is now typified by a more international, integrated and intensive mode of accumulation; a new business imperative of the maximization of shareholder value; and a remarkable capacity to become an intermediary in every aspect of daily life. The finance sector has progressively increased its share of GDP, and even for non-financial corporations the pursuit of interest, dividends and capital gains outweigh any interest in productive investment. As non-financial corporations have become increasingly drawn into a financial paradigm they have less capital available for productive activity. These financial pressures are translated into the operations of corporations through the enveloping regime of maximising shareholder value as the primary objective. Agency theory has provided the rationale for this project, prioritising shareholders above all other participants in the corporation. This article seeks to discover the origins of the financialisation of corporations in the early development of agency theory and shareholder value in Anglo-American corporations. The enduring myths of shareholder primacy are examined. The article concludes with a consideration of how the reform of corporate law might serve to strengthen the recognition and pursuit of the wider purposes of corporations and longer-term investment horizons.

Agricultural cooperatives have specific characteristics. Coop members may have different roles (owners, buyers, sellers and controllers) and, consequently, these players may have different objectives. The various stakeholders may also have different objectives from the management of the cooperative. This makes agency theory a good framework for the analysis of farmers' satisfaction with their cooperative. Based on a sample of 277 members of fruit and vegetable marketing cooperatives in Spain, the results show that members' satisfaction with the cooperative exerts a positive influence on members' desire to continue as members of that cooperative. The results also confirm the positive influence of trust, information and control on satisfaction. (c) 2014 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA).

Institutional investors report that they prefer to invest in firms with greater board independence despite the fact that researchers have been unable to demonstrate a link between board independence and firm performance. We investigate whether differences among institutional investors affect these preferences. We find that trading strategies have some effect but that mutual funds - facing the strongest institutional pressures - have significantly stronger preferences for firms with greater board independence than do other types of institutional investors. This suggests that institutional investor preferences for independent boards are at least partially driven by institutional pressures rather than anticipated reductions in agency costs.

Agency theory is one of the most important foundational theories in management research, but it rests on contestable cognitive assumptions. Specifically, the principal is assumed to hold a perfect (correct) theory regarding some of the content of the agent's mind, while he is entirely ignorant concerning other such content. More realistically, individuals have some limited access to the minds of others. We explore the implications for classical agency theory of realistic assumptions regarding the human potential for interpersonal sensemaking. We discuss implications for the design and management of rewards, and trace implications for value creation in principal-agent relations. (c) 2014 European Academy of Management.

Drawing from agency theory and socioemotional wealth considerations, we evaluate the extent post-IPO investment policy choices and their economic consequences differ for family firms relative to nonfamily firms. Our results suggest that family firms underinvest in post-IPO liquidity, total investment spending, and R&D expenditures, relative to similar non-family firms. On the other hand, family firms overinvest in capital spending and underinvest in acquisition spending relative to nonfamily firms with dispersed but not concentrated ownership structures. Furthermore, while increases in R&D spending decrease shareholder value in family firms, the reverse is the case with acquisition spending. (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Purpose - With the licence season 2013/2014 onwards Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Financial Fair Play (FFP) fully came into force. Among other things, FFP demands from the clubs to operate within their own revenues in order to counteract the increasing over indebtedness in European club football. The purpose of this paper is to cast further light on the relationship between UEFA and the clubs as the main actors of FFP and to derive implications to UEFA to improve the efficacy of this regulatory intervention. Design/methodology/approach - This paper explicitly examines the case of FFP from an agency theory perspective. A positivist agency approach is applied in order to describe and explain (potential) problems in the relationship between UEFA and the clubs. Findings - The paper demonstrates that the relationship between UEFA and the clubs corresponds in many aspects to a classic principal-agent problem. A potential conflict of interest between both actors is outlined which together with asymmetric information creates incentives for opportunistic behaviour on the part of the clubs. The necessity of a stronger emphasis and communication of the economic and sport ethical legitimacy of FFP is detected. Practical implications - It is suggested that UEFA should consider taking a more proactive stance and endeavour to prevent non-compliance not only by limiting the opportunities to do so but also by providing information as well as education. Originality/value - FFP is supposed to have ground-breaking consequences for European club football. This is the first paper to systematically examine (potential) agency problems inherent in FFP.

Design/methodology/approach - Annual financial data and stock prices of 192 firms from six different sectors on the Bursa Malaysia are collected for the period 2000-2007. Analysis using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test is carried out to analyze industrial and time differences in cash holdings. The ordinary least square (OLS) regression technique is used to understand the relationships between various attributes with the level of cash holdings. Due to issues of endogeneity, the generalized method of moments method is also applied. Findings - Significant differences are found to exist in the level of cash holdings between firms and across time. It is found that firms adjust to a target level of cash holdings, although this is done relatively slowly. Also, significance of firm characteristics and their relationships with cash holdings indicate that other than the pecking order theory, the trade-off theory and the agency theory can help explain the level of cash holdings of firms in Malaysia. Originality/value - Most studies on cash holdings have been carried out in developed countries. Malaysia is an advanced emerging market with significant state control and firm structure being largely family-oriented. Hence, a study on a different market with different types of firm structures will contribute significantly to the existing literature on corporate cash holdings. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The world-wide inflation in executive compensation in recent years has been accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of long-term incentives. This article demonstrates how the subjectively perceived value of long-term incentives is affected by risk aversion, uncertainty aversion, and time preferences. Based on a unique empirical study which involved collecting primary data on executive preferences from around the world, and using a theoretical framework which draws on behavioral agency theory, we conclude that, while long-term incentives are perceived by executives to be effective, they are not in fact an efficient form of reward, and that this outcome is not significantly affected by cross-cultural differences. We conjecture that boards of directors, acting on behalf of shareholders, increase the size of long-term incentive awards in order to compensate executives for the perceived loss of value when compared with less risky, more certain and more immediate forms of reward.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an extensive and critical overview of the theoretical perspectives used in the accounting disclosure literature including economic theories, political and social theories.
Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews and discusses in details the positive accounting theory (PAT), agency theory, signalling theory, political economy theory (PET), stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory and contingency theory to identify the situations suit each of these perspectives.
Findings - The main finding shows that there is no universal theory applicable for all situations or societies. For example, PAT is probably used when a corporation believes that its primary responsibility is to use its resources and engage in activities designed to maximise its profits. On the other hand, the PET seems to better explain why some corporations appear to respond to government or public pressure for information about their social impact. The agency theory provides the required framework to evaluate accounting choices and disclosure decisions in market-based studies.While the legitimacy theory seems to be more suitable for multinational corporations working in developed/democratic countries, the stakeholder theory seems to be most suitable for multinational corporations working in developing/dictator countries; whereas a corporation can manage its stakeholders. The contingency theory supports our main finding that different theories are required for different situations, as it clearly indicates that management's preferences of reporting practices are related to the nature of environmental and organisational constraints rather than their relative income effects.
Originality/value - The paper contributes to the limited body of literature concerning the accounting disclosure theories and to identify the main theoretical perspective that can be used in the accounting disclosure research. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We examine leverage decisions in the context of national culture over the 1996-2010 period. Cultural characteristics can explain capital structure decisions from emerging-markets cross-listings. The results show that firms from countries with high Individualism and Indulgence employ more debt. Firms located in countries with high Power Distance, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Long-term Orientation are less leveraged. Additionally, Exchange-traded and capital-raising ADRs are more likely to be from countries with weaker corporate governance. Univariate tests show that capital-raising ADRs employ less debt relative to non-capital-raising ADRs, and notably, in the post-cross-listing period. Interestingly, the home country's cultural characteristics of capital-raising and exchange-traded ADRs exert less influence on their capital structure decisions. Our findings suggest that there is a value discount associated with increased firm leverage. Our insights have practical implications for portfolio managers attempting to enter emerging markets through the use of ADRs. Moreover, investors can evaluate the often neglected effect of cultural values into firm performance. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: We aimed at testing transformational leadership's (TFL's) capacity to enhance followers' willingness to engage in selfless pro-organizational behavior (SPB), that is, behavior for the benefit of the company that is inapt to be instrumentally used for self-serving purposes and carried out despite salient personal costs. Furthermore, we aimed at demonstrating organizational identification to mediate this relation. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this study with three time points of data collection, 321 employees completed questionnaires measuring TFL, organizational identification, and-to control for dispositional effects-honesty/humility. SPB was captured applying a distribution task where participants had to make trade-off decisions between pro-self and pro-company distribution alternatives. In addition, participants' general willingness to engage in SPB was measured using a self-report questionnaire. Findings: We found TFL to predict followers' (willingness to engage in) selfless pro-organizational behavior and organizational identification to fully mediate this relation. Implications: Among other things, our findings challenge the negative assumptions regarding human motivation and behavior (e.g., people invariably driven by self-interest) inherent in some influential management-related theories (e.g., agency theory). Originality/Value: Getting followers to transcend their self-interest for company benefits is a core element of TFL theory. However, this core idea is difficult to test by means of questionnaires that measure citizenship behavior in field study research because three motives remain intertwined: pro-social values or orientation, organizational concern, and impression management motive. By disentangling company interest from employees' self-interest and controlling for honesty/humility as an indicator for pro-social orientation, our study represents a more rigorous attempt to empirically confirm this assumption.

The nature of staff turnover accounting procedures in a labour intensive context has been examined by conducting interviews with twenty eight managers in large three to five star hotels and two theme parks. It was found that the main staff turnover accountability procedures adopted involve monthly departmental reporting of staff turnover percentage levels and also the conduct of exit interviews. A degree of staff turnover costing was noted, although this practice was not extensively applied. Most interviewees supported the notion of allocating staff turnover costs to those operating departments experiencing the turnover. A muted form of this practice was observed in one hotel, however most interviewees had never contemplated or heard of the practice. Agency theory has been utilized as a framework for structuring a range of observed and potential staff turnover accountability relationships. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Findings: Results showed that a concave relationship exists between firm value and cash holdings, which confirmed that there is an optimal cash level that maximizes firm value. It was also found that deviations from the optimal level affect firm value negatively.
Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between firm value and cash holdings for the period 2003-2008. This study seeks to find if there are costs and benefits associated with holding too much or too little cash, then an optimal cash level exists where marginal benefits are offset by their costs. If this optimal point exists, then firm value will be maximized at that point and deviation from it will affect the firm value negatively.
Design/methodology/approach: Optimal cash level between firm value and cash holding is determined by investigating the concave relationship. If concave relationship exists then a residual term is included in the equation to see how deviations from the optimal level affect firm value. A two-step generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator is used in estimating all results. GMM controls for unobserved firm heterogeneity and endogeneity problems.
Practical implications: The paper provides the existence of an optimal point of cash between costs and benefits wherein firm value is maximized. It has implications for firms' investment and financing decisions when there is limited access to external finance. At higher level of cash the study has implications for agency theory and governance practices.
Originality/value: The study establishes a conclusive relationship between firm value and cash holdings within the context of the Pakistani market. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The literature suggests that corporate diversification destroys firm value. This value destruction is usually considered to be a consequence of managers' pursuing diversification strategies to benefit themselves rather than to increase firm value. This paper provides evidence that casts doubt on this agency theory-based explanation for corporate diversification. Evidence based on insider trading suggests that managers themselves consider their diversification strategies to be value-increasing. Specifically, it is documented that corporate insiders (directors) purchase more of their firms' shares in the open market when corporate diversification is high. Moreover, insiders purchase more when the level of diversification discount is high, suggesting that they disagree with outside investors' undervaluation due to diversification. It is also found that the market reaction to insiders' purchases is positively related to corporate diversification. This result suggests that outsiders consider the amount of favourable information contained in insiders' purchases to increase with the extent of corporate diversification.

This article analyses the financing structure of social enterprises which usually have access to a wide range of funding sources. Although a diversified financing structure promises stability in terms of cash flows to the business, empirical evidence shows that social enterprises have a rather concentrated financing structure. This can be explained as a diversified financing structure that can result in conflicts which either originate from the capital providers' divergent return requirements or the design of financing instruments. To reduce these conflicts, inherent in a diversified financing structure social enterprises concentrate on the most suitable financing sources. As social and financial return requirements differ between capital providers, the concentration on a reduced number of financing sources implies a more clearly defined set of expectations that the social enterprise has to consider. The social enterprise needs to adapt to the expectations of its capital providers and align the strategy accordingly. Copyright (c) 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how information sharing practices influenced inter-firm relationships. This was done specifically in relation to bulk commodity supply chains, due to the pre-existing power asymmetries in the system. Design/methodology/approach - This research was conducted using an interpretivist, inductive approach. The intention was to gather a wide range of data and then explore the data to see which themes emerged, rather than focusing on collecting data relevant only to specific themes. Findings - The key findings of this research focused around the difference between creating situations of compliance or collaboration in a supply chain context. This suggests that by understanding the relationships that exist between organisations, those in procurement and supply chain management roles will be able to better understand and manage the nuances of their supplier relationships. Research limitations/implications - The study is focused on a supply network specifically configured to facilitate sourcing and distribution of bulk grain. As such the findings need to be understood within the constraints of this context. Practical implications - Reliance on coercive power in an institutional change process is shown in our study to create a situation of compliance rather than of collaboration. Reliance on a different type of power, such as referent power, would be more successful in creating a situation of collaboration. Social implications - The sourcing and distribution of bulk grain is fundamental to food distribution in a developed economy. Our study provides a set of propositions indicating where managers can focus to more effectively manage these flows. Originality/value - The definition of the "agent" also provided an interesting point of comparison. This research found that the ultimate definition of the "agent" changes and can be linked to the institutional differences in ownership within a supply chain. This suggests the potential to redefine the way that Agency theory is discussed. The notion that the "agent" is dynamic and is likely to be the "agent", "caretaker" and more at the same time suggests the potential for the traditional definition of the agent to be challenged.

Agency theory suggests that high pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) of CEO's compensation is an important motivation mechanism to the CEO to improve corporate performance. We develop a simple model that suggests that reverse causality should also be considered. Specifically, our model predicts that when good performance is expected, a powerful CEO will push for a contract with higher PPS. Data from 135 Israeli companies over a five-year period confirm the model's main prediction. Our empirical analysis shows that when the CEO is the chairman of the board of directors and thus is more powerful in affecting his compensation scheme, he achieves a high PPS in good periods (in terms of corporate performance), compared to similar powerful CEOs in periods of bad performance, and also compared to less powerful CEOs in good periods.

The purpose of this research is to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for interpreting Shariah governance mechanism in Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). After reviewing existing theories that were used to explain the phenomenon of corporate governance, three most commonly used theories in the corporate governance and Shariah governance area namely agency theory, stewardship theory and stakeholder theory were used and integrated based on their interrelated concepts and their relationship with Shariah governance. The constructed theoretical framework includes five concepts, namely accountability, disclosure and transparency, competency, confidentiality and independency among the key functionaries in Shariah governance, which are perceived to be the principles of Shariah governance. This research is among the first attempts to build an integrated theoretical foundation for Shariah governance in IFIs and the developed theoretical framework can be used as the basis for interpretations and comparisons on the ideal versus practical situation of Shariah governance in IFIs.

This study examines the impact on firm performance of theoretically consistent relationships between three management control systems (MCS) design choices - delegation, performance measurement, and incentive compensation. Based upon the three-legged stool model and agency theory, the hypothesis is that theoretically consistent MCS design choices are associated with enhanced firm performance. Using survey data from large Australian firms, the findings support the hypothesis, suggesting that an appropriate MCS design is a determinant of firm performance. The study contributes to the literature by moving beyond a focus on the antecedents of the three key MCS design choices to the consequence of alignment of those choices. (c) 2014 Taylor & Francis.

Are there country-level differences in the use of pay-for-performance in executive compensation contracts? We investigate how formal country-level institutions affect pay-for-performance directly and if institutions have a moderating effect on the relation between ownership structure and pay-for-performance contracts. Based on agency theory arguments, we show that substitutionary and complementary relations are conceivable, for the direct and the moderating effect. We conduct an empirical analysis based on 2766 firm-year observations for the years 2005-2008. Our empirical results show that whereas strong shareholder protection substitutes pay-for-performance, disclosure requirements complement pay-for-performance. Additionally, strong shareholder protection complements the effect of concentrated ownership on pay-for-performance while disclosure requirements substitute effects of ownership concentration. Overall, our results provide evidence for the relevance of formal institutions as determinants of executive compensation contracts. Additionally, our results indicate the general complexity of integrating institutions and internal governance mechanisms. (c) 2014.

Professional institutions are increasingly confronted by fiscal constraints and political pressures to improve and increase their accountability in a competitive consumer-driven market. Accordingly, the need to ensure efficiency and accountability is of strategic importance. This article reports on a qualitative study of medical professionals that assessed the utility of financial incentives and external control methods derived from agency theory to ensure accountability of professionals. The authors argue that approaches derived from stewardship and institutional theories can extend the principal-agent perspective to sustain greater social and ethical accountability.

Classic financial agency theory recommends compensation through stock options rather than shares to counteract excessive risk aversion in agents. In a setting where any kind of risk taking is suboptimal for shareholders, we show that excessive risk taking may occur for one of two reasons: risk preferences or incentives. Even when compensated through restricted company stock, experimental CEOs take large amounts of excessive risk. This contradicts classical financial theory, but can be explained through risk preferences that are not uniform over the probability and outcome spaces, and in particular, risk seeking for small probability gains and large probability losses. Compensation through options further increases risk taking as expected. We show that this effect is driven mainly by the personal asset position of the experimental CEO, thus having deleterious effects on company performance. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates which corporate governance and firm-specific characteristics lead firms to be prone to ex-post moral hazard by misallocating the funds that they specifically borrowed for financing their R&D activities. We study 106 firms that received a specially designed loan by a Turkish government to be invested only in R&D and technological innovations. We find that as the size of the loan increases firms are less prone to moral hazard. For family firms our results support the agency theory. For large shareholders, initially our results are aligned with the agency theory but after controlling for the loan size our results hold for the stewardship theory. We also find that as amount of the loans increases relative to size of firms, the performance of projects financed by these loans plummets. Finally, we show that moral hazard related to R&D and innovation activities varies across industries.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We look at the reaction to hedge fund activism of managers and shareholders in Japanese firms and explore the implications of our findings for agency theory. Research Findings/Insights: Confrontational shareholder activism of the kind practiced by American and British hedge funds in Japan during the 2000s failed to gain acceptance from Japanese investors and managers or to alter the internal focus of corporate governance practices in Japanese firms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We use a qualitative research design which treats the standard agency-theoretical model of the firm as only one possible approach to understanding corporate governance, to be tested through empirical research, rather than as an assumption built into the analysis. We find that Japanese managers do not generally regard themselves as the shareholders' agents and that, conversely, shareholders in Japanese firms do not generally behave as principals. Our findings suggest that the standard principal-agent model may be a weak fit for firms in certain national contexts. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For policymakers, our work demonstrates the importance of understanding the distinctive features of national-level corporate governance arrangements. For practitioners, it cautions against the view that national corporate governance systems are converging around the model of shareholder primacy and directs attention to the need for investors to be informed of the diversity of practices across different countries.

This study examines the determinants of board structure for Taiwanese firms by reviewing their board elections, held between 1991 and 2009. The paper emphasizes three factors: the distinction between insider-affiliated and non-insider-affiliated outside directors based on family relationships, governmental agency theory-based regulations, and the firm's choice between agency and stewardship governance philosophy. Evidence has shown that the proportion of non-insider-affiliated outsiders on the board is sensitive to changes in firm and CEO characteristics, and to changes in government regulations. Government regulations significantly shape corporate boards, encouraging a smaller size, more outside directors, and fewer insider-affiliated outside directors. For firms adopting agency and stewardship theories as governance arrangement, the determinants of board structure are diverse. The board structure of principal-steward firms is less susceptible to changes in firm characteristics but more susceptible to CEO influence, and more responsive to government regulations.

The current study examines the relationship between executive compensation and firm performance in the U.S. lodging industry. It is not clear-cut whether performance leads to compensation or compensation drives firm performance. Our contention is that cash and lagged equity-based compensation drive the firm performance. Our findings suggest that chief executive officer's (CEO) contemporaneous cash-compensation and one-year lagged equity-compensation positively affect the accounting performance measures return on assets and Tobin's Q; but neither compensation components affects the market-performance measure, stock returns, in the lodging industry. Quantitatively similar findings are found for the chief financial officer (CFO). Further robustness test show that further lags of equity compensation of both named executives do not result in increased stock performance in the lodging industry. (c) 2013.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Should responsibility for strategic planning and execution be assigned to the same manager? Should a firm have a chief operating officer with responsibilities distinct from those of the chief executive officer? How does the division of labor affect managerial opportunism? This paper uses a formal agency-theoretic model to address these questions and present a new theory of the division of managerial labor. Building on Penrose's typology [Penrose E (2009) The Theory of the Growth of the Firm, 4th ed. (Blackwell, Oxford, UK)], the theory identifies when to assign (i) entrepreneurial services, which relate to strategic planning and the acquisition of resources, and (ii) managerial services, which relate to execution, to the same generalist manager rather than to different specialists. The analysis reveals the critical importance of separability, i.e., whether a supervisor can separately observe the outcomes of entrepreneurial and managerial services. If managers and their supervisor have symmetric information about separability, hiring a generalist dominates because managerial services, which are easier to assess, reduce the scope for opportunism associated with entrepreneurial services, which are harder to assess. Conversely, if managers have better information regarding separability and the probability of separability is low, hiring specialists dominates because hiring a generalist allows the potential for opportunism associated with entrepreneurial services to contaminate the provision of managerial services. Even so, the benefits of hiring a generalist may be restored if the services are sequenced appropriately. An implication of such sequencing is that a firm will grow in fits and starts, giving rise to a "Penrose effect" even if labor market frictions do not impede the assimilation of new managers.

Reducing overhead is a target for governments across Europe that are looking for ways to economize. This study contributes to our understanding of overhead levels in different types of agencies. Regression and fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) are applied to examine the relationship between an agency's overhead level and its formal autonomy, result control, size, and task. The results support the claim that greater formal autonomy leads to a higher overhead, especially when combined with performance-based target setting or when frequent monitoring is absent. The relationship, however, is nonlinear. Distinct effects for the different subdimensions of result control are found. Agency size and task mediate the relationship between formal autonomy, result control and overhead, but only in specific combinations. Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC 2014.

This study analyses whether or not the effect of board independence on a firm's strategic performance is moderated by family involvement in ownership and control. Moderation of the board's size and the independent director ratio are tested under quadratic specifications. The effect of CEO duality with family involvement on long-term sales growth is also measured. The empirical analysis is conducted in the Southern European context using a sample of publicly traded firms that have concentrated ownership structures. The main findings indicate that when nonlinearities are considered, family involvement moderates the relationship between the independent director ratio and firm performance. The optimal proportion of independent directors is lower in family businesses than in non-family ones. However, the results fail to support nonlinearities for board size. We find positive linear relationships between both board size and CEO duality with firm performance, which are not moderated by family involvement.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate whether hiring a high-quality auditor (i.e. industry specialist) depends on corporate governance indicators after controlling a different level of agency conflicts (ACs). Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses logistic regressions on 12,449 firm-year samples of Taiwanese public companies from 1998 to 2011 by grouping the samples into three categories (i.e. low, medium and high AC). Findings - The results show that the corporate governance indicators can explain the decision of auditor selection only in low and mediumACgroups, which suggest that there may be a complementary relationship between external (i.e. auditors) and internal governance when the ACs are mild. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the ongoing debate between the complementary and substitutable effects. When the internal ACs are controlled, the internal governance and auditor selection are complemented. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Agency theory is used to investigate the relationship between top management team involvement on not-for-profit hospitals' boards of directors (BODs) and hospital financial performance. Governance data collected in 2011 by The Governance Institute was merged with hospital financial performance data from the 2011 Medicare Cost Reports. Then, an ordinary least squares regression model, using propensity score adjustments, was used to evaluate the relationship between management involvement on the BOD and three financial performance profitability ratios: total margin, operating margin, and return on assets. The sample included 637 not-for-profit hospitals, most of which (74.1%) were not government owned. As hypothesized, we found that having a larger number of managers with voting rights on the BOD was associated with lower total margin (b= -0.011, p < .065). Similarly, we found that having a greater percentage of voting BOD members who were managers was associated with lower total margin (b= -0.296, p < .002) and return on assets (b= -0.337, p < .072). We did not find support for the notion that CEO involvement on the BOD is associated with poorer hospital financial performance (b= -0.008, p < .437). Consistent with agency theory, our findings suggest that management involvement on the BOD is associated with poorer hospital financial performance. This finding suggests that management involvement on the BOD may impair the BOD's ability to effectively monitor the actions of management, which may lead managers to make decisions that are more consistent with their own interests than those of the organization.

Purpose: This paper aims to focus on governance theories and practice variables in Not-For-Profit Service Organizations. The research answers two questions: what the prevalent governance practices of Not-for-Profit Service Organizations (NPSO) are, and whether there is a crossover among NPSO governance practices and For-Profit-Organization theories in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire to the 285 organizations within the defined parameters obtained a 18 percent response. Data were collected regarding the boards' predominant roles in the organizations' governance activities, the top executives' predominant roles in the organizations' operations and their interrelationship with the boards, and the boards' most common meeting agenda topics. Findings: The findings prove that governance models in NPSO are mostly driven by Agency Theory (52 percent of the sample). Stewardship and Resource Dependence Theories also contribute to existing governance models (28 percent), while some of the organizations have developed Hybrid Models (20 percent) drawing from the various theories. Research limitations/implications: The limited number of organizations participating in the research does not allow a generalization. However the diversity of organization types and sizes within the scope do provide a panoramic view of the not-for-profit service sector. Practical implications: Having proved that there is a crossover of governance practices among For-Profit and Not-for Profit Organizations, this research opens the door to the evaluation of many other existing or potential crossovers in governance and other management elements. Originality/value: This research is novel in its approach to look for similarities rather than differences between For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Organizations. The approach allows both sectors to learn from each other and seek for fresh improvement alternatives. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Nowadays, separation of ownership from control in business causes the inability of shareholders to have a full control over managerial actions. In this situation, agency theory assumes an opportunistic behavior, that is, individuals want to maximize their own expected interests and are resourceful in doing so. This opportunistic behavior leads to conflict of interest betweenmanagers and shareholders on the one hand, and majority andminority shareholders on the other. From the agency theory perspective, the aim of Corporate Governance (CG) is to mitigate these agency conflicts and direct the operations to achieve an appropriate performance. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the relationship between CG characteristics and firm performance in Malaysian listed firms where divergence between cash flow and control rights is critical. Based on a randomly selected sample of 400 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia and applying the linear multiple regression, it is found that board independency and CEO duality have respectively positive and negative relationship with firm performance. In addition, audit quality has a significantly positive relationship with firm performance. The contribution of this study is to add a dummy interaction between audit quality and divergence between cash flow and control rights. It is found that high-quality audit firms can mitigate the agency problems in firms with divergence between cash flow and control rights. (c) 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

Purpose - This paper aims to provide insight whether disclosed compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) leads to higher valuation on the German stock market.Design/methodology/approach - Based on agency theory, stakeholder theory and institutional theory, the authors conduct a meta-analysis and evaluate the value relevance of the compliance with the GCGC.Findings - The research finds that compliance with the GCGC is mainly not a value-relevant factor for German companies listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.Research limitations/implications - The research considered is not fully comparable with regard to observation date, full integration of the GCGC rules and company selection/sample size. Future research is encouraged to research the valuation effects of compliance with the GCGC for a longer time horizon, the use of uniform performance measures and the integration of all GCGC rules.Practical implications - Compliance with the GCGC has not proven to be a value-driver for German listed companies. The authors recommend companies to search for opportunities to make their corporate governance more comprehensive by expanding their corporate governance reporting and thus providing deeper insights on how their processes of management and control work.Originality/value - The paper is the first investigation integrating the results of ten years of "code compliance - market valuation" research in Germany. We detect reasons why soft law regulation by corporate governance codes did not function on the German stock market. We additionally address behavioral aspects why investors do not give enough relevance to companies' corporate governance statements so far. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Background: Despite continued scrutiny over executive earnings in the health care industry, the evidence for executive pay determinants is uncertain and inconclusive. Theoretical motivations for executive compensation practices have been debated, and questions remain about the explanatory power of previously applied theoretical models. Purposes: Our systematic review considered evidence of executive compensation determinants among health care organizations and sought to identify factors affecting executive pay that are commonly supported by previous studies. We also aimed to survey the theoretical perspectives employed in health care executive compensation studies to address how organization theory may explain executive remuneration practices at health care organizations. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Twenty-one eligible studies were identified after a search of the MEDLINE/PubMed and CINAHL electronic reference databases and the reference lists of relevant studies. Eligible studies included those examining health care organizations and providing empirical, regression-based outcomes regarding the determinants of executive compensation. Each eligible study was coded to identify pertinent information, including study settings, executive compensation measures, executive compensation determinants and their measures (e.g., financial performance measured as profit margin), outcomes (direction and level of statistical significance of regression model coefficients), and theoretical applications. Findings: Studies are mixed in their findings regarding the statistical significance of various determinants of executive compensation. Many studies indicate that, in addition to firm financial performance, other factors may influence health care executive compensation, including organizational size and human capital attributes. Agency theory was the predominant framework applied, yet the findings suggest a complementary theoretical perspective may better explain health care executive compensation. Practice Implications: To address critics who assert health care executive compensation levels are not consistent with organizational performance, health care organization CEOs, board members, and consultants would benefit to carefully consider and effectively communicate the numerous factors influencing executive compensation beyond firm financial performance.

This study proposes a revised agency theory for the nonprofit sector, distinguishes between the extent of agency and the extent of monitoring, and compares the magnitudes of the two impacts. Using panel data for 1998-2003, the paper tests whether monitoring by principal-stakeholders such as donors, clients, the government, and the board reduces the opportunity for executive misconduct such as extravagant spending on compensation and perquisites. Given the theory, the findings show that two effects influence CEO salaries. First, while nonprofit endowments provide a fiscal cushion in tough financial situations, by offering "organizational slack" they also increase the CEO's opportunity to steal or raise her compensation (i.e., agency effect). Second, donors utilize monitoring mechanisms such as auditing or direct observations, which limit the opportunity for misconduct and reduce executive pay (i.e., monitoring effect). In the final analysis, the monitoring effect is greater than the agency effect, which implies that even if agency problems are present, the monitoring that donors provide offsets them.

This paper investigates the agency costs of multinational companies (MNCs) in relation to agency theory, in the Malaysian business environment. Using the data of 235 MNCs, this study explores their demand for monitoring costs and these companies' preferences between the monitoring costs components. The result indicates that MNCs incur significantly higher monitoring costs compared to domestic companies. However, the relationship between these companies and their preference between the components of the monitoring mechanisms, that is between directorship and auditing as their monitoring mechanism, is not significant. When the auditing components are further investigated, it reveals that MNCs incur more external audit costs compared to internal audit costs. (c) 2014, University of Malaya. All rights reserved.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of higher-quality auditors on corporate risk-taking. Design/methodology/approach - Agency theory suggests that managers have incentives to avoid risk in the interests of perquisite consumption and self-preservation, while investors prefer that managers invest in all projects with a positive net present value, i.e. projects that generally increase corporate risk. Empirical literature finds that managerial risk-aversion is mitigated (and firm value enhanced) when investor protection is higher. The authors examine whether higher-quality auditing is one such mechanism to encourage shareholder-focused corporate risk-taking. They model measures of corporate risk as a function of whether a firm is audited by an industry specialist or not, controlling specifically for accounting quality. They then examine the incremental effect of higher-quality audits on other forms of external monitoring (analyst coverage and institutional holdings) for corporate risk. Findings - Using a sample from 2003 to 2007, the authors document a positive relationship between local-level audit industry specialization and both the standard deviation of annual stock returns and research and development expenditures (their measures of corporate risk-taking). They then find the effect is mitigated when firms have alternative external monitoring, in the form of either higher analyst coverage or greater institutional holdings. Research limitations/implications - Given the nature of the question the authors ask, particularly in the context of the auditor- client relationship, a potential limitation is the difficulty in assigning causation. Nonetheless, this study underscores the importance of auditors as an effective mechanism for monitoring corporate managers. Originality/value - This study provides novel evidence that auditors affect managerial decision making beyond a simple effect on financial statements, and should be of interest to boards of directors, regulators and investors.

We examine how time preferences impact the financing decision of firms. We hypothesize that the degree of long-term orientation in a country is positively related to the use of bank relationship lending. Based on a thorough theoretical investigation and an extensive empirical analysis using a large, worldwide dataset, we find strong support for our hypothesis on the role of time preferences for financial intermediation. Our results are robust to controlling for other determinants of the choice of debt financing as well as to applying alternative variables and different estimation methods. Firms in long-term orientation countries appear to prefer relationship bank financing, since it is usually available for the long run and will not be withdrawn quickly in response to adverse developments. This allows managers to preserve a more strategic view and pursue longer planning horizons. (c) 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Research Question/Issue: When the stock options granted to CEOs go underwater, boards of directors tend to award additional stock options to their CEOs. Drawing on agency theory and attribution theory, this study explores social psychological mechanisms that explain why boards of directors increase new option grants to CEOs in response to underwater options. Research Findings/Insights: Using the compensation data of CEOs at 966 US firms, we found that contextual factors such as market conditions and industry performance affected boards of directors' decisions to grant new stock options. Consistent with our hypotheses, boards of directors granted a greater number of new options to CEOs in response to CEOs' underwater options during the recession period than the recovery period, and they granted fewer new options when the firm's industry performance was high rather than low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study incorporates attribution theory in understanding boards of directors' causal attribution of firm performance and its impact on executive compensation. It complements earlier studies on causal attribution by exploring the role of contextual factors. It also contributes to the research by examining the attribution process of boards of directors rather than that of top management, as well as the consequences of the causal attribution in terms of ex-post adjustment in executive option compensation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides up-to-date and improved evidence on boards' decision making about executive stock options. Practitioners and policy makers can benefit from the study's findings that board members rely on contextual information about the market and the competition when they make causal attribution of firm performance changes, which tends to affect their decisions about executive compensation.

The historical evolution of corporate governance is considered, highlighting the different eras of governance, the dominant theoretical and practical paradigms, the reformulation of paradigms and counter paradigms. Two alternative and sharply contrasting theorizations, one collective and collaborative (the work of Berle and Means), the other individualistic and contractual (agency theory and shareholder value) are focused upon. The explanatory potential of Blair and Stout's team production theory is elaborated, and its conception of the complexity of business enterprise, with a mediating hierarch (the board of directors) securing a balance between the interests of different stakeholders. The potential for reform of corporate purpose, corporate governance and directors' duties is examined with reference to the UK Modern Company Law Review. The impact of the intensification of the financialization of corporations is analysed, with the increased emphasis upon short-termism. The origins of the global financial crisis in shareholder value orientations and the continuing reverberations of the crisis are explored. Finally, the imperative of the advance of sustainable enterprise is argued, and the critical changes necessitated in corporate purpose and directors' duties.

This exploratory study, based on document analysis, reveals the responses of Israeli hotels to the community members in need of assistance during the fall 2012 Gaza conflict. The study describes the role of hotels in society in times of danger indicating that some hotels demonstrated social responsibility toward the community in need even at their own expense. We discuss the accommodation offers made to guests by various types of hotels based on the principles of agency theory, homophily, duty of care, and Kew Garden Principles (KGPs). Directions for future research are proposed, as well as potential implications for educators, practitioners, and policy makers are suggested. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We lack an overarching and unifying theory of corporate governance. The most popular theoretical framework, the agency theory, led to the evolution of the Anglo-Saxon model of corporate governance that is used widely to help the board of directors in curbing excessive executive power in the hands of management. However, with the blurring of the roles of the principal and the agent, the currently prevalent governance frameworks, based on this theory, have become self limiting and ineffective. Efforts to supplement the agency theory with alternative theoretical frameworks such as the stakeholder theory and the stewardship theory have, at times, tended to place the board of directors in conflict with their legal obligations that requires them to work in the interests of the shareholders. A governance model based on the Gandhian concept of trusteeship, while providing fresh insights, suffers from problems in implementation and remains, at best, an idealistic goal to aim for. We need new theoretical insights that will take us towards a comprehensive theory of governance. This paper seeks to revisit the discussion on the various theoretical frameworks for corporate governance and suggests that a new and different framework is required as the underlying theory for corporate governance. One such framework is based on viewing the 'organization as an organism' with its primary focus on the organization's longevity and growth and which seeks to maximize the long term strategic value for an organization.

This research focuses on the relationship between corporate governance and performance in the largest European listed banks, which have been studied to a lesser extent within this field. The study is based on agency theory and we use a sample of 404 observations referring to 97 banks selected from the annual ranking of the 2,000 biggest companies in the world prepared by Forbes. The paper covers the period from 2006 to 2010, thus, examining the changes in the performance drivers in the recent financial crisis. On the basis of the panel data analysis, we confirm that the variety of governance factors including board size, insider appointed, directors' age, board meetings and affiliated committees influence the performance of the banks. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the effect of corporate governance on the financial performance of the financial companies in times of high capital market volatility.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

The study investigates the moderating effect of CEO (Chief Executive Officer) duality and CEO ownership on the relationship between organisational slack and firm performance. Through reviewing relevant literature on organisational slack, agency and stewardship theories, this study develops hypotheses on the relationship between organisational slack and firm performance and the moderations of CEO duality and CEO ownership. On the basis of a large data of Chinese firms, this study finds that there is a positive relationship between organisational slack and firm performance, and the moderating effect of CEO duality is positive, whereas that of CEO ownership is insignificant. The findings not only improve the understanding on the performance implication of organisational slack but also indicates that stewardship theory is more powerful than agency theory in China.

We analyze the direct and simultaneous effects of internationalization on the ownership structure of Latin American companies based on agency theory. Using a sample of 425 Latin American firms between 2007 and 2011, which corresponds to 1,776 observations, we use random effects and three-stage least squares panel data regression to test these effects. We find that the hypothesized positive effect of internationalization on ownership concentration is rejected. Our results support the negative relationship that is predicted by principal-agent theory when analyzing the effect of ownership on the degree of internationalization. Greater internationalization via the equity entry mode is associated with lower levels of ownership concentration. Finally, there is simultaneity in the determination of the relationship between the degree of internationalization and ownership concentration.

We find that initial market reactions and long-run post-issue stock performance are negatively related to C-level executive insider sales, but unrelated to participation by nonexecutive insiders. We also find significantly lower post-issue abnormal earnings surprises for SEOs with C-level executive sales. Overall, the findings are consistent with the predictions of asymmetric information and agency theories. (c) 2014 Financial Management Association International.

This research provides an accurate picture of situations in which founder-CEOs are replaced (or not) by venture capitalists. Our analysis aims to go further than the schematic case of the founder being simply dismissed by investors in a conflictual context. We first review the literature dedicated to this subject in the light of the agency theory (AT) and the resource-based view (RBV). However, the limits of these theoretical frameworks lead us to investigate their extensions: the entrenchment theory (ET), the dynamic capabilities approach (DCA) and the cognitive governance perspective (CGP). In a second phase, in order to decode the replacement process, we designed an exploratory methodology based on qualitative data, thus deepening our understanding of the issues it entails in venture-backed companies. Finally, this field analysis allows us to build a typology of replacement scenarii, with each scenario being interpreted by combining relevant theories to explain all aspects of it. In line with the AT, the ET focuses on the FCs strategy to retain their position. The DCA analyses the CEOs' resources from a dynamic angle, in accordance with the RBV. The CGP is mobilised to characterise a conflict originating in a lack of skills. These results lead us to rethink the role of time and the nature of conflicts in the relationships between FCs and venture capitalists. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper aims at identifying impact of corporate governance variables i.e. board structure (board size, board independence, board activity and board busyness) and ownership structure (foreign promoters holding, institutional shareholding and CEO duality) on financial disclosures made by the Indian firms. Using cross sectional data of 325 listed firms for the financial year 2009-10, we compute financial disclosure score (using 171 checklist points) based on disclosure requirements of accounting standards. We find average disclosure score of 73%, maximum and minimum being 100% and 46% respectively. Our finding support agency theory in terms of monitoring role of board since board size is found to be significant however we do not find any influence of board independence on the disclosures. The study also supports resource dependency theory in terms of outside directorship which might provide exposure to different corporate environment, brings diverse perspectives and knowledge to the directors and this in turn leads to improved disclosures. We also support the notion that having foreign promoter shareholding improves disclosures. (c) 2014, Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

This study uses the London Stock Exchange (LSE), forced to demutualize due to major changes in its business environment, notably due to increased competition and technological advances, as field experiment to study corporate governance restructuring to adapt to new market conditions. The LSE improved its financial situation after demutualization and is an example of successful corporate governance restructuring. The LSE significantly restructured the composition of its board of directors following demutualization. The number of exchange members on the LSE board decreased after demutualization while the number of independent directors increased, pointing to a more "monitoring board", in support of an agency theory approach. Interestingly, the large majority of these independent directors had experiences in diverse business. The LSE significantly reorganized its management team to adapt to the new strategies triggered by demutualization and modified its compensation by increasing performance-related payments. Results suggest that demutualization brings efficiencies if accompanied by changes in the governing bodies and in the incentive structures of the exchanges. Most of our results could be relevant also, for example, for firms going public, for smaller firms that are expanding their activities and searching for outside investors and for companies facing major changes in their business environments.

Family governance is a typical governance structure in publicly traded firms in Taiwan and around the world. The founding family of a firm can choose direct ownership or a pyramidal ownership structure to achieve control over a publicly traded family business or a family business group. In addressing performance issues in family businesses, the family ownership structure could generate positive or negative impacts on performance. Thus, determining the contingent condition that will moderate the relationship between family ownership and performance is a key concern in family businesses. Utilizing longitudinal data in family businesses in Taiwan's personal computer industry, this study examines the relationships between the roles of professional managers on the board, the family ownership structure, and the firm's performance from agency theory viewpoint. The results indicate that the professional manager's position on the board will moderate the relationship between the family ownership structure and performance. Specifically, the professional managers serving as directors will enhance the positive impact from family direct ownership on performance and mitigate the negative performance impact from family pyramidal ownership. This study extends the principal-agent and principal-principal agency arguments by further considering the role of the professional manager's position in family businesses.

This study examines the relationship between cross-listing and managerial compensation of Chinese firms that concurrently issued A- and B-shares or A- and H-shares during 2001-2010. The results show that executive compensation is a positive factor to motivate Chinese A-share firms to cross-list as B- or H-shares; it implies that cross-listings could be employed as a way of asset appropriation at the managers' discretion. The results also confirm that corporate governance is important in determining cross-listings. Under the weak corporate governance institution, Chinese firms were chosen to cross-list based on political considerations rather than on economic merits, serving as a vehicle to signal the quality of state owned enterprises. The results are drawn on agency theory, signalling hypothesis and bonding hypothesis. (c) 2014 The Author(s).

In this study, we examine the interactions among cooperation and five other factors that affect supply chain performance in the context of third party logistics services. We develop a new research model, with degree of cooperation as a mediating construct and test the model's six research hypotheses using structural equation modelling. The data are from 105 manufacturing firms in Taiwan. The results show that the major factors contributing to cooperation are, in order of importance, self-control costs, transaction frequency and external uncertainty. The findings demonstrate that supply chain members should reinforce their collaborative behavior and activities and enhance cooperation in supply chains to achieve higher levels of performance overall in third party logistics services.

The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) have been globally accepted by more than 100 countries as of 2012 to reduce the global diversity in accounting standards that makes comparison of financial results from companies in other countries problematic when evaluating investment opportunities in equity capital for growth and expansion. The IFRS were adopted in Australia in 2005. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of the IFRS adoption on cross-listing of Australian firms and trading volume for the cross-listed Australian companies between 2002 and 2008. The sample of companies included in this study were all Australian companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) as of January 1, 2002, which were still listed on the ASX as of December 31, 2008. The test results based on the Australian cross-listed companies attest that the adoption of IFRS improves access to equity capital thus contributing to the literature on agency theory.

The decisions of private equity firms affect the development of industries and national economies, yet little is known about how these decisions are made. This doctoral thesis uses proprietary survey data from 136 private equity firms (mostly venture capital and buyout firms) located in the United States of America, Canada, and Europe to explore determinants and rules of decision-making in private equity firms. The results exhibit new facts about the objectives, minimum return requirements, success measures, decision metrics, exit decision power, and exit decision rules of private equity firms. Firstly, the data show that private equity firms incline towards simple decision heuristics and practitioner metrics; decision rules and metrics from established financial theory usually do not play an important role. In a private equity environment, market "imperfections" would appear to render the central models of established financial theory less useful for decision-making. The decision heuristics and metrics most popular among private equity practitioners can nevertheless (under certain conditions) deliver the same results as a policy to maximise net present value. Measured by this standard, the datasuggest, however, that at least some private equity firms are forfeiting better performance due to inappropriate or inconsistent application of decision heuristics and decision criteria. Secondly, the data reveal numerous links between the responses of private equity firms and their individual characteristics, suggesting, for example, that external funding has a streamlining influence on a private equity firm's choice of success measures, that private equity firms are capable of choosing success measures that are better suited to their investment strategy, and that buyout firms tend to procrastinate the exits of poor quality investments more frequently than those of other investments. Some of these results reflect differences in the business models of buyout firms and venture capital firms. Others can be explained using theories and constructs which represent new institutional economics and include agency theory, asymmetric information, and Black and Gilson's (1998) implicit contract over control hypothesis. One such result is the important role that reputation and idiosyncratic risk play in the decisions of private equity firms. Thirdly, new hypotheses developed from existing literature are tested against the empirical data in this thesis. The results support the expectations that private equity firms generally consider money multiples and internal rates of return more important than other measures of success, that they tend towards an early exit of poor quality investments (early culling) more often than they tend towards an early exit of performing investments, and that price considerations usually govern the choice of exit channel. Fourthly, the views of European private equity firms on the determinants and rules of decision-making usually do not differ materially from those of private equity firms in the United States of America and Canada. Existing differences between these two geographical regions appear to relate mainly to external factors, such as legality and the liquidity of stock and buyout markets rather than to factors within private equity firms. The results of this study should be useful to both scholars and practitioners in private equity. For scholars, this thesis provides novel data and insights into the determinants and rules of decision-making in private equity firms; its results should contribute to the development of new ideas and theories in this field of research. Practitioners are offered an understanding of potential pitfalls in decision-making. An increased awareness of these hazards should help improve the quality of their decisions.

The aim of this paper is to address the impact of certain audit committee characteristics identified by the ASX Corporate Governance Council on improving the effectiveness of corporate audit committees on the likelihood of financial distress. Using a sample of 155 listed Australian firms, this paper finds support for the argument that the adoption of some, but not all, recommendations concerning the formation of an audit committee is beneficial for firms, which in this paper is reflected in a reduced likelihood of financial distress. In particular, the presence of a financial expert and solely non-executive directors on audit committee are associated with lower financial distress likelihood. By contrast, chairperson duality is significantly positively related to the probability of financial distress. (c) Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Board remuneration in German listed companies becomes more and more subject of public and political discussion, concerning the presumed lack of transparency and too short-term orientation. Besides the increasing regulatory activity, the arrangement of board compensation constitutes a focal economic issue of current empirical corporate governance research. The purpose of our analysis is to identify factors determining the amount and the structure of board compensation in Germany. Our study of 128 German listed companies for the business year 2011 investigates the impact of company-, performance and corporate governance-related factors on board remuneration by means of a multivariate-regression analysis. The analysis indicates that company size has a positive impact and leverage a negative on management board compensation. Furthermore, ROE and return on total capital, as indicators for performance-related variables, both have a positive impact on the average level of management remuneration. However, the corporate governance-related characteristics as ownership concentration and size of the supervisory board have no significant impact on management board remuneration.

The study investigates the impact of changes in dividend taxes on dividend payment policies and in turn, the impact of dividend payments on share prices. An event study approach is used to analyse the share price movements before, on and after dividend announcement dates. The results for companies of which the dividend paid resulted in an increase in the dividend payout ratio were that share prices responded positively to the announcement on the announcement date and for the few days thereafter. The findings again underline the paradoxical nature of dividends and although a better understanding of the impact of dividends on South African companies was gained, the dividend puzzle remains largely unsolved.

This article evaluates the efficiency of existing dividend distribution tax in India from the perspective of investors' preference pattern, as revealed in the market. It investigates the announcement effect of dividend in India in the presence of dividend distribution tax with specific legislative intent of discouraging dividend distribution. Using data on large profitable firms, we show that despite firm-level tax, higher dividend payout announcement leads to significant rise in share price. This implies that despite being tax-disadvantaged, investors of large profitable firms prefer higher payout, because it mitigates agency cost of retention. This shows that dividend distribution tax is inefficient. JEL Classification: G32, G35. (c) 2014, (c) 2014 SAGE Publications India Private Limited.

This study investigates a link between corporate governance and ownership structures on firm performance of 293 companies listed on the Main and Second Board of Bursa Malaysia from 2000- 2006. A dynamic panel system generalized method of moment technique is applied to control the endogeneity effect. After controlling for size, gearing, industry and time, this study finds significant positive relationships between institutional and foreign shareholdings using both market and accounting performance measures. These results imply their positive roles in constraining any opportunistic behavior of management. Interestingly, role duality (positions of Chairman and CEO were the same person) was observed to be negatively related to both performance measures, thus supporting the recommendation by Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG). However, contrary to agency theory and MCCG, firm performance decreases with the increase in proportion of independent directors in the board. (c) 2014, Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

This study investigates the valuation effect of board characteristics in corporate Joint Venture (JV) investments. Despite the prevalence of a board's involvement in JV decisions in practice, extant literature is mute concerning how the board adds value to JV outcomes. Investigation into board contribution in JVs is insightful due to executives' self-serving behaviors that may underlie their JV pursuits and boards' resource provision that may mitigate critical JV challenges. The former (latter) sheds light on the board's monitoring (advisory) role in a firm's JV engagement. Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study investigates the value of representative board characteristics underscored by these two theoretical perspectives. Our results show that the two conventional board measures, board size and outside director ratio, do not have a significant explanatory power. In contrast, director experience associated with JV decisions and gained from within relevant industries are found to positively impact JV outcomes. Moreover, both board meeting frequency and director ownership have favorable moderating effects on the strength of the experience-value relationship. However, these two variables per se do not independently determine a JV's value. Our research results indicate the importance of taking an integrative view to the investigation of board effectiveness, a perspective which has long been neglected in board research. The findings of the present study contribute to the mixed findings of extant studies on board influence from an uninvestigated domain, JV. (c), 2014, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

Based on a sample of 182 Portuguese fitness SMEs we study the investment determinants of fitness SMEs in Portugal. The multiple empirical evidence obtained in this study lets us conclude that the main explanatory theories of firm investment cannot be considered mutually exclusive in explaining the investment of Portuguese fitness SMEs, since: 1) they adjust investment as a function of sales, corroborating the assumptions of Neoclassical theory; 2) cash flow is an important financial resource for investment, corroborating the assumptions of Free Cash Flow theory; and 3) external finance, namely debt, is a restrictive determinant of investment, which corroborates the assumptions of Agency theory. Besides these results, we find that growth opportunities and government subsidies are positive determinants of investment in Portuguese fitness SMEs, and the financial crisis of 2008 has a negative influence on investment in Portuguese fitness SMEs. The financial crisis of 2008 also means greater relative importance of cash flow and government subsidies for increased investment, and debt for diminished investment, in fitness SMEs.

Low labor costs and market access are no longer competitive differentiators; increasingly companies are looking to design and develop new products and services as a crucial source of competitive advantage. As the pressure to innovate increases, so does the tension between shorter-term exploitative development and longer-term exploratory innovation activities. We explore this tension using interview data from software SMEs and venture capitalist firms who invest in technology-driven companies. Findings indicate that, despite firm's having established solid innovation plans, short-term exploitative demands crowd out their longer-term exploration innovation during the development phase. Agency and resource dependence theories are used to start to explore some of the reasons for this shift. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Purpose - Stewardship theory is an emergent approach for explaining leadership behavior, challenging the assumptions of agency theory and its dominance in corporate governance literature. This study revisits the agency and stewardship theories by seeking to answer whether chief executive officers (CEOs) in China are committed stewards or opportunistic agents.
Practical implications - One size does not fit all. Leadership behaviors in China do not follow the agency assumptions inherent in Western practices, rather they favor the conditions of positive leadership expressed by the stewardship theory. Assuming that the motivations of managers in emerging markets such as China are similar to those in the West may lead to a poor fit between governance policies and the institutional context.
Design/methodology/approach - Based on 5,165 observations of 1,036 listed companies in China over the period 2005-2010, the results suggest that the corporate governance mechanisms developed from the agency theory in the West are not necessarily applicable in the Chinese context.
Findings - This study supports the stewardship theory in its findings that empowering CEOs through the practice of CEO duality and longer CEO tenure have a positive effect on firm value in China. Additionally, the positive relationships between CEO duality, CEO tenure and firm value are strengthened by the number of executive directors on the board, and weakened by the number of independent directors on the board.

We investigate whether active involvement of private equity firms in their portfolio companies during the holding period of a later-stage private equity investment is related to increased levels in operating performance of these companies. Our analysis of unique survey data on 267 European buyouts and secondary performance data on 29 portfolio companies using partial least squares structural equation modeling indicates that private equity firms, that is, their board representatives, can increase operating performance not only by monitoring the behavior of top managers of portfolio companies, but also by becoming involved in strategic decisions and supporting top managers through the provision of strategic resources. Strategic resources, in particular expertise and networks, provided by private equity firm representatives in the form of financial and strategic involvement are associated with increases in the financial performance and competitive prospects of portfolio companies. Operational involvement, however, is not related to changes in operating performance. In addition to empirical insights into the different types of involvement and their effects, this chapter contributes to the buyout literature by providing support for the suggested broadening of the theoretical discussion beyond the dominant perspective of agency theory through developing and testing a complementary resource-based view of involvement. This allows taking into account not only the monitoring, but also the more entrepreneurial supporting element of involvement by private equity firms.

Compared to other transactions, corporate divestiture is characterized by greater ambiguity and lower transparency, which can be detrimental to stock market reaction. Drawing upon agency theory and information economics literature, this paper examines the relationship between information asymmetries, family ownership and the divestiture financial performance in Western European countries. Based on a sample of 115 Western European divestiture transactions carried out between 1996 and 2010, we find support for the assertion that information asymmetry impacts divestiture financial performance. We also show that the influence of information asymmetries is moderated by family ownership, which acts as a signal of divestiture quality.

This paper investigates the tax and agency explanations of corporate payout policy by investigating the likelihood, the level and the method of payout in founder and family firms. Controlling founders and families are both subject to the tax disadvantage of dividends arising from their substantial shareholdings, but family firms are arguably subject to more severe agency conflicts than founder firms due to their susceptibility to wasteful expenditure and the adverse effects of intra-family conflicts. Results indicate that founder firms on average are less likely and pay a lower level of dividends than family firms. Moreover, founder firms prefer share repurchase over dividends as the main method of payout whereas family firms prefer dividends over share repurchase. Overall, our findings are consistent with the agency explanation of corporate payout policy.

The research on the relationship between executive compensation and firm performance is extensive but has produced inconsistent results and, typically, weak explanatory power. One cause of these results is use of an incomplete theoretical framework that ignores some variables that are related to these two concepts. We explore the missing links between them. The paper contributes to scholarly and practical understanding of this important issue in the literature by extending and combining agency theory, upper echelons theory, and motivation theory perspectives. The paper develops a model that describes and explains the interactive relationship between executive managerial ability, executive compensation, strategic choices and firm performance. It puts forward the argument that executive managerial ability is related to strategic choices, and executive compensation moderates this relationship. Additionally, the paper suggests that strategic choice is an important variable that has not been explicitly accounted for in the relationship between compensation and firm performance.

This paper examines the monitoring effectiveness of independent and non independent directors on a CEO pay-performance of Malaysian financial firms from 2002-2009. It is based on the agency and managerial power theory. The former states that under optimal contract pay should be aligned to performance, while the latter postulates that powerfully entrenched CEO can influence captive directors to award generous compensation package. Our empirical results show (1) a high CEO pay-dividend sensitivity while market measurement plays no part in influencing CEO pay; (2) both the independent and non independent directors have failed in their fiduciary role as internal monitor, suggesting the dominance of managerial power in the board; (3) the appointment of independent directors is merely a move to fulfill the minimum standards of the best practices of corporate governance.

The interest in researching corporate governance in the broader context continues unabated. The research in this area continues to be dominated by test of agency theory in advanced capitalist economies. Few researches are seen in developing countries like Nigeria. Though there have been calls for new theories to be tested in the field of corporate governance, only few have been tested, predominantly stakeholder and resource dependence theories (Barkema and Gomez-Mejia, 1998). This paper departs from previous literature in two ways. First, it tests the identity theory. Second, it uses the case study drawing empirical data from Nigeria, an emerging economy from a developing capital market to provide insights into the corporate governance mechanisms. This study explores appropriate framework and principles governing the duties and obligations of directors, auditors and secretaries. This is crucial because there is increased reliance by the stakeholders on the three actors (directors, auditors and secretaries) as it concern corporate governance both regionally and internationally. Therefore, an exploratory case study was carried out to explore the level of development of corporate governance mechanism in developing economies like Nigeria. Despite the huge challenges, issues and bottlenecks hampering good corporate governance, the study finds growth in the number of directorships, auditors and secretaries of listed companies. Also, the study reveals the code governing the responsibilities of directors; auditors and secretaries have not produced the desired result pertaining to accountability, transparency and good corporate financial reporting. Thus this adds to the body of knowledge by contributing to the corporate governance system in developing countries. (c) 2014, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

This chapter examines the theoretical foundations of Governance Ethics and in doing so, it challenges pertinent aspects of the standard economic theory of the firm, in particular the exclusion of ethical and political aspects from the epistemic interests of economics. Governance ethics has to be understood as a contribution to the development of a new economics of organization. Its aim is to combine foundations and findings of ethics, social theory, organization theory and economics of governance in a productive way in order to improve the practical relevance and the theoretical explanatory force of an economic theory of the firm. What is at issue is the integration of organizational, social, psychological, cultural and above all moral phenomena in an economics of governance which takes an interdisciplinary understanding of economics and a comprehensive concept of governance as its starting point. This endeavor is based on the assumption that a general and at the same time application-oriented theory of economic organization and monitoring cannot be achieved without this ethical, social-theoretical and organization-theoretical extension of standard and mainstream economics.

This chapter is based on the theoretical integration of stakeholder management in a governance approach and attempts to answer questions on the boundaries of a firm, the nature of its relationship to society and the nature of the firm in general. The basic assumption is that the firm can be understood as a social form of governance for bilateral and multilateral, contractually organized stakeholder relationships. In this outline stakeholders are self-interested owners of resources who form a team for the utilization of these resources and the creation of economic added value as long as a cooperation rent can be achieved for all the participants. As the owners of resources, stakeholders constitute and reproduce a team through their transactions and they are not, as a wide-spread assumption in the discussion suggests, to be understood as "claimant groups" external to the firm but as its internal assets, whose efficiency and effectiveness for the team and its members depend on the form and the organization of its governance structure. In this theoretical perspective economic cooperation is always the result of social cooperation and stakeholder dialogues, multi-stakeholder forums, deliberative discourses etc. represent an opportunity for managing the resources of a team, which is needed because of the specific nature of the resources involved in the implementation of a particular transaction. In this sense corporate governance cannot be restricted to a monitoring function. Instead it must be seen as the capacity to lead, manage and monitor the resources of a cooperative project designed to generate factor income and a cooperation rent. This approach implies that stakeholder management is a fundamental strategic task of corporate governance and not simply the business of a firm's communication department. This includes participation in networks of stakeholders which have the task of contributing to the solution of the social and hence also of the economic problems of the firm.

This Chapter aims at analysing the role of the incentive and rewarding mechanism in the loose coupling PMS. Thus, it firstly identifies the purposes of the incentive and rewarding mechanism in the PMS, namely motivation, information, and recruitment and retention. After a brief introduction to the incentive theories, the discussion starts from the investigation of the incentive and rewarding process, which is composed of three main phases; the selection of the performance measures to be used in the assessment phase, the assessment and its frequency, and the model selection. Finally, the last sections provide theoretical and practical insights into the assessment of the incentive and rewarding mechanism and the dysfunctional effects resulting from the use of biased incentive and rewarding mechanisms.

The aim of this paper is to provide empirical evidence regarding the effect of insider ownership on firm value which stems from the lack of such study for the case of Romania. By using a sample of companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, over the period 2007-2011, our results showed a negative effect of insider shareholdings on firm value. Likewise, the negative effect on firm value was confirmed for insider ownership one-year lagged. Thereby, unconcerned to the level of shareholdings, we ascertained the entrenchment effect, opposite to the goal of shareholders wealth maximization. (c) 2014 Econjournals. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have tried to make a comparative analysis between the market-oriented system and the mixed governance system on the determinants of stock option awards for managers; however, these studies exhibit some failures that must be overcome. In addition, we note the absence of studies addressing the validity of the agency theory on the determinants of equity-based compensation in times of instability or crisis. We used a sample of 159 French companies and 203 US companies for the period spanning 2002 to 2010. The results of the present study support the conclusion that the variables measuring the size of the firm, growth opportunity, debt, management and control functions, size of the board, and ownership concentration explain the decision to grant equity-based compensation, regardless of the sample and period considered. Using a variable representing the presence of institutional investors, we show that this type of investor is only involved in controlling the leader in the French case, during a period of financial instability.

We study the events that motivate CEOs to underinvest in R&D longterm projects (CEO myopia). Based on the existing literature in earnings management and agency theory, myopia is likely to become more problematic under five circumstances: when the CEO nears retirement (the CEO horizon problem), R&D projects have very long time horizons (the project horizon problem), the firm's financial health is deteriorating (the cover-up problem), ownership structure is heavily weighted toward insider owners (minority owner oppression problem), and when the threat of hostile takeover increases (the entrenchment problem). We setup a dynamic simulation model in which rational CEOs maximize the total value of their bonus compensation over their tenure. Our findings related to the five circumstances are consistent with the extant literature. However, we found an unexpected stable, nonlinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship between CEO tenure and R&D investment. We discuss the theoretical implications of our model and offer suggestions for future research. Copyright (c) 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We study the relation between initial IPO underpricing and two-tier board structure in the Vienna Stock Exchange of Austria, where a two-tier board is mandatory for listed companies. The board ratio, defined as the size of the supervisory board to the management board, is used to capture the effect of two-tiered board on underpricing. The results show that the board ratio is negatively related with underpricing, consistent with the agency theory which predicts that more effective monitoring implied in a relatively larger supervisory board will lead to lower agency costs, and thus lower underpricing. The results are robust to the inclusion of control variables and suggest that firms seeking to raise external capital will be helped by adopting strong corporate governance standards.

The results indicate that diversification influence accounting returns negatively while separate risk management committee (RMC) influence market valuation of finance companies positively both in the period after the Asian financial crisis which also is the period after the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) was issued. Finally, the results indicate significant difference between the period before and after the Asian financial crisis and MCCG in terms of diversification and corporate governance in the finance companies. The results support agency theory which suggests that diversification may create further agency problem between the management and the shareholders. (c) 2014 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The causal relationship between block premium and the likelihood of shareholder litigation has two possibilities. First, Barclay and Holderness (1989) argue that one of the costs of block ownership is the expected likelihood of litigation. According to this argument, greater ex ante litigation risk will reduce the size of block premium. Second, agency theory suggests that excessive private benefits, the size of which is measured by the block premium, can lead to litigation by disgruntled shareholders. According to this agency-theory hypothesis, greater block premium will indicate a greater likelihood of litigation. Using a sample of 593 block trades in the United States, we find evidence that greater litigation risk at the time of the block trade lowers the block premium, thus supporting the notion that the expected litigation risk is one of the costs of block ownership.

In the last decade regulatory pressure includes appeals that corporate elites should reduce their multiple directorships to a minimum. The functionality of this governance mechanism is suggested by agency theory. The embeddedness view counter-argues that social relationships matter for the effectiveness of corporate governance. In particular for ill-structured tasks like stock price valuation social networks solve fundamental coordination problems in markets by reducing the risks of market exchange, by establishing a common base of recognition and by getting actions and blocking actions. For the Swiss banking sector this article shows that the social embeddedness of corporate elites reduces the volatility of stock prices. With respect to regulatory pressure against multiple directorships it recommends a more balanced view. While for investors and stakeholders certain amounts of stock price volatility are surly desirable, exorbitant fluctuations of stock prices - like in financial crises - are definitely not. Social embeddedness should therefore be considered by economic and financial theory: it does prevent the misspecification of regulatory proposals and incentive regimes.

Scholars are divided over whether listing the shares of stock exchanges improves their financial performance. Applying simple OLS regressions, I test the hypothesis that exchanges' post-IPO owners are value maximizers. However, recently demutualized exchanges have a high proportion of shareholders with conflicts of interest. Therefore, I also test whether different types of shareholders have different effects on performance. I find that investment managers behave like true value maximizers. The results also show that a higher fragmentation of share ownership is associated with lower performance. The proportion of brokers, who are the most conflicted shareholders in exchanges (since they are large customers as well as owners), is too small to have a measurable effect on performance. Most interestingly I find, by way of an inductive approach to shareholding structure, that strategic shareholders, a wide array of investors with various agendas, are on balance detrimental to shareholder value. This chapter is the first in a trilogy of articles that make up my Ph.D. dissertation. It is followed by an in-depth study of the shareholding structure of individual stock exchanges, notably in order to understand more clearly who these strategic investors are and what effects they have on exchanges.

When seeking to internationalize, the managers of many small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often turn to government incentive programs to help them achieve their goals. The experience of one French firm shows that, in doing so, however, there is a risk of becoming dependent on the financing party for not only funding but also for management. When applied to both internal and external business relationships, Agency Theory-which focuses on the behavior and contracts between principals and agents-provides a tool for understanding the process by which a business owner can become financially dependent on and surrender decision-making rights to an outside agency, particularly in a declining market environment.

This article aims at studying the influence of debt on small business investment in a European context, i.e. France. The empirical findings, robust to the endogeneity analysis, lead to several interesting results. In particular, credit institutions privilege corporate manager monitoring before the recent crisis, especially for low growth firms. They limit the scope of this monitoring in favor of a higher restriction of debt access during the crisis period. To cope with this constraint, small businesses tend to intensify the use of internal financial resources. These results, although coherent with the disciplinary role of debt stipulated by agency theories of corporate leverage, moderate the magnitude of this role according to the global crisis effect.

This work concerns the study of the influence of governance mechanisms on the performance of listed companies in different contexts, with evidence for nonlinear relationships. The sample consisting of 146 companies is grouped in 46 Portuguese and 100 British companies. The multiple linear regression and nonlinear regression were used. It was concluded that the influence of governance mechanisms on the performance of companies in different contexts is diverse and that there are nonlinear relationships whose effect represents an important contribution to understand the governance model.

Evaluating agency theory and optimal contracting theory views of corporate philanthropy, we find that as corporate giving increases, shareholders reduce their valuation of firm cash holdings. Dividend increases following the 2003 Tax Reform Act are associated with reduced corporate giving. Using a natural experiment, we find that corporate giving is positively (negatively) associated with CEO charity preferences (CEO shareholdings and corporate governance quality). Evidence from CEO-affiliated charity donations, market reactions to insider-affiliated donations, its relation to CEO compensation, and firm contributions to director-affiliated charities indicates that corporate donations advance CEO interests and suggests misuses of corporate resources that reduce firm value.

Although studies about the determinants of CEO compensation are ubiquitous, the balance of evidence for one of the more controversial theoretical approaches, managerial power theory, remains inconclusive. The authors provide a meta-analysis of 219 U.S.-based studies, focusing on the relationships between indicators of managerial power and levels of CEO compensation and CEO pay-performance sensitivities. The results indicate that managerial power theory is well equipped for predicting core compensation variables such as total cash and total compensation but less so for predicting the sensitivity of pay to performance. In most situations where CEOs are expected to have power over the pay setting process, they receive significantly higher levels of total cash and total compensation. In contrast, where boards are expected to have more power, CEOs receive lower total cash and total compensation. In addition, powerful directors also appear to be able to establish tighter links between CEO compensation and firm performance and can accomplish this even in the face of powerful CEOs. The authors discuss the implications for theory and research regarding the determinants of executive compensation. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

We provide evidence on the covenant structure of corporate loan agreements. Building on the work of Jensen and Meckling [1976, Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs, and Captial Structure, Journal of the Financial Economics 3, 305-360], Myers [1977, Determinants of Corporate Borrowing, Journal of Financial Economics 5, 145-147] and Smith and Warner [1979, On Financial Contracting: An Analysis of Bond Covenants, Journal of Financial Economics 7(2), 117-161]. We summarize and test the implications for what we refer to as the Agency Theory of Covenants (ATC), using a large sample of privately placed corporate debt. Our results are consistent with many of the implications of the ATC, including a negative relation between the promised yield on corporate debt and the presence of covenants. We also find that borrower and lender characteristics, as well as macroeconomic factors, determine covenant structure. Loans are more likely to include protective covenants when the borrower is small, has high growth opportunities or is highly levered. Loans made by investment banks and syndicated loans are also more likely to include protective covenants, as are loans made during recessionary periods or when credit spreads are large. Finally, we show that consistent with the ATC, firms that elect to issue private rather than public debt are smaller, have greater growth opportunities, less long-term debt, fewer tangible assets, more volatile cash flows and include more covenants in their debt agreements. An important byproduct of our analysis is to demonstrate empirically that covenant structure and the yield on corporate debt are determined simultaneously.

This research investigates the relationship between board gender diversity and firm financial performance in the context of a transitional economy characterised by an underdeveloped corporate governance system. Using a sample of 120 publicly listed companies in Vietnam covering a 4-year period from 2008 to 2011, we examine this relationship in a dynamic modelling framework, which controls for potential sources of endogeneity. We find that board gender diversity appears to have an effect on firm performance. This finding remains robust when alternative proxies for gender diversity are employed and is consistent with the perspectives of agency theory and resource dependence theory. The number of female directors in the boardroom also matters, supporting the view that if female board representation affects firm outcomes, this effect is more pronounced when the number of female directors increases. It is observed, furthermore, that the marginal positive performance effect of board gender diversity ceases when the percentage of female directors reaches a breakpoint of about 20%. This finding suggests that there is perhaps a potential trade-off between the costs and benefits of board gender diversification. Our findings significantly contribute to the growing literature of non-US based studies, by providing robust empirical evidence from a transitional economy in East Asia. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This article describes new micro-foundations for theorizing about executive compensation, drawing on the behavioral economics literature and based on a more realistic set of behavioral assumptions than those that have typically been made by agency theorists. We call these micro-foundations "behavioral agency theory." In contrast to the standard agency framework, which focuses on monitoring costs and incentive alignment, behavioral agency theory places agent performance at the center of the agency model, arguing that the interests of shareholders and their agents are most likely to be aligned if executives are motivated to perform to the best of their abilities. We develop a line of argument first advanced by Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia and put the case for a more general reassessment of the behavioral assumptions underpinning agency theory. A model of economic man predicated on bounded rationality is proposed, adopting Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia's assumptions about risk preferences, but incorporating new assumptions about time discounting, inequity aversion, and the trade-off between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. We argue that behavioral agency theory provides a better framework for theorizing about executive compensation, an enhanced theory of agent behavior, and an improved platform for making recommendations about the design of executive compensation plans.

In this paper, the relationship between ownership concentration and financial performance of companies in Singapore and Vietnam is investigated in a dynamic framework. By focusing on two different types of national governance systems (well-developed vs. under-developed), we observe how the relationship is moderated by the national governance quality. We find that the performance effect of concentrated ownership persists in these markets even after the dynamic nature of the ownership concentration-performance relationship is taken into consideration. Our finding supports the prediction of agency theory about the efficient monitoring effect of large shareholders in markets with highly concentrated ownership. In addition, we find that national governance quality does matter when explaining the ownership concentration-performance relationship. The positive effect of concentrated ownership on performance of firms operating in the under-developed national governance system (Vietnam) tends to be stronger than that in the well-established system (Singapore). This finding is consistent with the argument that ownership concentration is an efficient corporate governance mechanism which can substitute for weak national governance quality. Econometrically, our findings still hold even after controlling for dynamic endogeneity, simultaneity, and unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity, inherent in the corporate governance-performance relationship.

By complementing agency theory with behavioral assumptions, we explore the effects of family involvement on small and medium enterprises' (SMEs) performance. We identify three separate dimensions of family involvement and hypothesize nonlinear, direct, and interaction effects on the performance of an SME. The evidence on 787 SMEs suggests that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between family ownership and performance, and ownership dispersion among family members negatively affects performance. Balancing family and nonfamily members in the top management team (TMT) is found to be beneficial to SMEs' performance, but the family ratio in the TMT becomes crucial only at high levels of family ownership.

This paper investigates the effect of the 2009 guidance of the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs on greenhouse gas (GHG) disclosure. The sample comprises 215 companies from a population of London Stock Exchange FTSE 350 companies over four years (2008-2011). To quantify GHG disclosure, a research index methodology is employed, with information derived from several GHG reporting frameworks. The econometric model is estimated using panel fixed effects. Our findings suggest that the publication of the 2009 guidance has had a significant effect on the level of GHG disclosure, and that corporate governance mechanisms (board size, director ownership, and ownership concentration) also affect the extent of GHG information disclosure. The results also indicate that companies increased their disclosures prior to the 2009 guidance in anticipation of its publication. These results have important implications for the government, suggesting that non-mandatory guidance could increase disclosure as much as do mandatory requirements. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine whether the extent and type of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures made by Indian public listed companies are associated with firm ownership and board characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - Data analysis is based on the top 100 companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (2007-2011) using a 17-item CSR disclosure measure. Findings - The extent of CSR disclosure is positively associated with foreign ownership, government ownership and board independence and negatively associated with CEO duality. Promoter ownership has a negligible effect on the extent of CSR disclosure. In terms of the type of CSR disclosure, community information increases with government ownership and board independence, while environmental information expands with foreign ownership and board independence. Information on employees/ human resources has a positive association with foreign ownership but decreases with CEO duality. The amount of product and services information increases with promoter ownership, foreign ownership and board independence and CEO duality. Practical implications - Given the positive impact independent directors have on the extent of CSR disclosure, their role can be further strengthened in terms of overseeing quality of information disclosed. Stakeholders and regulators will need to develop greater awareness of firm CSR disclosure biases associated with ownership and more carefully scrutinize firm CSR activities that firms are "not" reporting on. Originality/value - Empirical evidence on the link between corporate governance and CSR disclosure from a developing nation context is limited. This paper provides much needed evidence in this area from India - one of the largest, rapidly developing economies in the world. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

New Public Management (NPM) has been guiding public sector reform for over 25 years. Its position on the design of effective management control rests on three key ideas: (1) performance improvement requires a results-oriented culture that emphasizes outcomes rather than inputs or processes; (2) public sector organizations need to introduce performance management based on targets, monitoring and incentives; and (3) public sector organizations should decentralize decision rights and reduce their reliance on rules and procedures. Focusing on the particularly influential version of NPM as advocated by the OECD, we examine the validity of these ideas theoretically and empirically. We conclude that NPM's reform programme should be reconsidered. Although the evidence indicates that a results-oriented culture is positively associated with performance, we find little support for the assumed benefits of NPM-type performance contracting. In addition, the results suggest that both the effects of decentralization and the reliance on rules and procedures are opposite to NPM's expectations. (c) The Author(s) 2015.

Organizational performance can be enhanced by effective project benefit generation. Although it identifies the project owner as the single point of accountability for the realization of project benefits, the literature does not comprehensively discuss this role in the project governance model, nor the management approaches that can support this role. Based on principal-agent theory and a control-trust-risk approach, we have conducted an empirical study across various managerial contexts. Results suggest that trust of the project owner in the project manager is more effective in a turbulent environment, whereas more control by the project owner of the project management process is a superior management approach in a more stable project setting. Finally, a project governance model is introduced and the management role of the project owner is discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Family firms and business groups play an important role in many emerging economies. In this paper we study how different aspects of family involvement influence technological innovation in a firm. Arguments drawn from agency theory and particularly the principal-principal agency hypothesize a negative influence of family involvement with respect to technological innovation. In contrast, stewardship theory predicts a positive influence of family involvement on technological innovation. Drawing on these theoretical lenses with contrasting directionalities with regard to the impact of family involvement on technological innovation, we study how family involvement in ownership, management and board of directors, and business group affiliation influence R&D investments and patents obtained by the firm. The hypotheses are empirically tested on a seven-year panel of 172 firms from the pharmaceutical industry in India. Our results indicate that family shareholding and family control over both CEO and chairperson positions have a positive and significant influence on the firm's R&D investments, broadly lending support to stewardship theory. We also find a positive influence of business group affiliation on R&D investments and patents applied by the firm. Our conjecture is that the high technology opportunity environment in the Indian pharmaceutical industry facilitates stewardship behavior which in turn promotes innovation in these firms.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

Family firms often evolve into ownership constellations with multiple family owners. Building on agency theory, we argue that the growing complexity within a group of family blockholders gives rise to what we label family blockholder conflicts, defined as conflicts within a group of family owners. To curb family blockholder conflicts, families often separate the family from its assets and install intermediary governance structures. We explore four frequently applied structures (uncoordinated family, embedded family office, single family office, and family trust), which vary in their degree of separation between family owners and assets and consequently the extent to which the firm might incur family blockholder costs and the double-agency costs associated with appointing agents to oversee agents.

This paper revisits the influence of companies' financial factors on the extent of corporate environmental sustainability reporting (CESR) in an impressive sample of 3931 companies operating in 51 industries and 59 countries. A CESR composite index is constructed for each company that focuses on the G3 core environmental indicators from the Global Reporting Initiative because they are material for most organizations. In a methodological innovation, this study employs a quantile regression that unfolds certain interesting effects of financial drivers on the intensity of CESR that have not previously been revealed. Considering a combination of the main underlying theories of corporate sustainability reporting - legitimacy theory, agency theory, political costs theory, and signal theory - offers a better understanding of the complex structure of the dependencies found among factors such as company size, leverage, return on assets, research and development spending, market return and market capitalization, and commitment to environmental reporting.

We review what the financial economics literature has to say about the unique ways in which the following three classic agency problems manifest themselves in family firms: (a) shareholders versus managers, (b) controlling (family) shareholders versus noncontrolling shareholders, and (c) shareholders versus creditors. We also call attention to a fourth agency problem that is unique to family firms: the conflict of interest between family shareholders and the family at large, which can be thought of as the "superprincipal" in a multi-tier agency structure akin to those found in other concentrated ownership structures in which the controlling owner is the state, a bank, a corporation, or other institutions. We then discuss the solutions or corporate governance mechanisms that have been devised to address these problems and what research has taught us about these mechanisms' effectiveness at solving these four conflicts in family firms.

Internationally, disclosures related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy usage have increased dramatically due to trends toward increased sustainability reporting, growing concerns about climate change, and the introduction of new legislation and taxes. Audit committees, management, internal auditors, external auditors, and other stakeholders all have a potential role in relation to GHG disclosures. Our study addresses the role of internal auditors. We conducted 29 interviews with senior audit committee members, senior accountants, in-house internal auditors, and partners specializing in internal audit from the major accounting firms. These interviews allowed us to gain insights into the present role of internal auditors in GHG/energy reporting, the factors explaining internal audit's role, and the future role of internal audit. In addition, audit committee members describe their present involvement in GHG/energy reporting. We consider the consistency of our findings with three corporate governance theories (agency theory, institutional theory, and resource dependence theory). Although our results support the importance of effective monitoring consistent with agency theory, no one theory fully explains our results. (c) 2015, American Accounting Association.

Prior work based on agency theory and behavioral agency model has focused on how absolute pay values affect firm outcomes. Departing from this traditional approach, we draw from behavioral decision theory to explain how relative pay levels influence firm risk taking. We investigate how CEO restricted stock value relative to reference point influences R&D intensity in high-technology firms. We propose that negative deviation increases are related to R&D increases and positive deviation increases lead to R&D decreases, while negative deviation has greater effect than positive deviation. We establish theoretical boundary conditions by considering CEO duality and board vigilance as moderators. Drawing from agency theory, we predict the main effects will be enhanced under duality and weakened under high board vigilance. Our hypotheses are largely supported.

This study examines the influence of board independence on firm agency cost among listed firms in Bangladesh, which feature concentrated ownership and high insider representation on corporate boards. This study uses three measures of agency cost: the 'expense ratio', the 'Q-free cash flow interaction' and the 'asset utilization ratio'. The finding of the study is that board independence can reduce the firm agency cost only under 'asset utilization ratio' measure of agency cost. These findings are robust to several robustness tests. Furthermore, the non-linearity tests suggest that the benefit of outside independent directors is generally plausible as a factor controlling agency costs in the case of a medium level of board independence. Overall, these findings do not reject the validity of agency theory, supporting the Anglo-American orthodoxy promoting outside independent directors as good monitors.

We examine the role of voluntary adoption of corporate governance mechanisms in mitigating the financial distress status of firms. Using a sample of 171 financially distressed and 106 healthy listed Australian firms over the 5-year period prior to the introduction of the ASX Corporate Governance Council Code in 2003, we find support for the argument that the adoption of certain corporate governance mechanisms is beneficial for firms, as reflected in a reduced likelihood of financial distress. In particular, greater levels of blockholder and director ownership and the existence of a separate audit committee are associated with lower financial distress likelihood. We also find causal evidence that the voluntary adoption of particular corporate governance structures leads to lower levels of financial distress, rather than financial distress recognition leading to corporate governance structural reform.

Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of audit committee (AC) attributes on the performance of finance companies in Malaysia in both period before and after the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) was issued in order to determine which of the AC attributes enhances performance of finance companies in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach-The population of the study comprises firms listed under finance sector of the main market of Bursa Malaysia. The number of firms listed on the main market of Bursa Malaysia as at the time of data collection (2012) was 822, out of which 37 were finance firms. Since the number of finance companies listed on the main market was only 37, all companies were used as sample for this study. This comprises companies involved in commercial, investment and Islamic banking, insurance, Takaful and other finance-related services. The sample for the period prior to MCCG varies over the period of observation. The number of finance companies in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 was 36, 40, 44, 47 and 54, respectively. The sample comprises companies in commercial banking, investment banking, Islamic banking, insurance, Takaful and other finance-related services. The sample comprises firms listed on the main board of Kuala Lumpur stock exchange as it was called before the name was changed to Bursa Malaysia. The companies listed under the Ace market are not included due to their small number and because they are subject to different listing requirements. The list of the finance companies for the period 2007-2011 is obtained from the web site of Bursa Malaysia while for the period 1992-1996, the list is obtained from Bursa Malaysia knowledge centre. The observation period for the study covers financial period from 2007 to 2011 which represents post MCCG period while period from 1992 to 1996 represents the period before MCCG. Findings-The findings suggests a significant positive relationship between independent AC members and profitability while dual membership of directors on audit and nomination committee is significant and negatively related with profitability. The result supports agency theory which suggests that independent directors provide effective monitoring of the management thereby enhancing profitability and reducing possibility for opportunistic behavior by the management and ultimately enhancing performance. In addition, the result indicates that there was significant improvement in corporate governance in finance companies after the MCCG was issued compared to the period before it was issued. Research limitations/implications-The study focussed only on finance companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. The attributes examined include independence, expertise, experience, executive membership and interlock of directors, future studies could examine other attributes such as internal process of the committee and personal characteristics of the directors. Furthermore, the study used secondary data future studies could use primary data or a combination of primary and secondary data. The study only examined the period before MCCG and after the code was issued, future study could examine the impact of the first and second revision and compare it with period after the first and second revision. Practical implications-The findings contribute to the literature and the understanding of the influence of AC attributes such as independence and experience of the directors on the committee by showing an association between director independence, expertise, experience and improved performance. Management and board of companies may use the findings to make appropriate choices about AC attributes and governance mechanisms to improve performance particularly with regards to independence, expertise, experience and interlock of the directors. Social implications-The study has provided policy makers with a better understanding of the various features a AC should have which could be incorporated in future policy formulation in order to safeguard investments of shareholders, protect the interest of various stakeholders and enhance the flow of capital and foreign direct investment into finance companies and the economy in general. Comparison of the result between the pre MCCG and post MCCG period shows an improvement in corporate governance in finance companies after the MCCG was issued. This implies that the initial issue of MCCG impacted positively on the governance of the finance companies. Originality/value-To best of the authors knowledge the study is the first to examine the attributes of AC in finance sector as a whole and to examine the impact in the period before and after the MCCG was issued.

Relying on an alternative theoretical framework (i.e. institutional theory), rather than the dominant agency theory, this paper examines the connections between corporate governance mechanisms and good practices, as informed by an empirical and contextual analysis. On the basis of research methods triangulation, this study presents nine specific antecedents of good corporate governance in weak institutional settings (Nigeria). The study proposes how each of these antecedents must be understood, articulated and harnessed, on the basis of relevant institutional peculiarities, in order to address contextual governance challenges. This study adds to the institutional theorising of good corporate governance, by paying attention to the context (African), efficiency (instrumentality) and legitimacy (symbolic) in explaining the firm-level drivers of good governance practices in an international business environment.

Collaborating with a supplier in a buying firm's new product development (NPD) project is commonly advocated and adopted, but does not always improve project performance. Some pre-existing collaboration contexts, such as buyer-supplier NPD projects, are especially exposed to supplier opportunism due to the uncertain nature of the collaboration process. Adopting agency theory and transaction cost theory perspectives, we examine: (i) contextual antecedents and project consequences of supplier opportunism and (ii) if these causal influences vary in different cultural and institutional contexts. Using a survey sample of 214 United States (U.S.) and 212 Chinese buying firms' responses about buyer-supplier NPD projects, we find that supplier opportunism is significantly influenced by the task and relational contexts. We also show that supplier opportunism damages both design quality and efficiency, two aspects of project performance. When comparing U.S. to China, we find that task and relational contexts have a greater impact on supplier opportunism in the U.S., but design efficiency is less hurt by supplier opportunism there. Finally, we show challenges of preventing supplier opportunism in certain NPD collaboration contexts, and offer solutions for overcoming these challenges. (c) 2015 Decision Sciences Institute.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore key challenges of adopting, designing and managing performance-based contracts (PBC) for advanced logistics services, as seen by providers. The shift toward performance-based solutions has proved challenging since providers often struggle to link performance to their payment. Despite such managerial challenges, empirical research in this area has been limited. Design/methodology/approach - A multi-case design was adopted. Three cases of logistics service providers were selected based on purposive sampling. Data were collected through 38 semi-structured interviews and review of 43 documents such as contracts and customer target letters. Findings - Key PBC adoption challenges include customer and provider intention to align their goals and incentives as well as their views on risk and reward sharing. Contract design challenges center around performance metric definition and weighting, designing performance monitoring systems that consider service co-production effects and help improve customer relationship and designing incentives with appropriate intensity levels. Contract management challenges include fostering provider pro-activity, provider changes in terms of processes and resource investments, perceived fairness of designed incentives and contract re-design to allow for win-win relationship outcomes. Research limitations/implications - The study empirically contributes to extant logistics service provider literature by identifying specific challenges that extend also beyond PBC adoption and design and cover contract management (and potential contract re-design). It also unpacks the notion of performance attributability by analyzing its role also in terms of contract and performance management as well as its potential effects on customer relationship management. Practical implications - The study presents implications for logistics provider managers regarding how the observed PBC challenges can be overcome. Originality/value - The study unearths several challenges of PBC for advanced logistics services, particularly in connection to contract management and re-design.

We examine the effect of family control on IFRS mandatory disclosure levels, and the valuation implications of these disclosure levels, for Malaysian companies. We find that family control is related negatively to disclosure and that compliance levels are not value relevant. These findings suggest that agency theory predictions and theories linking common law legal systems to high quality financial reporting require refining in certain national contexts. Where Type 2 agency problems dominate, institutional arrangements intended to enhance financial reporting quality aimed at mitigating Type 1 problems in developed markets may have limited effect in less developed jurisdictions.

This study examines the association between Chinese stock issuers' board characteristics and dividends. We focus on the gender of CEO and accompanying board members, as well as other salient board demographics and characteristics. Using more than 9,000 firm-year observations, we observe little difference in the dividend distributions of female- and male-led Chinese firms. Other salient demographics, notably CEO age and tenure bear a strong positive association with cash distributions. Cash pay-out is also increasing in directors' equity stakes and state ownership. In a general sense, the proportion of independent directors on boards bears only limited association with cash pay-out. However, in state-invested entities, greater independent director presence acts as a brake against cash distributions. We challenge a lingering perception in the investment literature that women are significantly more risk-averse than men. Cross-cultural theory suggests that risk aversion is manifest in greater cash retention and thus lower pay-outs (Bae, Chang, & Kang, The Journal of Financial Research, 35(2): 289-316, 2012; Khambata & Liu, Journal of Asia-Pacific Business, 6(4): 31-43, 2005). Building on this literature, and extending it specifically to gender, our results are consistent with male and female CEOs displaying comparable levels of risk aversion. They are also congruent with "financial knowledge" lessening gender-based differences in risk aversion (Hibbert, Lawrence, & Prakash, Global Finance Journal, 24: 140-152, 2013) and/or its general absence in the specific field of financial decisions (Schubert, Brown, Gysler, & Brachinger, The American Economic Review, 89(2): 381-385, 1999). We also emphasize theory on managerial power (Allen, Social Forces, 60(2): 482-494, 1981) and entrenchment. Results for CEO tenure and age support notions of CEO entrenchment, while those for duality do not. In contrast to agency theory, but consistent with tunneling arguments, the present study stresses the overarching role of state-ownership in increasing (decreasing) cash (stock) payouts. We observe non-monotonic effects in this relation, thus extending related findings elsewhere (Huang, Chen, & Kao, Asia Pacific Journal of Management, 29: 39-58, 2012).

Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries--often labeled "lack of transparency"--between top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high.

There remains a good deal of uncertainty as to whether and under which governance conditions family firms, even large, publicly traded ones, are entrepreneurial. We shall argue that agency theory, behavioral agency perspectives, and the resource-based view all posit both positive and negative influences regarding entrepreneurship in family firms, while empirical studies, collectively, are no less ambiguous in their findings. We use each of the above theories to propose various governance distinctions that can reconcile these contradictions and suggest when family firms will be most and least entrepreneurial.

Purpose - Communication of risk management (RM) practices are a critical component of good corporate governance. Research, to date, has been of little benefit in informing regulators internationally. This paper seeks to contribute to the literature by investigating how listed Australian companies disclose RM information in annual report governance statements in accordance with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) corporate governance framework. Design/methodology/approach - To address this study's research questions and related hypotheses, the authors examine the top 300 ASX-listed companies by market capitalisation at 30 June 2010. For these firms, the authors identify, code and categorise RM disclosures made in the annual according to the disclosure categories specified in ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (CGPR). The derived data are then examined using a comprehensive approach comprising thematic content analysis and regression analysis. Findings - The results indicate widespread divergence in disclosure practices and low conformance with the Principle 7 of the ASX CGPR. This result suggests that companies are not disclosing all "material business risks" possibly due to ignorance at the board level, or due to the intentional withholding of sensitive information from financial statement users. The findings also show mixed results across the factors expected to influence disclosure behaviour. While the presence of a risk committee (RC) (in particular, a standalone RC) and technology committee (TC) are found to be associated with some improvement in disclosure levels, the authors do not find evidence that company risk measures (as proxied by equity beta and the market-to-book ratio) are significantly associated with greater levels of RM disclosure. Also, contrary to common findings in the disclosure literature, factors such as board independence and expertise, audit committee independence and the usage of a Big-4 auditor do not seem to impact the level of RM disclosure in the Australian context. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited by the sample and study period selection as the RM disclosures of only the largest (top 300) ASX firms are examined for the fiscal year 2010. Thus, the findings may not be generalisable to smaller firms or earlier/later years. Also, the findings may have limited applicability in other jurisdictions with different regulatory environments. Practical implications - The study's findings suggest that insufficient attention has been applied to RM disclosures by listed companies in Australia. These results suggest RM disclosures practices observed in the Australian setting may not be meeting the objectives of regulators and the needs of stakeholders. Originality/value - The Australian setting provides an ideal environment to examine RM communication as the ASX has explicitly recommended RM disclosures areas in its principle-based governance rules since 2007 (Principle 7). This differs from other jurisdictions where such disclosure recommendations are typically not provided and provides us with a benchmark to examine the nature and quality of RM disclosures. Despite the recommendation, the authors reveal that low levels and poor RM communication are prevalent in the Australian setting and warrant further investigation.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of corporate governance on intellectual capital (IC) in top service firms in Australia. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the agency theory, the paper develops hypotheses about relationships between corporate governance mechanisms (chief executive officer [CEO] duality, board size, board composition and subcommittee composition) and IC. The study uses a multiple regression analysis on data collected from corporate annual reports of 300 firm-year observations. Findings - The findings of the regression analysis indicate that CEO duality, board composition and remuneration committee composition are significantly associated with IC. In contrast, there is no evidence that board size and audit committee composition have an effect on IC. The study contributes to agency theory in general and the literature on IC and corporate governance more specifically. Practical implications - The findings of the study might be of interest to regulators, investment analysts, shareholders, company directors and managers in Australia, as well as academics, in designing corporate governance mechanisms to develop IC. Originality/value - Corporate governance is country-specific and, hence, its impact on managerial decisions leading to IC is different from country to country. This study provides empirical evidence on the relationship between corporate governance and IC in top service firms in Australia. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This article utilizes agency theory to explain maverick buying in governmental agencies, that is, noncompliance to centrally negotiated frame agreements. Traditional agency theory assumes the agent to be an opportunistic self-interest seeker. A complementary view of agency problems portrays man as an honest, yet not fully competent, actor; both agents and principals may be burdened by "honest incompetence." We apply both perspectives on principal-agent relationships to study maverick buying in government procurement and link agency problems to three governance mechanisms: monitoring, training, and guidance. We find that guidance and training help to reduce governmental employees' noncompliance, but output monitoring does not. Our findings further indicate that maverick buying is related to goal incongruence and two different types of information asymmetry: Agency problems may arise not only because the agent has information the principal is not aware of but also because the principal may have information the agent is not aware of. Future research in public management using agency theory to study instances of hidden action could benefit from applying a similar dual lens to behaviors previously examined as purely opportunistic.

Purpose - How family businesses (FBs) manage to survive in the long term is still not well understood in FB research. A promising concept to explain survivability, that is currently heavily discussed in the management literature is organizational ambidexterity (OA) - the ability to balance exploring and exploiting activities at the same time. However, FB research has not yet taken sufficient advantage of the potential of OA to contribute to explaining the ability of later-generation FBs to survive. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - Using central tenets of agency theory, this conceptual paper draws together findings from the FB literature and the OA literature to create a framework for the relationship between family involvement and the ability to reach high levels of OA. Findings - Seven propositions are developed which suggest that the level of family involvement in ownership and management affect the ability of later-generation FBs to reach high levels of OA. They further suggest that the number of family shareholders, the existence of majority family shareholders, and generational involvement of the controlling family in management moderate these relationships. Originality/value - This is the first paper to theoretically analyze OA in later-generation FBs. The seven propositions and avenues for further research presented in this paper are intended to motivate FB research to take a closer look at OA. This may be crucial to better explaining and predicting one of business-owning families' most important goals: the long-term survival of the FB. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747.

This article analyses founding family influence on pay-out policies for Swiss listed firms over the period 2003-2010. We hypothesise that family firms have different incentives and characteristics that affect pay-out decisions and propose three possible explanations: agency theory, reputation building and family income needs. Our results show that founding family firms display significantly higher dividend pay-outs relative to companies with other ownership structures. We also examine specific family characteristics and document that a family's stake, active involvement and generation play an important role in determining pay-out policies. Our findings appear to be consistent with the family income hypothesis and to some extent with reputational concerns. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the association between four pivotal audit committee characteristics and accounting conservatism. Using a sample of 7,668 Australian firm-year observations from 2004 to 2012, a positive association is found between accounting conservatism and: (a) a director with financial expertise on the audit committee; (b) an experienced director on the audit committee; and (c) frequency of audit committee meetings. Within an agency theoretical framework, results suggest that audit committees act as effective monitoring mechanisms in restricting management's opportunistic behaviour and overstatement of earnings. Results also suggest that regulators (and other stakeholders) should pay greater attention to the financial expertise, experience of members and meeting frequency of the audit committee when judging the committee's value.

Over the past decade, expectations for more effective oversight of risks by boards of directors have significantly increased. These expectations emanate from stock exchanges, regulators, credit rating agencies and other key stakeholders. Proponents of enhanced risk oversight argue that an increased understanding of enterprise-wide risks provides strategic benefit by helping the board and management identify and manage risks that may impact the achievement of strategic objectives while at the same time helping the board monitor the extent of risk-taking on the part of management in their desire to meet these objectives. In response to these growing expectations, some boards have asked management to explore implementation of a more holistic, top-down approach to risk oversight widely known as enterprise risk management (ERM) while others have not. Institutional theory would suggest that a number of organizations implement minimal elements of ERM for symbolic reasons, lacking substance in risk oversight. In contrast, agency theory would suggest that boards embrace explicit and robust risk oversight activities to monitor management's risk-taking actions, and resource dependence theory would suggest that they also do so to help the organization achieve strategic objectives. Little is known about the way in which boards and management organize their processes and the impact of those processes on the level of ERM adoption. More importantly, little is known about the extent to which ERM is perceived to provide strategic benefit to those organizations that have invested in developing a robust ERM process. Based on data gathered from 645 survey responses from executives of organizations spanning a number of industries and sizes, we find that organizations with greater ERM maturity are significantly more likely to have taken steps to formally engage the board and senior management in specific risk oversight tasks (consistent with agency theory), and certain board and management risk practices are associated with perceptions that ERM provides strategic advantage (consistent with resource dependence theory).

Family business succession is a complex and challenging process, in which family members often build on the support of trusted advisors who can be seen as the most relied external source of advice and knowledge that family businesses draw on. Based on an extensive literature review, this article aims to synthesize prior research on both advisors and succession to systematically describe and analyze the role of trusted advisors during the succession-planning process. Based on arguments from agency theory, we discuss potential benefits and drawbacks associated with the involvement of trusted advisors along the four phases-trigger, preparation, selection, and training-of the succession-planning process and outline how trusted advisors can mitigate but also enhance agency costs-in particular goal divergence and information asymmetry-during each of these four phases. Subsequently, we discuss four typical constellations of advisor involvement, which vary in their agency costs and thus have different levels of bias and efficiency. We thereby outline several inefficiencies that result from the common setup in which an incumbent and a successor both rely on their own trusted advisors or a team of expert advisors and propose a balanced and efficient model of advisor involvement as a potential solution which reduces the agency costs. This conceptual article contributes to research on succession, agency theory, and trusted advisors in family firms. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In many business schools, the field of strategic management has been elevated to the same status as more traditional subject areas such as finance, marketing and organizational behaviour. However, the field is rather unclearly delineated at present, as a result of the heavy usage of borrowed theories, a phenomenon we discuss in this article. For strategic management to become a legitimate subject area, truly at par with the more conventional fields taught in business schools, we recommend much stronger selectivity when borrowing theories from other areas of scholarly inquiry than management, as the foundation of empirical work. We propose a new model consisting of seven quality tests to assess whether proper selectivity is being applied when 'importing' concepts from other fields than management. Our perspective has major implications both for future, evidence-based strategic management research and for the field's key stakeholders such as strategy teachers, practitioners and policy makers - who rely on research outputs from strategy scholars.

Building on agency theory and international business research, this paper explores how parent firm and subsidiary ownership factors affect FDI location decisions in emerging economies. Our analysis suggests that ownerships of block-shareholders in the parent firm (i.e., controlling family, non-family TMT members and institutional investors) and equity stake in a subsidiary owned by the parent company are positively associated with FDI location decisions in less-explored and risky areas. However, the effects of parent firm and subsidiary ownership factors may substitute for each other with respect to their integrated effect on dealing with risks associated with FDI location decisions.

An effective board of directors is central to agency theory's prescription to solving the problems of separation of ownership from control in the modern corporation. The shareholders' confidence in the board's ability to fulfil its duties is an important measure of the success or otherwise of this cornerstone of agency theory. The Board Shareholder Confidence Index focuses on the board of directors and is the standard by which Canadian governance best practices are measured. This paper investigates the relationship between board effectiveness and company performance. Using a sample of 699 firm year observations from 2003 to 2009, we find a positive association between the firm's measure of board effectiveness and the firm's contemporaneous and future market measure of performance, Tobin's Q. The results hold across a number of econometric models that control for different types of endogeneities. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores the relation between corporate governance and asymmetric information. We find that proxies for governance mechanisms that encourage the monitoring of managers are inversely related to proxies for asymmetric information. Specifically, greater board independence, board activeness and debt financing are significantly and inversely related to the degree of asymmetric information as reflected in bid-ask spreads, volatility of share returns, normalised share trade volumes and market value of shares traded. This implies that corporate governance mechanisms that enhance managerial monitoring lead to improvements in the informational environment of the firm. (c) 2015 The Authors.

While some research suggests that explicit incentives to meet time budgets have recently been reduced at audit firms, there is also evidence indicating that audit seniors and staff still feel at least implicit pressure to meet budgets. We examine the possibility that both of these findings tell a part of the story. Specifically, we explore whether, and under what conditions, seniors and staff are implicitly encouraged to underreport time through future engagement staffing decisions and the performance evaluation process. Further, we consider the extent to which agency theory can serve as a framework for understanding how the incentives of audit managers and partners influence how they view underreporting by their engagement staff. We place participants in a scenario in which they are responsible for evaluating an engagement senior who appears to have worked more hours than were budgeted. We manipulate the senior's reporting accuracy (underreporting versus accurate reporting) and the desirability of the client (more versus less desirable). We find that, when managers' agency-related incentives conflict more strongly with those of the firm (more desirable client), they tend to tacitly encourage underreporting through their evaluations of the senior's performance. Managers are also more likely to request an underreporter on a future engagement. In contrast, partners placed in the same setting show no evidence of encouraging underreporting. Thus, our results suggest that managers' tacit encouragement of underreporting is contrary to what the "principals" of the firm (i.e., partners) appear to want. Further, while firms may have reduced their emphasis on formal, explicit incentives to underreport, it appears likely that implicit manager incentives persist. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems are increasingly used in construction projects. Theoretically, these systems provide greater transparency and access to construction project information and, in doing so, should reduce the information asymmetry that commonly arises in construction contracting relationships. This typically occurs when suppliers of products and services opportunistically take advantage of the client due to the imbalance in information. The article therefore explores whether or not the high level of information content offered by BIM and the potential for sharing that information among contracting parties means that the information asymmetry can be alleviated using BIM. In order to investigate this, evidence was collected through three purposively sampled case studies of large principal organizations undertaking projects in Australia - each representing a different type of customer in the supply chain on construction projects. Our findings suggest a gap between the theoretical potential and practical application of BIM to reduce information asymmetry. The study found that, although BIM has the capability to reduce information asymmetry, it has not reached a mature enough stage in the Australian construction industry to clearly confirm that it actually reduces the problem. There is even a degree of evidence that, under certain circumstances, a reverse asymmetry may exist in which a client has the technical knowledge to more successfully analyze the BIM model (relative to the organizations they contract with) and then use the resulting information to their own opportunistic advantage.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We analyze CEO turnover in closely held firms with some level of ownership dispersion in a context of low investor protection. In particular, we examine the impact of family involvement on CEO turnover and CEO turnover/performance sensitivity. We argue that family involvement in management, ownership, and control has both a direct effect on CEO turnover from the family presence itself, and a moderating effect over CEO turnover/performance sensitivity attributable to the agency tensions between majority and minority shareholders (whether other family blocks or non-family shareholders). Research Findings/Insights: Using data from 1996-2006 for 523 Colombian firms, we find direct and moderating effects, depending on the type of family involvement. Family involvement in management and boards reduces CEO turnover, but family involvement in ownership increases it. Regarding moderating effects, family involvement in ownership reduces CEO turnover/performance sensitivity, while the opposite occurs with family directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results show that closely held firms in emerging markets exhibit a strong negative CEO turnover/performance sensitivity, which is a somewhat counterintuitive result, and also contribute to a better understanding of agency conflicts within family firms by highlighting the different ways families affect CEO turnover. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings suggest that even benevolently entrenched family CEOs are not immune to poor financial performance. Families that are majority or controlling shareholders may support CEOs even when the firm performs poorly because of potential benefits from control. Family boards are very sensitive to financial performance even when the CEO is a family member. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Agency theory predicts that incentives will align agents' interests with those of principals. However, the resource-based view suggests that to be effective, the incentive to deliver must be paired with the ability to deliver. Using Fortune 500 boards as an empirical context, this study shows that the presence of directors who lack top-level experience but own large shareholdings is negatively associated with firm value, an effect that increases in the number of such directors. Firm value rises after such directors depart from boards, with the greatest increases occurring when many of these directors leave. While agency theory highlights the importance of the right incentives being in place, this research suggests that this can be ineffective if the right resources are not also in place.

Empirical examinations of the links between corporate governance and intellectual capital are underresearched, particularly from the context of emerging economies where corporate governance mechanisms tend to be largely ceremonial due to family dominance. This study aims to address this gap in the intellectual capital disclosure (ICD) literature by undertaking an empirical examination of the relationship between corporate governance and the extent of ICD of Bangladeshi companies. Inter alia, the key findings of this study suggest that there is a non-linear relationship between family ownership and the extent of ICD. This research also found that foreign ownership, board independence, and the presence of audit committees are positively associated with the extent of ICD. Conversely, family duality (i.e., where the positions of CEO and chairperson are occupied by two individuals from the same family) is negatively associated with the extent of ICD.

What is the impact of long-term executive compensation, particularly large pension payouts, on the firm's current dividend policy? We argue that managers with high pension holdings are less likely to adopt a high dividend policy that can risk their future pension payouts. Using a hand-collected actuarial pension dataset we show that (i) dividend payments are significantly lower when manager compensation relies more heavily on pension payouts; (ii) higher compensation leverage and inside debt have a significant negative effect on dividend payments net of stock repurchases; and (iii) the negative effect of pension on dividend is significantly weaker when pensions are protected in a pre-funding rabbi trust. We show further that this agency behavior reduces firm performance. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we examine the relationship between government ownership and dividend policy. Using a multinational sample of newly privatised firms from 43 countries, we find strong and robust evidence indicating that dividend payout is negatively related to government ownership, consistent with the predictions of agency theory. We also find that country-level corporate governance affects the relationship between government ownership and dividend policy. Specifically, the adverse effects of government ownership on dividend policy are more pronounced in countries with weak law and order and a lower level of checks and balances. Our results are important, as they show that government ownership, as well as the institutional environment, does in fact affect the critical corporate policies, such as dividend policy, of newly privatised firms.

Through construction contracts, clients and contractors are involved in principal-agent relationships. These relationships are argued to be adversarial and characterised by two main features of contracting parties, as follows: (1) different goals, and (2) different attitudes to risk. Agency-related problems contribute to the project participants concentrating on risks associated with their own parts of projects instead of joint risk management (JRM). Fewer studies have discussed JRM, although risk-sharing is a key issue in principal-agent relationships and agency-related problems must be effectively addressed to establish strong collaboration. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate how project participants address problems associated with principal-agent relationships and thereby enhance cooperative relationships (and JRM). The empirical findings are based on two longitudinal case studies and show that strong collaboration is a multidimensional activity that is crucial for JRM. Effective JRM is highly dependent on strategies for fostering relationships and collaboration (such as cooperative procurement, establishment of common goals, and open communication), and should be implemented together with these strategies.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide insights into the understanding of the relationship between board involvement and corporate performance within the context of developing countries. Design/methodology/approach - A number of aspects related to board involvement, including board's shareholdings, frequency of board meetings, availability of independent board committees, board size, CEO duality, and CEO is being a promoter, were examined in order to explore their influence on corporate performance measured in terms of earnings per share. The study mainly draws on agency theory, and is supplemented by resource dependence and stewardship theories. Multiple regression analysis is utilized to analyze the data gathered from a sample of 212 publicly listed companies in 20 industries in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings - Among the aspects of board involvement considered, board's shareholdings, board meetings frequency, independent committees, and CEO duality showed a positive influence on corporate performance. However, two other aspects, namely CEO being a promoter, and the size of corporate boards showed a negative effect. The findings also suggest that the use of multiple theories, rather than depending on a single theory, is more effective in understanding the relationships examined in this study. Further, the study highlights the need to be cautious in utilizing the theories that are more applicable to matured western economies when analyzing issues relating to developing countries. Originality/value - This study makes an original contribution to corporate governance literature by examining the relationship between board involvement and corporate performance in a developing country, namely Sri Lanka. The study also adds to the existing literature by utilizing multiple theories to examine the issue under investigation. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Unlike business models of private banks based on profit maximization and shareholder-oriented governance, alternative banks (such as cooperative banks, government savings banks, and special purpose banks) share business models based on sustainable returns with longer time horizons, corporate missions that include social and public policy goals, and stakeholder-oriented governance. Strong evidence from recent research suggests that alternative banks often equal or outperform joint-stock banks in terms of efficiency, profitability, and risk management. This counters core ideas in contemporary banking theory and expectations of regulators about the superiority of private ownership and market-based banking. Concepts and theories from banking studies help explain how alternative banks outperform private banks in core functions such as creating and managing liquidity, pooling deposits, and reducing information asymmetries and agency costs. However, heterodox theories of the firm and institutional approaches to competitive advantage broaden the scope of analysis to explain further historical, social, and organizational advantages (and risks) in alternative banking. Alternative banks therefore require, and may inspire, alternative theories of banking and new approaches to bank regulation. (c) Walter de Gruyter GmbH. All rights reserved.

This study investigates how franchising chains use advertising to enhance coordination and improve their control over prices set at franchised outlets. We argue that chains use price advertising to inform customers about their desired prices, thereby influencing franchisees to adopt the advertised prices although they are not contractually required to do so. We test our hypotheses using rich outlet-level price data collected before and after a U.S. nationwide advertising campaign by McDonald's. Our findings indicate that advertising is an effective mechanism that franchising chains use to improve their control over franchisees, enhance uniformity, and reduce franchisee free-riding.

Purpose - Drawing upon the resource dependence theory, the purpose of this paper is to examine how the board capital diversity influences the explorative innovation of firms, attempting to resolve the inconsistent empirical findings of the effect of outside directors on firm's R&D strategy. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of Korean manufacturing firms which consider R&D capability to be one of their core competencies, the study uses negative binomial model to test the influence of board capital diversity on explorative innovation. Findings - Results support the value of moderate level of board diversity hypothesis by demonstrating that board capital diversity shows an inverted U-shaped relationship with explorative innovation. The results also suggest that CEO ownership positively moderates the relationship between board capital diversity and firms' innovative performance. Originality/value - Mainstream research has focussed on the directors' monitoring role based on agency theory, overlooking the more positive resource provision role. Taking on the concepts of board capital and exploration, the study introduces the notion that outside directors should be selected with a view as vehicles for bringing in valuable expertise and social linkages for the firm's explorative innovation.

Recently, outside blockholders, external owners that hold 5% or more of their firms' outstanding common stockholdings, have been pressuring their firms to engage in divestiture activities. This study considers whether the influence of those owners also extends to how the divestiture is implemented, whether through spin-off or sell-off. Tests of an agency theory model using data from 205 divestitures show that the adoption of spin-offs or sell-offs is associated with the amount of outstanding common stockholdings held by outside blockholders and the size of the unit divested. Spin-offs are used more frequently when outside blockholders own more of the divesting firm's stockholdings and the divested unit is larger, while sell-offs tend to be selected when outside blockholders own less stock and the divested business is smaller. Consistent with agency theory expectations, spin-offs would allow the blockholders to decide whether to hold or sell their interests in the divested firm, a decision they could make in accordance with their individual portfolio risks. Sell-offs of small units could be used to preserve organizational diversity and produce proceeds that would help the divesting firm's managers pursue their self-interests. Overall, outside blockholders appear to shape how divestitures are done, even if they cannot directly intervene in their firms' operations. (c) The Author(s) 2012

In this study we examine the relation between ownership structure and corporate performance; the sample of the study included 42 out of 48 companies of all sectors in Bahrain Bourse in five years from 2007-2011. Several dimensions of ownership concentration were studied in addition to managerial and institutional ownership. Two different measurements of performance were used (ROA and Tobin's Q). The study investigated this relation using several control variables and 2SLS statistical method to overcome the problem of endogeneity that may exist between the study variables. It was found that ownership concentration have a negative effect with statistical significance on company performance. Institutional ownership was found to have a positive effect on company performance. Managerial ownership was not found to have a significant effect on company performance, however it was found that managerial ownership has a positive effect on performance only in the case of declining ownership concentration. Other results were revealed by the study regarding company age, size, growth, board size and liquidity. The study is considered to have theoretical and practical implications. It contributes to the debate about agency theory and managerial entrenchment. It also may help officials in Bahrain in making laws and legislations concerning corporate governance improvement in Bahraini market.

In this article we examine the extent to which fairness considerations are salient to senior executives, and consider the implications for agency theory, tournament theory and the design of top-management incentives. We look for patterns in a unique data set of senior executive preferences and seek explanations for these patterns using a model of fairness first advanced by Fehr and Schmidt in 1999. We propose a number of amendments to Fehr and Schmidt's model. We challenge some of the standard tenets of agency theory and tournament theory, demonstrating why equity considerations should be taken into account. We add to the growing literature on behavioural agency theory. (c) 2015, (c) The Author(s) 2015.

This study examines the effect of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) on audit fees, and assesses whether and how this effect varies across different countries. We specifically consider publicly listed firms in the US and Japan over the eight-year period centered around the dates on which XBRL was first mandated for use by publicly listed firms in these jurisdictions. Our comparative results show that XBRL use is inversely associated with audit fees, which are in turn positively associated with firm size. We also find that, overall, XBRL moderates the association between firm size and audit fees in both the US and Japan. However, these moderation effects are weaker among Japanese firms.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board characteristics on financial performance. Most of the existing literature implicitly assumes that the relationship between either board composition, or board leadership structure and financial performance is direct. Design/methodology/approach - The generalized least squares method was performed as a panel data analysis on a sample of 40 Egyptian listed firms during the period from 2008 to 2010. Findings - The results demonstrated that under board leadership structure that assigns the duties of the CEO and chairman to the same person, increasing the proportion of non-executive members to the total number of directors has a negative impact on firm financial performance. Practical implications - First, corporate governance structures do not operate in a vacuum, and therefore, corporate governance mechanisms must be considered and assessed altogether. Second, failure to understand the underlying interdependency among corporate governance mechanisms may result in arguments that blame some corporate governance designs for poor financial performance. Third, there is no single board governance mechanism that can be considered ideal, but there are combinations of these mechanisms that are preferred. Originality/value - The paper adds to the corporate governance literature by providing empirical evidence from the emerging market of Egypt. The evidence shows that the relationship between board characteristics and financial performance is not a monotonic relationship. Consequently, these findings imply that existing evidence explaining the relationship between board characteristics and financial performance needs to be interpreted with some caution.

This study seeks to examine the potential links between corporate governance mechanisms and environmental reporting practices from the perspective of agency theory. A content analysis has been conducted to gather relevant information from the annual reports of the 100 leading Malaysian public-listed companies covering a three-year period, i.e., from 2009 to 2011. The relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and environmental reporting practices is then tested using regression analysis. The results generally indicate that there was an improved trend in environmental reporting among the companies over the three-year period and offer preliminary insights into the influence of corporate governance on environmental reporting. A positive significant relationship was found between board size and environmental reporting. Other corporate governance mechanisms including board independence, ownership concentration and female directorship were not associated with the environmental reporting practices of companies. The findings provide new insights into the potential strategies in relation to corporate governance towards encouraging greater environmental reporting from the perspective of an emerging country.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Using agency theory and socioemotional wealth perspective as the theoretical framework, we evaluate the extent to which financing choices subsequent to going public and their economic consequences differ for family firms relative to non-family firms. Research Findings/Insights: Our results suggest that family firms maintain higher post-IPO leverage and longer debt maturity structure relative to non-family firms. Further, family firms raise less external capital subsequent to going public relative to non-family firms. The reluctance of family firms to raise post-IPO capital, however, results in higher investment sensitivity to internal cash flows and consequently inefficient investment. In addition, family firm financing choices differentially influence various facets of post-IPO performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study suggests that agency conflicts among firm stakeholders as well as socioemotional wealth considerations are important determinants of family firm financing behavior subsequent to going public. Further, ownership structure is an important determinant of the extent IPO firms capitalize on the opportunity to raise capital subsequent to going public to finance investments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results offer insights to entrepreneurs, managers, venture capitalists, and other capital market participants with regard to the link between firm ownership structure and the economic benefits of going public (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Agency theory suggests that dividends can be used to mitigate agency problems between shareholders and managers. If director stock options are granted to align the interests of directors with shareholders, we anticipate that there will be less need for external governance mechanisms such as dividends. Examining the association between outside director stock options and dividend policy, we show that outside director option compensation indeed varies inversely with dividend distribution. This result suggests that incentivizing outside directors reduces the need for external market monitoring through dividends. Controlling for the sensitivity of options to changes in dividends, we illustrate that the lack of dividend protection for stock options is not a sufficient explanation for the reduction of dividends. We also show that while investment policy might dominate the decision to offer a dividend, director stock options play an important role in determining the level of dividend paid in firms that pay dividends.

We test the agency theory of corporate political activity by examining the association between the legality of independent expenditures and antitakeover lawmaking in the US states. Exploiting changesinstate law regarding the use of corporate independent expenditures in the pre-Citizens United era, we estimate that a state is more likely to pass antitakeover statutes that entrench management when firms are allowed to make independent expenditures. We also find that this relationship is conditional on the competitiveness of a state's electoral environment, suggesting that the threat of independent expenditures may move vulnerable legislators' votes on less salient issues, such as corporate governance. These findings are robust to competing public interest and political economy explanations for anti-takeover lawmaking, and they reveal that allowing independent expenditures may create additional agency costs for owners through public policy. Finally, these results strongly challenge the claim that state-level antitakeover laws are exogenous to firms' activities. (c) The Author 2014.

To examine the bribing behavior of firms, we developed a cross-level moderation model using agency theory at the firm level and anomie theory at the societal level to investigate the relationship between manager control of firms and firm bribery activity. The results of this cross-cultural analysis using a sample of 1,799 firms from 38 nations showed that at the firm level, manager-controlled firms (MCFs) have a higher propensity to bribe than shareholder-controlled firms. At the country level, bribery is higher in MCFs (relative to shareholder-controlled firms) in societies with a low level of institutional collectivism, a high level of uncertainty avoidance, economic change, and income inequality. Contrary to the hypothesis, the relationship between bribery and manager control is stronger rather than weaker in societies with press freedom. Implications for future research and practices are discussed. (c) 2015 The International Association for Chinese Management Research.

We document three new facts about gender differences in executive compensation. First, female executives receive lower share of incentive pay in total compensation relative to males. This difference accounts for 93% of the gender gap in total pay. Second, the compensation of female executives displays lower pay-performance sensitivity. A $1 million dollar increase in firm value generates a $17,150 increase in firm-specific wealth for male executives and a $1,670 increase for females. Third, female executives are more exposed to bad firm performance and less exposed to good firm performance relative to male executives. We find no link between firm performance and the gender of top executives. We discuss evidence on differences in preferences and the cost of managerial effort by gender and examine the resulting predictions for the structure of compensation. We consider two paradigms for the pay-setting process, the efficient contracting model and the "managerial power" or skimming view. The efficient contracting model can explain the first two facts. Only the skimming view is consistent with the third fact. This suggests that the gender differentials in executive compensation may be inefficient. (c) 2015 Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Objective - The purpose of this work is to examine the influence of ownership concentration on the funds allocated to CSR in Brazilian firm. Design/methodology/approach - Econometric models have been estimated, with an index of CSR as the dependent variable, and ownership concentration as the explanatory variable, together with relevant control variables suggested in the literature (profitability, leverage, growth opportunities, and firm size). A Brazilian CSR database has been built using data extracted from two different sources, one relative to CSR data and another that provides ownership structure and financial data. CSR policy is proxied by an index obtained as the ratio between funds directed to social action (employee relations, external social actions, and environmental action) and net sales. Findings - The findings indicate that CSR is positively influenced by firm ownership concentration in Brazil. Practical implications - The positive influence of ownership concentration on CSR may be an indication that large controlling shareholders of Brazilian firm may be considering CSR as an effective way to improve the image and reputation of the firm and its owners. This belief may be stimulating CSR projects and their disclosure in Brazil. Originality/value - This work is an additional contribution to the debate about the role played by ownership structure on CSR. Taking into account that the central point of Stakeholder Theory is a firm's concern with all its stakeholders, the research builds on Stakeholder and Agency Theories by assessing the influence of large controlling shareholders on a firm's social concerns.

This study suggests that unrelated diversification has a positive influence on the probability of fraudulent reporting whereas related diversification has a negative influence on the probability of fraudulent reporting. The strength of the influence of these corporate level strategies is contingent on the moral character of the firm. Unrelated diversification provides opportunity for financial innovation within the firm's internal capital market, which can result in fraudulent reporting. This is more likely when the moral character of the firm is driven by a conscienceless financial self-interest motive, as implied by the firm's contempt toward the larger community (in terms of damage inflicted on the interests of people outside the firm). In contrast, related diversification, where product divisions focus on mutual sharing and monitoring of operational activities, can reduce the probability of fraudulent reporting. This is more likely when constituents within the firm view themselves as moral citizens, as implied by the firm's benevolence toward the larger community. Hence, while unrelated diversification focuses the energies of managers within the firm on financial manipulation, related diversification focuses these energies on productive purposes.

Purpose - This study aims to examine the role the structure of corporate boards plays in the failure of the firm. Specifically, it examines whether the remuneration committee is related to corporate failure in the UK. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 failed and 269 non-failed UK-listed non-financial firms between the periods of 1994 and 2011. This study used pooled cross-sectional, fixed and random effects LOGIT models to estimate whether corporate failure is related to remuneration committee in the UK. Findings - The findings indicate that corporate failure is negatively related to the independence of the remuneration committee chairman and remuneration committee's effectiveness but not remuneration committee's presence, size and meetings. However, a positive and significant relationship was observed between corporate failure and remuneration committee independence. Practical implications - The findings of the study provide support for the appropriateness of agency theory as analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of remuneration committee, especially the independence of the remuneration committee chairperson, as a board monitoring device, in the context of corporate failure. Originality/value - The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance by establishing the likely causes of corporate failure in the UK. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper examines the influence of top management team (TMT) pay structure characteristics (such as pay dispersion, long-term variable pay, and short-term variable pay) on corporate social performance (CSP) based on upper echelon theory and agency theory. The analysis using a large panel sample of US public firms reveals that long-term oriented and egalitarian TMT pay structure has a positive influence on CSP. In addition, the negative influence of short-term variable pay on CSP becomes stronger as the pay difference among TMT members becomes greater. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings will be discussed. (c) 2015 The Braybrooke Press Ltd.

This chapter provides a synoptic description of the main theories that see inter-organizational relationships as coordination and control issues: the Transaction Costs Economics theory, the Agency theory and the Resource Dependence theory. These three theories share the idea that inter-organizational relationships are founded on opportunism and bounded rationality, and that organizations seek to control the critical aspects of their business network interactions in order to pursue their goals. These three theories are often considered as complementary in literature, since they often provide opposite predictions in similar cases. Scholars interested in e-marketplaces and in the inter-organizational impacts of the Internet have mainly focused on the Transaction Costs Economics theory so far; this theory has undergone important evolution and hybridization processes, and is then more thoroughly described than the other two in this chapter.

We discuss how the approach taken by regulators to address financial reporting issues has a significant influence on tone at the top. While tone must ultimately be established internally, regulators are more likely to have a positive impact on the quality of financial reporting by addressing organizational tone. A strong tone at the top should ensure that the financial reports are characterized by greater transparency and complete disclosures, and a regulator's response will depend upon their perspective as to what motivates management. A compliance-based approach, rooted in agency theory's assumption that managers act in their own best interests, seeks to mandate desirable behavior through elevated monitoring and reduced managerial discretion. Alternatively, an empowerment-based approach rooted in stewardship theory views managers as trustworthy guardians and grants them greater discretion without burdensome external monitoring. In practice, regulations fall on a continuum between these two approaches. To illustrate the continuum between compliance and empowerment, we present three cases in financial and tax reporting and examine the outcomes of these recent regulatory responses. We then provide conclusions regarding the effectiveness of each regulation by considering how tone was influenced within organizations. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Purpose - This study aims to develop a theoretical model that specifies the most important factors hypothesised to facilitate reciprocal knowledge transfer between nationals and non-nationals in the context of workplace quotas. Design/methodology/approach - Expatriate labour is viewed as a form of contingent employment that provides firms with ready access to experienced and specialised knowledge. We argue that in a knowledge economy, the successful use of workplace quotas for nationals depends on effective management of both nationals and non-nationals. By drawing on scholarly contributions in the areas of strategic management, agency theory, knowledge management and absorptive capacity, this paper consolidates extant knowledge and proposes a new framework aimed at developing a more integrated agenda for future research. Findings - Three broad categories are posited as strategic enablers to effective knowledge management. First, senior leadership has a direct role in developing appropriate policies, promoting transparency and fostering a culture of trust and an indirect role through the establishment of incentives. Second, the influence of incentives on both knowledge management and process improvement is addressed. Third, the characteristics of each group with regard to qualifications, motivation and receptivity are discussed. Optimally, these factors work in concert to build competencies that ultimately satisfy customers and meet organisational goals. Originality/value - There is a gap in scholarly research that explicitly links important organisational and management concepts to the study of expatriate-national interactions. This article contributes to understanding how policy makers and leaders can strengthen the transformative forces that will drive successful development of human capital.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between "political competition" and "environmental reporting" by New Zealand local governments. Design/methodology/approach - The research method includes a longitudinal analysis of environmental reporting by New Zealand local governments in their annual reports for the financial years 2005-2006 to 2009-2010. "Content analysis" was used to attach scores to the extent of environmental reporting. The "number of candidates divided by the number of available positions at the previous election" was used as the proxy for "political competition". Findings - The study reports a positive relationship between "political competition" and "environmental reporting" in 2007-2008. The number of local governments reporting voluntary environmental information increased in 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 compared to 2005-2006, followed by a reduction in such numbers following the 2007-2008 financial year. This trend in disclosure can be attributed to the local government elections in October 2007. This finding is consistent with the expectation of "agency theory" and provides insight into the pattern of perceived agency costs. The study also finds a dearth in reporting "monetary" and "bad" news. Originality/value - The study contributes towards the previous literature on environmental reporting by concentrating on the public sector and New Zealand, together with investigating the relationship of such reporting with "political competition" through a longitudinal analysis. The theoretical contribution of this study is the adoption of "agency theory" in the context of public sector voluntary reporting and investigating the significance attached by agents to environmental reporting to minimise agency cost. The practical contribution of the study is in the area of future development of reporting standards in regards to environmental reporting. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the association between corporate ownership structures and audit fees paid to external auditors by Malaysian companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. This study focusses on the extent of the auditor's reliance on the client's internal control inasmuch as the corporate ownership structures are varied, and, ultimately, affect the audit fees. Design/methodology/approach - This study applies the agency theory in formulating three hypotheses that guide the results analysis. By employing a multi regression model for a sample of 345 Malaysian companies listed on Bursa Malaysia, this study examines the relationship of ownership structure, namely, managerial ownership, foreign ownership and government ownership with audit fees using data for 2010. Findings - The results show a significant positive relationship between audit fees and firms with larger foreign ownership and government ownership but no significant relationship with firms with higher managerial ownership. This study contributes recent evidence concerning the relationship between corporate ownership structure and audit fees. Practical implications - Regulators may consider ownership structure on the standards or regulation setting in order to be practical and operationalized in line with the impact associated with different ownership structures. The practitioners may also design appropriate methodologies and procedures for the different ownership structures for high-quality service and to standardize the risk mitigation process. Social implications - The ownership structures have different influences on the audit fees, as well as complexity of the firms and their profitability. Originality/value - The study looks upon certain percentages of ownership structures, and how they affects audit fees, firms complexity and profitability. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study is intended to find out the motives of cash holding in Chinese firms and theories associated with these motives. The study is unique because it not only estimates the adjustment speed of corporate cash holdings but also discuss several firm specific factors that affects cash holdings in Chinese firms with special reference to Chinese SOEs and NSOEs. An extensive set of panel data comprising 1632 A listed Chines firms, over a period from 2001 to 2013 are taken for analysis. The study reports a lower adjustment coefficient for Chinese firms compared to other developed nations. The study finds that target level of cash holdings in Chinese firms is better explained by Trade off and Pecking order theories. To cope with issues of endogeneity and serial correlation the study apply GMM and random effects model with an added AR (autoregressive) term.

There has been a trend of large professional service firms (PSFs) to move from the partnership form of ownership to alternative ownership forms. As part of this trend large, publicly-quoted accounting companies have emerged in Australia, the US and the UK. Research on how publicly-owned PSFs, including accounting companies, are governed, whether aspects of the governance of partnership persist, why particular governance interpretive schemes and associated structures and systems are implemented and implications for performance is sparse. This study explores the interpretive scheme of governance in two Australian publicly-quoted accounting companies and finds one of the companies to have mimicked the major attributes of the partnership interpretive scheme while the other company moved to a corporate form of governance eliminating all vestiges of the partnership interpretive scheme. Governance was found to have significant implications for the performance of the companies with moving from a partnership interpretive scheme contributing to the ultimate failure of one of the companies. The cases suggest that failed experiments in the governance of publicly-owned PSFs, a relatively recently emerged ownership form in some professions, may contribute to conflicting prior findings on the implications of ownership form for the performance of PSFs. Two alternative approaches to the introduction of corporate style governance structures and systems were identified with the findings suggesting potential benefits of evolution rather than revolution. Based on the findings, a theoretical model of the interpretive scheme of governance of publicly-traded PSFs is developed including factors affecting the interpretive scheme implemented and the introduction of more corporate-like governance structures and systems, potential performance implications of PSFs moving away from a partnership interpretive scheme and the conditions and contingencies under which the relationship may hold. The paper also extends the application of agency theory to publicly-owned PSFs. (c) The Author(s) 2015

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider the way in which agency theory has crowded out other approaches to understanding the governance of modern businesses. The paper rescues the meaning and context which informed the American corporate governance reform movement originally and demonstrates how the economically predicated agency approach became dominant in academic considerations of corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach - Both primary and secondary sources were considered in a Foucauldian history of ideas approach. Findings - Other approaches to corporate governance have been pushed out of the mainstream of corporate governance discourse by an economic model which excludes many of the key issues which informed the notion originally. Practical implications - Dominant academic attitudes to corporate governance have occluded other ways in which the governance of corporations can be understood. Originality/value - Previous accounts of corporate governance have ignored the alternative approaches represented before agency theory became dominant. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

The 2011 Tunisian revolution has played a role in bringing the corporate governance agenda to the forefront. This political change in Tunisia has revealed persistent governance problems in its banking industry. This paper presents the results of research conducted on how different aspects of corporate governance can influence bank performance. The sample comprises 10 Tunisian commercial banks for the period from 1997 to 2010. The performance-governance relationship is estimated using a range of econometric techniques. The findings reveal strong support for a negative association between blockholder ownership and performance. Our results show that the bank board size is related to directors' ability to monitor and advise management. Additionally, CEO duality is positively associated with performance. Further analysis suggests that the presence of government officials on banks' board of directors decreases bank performance. Taken together, our findings offer recommendations to regulators, especially for the on-going financial reform of corporate boards.

Based on the assumptions of agency theory, family business researchers have often argued that family firms are less likely to use formal methods of monitoring and control than nonfamily firms. We explore the relationship between family firm status and presence of a written agreement among the owners, a formal measure of control. We hypothesize economic goals and perceived level of risk taking and management efficacy will mediate the relationship between family firm status and presence of a written agreement. Results indicate that the primary goal of the firm serves as a partial mediator of this relationship. (c) 2015 International Council for Small Business.

Top management of a multidivisional firm needs to strike a balance between providing transfer pricing autonomy to divisional managers and retaining some level of control to prevent dysfunctional behavior. Little empirical evidence exists on how top management makes this trade-off. Drawing on agency theory, we predict that transfer pricing autonomy is influenced by intermediate product standardization, foreign investment, tax rate difference, and the weight on firm-level performance measures in the divisional manager's performance evaluation. We also predict that the extent of mismatch between transfer pricing autonomy and organizational characteristics leads to lower perceived fairness and perceived transfer pricing effectiveness by divisional managers. Using data collected from a cross-sectional survey of 210 divisional managers, we find results consistent with our predictions. (c) 2015, American Accounting Association. All rights reserved.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to revisit Schein's proposed process-consultation approach as a general framework for management consulting in the light of some premises of the agency theory, namely the behavior induced by the asymmetry of information between the principal (leader-client) and the agent (consultant). Design/methodology/approach - Empirical research consisted of an in-depth, qualitative and phenomenological analysis of 13 cases of organizational intervention based on the practice of four senior consultants in a Canadian management consulting firm whose philosophy is based on organizational development principles and practices. All the cases chosen are characterized by a situation of strategic change as a result of governmental reforms in the healthcare sector between 2005 and 2008. Findings - Overall, the study shows that the relationship between leaders-clients and consultants varies from one stage to another throughout the consultation process and that the information asymmetry does not always benefit the agent as stated in the agency theory. The consultants are required to play diverse roles, either in combination or alternation, during the consultation process; the facilitator's role, stated as the more efficient role in Schein's perspective and the more altruistic from the point of view of the agency theory, is not necessarily the role preferred by managers. Moreover, results highlight the idiosyncrasies of healthcare organizations, namely the phenomenon of escalating indecision that comes into play during the implementation phase of change, worth taking into account in the practice and theories of management consulting. Practical implications - This analysis raises a number of questions about the general understanding and applicability of the process consultation as defined by Schein. Perhaps the four consultants have not perfectly mastered the interpersonal skills that Schein's model presupposes. One may also conclude that the model does not always respond to the expectations and needs of leaders and managers and that, for many consultants, it is difficult to adopt only one role model throughout the consulting process. One may also question its realism in a context of interventions in public organizations, with a plurality of interest groups and ambiguity of goals, where governmental reforms are pressuring managers to control costs. Originality/value - According to Eisenhardt (1989) and Hendry (2002), the agency theory offers promising avenues if combined with other theoretical anchors such as the field of organizational behavior. This study scrutinizes the leader-consultant relationship, and more specifically the type of assistance requested by healthcare leaders as they experienced strategic change and how consultants responded to these requests.

Purpose - This paper aims to explore the differing attitudes of salaried chief financial officers (CFOs) that can be associated with agency theory and stewardship theory. CFO attitudes are investigated because CFOs typically face additional agency conflict in their roles as overseers of the financial and accounting functions that are responsible for the production of numerical information used as a basis for incentive compensation. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative field study of 14 large privately held Austrian manufacturing companies was conducted. The findings rely on information retrieved from 18 semi-structured interviews conducted with individuals from these companies. Findings - The findings reveal a number of contextual factors that influence stewardship and agency attitudes of salaried CFOs. CFOs, who mainly report formally to owners, perceive more control in the hands of the owners. Short-term management appointments appear to facilitate agency-like behavior, whereas the existence of owner-managers and the typical CFO's maturity in terms of age and wealth seem to nurture stewardship behavior. Research limitations/implications - Further (quantitative) research is needed to corroborate the findings in this study, which are derived from a qualitative research approach. Further research on agency and stewardship behavior should also include the view of principal with respect to agent actions, as this paper shows that principal opinion strongly affects the way agents perceive control. Practical implications - The findings suggest that the behavior of company owners can influence and change a manager's agency or stewardship attitude. Owners who desire a culture of stewardship should set long-term goals and facilitate long-term management appointments. Moreover, owners can lower a manager's perceived level of owner control by adopting an active role in management. Originality/value - This paper is the first to analyze stewardship and agency attitude of salaried CFOs in privately held companies. It, therefore, adds to the current literature on the role of the CFO, as well as to the literature on governance issues in privately held firms. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

It is well known that firms with low price to earnings ratios (value firms) earn higher stock returns in the long term than high price to earnings firms (growth firms). This study investigates how insider ownership affects this relation. We show that when insider ownership is high, returns decline for low P/E firms and improve for high P/E firms. These findings are rationalized in the context of entrenchment and alignment of incentive effects. For low P/E firms, low stock returns reflect the inability of boards of directors and outside shareholders to influence poorly performing entrenched management. For high P/E firms, boards of directors and outside shareholders are less likely to intervene since higher returns reflect increased agency incentives for value-creating managers.

Purpose - This review paper aims to compare the various dimensions in the finance literature pertaining to the Anglo-Saxon Model (Stockholder Model) prevalent in the USA and the UK with the German Model (Stakeholder Model) of corporate governance prevalent in Germany and continental Europe. The present study identifies different strands of research on the various dimensions of these models, along with aspects of governance in emerging economies and the phenomenon of the convergence of these governance mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The literature review on corporate governance models has been carried out on the themes of internal and external governance mechanisms. The review considers agency theory along with principal-principal (PP) conflicts as the fundamental blocks explaining the need for governance structures. Findings - The traditional models of governance, along with the incorporation of PP conflicts, will result in a hybrid model inculcating the best of both the traditional models. However, convergence in the true sense may not be possible owing to fundamental differences pertaining to cultural, economic, legal and socio-economic aspects of the firm. Originality/value - This paper proposes a framework incorporating the interplay of managerial talent and controlling shareholders to understand the governance system that may be applicable for firms in emerging economies.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to draw on agency theory (AT) to develop and validate a scale to investigate customers' loyalty towards salespersons under agency problems. Especially with credence services, customer-salesperson relationships are beset by problems that stem from personal differences and conflicts of interests. Design/methodology/approach - The context is financial investment services in Indonesia. Following Churchill's (1979) procedure, initial qualitative surveys generated a pool of 44 items for the three AT asymmetries of risk, goal and information. Expert panel validation and exploratory factor analyses of a dataset (n = 429) confirmed a four-dimensional structure of 30 items. Finally, confirmatory factor analyses using a second dataset (n = 299) tested the effects of the four asymmetries on customer loyalty, and how the effects are moderated by customer trust and relationship duration. Findings - Overall, agency problems negatively influence customer loyalty. Information asymmetry has two discriminantly distinct dimension, quality and timeliness. Low trust amplifies the effects of all asymmetries, whereas relationship duration reduces the effects of only risk asymmetry. Comparison with a three-factor model shows that the four-factor scale is superior. Research limitations/implications - Service firms desiring long-term customer relationships need to be cognisant of potential asymmetries created by salespersons, and develop initiatives to minimise potential fallouts from each asymmetry. These include proper alignment of compensation structures, accurate and timely communications of product information, and matching risk profiles between customers and salespersons. Regular customer feedback regarding perceived asymmetries would also help early problem detection. Finally, the findings would inform the development of policy matters and industry best practices. Originality/value - Besides contributing to the small stream of research that applies AT to marketing, this study is the first to develop and validate an AT scale that incorporates all three asymmetries.

The board of directors plays an important role in corporate governance. It is an internal mechanism that controls and monitors the actions of managers and aligns the utility functions between corporate owners and managers. The board of directors performs multiple functions that concern, for example, the replacement of the managers, financial policy, the preparation of strategic plans and other actions that affect the performance of the company. The board plays an important role since on the one hand it controls the actions of management and on the other it advises the management regarding the strategies to be adopted. In this study, 100 announcements regarding the appointment of the board of directors of 100 Italian listed companies during the period 2012-2014 are investigated. The results show a positive reaction within 20 days around the announcement date. In four of the six time windows, cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are positive and statistically significant. The positive reaction of the market would appear, however, to be linked more to the composition of the board of directors than to the size of the board of directors.

Understanding the value the right chief executive officer selection and tenure choices can bring to an organisation is under researched in legal jurisdictions such as Australia where there is strong separation of the role of the chief executive officer and chairperson. The chief executive officer is the key organisation strategist and plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategy as well as keeping the board of directors informed of the work of the executive team. This paper reviews and synthesises the corporate governance literature to develop the argument that a chief executive officer's professional development background and work context will impact his or her ability to favourably influence organisation performance. A series of research propositions of interest to a range of stakeholders inside and outside the organisation are developed drawing on a number of corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory, stewardship theory). This conceptual paper develops a substantial future empirical research agenda. (c) 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

Purpose: This paper aims to explore organizational structure, efficiency and evolution, and its relationship to bureaucracy. A new mathematical model is utilized to generate theoretically consistent relationships between economic performance and organizational scale and structure, and to develop a taxonomy of organizational structure. Design/methodology/approach: A systems approach is used to model structural evolution and generate consistent, testable hypotheses concerning organizational sustainability and financial performance. This theoretical treatment seeks to reconcile contradictory views of bureaucracy, modeling both positive and negative impacts on performance and behavior. A variant of agency theory is used as an organizing paradigm, based on three competing organizational needs: control, autonomy and ownership of consequences. Findings: Simulations reveal that organizations evolve through five stages of development: from an entry (flat/parallel) stage, through a hybrid or mixed stage, to the massively serial (hierarchical) stage. As firms evolve, the risk/return ratio first falls as employment expands, but later rises as higher levels of hierarchy appear. Eventually, organizational complexity rises sufficiently to produce lower levels of managerial ownership of consequences and professional autonomy, as well as higher levels of control, leading to a collapse of organizational efficiency. A subtle variation of agency theory is revealed: upper-management may maximize organizational depth, increasing salary differences between levels. Originality/value: This paper uses an internally consistent, deductive framework to elucidate relationships between task complexity, skill level, industry life-cycle and firm age - providing the first known attribute-based metric for organizational complexity. This approach is reminiscent of Perrow's (1999) non-mathematical treatment of organizational systems complexity. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Former audit demand studies generally consider wholly family-owned private firms as a homogeneous group of firms that incur minimal agency costs. Family firm literature, however, argues that these firms might incur significant agency costs as well and we therefore examine audit demand in this particular type of firm. As we examine private family firms from the USA, which have no audit requirement, we broaden the concept of audit demand to the demand for auditor services, which encompasses audits, reviews and compilations. Consistent with former audit demand studies, we hypothesise a negative association between management ownership and the demand for auditor services, but only for first-generation private family firms. We hypothesise that this relation turns positive for subsequent generation private family firms due to entrenching behaviour caused by weakened altruistic feelings between the family shareholders. Our results support this hypothesis, but only regarding the demand for reviews and compilations. Therefore, our findings suggest that reviews and compilations seem to be sufficient and more cost-effective in this specific context to mitigate shareholder-manager agency costs compared to more expensive audits. Moreover, results suggest that the level of shareholder-debtholder agency costs do seem to be a driver for the demand for audits. (c) 2014 Taylor & Francis.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate employers' recruitment strategies to address distinct job-related agency problems before establishing an employment relationship. Insights from agency theory and the social embeddedness perspective are combined to hypothesize whether and why employers adapt their recruitment strategies to the job type (differing in level of discretion) for which they are externally hiring. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are empirically tested using data from a survey of 288 Dutch employers. Questions were asked about the two types of jobs. Multi-level logistic regression analysis is applied to investigate the effect of social context on the choice of recruitment strategy. In addition to that, separate analyses are conducted for the two job types, using logistic regression analysis. Findings - As predicted, employers have the tendency to use informal recruitment channels more often for jobs with high degree of discretion (i.e. managerial, professional, and specialists jobs (MPS)) than for jobs with low degree of discretion (i.e. administrative and supporting jobs). In addition, the type of information transmitted through employers' social contacts matters for their recruitment strategies. In particular, the reliable and trustworthy information from contacts with friends and family is more important for MPS jobs. This seems to be the way employers deal with the high agency costs characterizing this type of jobs. Originality/value - This study extends prior research as follows. First, while earlier studies more closely looked at why organizations use formal or informal recruitment, this study specifically focusses on the role the job type plays in the hiring process. Second, it provides an extension of agency theory by including job type in the analyses. And, third, the study examines how the networks of employers, rather than employees, affect the hiring process. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We analyze the presence of activist investors (hedge funds and private equity funds) and their impact on top management turnover in Germany. We contrast two hypotheses. The monitoring hypothesis is based on agency theory. Under this hypothesis, we expect active investors to increase top management turnover as a consequence of their monitoring efforts. Under the restraint hypothesis, we expect active investors to exert little influence on top management turnover in consequence of the comparatively limited discretion they have in Germany due to, e.g., regulatory restraints. We test both hypotheses using an event history analysis based on a sample of top managers in the 100 largest German corporations between 1998 and 2008. Contrary to studies based on agency theory in a US context, and in accordance with the restraint hypothesis, we do not find increased top management turnover under the presence of activist investors. The presence of private equity funds is not associated with any significant influence on turnover, but that of hedge funds may even reduce top management turnover.

In this paper, we use unique features of Pakistan's corporate environment to test information asymmetry and agency theories in explaining dividend smoothing behaviour of firms. Based on a sample of 150 non-financial firms listed at the Karachi Stock Exchange over the period of 1999 to 2012, we find evidence that the degree of dividend smoothing in family firms is lower than the degree of dividend smoothing in non-family firms. Our findings are more in line with the implications of information asymmetry theory. Moreover, our findings suggest that firms in Pakistan follow more flexible dividend policies as compared to developed markets, despite the fact that Pakistan is in classical tax system.

Franchising has become a dominant model of retailing in the Western world and is rapidly expanding in emerging countries. This paper is an attempt to explain the significant differences in the development of franchising in three emerging countries: Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Explanations can be found in the general institutional environment in these countries, including the political and economic environments; governments' willingness to modernize the distribution structures; and the legal and regulatory environments specific to franchising. Our analytical framework is based on institutional theory (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983), a framework that provides further insights beyond the approaches based on economic efficiency (agency theory and the resource scarcity perspective). Based on an analysis of the documents in the major public databases in the three countries, supplemented with field research, we propose an analytical framework that helps explain the uneven developments of franchising in the three North African countries based on the specific institutional environment of each country. This study thus provides empirical evidence supporting the institutional theory of franchise expansion. It appears that institutional theory complements agency theory and resource scarcity theory in explaining the development of franchising in emerging markets: while agency theory and resource scarcity theory explain the motivation of firms to expand internationally through franchising, institutional theory helps explain the success or failure of these firms in the emerging markets they expand to.

Board of director member diversity has an impact on the functions each director successfully provides. Appropriate and necessary board member capabilities differ between small and large firms. Although these differences seem apparent, current research has favored studies related to large firms and neglected those related to board member needs of small firms. Grounded in Agency Theory and Resource Dependence Theory, the following manuscript theoretically suggests that firm size moderates the relationship between board member diversity and the two primary functions (monitoring and the provision of resources) of board members. Furthermore, small firms can enhance performance through appropriate member composition in differing ways than large firms. (c) 2015, Small Business Institute. All rights reserved.

This study seeks to confirm if internal audit, a corporate control process, is functioning effectively in Australian public universities. The study draws on agency theory, published literature and best-practice guidelines to develop an internal audit evaluation framework. A survey instrument is thereafter developed from the framework and used as a basis to examine if internal audit is structured to enhance governance in the Australian public university sector. The results show that a majority of university internal audit functions are operating under flexible structural and functional arrangements to achieve internal audit's theoretical role of enhancing governance. A minority of functions did not comply with best-practice guidelines for achieving internal auditing's theoretical role. The flexible arrangements further do not guarantee internal audit functions currently complying with best-practice guidelines will continue to do so. Contributing factors to non-compliance and flexible operating arrangements include the non-availability of mandatory requirements for compliance by the profession or government legislation. The study provides avenues for further research to confirm the findings with other stakeholders. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

The aim of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of board monitoring mechanisms in Government Linked Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia. Mainly it focuses on how the introduction of the transformation policy, which emphasizes strengthening the board effectiveness, would lead to an improvement in the performance of GLCs. Our study goes further to explain the impact of earnings management on performance as it is opined that the performance of the firm could be affected by the earnings management (EM) practices, and, hence, looking at the performance after stripping away the managed portion of performance could provide more accurate results concerning the impact of corporate governance on performance. Using regression analysis, the findings of the study showed that the adjusted R2 increased from 14.8% to 26.8% (between the pre-transformation and post-transformation models). In addition, more corporate governance variables were found to be significant in the post-transformation model (i.e. board independence and board meetings). More importantly, the significance of the variables are as predicted in the hypotheses, thus lending support for the argument of the agency theory. This study has recognized a few limitations. First, the main limitation of the study is that the data were collected through publicly available data which include annual reports and other databases such as Bloomberg. Other data such as qualitative information could be helpful to gain more insight concerning the issue of the effectiveness of the transformation policy. Second, although we are using all available data for the Malaysian GLCs, the sample size of 35 companies could still be considered as a small sample size for generalization purpose. The government, in its role of regulating the corporate governance for GLCs, could gain an insight from the results of the study, thereby providing empirical support for the development of new regulations and recommendations, and takes the necessary corrective decisions regarding the effectiveness of the transformation policy. The paper provides further evidence concerning the relationship between performance and corporate governance mechanisms. Specifically, it looks into such a relationship within the Malaysian GLCs after the introduction of the transformation programme. The results of the study are more accurate for interpretation as the measure of performance has deducted the portion of managed earnings. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The weak corporate governance framework in Indonesia, as in other countries in Southeast Asia, was deemed a crucial factor in deepening the financial and economic crisis in the late 1990s. Over a decade after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries have made substantial governance reforms. The reform measures of the institutional framework, both in the public and corporate sectors, were intended to transform Indonesia into a clean, transparent, and accountable country. While the reforms have resulted in increased political stability, improved government effectiveness, and a more conducive investment climate, corruption remains a major concern in Indonesia. This study aims to evaluate how corporate governance mechanisms can reduce the opportunities for corruption. By utilizing agency theory, we argue that a strong corporate governance institutional framework helps to reduce a country's level of corruption. We focus attention on three components of corporate governance mechanisms, i.e., shareholder rights, the quality of the board of directors (BoD), and appropriate accounting and auditing standards, including transparency standards. In an attempt to strengthen corporate governance standards and practices in Indonesia, we conducted a comparative study among Southeast Asian middle-income countries, i.e., Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. We rely on accessible secondary data such as corporate governance codes, laws, and regulations. Our study concludes that the Indonesian corporate governance institutional framework is less stringent compared to Malaysia and Thailand. This condition provides a favorable environment for corruption to persist because the standards and practices are less demanding and the companies do not necessarily have to comply with the existing regulatory framework.

This paper contributes to the emerging field of business transfer studies by providing qualitative, in-depth evidence on the role of intermediaries at different stages of the transfer process. Building on the resource-based view of the firm and agency theory, this paper identifies the specific resources different types of intermediaries offer small businesses in the transfer process. Further, it explores the role of intermediaries in managing risk and uncertainty in the interaction between buyer and seller. The results suggest that small business owners may need to navigate the use of a variety of intermediaries throughout different times leading-up-to and throughout the business transfer process. Finally, opportunities for further research are explored. (c) 2015 Taylor & Francis.

By using fixed-effects panel regression, we model cash holdings for agribusiness firms during the 1970-2012 period. The results suggest that agribusiness firms manage cash in a manner consistent with the precautionary theory of caution management. Specifically, agribusiness firms hold cash to quickly execute growth opportunities and limit transaction costs of acquiring capital for growth. Furthermore, a subset of cash-rich agribusiness firms, which concentrates 78.5% of the aggregate cash and 49% of total revenues, is analyzed with a logit model. Results of cash-rich agribusiness deviate from predictions by the precautionary theory. This finding has potential implications for structural changes in this sector.

This study analyzes the relationship between board size and economic-financial performance in a sample of European firms that constitute the EUROSTOXX50 Index. Based on previous literature, resource dependency and agency theories, and considering regulation developed by the OECD and European Union on the normative of corporate governance for each country in the sample, the authors propose the hypotheses of both positive linear and quadratic relationships between the researched parameters. Using ROA as a benchmark of financial performance and the number of members of the board as measurement of the board size, two OLS estimations are performed. To confirm the robustness of the results the empirical study is tested with two other similar financial ratios, ROE and Tobin's Q. Due to the absence of significant results, an additional factor, firm size, is employed in order to check if it affects firm performance. Delving further into the nature of this relationship, it is revealed that there exists a strong and negative relation between firm size and financial performance. Consequently, it can be asseverated that the generic recommendation "one size fits all" cannot be applied in this case; which conforms to the Recommendations of the European Union that dissuade using generic models for all countries.

There is a lack of scholarly research into long-term local organizing committee (LOC) budget forecasts in the bidding stages of a FIFA World Cup. As FIFA increasingly takes control of LOC revenues and contributes to the LOC's costs, the bid committees are adopting a strategy to distort their budgets. On the one hand, this situation encourages committees to underestimate their budgets to give FIFA the impression that greater profits can be achieved, prospectively leading to a better bidding position. On the other hand, an underestimated budget means that potential shortcomings need to be covered by taxpayers' money. For this reason, our research aim is twofold. First, we will shed light on the size of an LOC budget by conducting a benchmarking analysis that demonstrates the complexity of the LOC budget and illustrates the many different ways in which previous hosts have compiled their budgets. Expert interviews verify that the size of the LOC budget plays a strategic role in the bidding process. Secondly, we will discuss the political constraints on forecasting an LOC budget based on games theory and agency theory. The article explains the ex-ante and ex-post opportunism of the LOCs in terms of their budget prognosis and how FIFA reacts to these behavioral patterns. (c) 2015 Cognizant Comm. Corp.

This article develops a framework for understanding growth in executive remuneration and its increasing divergence from average earnings since a 1980s turning point, drawing on studies from a range of countries but with a special focus on Australian evidence. This framework emphasises the central roles played by company size, to which power is intrinsically related; the distinct, asymmetric nature of the 'bargaining' relationship in executive labour markets; and institutions that reflect seven rules. A corporation's status depends in part on its chief executive officer's status and pay. Chief executive officers' ability to extract rents is influenced by their social capital. Chief executive officer pay is heavily influenced by relative pay deprivation. Institutions emerge to facilitate dual-asymmetric pattern bargaining. The incentive structure of executive pay adjusts over time to minimise downside risk, justify high growth and deflect shareholder concerns. Different norms shape pay in different segments, though cross-segment references will be made to justify increases. Finally, chief executive officers' ability to ratchet pay upwards is contested, leading to cycles of asymmetries reflecting the social, political and economic climate and balance of power.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to help firms to create competitiveness by developing marketing capabilities. It analyzes how the component and architectural competences affect and enhance market orientation and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - Built on the theories of organizational capability, knowledge creation, and market orientation, this research develops the contents of marketing capabilities, including component and architectural competences that contribute to marketing capability by responding to external changes, and analyzes their influence on market orientation and firm performance. Findings - The study reveals the following effective marketing capabilities which benefit to marketing performance. First, hiring and retaining employees with higher professional, local, and specific knowledge. Second, firms with higher tacit knowledge enhance market orientation. Third, arranging employees into teamwork to implement marketing tasks. Fourth, assigning employees into small-scale experiments on creative proposals. Fifth, standardizing procedures of generation, dissemination, and response of marketing intelligence. Sixth, providing written market information and training programs to non-marketing staff. Seventh, appropriately delegating to staff. Eighth, establishing apprenticeship among the staff to deliver experiential know-how. Research limitations/implications - From a dynamic capability perspective, this research construct the two kinds of marketing competences and examine their effect on market orientation and firm performance. For further understanding the complementary effects of marketing capabilities, market orientation, and synergistic performance, a larger sample data (e.g. product, market share, sales, characteristics of staff, firm, and knowledge, etc.) and objective evaluation are encouraged. Otherwise, from the viewpoint of agency theory, the incentive system should also be discussed. Practical implications - This research has potentially significant implications for knowledge management and marketing management fields as well as managerial practice. The results suggest the importance of marketing capability for market orientation and firm performance. Originality/value - Marketing resources and marketing capabilities are significant drivers of firm performance, and their impact is greater when they are complementary to each other. This study takes the perspectives of organizational capabilities and market orientation to find out the factors which contribute to marketing capability and performance. This study provides practitioners with a framework for analyzing marketing capabilities as an object of improving firm performance by creating market orientation. Furthermore, this research empirically introduced strategic specific competence (tacit knowledge and autonomy) into the model and tests their effect of market orientation and firm performance.

Despite their alleged communication, control, coordination, and learning-related benefits, little is known of factors that affect language policies in multinational corporations (MNCs). In this paper, I draw on agency theory to focus on the effect of MNC subsidiary top manager nationality on subsidiary language policy. Specifically, I hypothesize that subsidiaries with expatriate top managers have more language policies than subsidiaries with host country national top managers. In addition, I hypothesize that subsidiary age and size moderate the effect between subsidiary top manager nationality and language policy, such that older and larger subsidiaries with expatriate top managers have more language policies than younger and smaller subsidiaries. Survey data from 547 subsidiaries in Japan provide support for these hypotheses. Theoretical implications and suggestions for future research are provided. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on agency theory, this paper investigates the determinants of voluntary audit committee (AC) formation among non-bank firms listed on the Palestine Stock Exchange (PSE). We used the annual reports of nearly all non-bank companies listed on the PSE as well as the company guides issued by the PSE for the period between 2010 and 2012. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the influence of a set of corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structures and company characteristics on the voluntary formation of ACs among non-bank Palestinian firms. The result of the analysis demonstrated that the AC is influenced by foreign ownership, institutional ownership, board diligence and external auditor type. This paper adds to the limited AC literature in Middle Eastern countries in general and in the Arab World in particular. This paper not only examines the determinants of the voluntary formation of ACs but also attempts to theorise about this formation.

This study provides an overview of the research in the field of agency theory and corporate governance. This research is aimed to extend existing research contributes to the agency theory literature and particularly, the growing body of literature of corporate governance mechanisms. The agency theory suggests that corporate governance can reduce agency costs which in turn leads to improved firm performance. The problem that occurs is known as the principal-agent problem where two parties, the principal and the agent. The separation of ownership and control in the open financial system can result in the agency problem between management and shareholders. The separation of control and ownership in corporations has caused agency problems and a series of corporate governance mechanisms have been implemented to mitigate them. The primary objective of corporate governance can play an important role in minimizing the agency problem and ensuring that management's interests are aligned with those of shareholders. The agency theory implies that the board of directors is elected to manage the potential conflict of interests between management and shareholders. (c) Medwell Journals, 2015.

We study the relationship between the types of issuer and the contents of the governance codes in the new-institutional theory, using a global sample of over 70 national governance codes. We hypothesise that the code recommendations are influenced by the isomorphic pressure to embrace new social practices, exerted by the different types of issuer. The findings show that codes issued involving multiple stakeholder groups and organisations in hybrid committees are more likely to: 1) include recommendations that take into account multiple political and social institutional demands; 2) adapt the mainstream agency-theory-based governance model to the national setting. Overall, the policy-making negotiations among different stakeholder groups in the local institutional setting appear to be determinant in shaping the recommendations of the code and in improving the promotion of good governance among firms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically investigate the relationship between the types of issuer and the contents of codes, in a global sample.

Using resource-based logic as well as stewardship and agency theories, we address a paradox when governing young firms-how to design governance structures to encourage top managers to generate rents while minimizing the threat of rent appropriation. Some corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) enhance empowerment and encourage managers to generate rents for the firm. But these CGMs may also allow managers to appropriate rents excessively. The solution appears to be combining CGMs that empower managers to generate rents with CGMs that either (a) motivate stewardship behavior or (b) reduce information asymmetry between management and other stakeholders. Our empirical analyses provide substantial support for our predictions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This study examines the moderation effects of corporate governance provisions on the link between family involvement (i.e., family ownership and family management) in publicly-traded firms and firm performance by drawing upon agency theory, with a focus on principal-principal agency issues, and the extant family governance literature. We develop and test the hypotheses on 386 of the S&P 500 firms longitudinally. Findings support the hypotheses suggesting the moderation effects of the use of provisions (a) protecting controlling owners in terms of their sustainability of controlling status, and (b) protecting management legally on the inverted U-shaped relationship between family ownership and firm performance. We also found support for the moderation effects of provisions (c) protecting controlling owners in terms of their voting rights, (d) protecting noncontrolling owners, and (e) protecting management monetarily on the inverted U-shaped relationship between family management and firm performance. By this, our study provides empirical support for the principal-principal agency perspective on the corporate governance in publicly-traded family firms. As such, it suggests new avenues of research for both the corporate governance literature, as well as for the theory of the family firm. Our study also offers insights to policy directed toward monitoring the actions of large shareholders such as family and enhancing the overall shareholder value in publicly-traded family firms.

This study examines the association between corporate governance mechanisms and corporate disclosure in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Hypotheses based on agency theory and organisational power literature are developed and tested on 85 firms listed in Dubai and Abu Dhabi stock exchanges. The study also runs multiple regression tests on two sub-samples (46 financial firms and 39 non-financial firms) in order to provide a richer analysis for the empirical findings. Overall, the results show that the extent of firms' disclosure is positively associated with the number of board committees, debt finance, firm size and firm profitability, while it is negatively related to CEO power. This study's findings direct policymakers attention to the importance of: the composition of the board, the optimal size of the board, governing the type of knowledge required for board members, and revisiting the level of foreign ownership in UAE firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the implications on former accounting firm partners becoming employees of a publicly owned accounting corporation, the responses of the former partners and impacts on the acquiring company. Partners of accounting and other professional service firms selling their firms to publicly owned companies often remain with the acquiring company as employees and receive company shares as consideration for their firms. Agency theory suggests public ownership will result in changes to the roles of senior professionals with potential resistance and motivation consequences. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a case study approach involving the review of publicly available information and interviews with executives and senior professionals of an Australian publicly owned accounting company, Stockford Limited. Findings: The Stockford case indicates that selling their firm to a publicly owned company can have significant negative implications for accounting firm partners. The former partners struggled to adapt to their new roles as senior professional employees and shareholders. Their responses had significant impacts on company performance, which ultimately contributed to the collapse of the company, thus reflecting the power senior professionals retain regardless of the change of ownership form. Research limitations/implications: Care is required when generalising findings of a single case to other professions and other geographic jurisdictions. Practical implications: This paper has significant implications for entrepreneurs and executives consolidating professional service firms, partners considering selling their firms and investors in publicly owned professional service firms. Originality/value: Despite the emergence of publicly owned accounting and other professional service companies and the importance and power of senior professionals in professional service firms, this is the first study to explore the implications on senior professionals of selling their firms to public companies.

Compensation not only provides incentives to an existing manager but also affects the type of manager attracted to the firm. This paper examines the dual incentive and sorting effects of performance pay in a simple contracting model of endogenous participation. Unless the manager is highly risk averse, sorting dampens optimal pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) because PPS beyond a nominal amount transfers unnecessary (information) rent to the manager. This helps explain why empirical estimates of PPS are much lower than predictions from models of moral hazard alone. The model also predicts that sorting under asymmetric information causes the firm to turn away more candidates than would be efficient; PPS increases in the cost of hiring the manager and in the manager's outside option, but decreases in output risk, information risk, and managerial risk aversion; and the firm becomes more selective in hiring as either the manager's outside option, the cost of hiring, risk aversion, output risk, or information risk increases.

Entrepreneurship is considered as an engine for bringing about positive changes in the form of socioeconomic welfare (Kortum and Lerner 2000). However, it is a well-established fact that, one of the major constraints faced by entrepreneurs is access to finance. Self-financing is usually not sufficient and collateral-based debt funding is not always available. Information asymmetries prevailing between investors and entrepreneurs, uncertainty related to the future of the product, and bleak exit prospects of the investor severely curtail a new venture's prospects of receiving finance (Chan, 1983; Amit et al. 1990). In recent years, equity financing in terms of venture capital has emerged as one of the alternative sources of financing for new ventures. The most accepted form of definition for venture capital includes investment in young firms which are very risky but promise a great return. (Gompers et al. 1998). Recent research in venture capital indicates a trend toward venture capitalists' preference toward late stage deals (e.g., Gompers and Lerner 2001). Since a large volume of venture capital is flowing into growth stage firms, it becomes essential to understand the various factors that venture capitalists consider before investing in a particular firm which is in its growth stage. Earlier research has focused mostly on analyzing the criteria used by venture capitalists to select a new venture based on human capital, attractiveness of markets, uniqueness of products etc. However, this chapter seeks to identify the various financial indicators that venture capitalists consider before funding growth firms. One way to do this is to analyze the capital structure of firms which receive venture financing later. The basic objective of this chapter is to understand whether the determinant of capital structure of a firm has a major role to play in the access of venture capital later in its life cycle. The finance literature comprises of numerous studies that focus on the determinants of capital structure of firms. However, there do not exist many studies which talk about the determinants of capital structure of a firm which is financed by venture capital. This chapter is based on the Indian context. It uses the static trade-off theory, pecking order theory, and agency theory to explain the financial structure of firms which receive venture capital subsequently. This chapter draws from the capital structure literature to carve out the variables, i.e., tangible assets, profitability, size, volatility, growth opportunities etc. that affect the capital structure of firms which receive venture financing later. Propositions are drawn on the basis of this reasoning and a conceptual framework is put forth that tries to identify an optimal capital structure strategy for Indian growth firms that seek venture capital.

The audit function has an important role in the corporate mechanism especially by extra value conferred to the governance process; thus, over time, this issue was debated assiduously in a series of studies and researches on information transparency at the level of companies. The purpose of this article is to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the audit committee (as a guarantor of quality internal audit) and the financial performance, the quality of the portfolio, the solvency and the own funds in the Romanian banking system. Thus, concentrating attention on the features of the audit committee, the authors of this article tried to find answers motivated by the empirical analysis results to the general question: how the various recorded features of the audit committee performance influences the banking system, what is the value added by the quality of internal audit at the level of credit institutions? In order to test the formulated hypotheses, the used research methodology is mainly quantitative, based on the statistical analysis, deductive, and having as starting point in the agency theory, as the objective testing possible links from cause - effect, and analysing the significance level thereof.

The purpose of this study is to examine the empirical relationship between insider ownership and firm performance. Based on resource dependence theory, this study argues that the positive convergence-of-interests effect and the negative entrenchment effect can coexist in various industrial settings. Fixed-effect panel data regression models are applied to a sample of 1,156 effective observations. To reflect the contextual role of resources, we defined industrial settings along with industrial complexity and firm scale dimensions. The empirical results supported our research hypotheses, showing that insider ownership exerts a positive effect on firm performance in a high-complexity and large-scale setting, but a negative effect in a low-complexity and smallscale setting. The results of this study imply that contextual fitness must be deliberately considered to determine effective regulations of corporate governance. In addition, this study contributes a new aspect to related discussion, which synthesizes conflicting theoretical arguments by introducing the contextual role of resources. (c) 2015, CIBER Institute.

The emerging Chinese hotel market offers clear opportunities for online travel agents (OTAs). The distribution landscape has been reshaped as a result of recent technological advancements and new emerging players. This study examines how OTAs operate in the Chinese market and their relationship with hotels from an agency theory perspective. Data were collected from secondary sources using keyword searches from January 2013 to May 2014. The findings indicate that hotels have little negotiating power with OTAs, and consequently the OTAs play a dominant role in their relationship with hotels. Meanwhile, the competition between OTAs is more intense than the competition between OTAs and hotels due to recent technological advancements and the intervention of Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent in the Chinese OTA market.

This study examines how organizational form (corporate or franchised store) and local market characteristics (competition, size and risk of sanctions) influence retail stores' likelihood of selling alcohol to minors. Drawing on agency theory, we hypothesize that franchised stores are more likely than corporate stores to sell alcohol to minors. We also examine whether local market competition, risk of sanctions, and market size influence the relationship between franchising and alcohol sales to minors. We test the hypotheses with data collected by minors attempting to purchase alcohol in retail stores. The results offer partial support to the theoretical predictions and have implications for retail chains and regulators. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Existing research suggests that internal and external corporate governance mechanisms substitute for one another to mitigate agency problems in bidding firms. This paper tests whether the interaction between these mechanisms is more complementary. Research Findings/Insights: While there is evidence for disciplinary responses to bids for unrelated targets involving strategic retrenchment and significant asset divestment, the influence of the information conveyed by this characteristic on the likelihood of post-abandonment discipline is not amplified when boards are less independent. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The results suggest that certain characteristics are used to distinguish between abandoned bidders which require discipline and those that do not. However, our findings do not suggest that interaction between internal and external governance mechanisms is contingent on board independence. Instead, these interactions between shareholders and boards seem to be contingent on a range of company, industry, and situation-specific factors. Practitioner/Policy Implications: While policy in the UK has focused on board independence as a means of effective corporate governance, our results suggest that this is not a panacea. Effective governance involves active owners, communicating their interests to boards, and boards responding accordingly. Further encouragement of such communication before, during, and after acquisitions will improve signals to managers that shareholders can target the necessary discipline of those whom they perceive to need it most.

This article examines factors influencing the creation of budgetary slack under budget-based incentive schemes. Classical agency theory serves as the starting point, with the dual role of budgeting as a planning and a motivational instrument. Under the assumption of fully rational utility maximizers, people should incorporate the maximum amount of budgetary slack possible given budget-related compensation. However, this behavior cannot be observed in reality or in experimental settings. Therefore, two important questions remain partially unanswered with regard to explaining the phenomenon of budgetary slack: First, why do individuals not maximize their own utility through budgetary slack? And, second, why is budgetary slack not eliminated completely due to reasons leading to the first question? Behavioral accounting research in this area has gained significant importance in the last years. In this domain, we focus on studies employing the psychological theories of social preferences, organizational justice, and moral disengagement and present primarily experimental as well as survey-based field research findings. The analysis leads to suggestions for further research in this area. (c) 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

This paper investigates if there is a relationship between managerial ownership and firm performance in selected firms listed on the JSE, and if so, what that relationship is. The study conducts regression analyses over a sample of 23 retail sector firms, observing data stretching from 2010 to 2013. The results are found to be robust. The results suggest that the hypothesis that a positive relationship exists between managerial ownership and performance be rejected as a negative relationship is found. Instead, the results of a two-stage least squares (2SLS) analysis find that managerial ownership does not impact firm performance in any direction. Overall the results of the study do not support the agency theory, as aligning the interests of managers and shareholders does not improve firm performance, at least within the retail sector.

Purpose: This paper aims to study the determinants of variable compensation for top Portuguese executives (chief executive officers, chief financial officers and commercial directors).Design/methodology/approach: Data from 101 firms were collected through an email questionnaire sent to the human resource directors of 500 largest and best Portuguese firms of Exame, a business newspaper. A Tobit regression analysis was used to estimate the basic equation of the study.Findings: The conclusions are generally consistent with findings obtained in more developed capital markets. It was found that public and older corporations are more intensive users of variable pay, consistent with the agency theory prediction. A location in the centre of economic activity and a higher executive education increase the propensity to receive higher levels of salary in the form of variable compensation. The relation between compensation and performance was more elusive.Research limitations/implications: There are limitations as to the extrapolation of the obtained results, as the level of potential idiosyncrasy cannot be measured. Ideally, the study should be replicated in different contexts to control for country-specific influences. Nevertheless, the main finding that performance-related pay mechanisms are less used in countries where public corporations and potential agency problems are less pervasive should hold.Originality/value: As the focus is on a small economy with a developing capital market, this paper contributes to executive compensation literature that has mostly analysed firms based in well-developed capital markets, with a higher separation of ownership and control (Anglo-Saxon countries).

The intellectual underpinning of much contemporary executive pay practice is to be found in agency theory, made famous by various scholars in the 1970s. Yet standard agency theory has been found wanting in various respect and has been criticised for supporting pay practices which may have contributed to the financial crisis. The Economic Psychology of Incentives proposes a revised theory of agency, drawing on ideas from behavioural economics and built on more robust assumptions about human behaviour than the standard principal-agent model. Incorporating evidence from a unique empirical study of executives from around the world, the book explains the mechanisms which link the performance of an individual senior executive, the performance of other executives who are part of the same top-management team, and corporate performance. The book proposes new design principles for executive pay, but also explains the difficulties in changing current executive pay practices. (c) Alexander Pepper 2015.

The impact of family ownership on strategic decision-making and diversifi cation in public corporations is an important but not clearly understood aspect of modern corporate governance. In many cases, large-block family owners of public corporations may have a great deal of input in strategic decision-making in large corporations. Previous literature investigates how ownership structure and diversifi cation are connected, but conclusions are not homogeneous. Agency theory suggests that professional managers are fundamentally self-interested, and the public corporation diversifi es because managers pursue their own interests, rather than the interest of shareholders. However in family fi rms, ownership and control use to coincide and family diversifi cation decisions which causes a lower diversifi cation. In this paper authors analyzes the impact of ownership concentration and the infl uence of ultimate owner's nature of business group (family or non-family) in diversifi cation's decision: specialization, related diversifi cation, unrelated diversifi cation and mixed diversifi cation (when a company uses both related and unrelated diversifi cation) Based on a sample of ninety-nine Spanish listed companies during the years 2000-2005, and using the listed company an their subsidiaries (pyramidal group) as unit of analysis, this research fi nds: fi rstly, the highest ownership concentration increases the adoption of specialization strategies and reduce the mixed diversifi cation; Secondly, attending to ultimate owner's nature, family fi rms adopt more strategies of specialization and related diversifi cation, and less diversifi cation strategies than nonfamily fi rms; Finally, results also show behaviour differences in family fi rms according to ownership concentration's degree: an increasing ownership concentration's degree in family fi rms rises the probability of diversifi cation.

The audit function plays a particularly important role as part of the corporate mechanism, due to the extra value it provides with the corporate governance, which is why, over the years, this issue has been assiduously studied and became the topic of numerous studies and analyses. The objective of this article is to provide an analysis of the potential relationships between the quality of external audit (assessed through membership to the Big Four: the largest four auditing firms, namely PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte) and financial performance (assessed by profitability, assets quality and solvency) of the banking system in Romania. Hence, the authors tried to find answers, advocated by the results of the conducted empirical analysis, to the following questions: "Does the quality of external audit affects the financial performance of banks in Romania? How is registered the added value of external audit quality at credit institutions level?" In order to test the assumptions made, it was used a predominantly quantitative research methodology, which is based on a deductive statistical analysis. The starting point is agency theory, the main objective is to test and identify the potential cause-effect relationships, while analyzing their significance weight. As a result of this research, it can be concluded that there is a positive correlation between external audit quality and financial performance of the credit institutions in the Romanian banking system, although it is not a significant one.

In the main, project management subscribes to an objective view of the organisation, relatively free of political and psychosocial tensions. But, this may be misleading in the context of projects where the stakes are numerous and complex. The article views the project from three perspectives: the conventional rational perspective, with the prism of the mandate; the atypical political perspective, with the prism of the principals; and the atypical psychosocial perspective, with the prism of the agents. It emerges that the rational perspective may be sufficient to assess and manage a project when efficiency prevails in both the parent and the client organisations. However, the project manager would be better served to use an integrative approach that also includes the political perspective when the organisations involved have differing expectations regarding the project, as well as the psychosocial perspective when project team members have a great deal of autonomy.

The Shariah law makes Amanah (trustworthiness) a fundamental obligation for all the contractual parties. From the agency theory perspective, we, thus, investigate managerial trustworthiness in capital structure decisions of Shariah firms and compare it with those of Non-Shariah firms, in the light of Islamic principle of Amanah (trustworthiness). Specifically, we examine whether capital structure of Shariah firms is partially influenced by managerial ownership under the motivation of self-interest. Using the data from Pakistan, our results show that, unlike Non-Shariah firms, leverage ratios in Shariah firms are insensitive to the varying degree of managerial ownership, indicating absence of managerial opportunism in financial decisions of these firms. For the Non-Shariah firms, on the other hand, our results confirm findings of previous research which reveal that managers manipulate leverage ratios in their own interestat the cost of firm value, indicating the severity of agency conflicts among these firms. Invoking agency theory, we argue that certain firm characteristics (such as lower free cash-flows and lesser liquidity), achieved through Shariah compliance, help Shariah firms mitigate agency conflicts. These features persuade managers to behave less opportunistically than their counterparts in Non-Shariah firms as shown from their financing choices. The results are important for understanding nature of the two types of firms studied and the cross-sectional differences between the capital structure choices of these firms. Besides, our findings have also implications for growing number of Shariah compliant firms and a new clientele of Islamic investors who have entered capital markets due to the Islamic image of Shariah firms in Muslim majority country like Pakistan.

This paper explores whether the performance of publicly-listed family-controlled firms in Malaysia is related to the extent of the families' ownership. It also explores whether there are any moderating effects from the various attributes of board independence on the ownership-performance relationship of these firms. The findings indicate that increasing families' ownership is related to better firm performance under the condition that the families do not have absolute ownership and control over their firms. However, giving more control via majority ownership that causes the families to become the only dominant party might enhance their ability to expropriate and cause firm performance to deteriorate. Therefore, proposal to increase ownership as a mean to reduce the classical agency-theory problems should be caveated under the principal-principal perspective. It is also found that the various board independence attributes do not exhibit any moderating influence on the family ownership-firm performance relationship. This finding may indicate the powerlessness of the boards of director in Malaysia when encountered with the influential controlling families whom the directorship tenures and opportunities of the non-family directors depend on. Decisions made by the controlling families which have bearing on firm performance may not have been effectively counter checked by the boards due to the lack of truly independent nature of the boards.

New concerns have been raised in Iberoamerica regarding the effectiveness of universities, especially in terms of their quality. It is an undisputed premise that the management of university governance is one of the determining factors to improve administrative tasks and, from there, academic duties. The purpose of this work is to make an analysis based on the Agency Theory (AT) as an estimate that may help detect and correct management problems in university governance, understanding that it is a theoretical drift and not a doctrinal one. In order to achieve this purpose, more than a hundred texts and papers published in internationally recognized academic journals were reviewed. As relevant findings, it is possible to highlight the identification and reflection about determining elements and factors considered by the AT , which are applicable to the world of university management (GU, by its Spanish acronym).

This study highlights differences across Islamic and conventional banks, with a particular focus on the determinants of their capital structure. Islamic finance surely forbids debt-based funding but it is an open question whether Islamic banks prefer internal funds or external resources. The study provides empirical support for the fact that Islamic banks, in contrast to their conventional peers, rely more on their own equity rather than on external finance including loss-profit-sharing deposits. The analysis also puts in evidence that Islamic and conventional banks can be differentiated on the basis of assets tangibility and dividend payout and not in terms of profitability, asset liquidity and credit default. Among these factors, only profitability and size influence the equity-to-asset ratio in both kinds of banks. Copyright (c) 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study examines multi-year dynamic response of CEO compensation to firm performance. Multi-period agency theories posit that the CEO's current performance can be compensated both today and tomorrow. This study investigates the dynamic view of CEO pay and firm performance by using partial adjustment models of CEO pay. We find that target pay levels are set on "long-run" past firm performance and that the deviation of the actual pay level causes near-complete convergence to the target in one year. Overall, the findings here indicate that a pay-for-contemporaneous-only-performance relationship significantly understates the incentive effects of CEO pay. (c) by author(s).

We examine whether a dual distribution system that uses both franchisor-operated and franchisee-operated outlets reduces a franchisor's information disadvantage when contracting with franchisee retailers. Using detailed qualitative and quantitative managerial data, we find persuasive evidence of the strategic use of performance information obtained from franchisor-operated outlets to reduce information asymmetry and enhance contracting efficiency for franchisee-operated outlets. We test whether the proximity of franchisor-operated retail outlets to franchisee-operated retail outlets reduces underpricing of quasi-franchise contracts. Our results accord with the proposition that information asymmetry reduces contracting efficiency and are consistent with our prediction that a manufacturer can reduce intrinsic information asymmetry by maintaining franchisor-operated outlets that are geographically proximate to the franchisee-operated outlets, and that this improves the franchisor's pricing of franchising contracts. We conclude that dual distribution reduces the franchisor's information asymmetry and increases their contract pricing efficiency. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Nonprofit organizations play a role in the creation of a society that is civil, and it is an important one that neither the state nor for-profit organizations undertake. This raises the question of governance and accountability, which is often addressed by looking to agency-based models from the private sector. The acknowledged problem is that the agency's notion of owners does not translate well to nonprofits. Adapting the concept of leasehold (wherein the managers and organization operate with broad autonomy, using resources supplied by supporters in exchange for the promise that specific societal value will be created, and are accountable for doing so) allows for a more flexible and responsive arrangement. It also suggests a mechanism whereby many independent nonprofits taking multiple approaches help civil society evolve. (c) 2015 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate whether firm-level corporate governance has an influence on the equity financing patterns in an emerging economy such as Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach - The regression framework uses a questionnaire survey-based corporate governance index (CGI) comprising five dimensions - ownership structures, shareholder rights, independence and responsibilities of the board and management, financial reporting and disclosures and responsibility towards stakeholders. In addition, a number of semi-structured interviews have been carried out with the relevant stakeholders. Findings - The results suggest a statistically significant positive relationship between CGI and equity capital and, thus, confirm the prediction of the agency theory. Research limitations/implications - This study does not address endogeneity and reverse causality issues with respect to the relationship between CGI and equity finance. Practical implications - Firms should improve their legal compliance and voluntary activism in corporate governance matters to ensure increased access to equity finance. Originality/value - This study is among the first to examine the relationship between overall corporate governance quality and equity finance of a firm from the perspective of a bank-based emerging economy.

A number of family business researches affirm benefits of family involvement to the business while some of other studies assure only detriments of family involvement. When comparative studies of family businesses begin to surface on the family involvement in business, there is that irritating question on what effect is brought about by family involvement to the business. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore business advantages and disadvantages generated by family involvement in businesses in Sri Lanka. The present study attempted to address the above knowledge gap, using qualitative research approach and multiple case studies as the strategy of inquiry. Purposive sampling technique was used to select both cases and respondents. Privately held, successfully conducted four family businesses were selected as cases and, existing business owner and one family related manager from each case were taken as respondents. Data was collected mainly via semi-structured, in depth interviews, observations, and secondary documents. Data collection from interviews consisted of 15 interviews with 09 different people from four cases. Before the data analysis, coding and categorization of respondents' views from interviews helped to identify common patterns and themes from both within the case and across cases. The analysis was carried out in the light of Agency Theory and resulted in a rich understanding of business advantages and disadvantages of family involvement in businesses in Sri Lanka. The findings of this study indicated that the agency cost is created not only on business matters but also on family matters. Further, findings revealed that agency benefit also can be obtained by family business by handling the family matters carefully in line with business matters. Findings of this study clearly indicated that an extension to Agency Theory is required to explain owner agent relationship in family businesses.

The spate of scandals and the financial crisis in the recent past has resuscitated the interest of academicians and regulators in the subject of corporate governance. Since corporates employ several governance (agency-conflict controlling) mechanisms at one point of time and board independence is one of them, the central accent in this research is upon the investigation of determinants of corporate board independence in Indian institutional context. By counting on several model specifications, modulations, proxies and operationalizations, regression estimates discloses that inside ownership, leverage, dividend payout policy, institutional ownership and firm growth have a significant bearing on the level of board independence. The denouements of firm size and board affiliation level have also been recognized while analyzing the determinants of board independence. Overall, the outcomes of the empirical analysis have invigorated the applicability of agency theory standpoints in Indian context. Moreover, these findings have profound implications for corporate governance research and have also been able to abate the diversity in empirical evidences of performance consequences of board independence.

Financial accounting is a heavily regulated area in modern economies. Financial accounting standards have grown steadily and describe in great detail the financial statement representation of transactions that firms undertake and events that affect their net worth. The financial statements are audited by independent accounting experts who attest that they present fairly the financial condition of the firm. Auditors themselves are subject to auditing standards and to oversight by their peers and government institutions. The audit committee in the board of directors oversees the accounting processes and the audit of the financial statements. Many countries operate accounting enforcement institutions to ensure compliance of the audited financial statements with the rules and to impose sanctions. Finally, investors and other parties can sue firms before court if they made decisions based on erroneous financial information by the firm. (c) 2015 Stewart Jones.

This study analyzes the degree of compliance in disclosures according to International Accounting Standard 16 "Tangible Fixed Assets" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the companies listed on the Euronext Lisbon, for the period 2005-2010, as well as their evolution and determination of potential corporate factors that explain this degree of compliance. By using a compliance index, a middle intermediate degree of compliance of the requirements for disclosure in accordance with IAS 16 (67.3%) was found. The experience in the application of these regulations had a positive impact, although it was not significant. Based on a literature review and the concepts of the Agency Theory, the Political Costs Theory, the Signaling Theory, and the Capital Theory, six hypotheses were developed in order to explain the degree of compliance already mentioned. Results show that the company's size and the amount of tangible fixed assets are corporate factors that explain the degree of compliance of the disclosure requirements stated in IAS 16.

The systemic banking crisis in 2008 led to the quasi-nationalisation of two UK listed banks: The Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group (National Audit Office, 2010). Using property rights and agency theory as the theoretical frameworks, this paper analyses whether the quasi-nationalisation of these banks has been successful. It is argued that as a rescue mechanism, quasi-nationalisation was a positive development. However, questions arise over its effect as an instrument of banking reform. The State's arm's length approach to management represents a lost opportunity to change the culture of profitability over people that contributed to the banking crisis.

Management buyout (MBO) is a specialized form of acquisition with different motives. Sometimes, there are initiatives taken by the senior management to bailout the firm from sickness. The predominant agency theory focuses only on the governance issues in the MBO firms and this theory can be applied to understand how managerial discretion can play vital roles in mitigating value destruction in the post-MBO firm. A CEOled MBO is presumed to be greed-driven (Bebchuk, L., Cremers, M. Peyer, U. (2011). The CEO pay slice. Journal of Financial Economics, 102, 199SOH221.). But a senior management team-led MBO is said to be a socialistic move. By default, MBOs are debt-driven, unless the buying management team is financially affluent, which may be rare, considering the price for the buyout. Private equity (PE) players play a dominant role in providing and or arranging funds in the form of equity and or debt. There is a notion that the PE investors help promote entrepreneurial and modern management practices. The MBO target firm has to ensure returning the entire money back to the sponsors within the shortest possible time out of the operational cash flow. Therefore, various issues like identifying a target firm, sourcing mix of finance, MBO price determination, value creation and value delivery to all stakeholders are all important for understanding the subject. This chapter attempts to construct a robust model for structuring MBO to ensure value fairness to all parties involved in the transaction. (c) 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The brand is the most important asset for enterprises. In a competitive marketplace, brand is considered the best way to differentiate products, to build corporate image and to develop bargaining power with retailers. Branding strategies are therefore a key aspect of corporate decision making. In this paper, the authors analyse the relationship between the ownership structure of agri-food SMEs and branding strategies. A conceptual model of how these variables are related is proposed and empirically tested using data from two surveys (2003 and 2010) of a representative sample of agri-food SMEs in the Languedoc-Roussillon region (South of France). The results show that ownership structure influences branding strategies in SMEs. This finding might be considered a challenge to the relevance of applying agency theory to a very particular form of enterprise and sector of activity.

This study seeks to furnish insights on institutional shareholders by assessing whether higher presence of institutional shareholders leads to higher dividend payout or vice versa in line with a particular version of the agency theory. The panel data consists of 100 Malaysian firms from the trading and services sector of Bursa Malaysia from the years 2005 to 2008. In line with the 'efficient monitoring hypothesis' theory of institutional shareholders and in conjunction with the outcome model of dividends, we find the presence of institutional shareholders results in higher dividends payout in Malaysia. In spite of the lower fraction of shareholding by institutional shareholders in Malaysia as compared to developed markets, it is clear from the results that the they in fact bring about a positive impact to the firms they invest in by resulting in higher dividends payments. We have provided a framework linking the two theories of dividends (outcome and substitute) and the three theories of institutional shareholders (efficient monitoring hypothesis, conflict of interest hypothesis and strategic alignment hypothesis) to better analyze the two broad ranging theories into greater depth.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore post-acquisition compensation management and examine how the two most commonly used theories to explain CEO stock option exercise, agency theory and CEO overconfidence, expect CEOs to manage their stock options following an acquisition. Design/methodology/approach - Using logistic regression analysis, the authors investigate whether CEOs are more or less likely to exercise options following an acquisition, and the effect which CEO tenure and acquisition history may have on option exercise. Findings - The results suggest that CEOs are more likely to exercise options following an acquisition. The authors also find that CEO tenure and acquisition experience are both linked to an increase in option exercise. Research limitations/implications - The findings suggest that future research should expect agency effects to outweigh overconfidence effects when considering CEO stock option exercise behavior within the post-acquisition firm context. Practical implications - This paper advises directors and shareholders about whether agency concerns or overconfidence are of greater concern and how CEO tenure and past acquisition history may influence post-acquisition CEO stock option exercise behavior, offering information valuable in designing effective corporate governance. Originality/value - This paper is among the first to explore how CEOs manage their options following an acquisition and finds that CEOs are more likely to exercise stock options following an acquisition. Post-acquisition compensation management is an important, though overlooked, consideration in improving acquisition performance. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Although the agency theory has been widely used across a variety of corporate finance concepts for the past three decades, little work has been undertaken with regard to how the agency theory could be used to explain simultaneous interrelation among internal solutions for Agency problem. In addition, no general consensus has emerged after many years of investigation and scholars can often disagree about the same empirical evidence. Among other, potential endogeneity of the agency mechanisms, as well as cultural and structural differences between developed and developing markets, has been stated to cause the complexity of corporate governance around the world. This article reviews the theoretical and empirical literature addressing causal effects of managerial incentives and financial controlling instrument due to agency problem. At the same time, the article aims to improve the understanding of how these instruments affect each other. The main part of the discussion is related to the evaluation of theoretical aspects of internal Agency solution and their interrelations, as well as the experiential studies in different countries. As such, specification of Malaysian market is surveyed separately to highlight the need for multi-theoretic process and interrelation effects in future research on corporate agency problems in the Malaysian context.

This study aims at testing the partial adjustment model of cash holdings to investigate whether Jordanian industrial firms have a target cash holdings and how fast they move toward that target when any target deviation exists. A sample of 57 industrial firms listed in the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) over the period 2001-2013 is used. The study uses the estimated fitted values from the conventional cash equation as a proxy for the target cash holding. Using pooled and panel data analysis, the study provides evidence suggesting that cash flows, net working capital, leverage and firm size significantly affect the cash holdings of Jordanian firms. Moreover, it reveals that Jordanian industrial firms have a target cash level and make a target reversion whenever needed. However, Jordanian industrial firms adjust their actual cash holdings to its target level too slowly. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

This study examines five national public policy areas where states and local governments received grants-in-aid from the federal government; these grants approximate a fifth of their yearly revenue budgets. Knowing the historical trends and concentrations can minimize expectation errors of practitioners and policy makers and facilitate future revenue planning. The grants examined between 1940 and 2010 include income security, health, education and training, economic and regional development, and transportation. The study uses agency theory to rationalize relationships among the governments, and applies statistical modeling, multiple means comparisons and discriminant analyses to test whether there are distinct policy concentrations and differences among policy regimes. Our findings show transfers were continuous, physically important and unaffected significantly by adjustments due to size and prices. The study found concentrations and differences among policy regimes. (c) 2015 by PrAcademics Press.

The problem of managerial control and the concept of corporate governance have long been the subject of researches, often linked to widely known organizational theories (transaction cost theory, agency theory ...). But it seems that these analyzes, especially because they are too focused on relations with the shareholders and neglect the examination of "managerial discretion", can only incompletely account for the status and the actual behavior of top managers. The author proposes to follow various paths to overcome this situation by enriching the narrow approaches that are dominant today. (c) 2015, Lavoisier.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between capital structure and financial performance of the listed companies on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). Fixed effect and random effect panel regression model is applied to the data covering the period 2009-2011. The empirical evidence shows that the firm's capital structure is a significant determinant of corporate performance. Specifically, SDTA has a negative and significant impact on the performance measure ROA and ROE. The significance and negative effects of SDTA on a firm's performance ROA supports the argument that short-term debt decreases a firm's performance. Moreover, LDTA, TDTA and TDTE are significantly negatively related to ROE. These results show that higher level of leverage lead to lower ROE. In addition, the results found the positive impact of 'Agro & Food Industry' sector to corporate performance in Thailand. It may also indicate particular sector is more profitable than others.

The purpose of the study was to reflect on existing practices in studying the CEO pay performance issue, with special reference to the context wherein the financial performance measurements were employed. In total, an in-depth content analysis of 40 published articles was done. Some flaws were identified in prior research, namely some studies only use either market-based or accounting-based measurements, only a single performance measurement, measurements without the context of the subjacent risks, monetary values without substance as performance measurements and without the context of a theory. The contribution of this study is that a framework is developed to guide future studies with regard to the context wherein financial performance measures should be employed and that some theories, additional to the agency theory, were identified that should be tested more frequently in pay performance-related studies.

The Arthasastra of Kautiliya is an important Indian text on governance dating back to 300 BC. Since its rediscovery in 1905, the book has inspired many authors to interpret and to analyze its contents, as well as to discuss its importance for management today. In the present paper, it is shown that basic assumptions on agency theory are presented in this early work. These include assumptions on organization, about people and on information. It is suggested that information, control and incentives should be used in combination to make it likely that agents support the objectives of their principal. Environmental conditions seem to have influenced the choice of instruments. For instance, high-risk levels of business operations at the time called for relatively more control than for offering incentives. (c) 2015, Taylor & Francis.

The study investigates the impact of agency problem and the distribution of corporate control on board composition using a dataset consisting of 190 listed firms in Indonesia. The conceptual framework is derived from agency theory assuming that board composition is endogenously determined by firm's specific environment. The study reveals that corporate control drives the composition of the board. The different types of large shareholders are found to pursue different strategies in relation to the board composition. While domestic and foreign investors rely on independent board, controlling family prefer to structure a less independent board. This suggests that the battle for corporate control between controlling family, in one side, and unrelated domestic and foreign investors begins with the structure of board. The findings imply that the type of large shareholder does matter in determining the device of corporate control. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

In the last few decades, policy makers around the world have focused on corporate governance reform since the Asian financial crisis and scandals in the United States such as the Enron debacle. In addition, there is no doubt that banks have significant position in the welfare of any economy. Corporate governance involves in how banks' businesses and affairs are governed by its board of directors that raises a fundamental question of how this could affect banks' financial performance. The focus of this research is to investigate the relationships between some of the corporate governance variables that are related to the board of directors on the financial performance of these banks working in the Egyptian market. Thirteen banks that are listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange were selected with data collected for the period from 2011 till 2013 which is the post Egyptian revolution era. Research analyses adopted in this study are descriptive, correlation and regression analyses to test the research hypotheses. Findings of this research provide evidence that some of these variables such as board independence, foreign board members ratio, women board members ratio and board educational ratio have significant effect on the financial performance of these banks; however, board size and CEO qualities do not have any significant effect on banks' performance. The research reaches some implications that are important to different stakeholders on practical and academic levels. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All right rserved.

This paper argues that a primary reason for the mixed results observed in the corporate governance and firm performance literature is that the relevant theories have not been applied to the class of phenomena they were designed to explain. For instance, the literature that focuses on ownership structure and firm performance employs entrepreneurial agency theories of the firm but applies them to managerial firms where ownership is separated from control. This is evidenced by the fact that firms in which managerial ownership is close to zero percent are included in the samples. After similarly analyzing other related governance and performance literatures, the paper provides orientation and recommendations for researchers to avoid the identified problems and secure future progress.

The paper investigates the relationship between organizational trust and a firm's market value through the perspective of company size. The paper addresses the theoretical and empirical gap regarding the effects of organizational trust on a firm's value by embarking on stewardship and agency theories. This provides a theoretical framework to extend the understanding of an organizational trust's influence on a firm's market value based on company size considering the extent to which a firm's size plays a role in determining the market value effect. Furthermore, the effects of firm size on an organizational trust's impact on market value were tested empirically through a moderation analysis drawing on a sample of 198 firms listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It has been found that there is no significant association between organizational trust climate and a firm's market value. However, what materialized from this investigation, as predicted, is that the aggregate impact of the internal trust climate on market value depends on company size. Specifically, it is reported that high trust diminishes the value of big firms, but at the same time contributes to a firm's value in the case of small firms. Although these results might seem surprising, they are supported by arguments derived from the stewardship and agency theories distinguishing the possible positive and negative outcomes of organizational trust under different conditions.

Managerial risk taking has increasingly been highlighted as a prerequisite for innovation. Since innovation is viewed as a high-risk, high-cost endeavour, CEOs often are reluctant to become advocates for innovation. However, not much is understood in terms of managerial risk-taking behaviour in relation to innovation within strong vs. flexible governance settings at the level of the firm. In an attempt to fill this void, the current paper attempts to contextualize managerial risk taking behaviours within corporate governance environments and its interaction with the innovation generation activities of the firm. In the context of innovation, corporate governance would relate to exercising control over resource allocation, as well as the nature of an innovative investment strategy while relying on the incentives and abilities of individuals who exercise that control. While both internal and external corporate governance mechanisms serve to enhance firm innovation activity, in environments where such mechanisms are mandated then one can expect greater managerial risk-aversion towards innovation. In such a scenario there is in due course a trade-off on the time and resources that could be allocated towards innovation generation. In order to arrive at a theory of the innovative enterprise given certain corporate governance environments, future studies should go beyond the counting of R&D and patent statistics. Undertaking a holistic approach in understanding the role that corporate governance would play on firm innovation generation activities would enable adoption of policies that promotes managerial risk taking and subsequently innovation generation.

This study is set out to examine the cogency of capital structure theories in a unique Islamic financial environment where tax shield is irrelevant, paying or receiving interest is undesirable and government exercises control over major economic activities. To achieve this objective, the annual reports of all Kuwaiti banks listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange for the period between 2010 and 2014 were used to extract internal bank variables. In addition, external macroeconomic data were extracted from World Bank statistics. The results of the pooled regression analysis disclosed that the capital structure of the Kuwaiti banks are influenced by their size measured by total assets, cash dividends paid and the market value/book value of the bank's share. While the result was inconsistent with agency theory, it provides support to the pick-order, trade off and market theories. (c) 2015 Econjournals. All rights reserved.

Up till present, there is no convergence conclusion about the relation of product diversification and capital structure. There are three kinds of empirical finding of the relationship: There is positive significance, there is negative significance, and there is not significance. This study aims to examine the influences of product diversification on capital structure decisions. We employ a panel data from 83 companies of 13 manufacturing industries that listed in IDX covering the period 2001 - 2010. We find that both variables: The category of product diversification (CPD) and the degree of relatedness of product diversification (DRD) has a significant negative influence on the capital structure.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the influence of family character on the level and type of diversification,additionally considering the effect of ownership concentration that exists in family business. The studyuses a sample of 99 listed companies, parent companies of business groups, with business group beingconsidered as the unit of analysis (parent company and subsidiaries firms). The results show that familygroups have lower average levels of total diversification and unrelated diversification, and they showthe negative influence of family character in unrelated diversification level. The existence of a nonlinearU-shaped relationship between the level of diversification (total and unrelated) and the ownership con-centration in family group is also observed, thus confirming a different behavior depending on the capitalheld by the main shareholders. The results obtained provide new evidence for the academic literatureon family firms and business groups, as well as on the diversification strategies adopted by the familygroups. (c) 2014 AEDEM.

Previous studies have not examined the performance of multi-unit franchise systems. The paper addresses this research gap by investigating franchisor performance of multi-unit franchise system from an organizational economics perspective by using data from Germany and Switzerland. According to the agency theory they show that under a strong brand name free-riding risk may be reduced through MUF and hence MUF positively influences the performance the systems. In addition, the data support the transaction cost hypothesis that environment uncertainty is negatively related to the performance of MUF systems. Furthermore, using property rights theory, they show that intangible local market assets are negatively and intangible system-specific assets are positively associated with MUF performance. Finally, the results indicate that decentralization of decision making has a positive performance effect on MUF systems. (c) Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Agency conflict arises due to the differences of interest between owner, manager and creditors. Therefore, the researchers are trying to find the appropriate model in order to reduce the agency conflict issues that occur. The uncommon thing which became the originality and the recency of this study is to consider the interdependence relationship of institutional ownership variables and leverage to assess the appropriate control of the agency conflict that occurs by considering the real situation and circumstances faced by the company when the investment opportunities is high and low as well as high and low company risk. This study uses data of listed companies in Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) with the data for 12 years. The analysis technique used is simultaneous equations with GMM estimation techniques (Generalize Method of Moment). This research provides practical implications for owners, managers, creditors, investors, and capital market regulation in considering decisions related to the mechanism controlling agency conflicts through institutional ownership, leverage on free cash flow faced by companies in Indonesia, so that they can make decisions and provide useful strategic considerations useful for the companies, government regulation, banks (lenders), and society.

Accounting standard-setters suggest a normative framework to measure value creation. They are opposed to the fact companies try to escape this framework, as they fear confusion and a lack of comparability among users. This paper aims to highlight value creation representation and to identify the determinants of its disclosure. At first, we interview a sample of companies' managers to identify the information disclosed on value creation. Then, a quantitative study examines the determinants of information disclosed on the value creation in the Annual Report of 84 SBF120 index firms in 2010. Three disclosure scores are used to consider the presentation, visibility and recurrence disclosures. Thhey are then aggregated into a global score. Thhe results show that performance, leverage, ownership structure, cross-listing and firm's size are determining factors. However, the influence of these variables depends on the dimensions of disclosures.

We employ agency and institutional theory arguments to explore the conditions under which first-tier suppliers will act as agents who fulfill the lead firm's sustainability requirements (i.e., the primary agency role) and implement these requirements in their suppliers' operations (i.e., the secondary agency role). The findings from three in-depth case studies embedded in different institutional contexts highlight the importance for lead firms to incentivize each agency role separately and to reduce information asymmetries, particularly at the second-tier level. In addition, our inductive analysis reveals several contingency factors that influence the coupling of the secondary agency role of the first-tier supplier. These factors include resource availability at the first-tier supplier's firm, the lead firm's focus on the triple-bottom-line dimension (i.e., environmental or social), the lead firm's use of power, and the lead firm's internal alignment of the sustainability and purchasing function. We integrate our findings in a conceptual framework that advances the research agenda on multi-tier sustainable supply chains, and we subsequently outline the practical implications of assigning the double agency role to first tier suppliers.

Based on a survey and content analysis of 462 peer-reviewed academic articles over the period 1990-2014, this article reviews theories related to the external drivers of corporate social responsibility (CSR) (such as stakeholder theory and resource-dependence theory) and the internal drivers of CSR (such as resource-based view [RBV] and agency theory) that have been utilized to explain CSR. The article discusses the main tenets of the principal theoretical perspectives and their application in CSR research. Going beyond previous reviews that have largely failed to investigate theory applications in CSR scholarship, this article stresses the importance of theory-driven explanations of CSR and the complementarity of different theories. The article demonstrates that the current mainstream theorizing of CSR is dominated by theories related to the external drivers of CSR and is less developed with regard to the internal dynamics. The article outlines several productive avenues for future research: the need for multi-theory studies and more research at multiple levels of analysis, particularly at the individual level of analysis. It suggests that CSR scholarship can benefit from combining theoretical insights from a range of established theoretical lenses such as institutional theory and RBV, and can gain new insights from theoretical lenses such as Austrian economics and micro-level psychological theories.

Agency theory draws attention to certain behaviors of CEOs and boards that, in aggregate, create losses for society. The empirical literature, however, characterized by contentious findings, suggests that the current form of agency theory is not supporting a clear understanding of these behaviors and their costs. We propose a change to one assumption, with potentially profound implications. Expanding on the assumption of narrow self-interest underlying agency theory, we apply an empirically wellestablished refinement that self-interest is bounded by norms of reciprocity and fairness. The resulting logic is that perceptions of fairness mediate the relationships derived from standard agency theory through positively and negatively reciprocal behaviors. This mediating variable provides a parsimonious new way to help explain extreme results found in prior studies. Rather than aiming to limit CEOs' self-serving behaviors, boards that apply these arguments improve social welfare by initiating positive reciprocity and avoiding unnecessary, welfare-reducing "revenge" behaviors.

Agency and stewardship theories are prominent perspectives to examine myriad issues within family firms. Although considered opposing theories, both address the same phenomena: the individual-level behaviors and firm-level governance mechanisms that predict organizational outcomes. Accordingly, we review and synthesize these theories concurrently, using the concepts of behavior and governance as our organizing framework. Our review encompasses 107 family firm articles grounded in agency and/or stewardship theory, published between 2000 and 2014 in 24 journals across several disciplines. Additionally, we identify future research areas that provide scholars opportunities to push theoretical boundaries and offer further insights into the family firm. (c) 2015, (c) The Author(s) 2015.

Resource dependence theorists argue that boards of directors with political capital can benefit focal firms by reducing uncertainty and providing preferential resources. Here, we develop theory regarding the downside of board political capital. The problem of principal-principal agency is evident in many parts of the world, and we argue that board political capital can further exacerbate it by enabling large blockholders to undertake more appropriation of firm wealth. Further, we explore how this enabling effect is moderated by ownership-, industry-, and environment-level contingencies. We find empirical support for our arguments using 32,174 directors in 1,046 Chinese listed firms over the period 2008-2011. Our study sheds light on new ways in which resource dependence and agency theories can be integrated to advance the extant research on board governance and corporate political strategy.

This study looks at the relationship between project governance and project success from an agency theory and stewardship theory perspective. For that project governance was operationalized respectively as a) the extent of shareholder versus stakeholder orientation and b) the extent of behavior versus outcome control, both exercised by the parent organization over its project. A cross-sectional, worldwide online survey yielded 254 usable responses. Factor and regression analyses indicate that project success correlates with increasing stakeholder orientation of the parent organization, while the types of control mechanisms do not correlate with project success. Results support the importance of stewardship approaches in the context of successful projects.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: This study reviews previous country-level and firm-level studies on corporate governance codes up to 2014 in order to highlight recent trends and indicate future avenues of research. Research Findings/Results: Our data show that research on codes increases over time consistently with the diffusion and the relevance of the empirical phenomenon. Despite previous studies substantially enriching our knowledge of the antecedents and consequences of governance codes, our study shows there are still several opportunities to make significant contributions in this area. Theoretical Implications: Agency theory is the dominant theoretical framework, although other theoretical perspectives (especially the institutional one) are increasingly adopted. Future studies should be aimed at widening and combining various theoretical lenses so as to develop new interpretations and a better understanding of governance codes. Practical Implications: Legislators and policymakers should continue to develop and update the recommendations of national governance codes in order to address the potential failures of corporate governance mechanisms in place.

This paper investigates the relationship between divestitures and firm value in family firms. Using hand-collected data on a sample of over 30,000 firm-year observations, we find that family firms are less likely than non-family firms to undertake divestitures, especially when these companies are managed by family rather than non-family-CEOs. However, we then establish that the divestitures undertaken by family firms, predominantly those run by family-CEOs, are associated with higher post-divestiture performance than their non-family counterparts. These findings indicate that family firms may fail to fully exploit available economic opportunities, potentially because they pursue multiple objectives beyond the maximization of shareholder value. These results also elucidate how the characteristics of corporate owners and managers can influence the value that firms derive from their corporate strategies.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore whether firms with powerful chief executive officers (CEOs) tend to invest (more) in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities as the over-investment hypothesis based on classical agency theory predicts. Design/methodology/approach: This paper tests an alternative hypothesis that if CSR investment is indeed an agency cost like the over-investment hypothesis suggests, then those activities may destroy firm value. Findings: Using CEO pay slice (Bebchuk et al., 2011), CEO tenure, and CEO duality to measure CEO power, the authors show that CEO power is negatively correlated with firm's choice to engage in CSR and with the level of CSR activities in the firm. Furthermore, the results suggest that CSR activities are in fact value enhancing in that as firms engage in more CSR activities their value increases.

The ownership of corporations has been studied in multiple disciplines and using diverse theoretical frameworks for several decades. Despite a wealth of research, both research gaps and contradictory findings are common. This is partly due to the fragmentation of the foci of individual studies. We synthesize the work done to date through a content analysis of 145 articles and 523 effect size estimates. On the basis of this review, we develop an integrated perspective to understand how institutional, government, family, executive, and board ownership affect a variety of firm outcomes. We conclude by offering new theoretical and contextual directions to better understand the role of ownership in shaping firm outcomes. (c) 2016, (c) The Author(s) 2016.

We examine the unique nature of agency problems within publicly traded family firms by investigating the earnings management decision of dominant family owners relative to non-family. To do so, we draw upon literature demonstrating that family owners are loss averse with respect to the family's socioemotional wealth, or the affective endowment derived from firm ownership and control. Our theory and findings suggest that potential reputational consequences of earnings management lead family principals to engage in less of this practice relative to non-family firms, and that founder family firms are less likely than non-founder family firms to use earnings management. Moreover, the family-firm effect varies with the firm size, the degree of CEO entrenchment, and the firm's stock structure. We provide important insights regarding differences between family and non-family principals in the use of unethical accounting practices, thereby extending agency theory and advancing an underdeveloped research area.

The determinants of risk disclosure in the annual reports of listed state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have yet to be fully explored. This paper examines the potential impact of the composition of the boards of directors and other company-specific features on risk disclosure levels. The presence of women on a board made a significant difference to risk disclosure, as did the age of board members. Board directors having an accounting or finance/business qualification affected risk disclosure negatively; company size and an internet visibility were positively related to risk disclosure. Although an Italian study, the lessons here will have application to academia and to practitioners, policy-makers and standard-setters worldwide. (c) 2016 CIPFA.

Purpose - This study aims to discover the corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure practices and the potential influence of corporate governance (CG), ownership structure and corporate characteristics in an emerging Arab country, Saudi Arabia. This study extends the extant literature by investigating the drivers of CSR disclosure in a country that lacks research in this area. Design/methodology/approach - This study examines 267 annual reports of Saudi Arabian non-financial listed firms during 2007-2011 using manual content and multiple regression analyses and a checklist of 17 CSR disclosure items based on ISO 26000. Findings - The analysis finds that the CSR disclosure average is 24 per cent, higher than 14.61 and 16 per cent found by Al-Janadi et al. (2013) and Macarulla and Talalweh (2012) for two Saudi Arabian samples during 2006-2007 and 2008, respectively. This improvement may be due to the application of Saudi CG code in 2007. The analysis also shows that government and family ownership, firm size and firm age are positive determinants of CSR disclosure, firm leverage is a negative determinant and effective AC, board independence, role duality, institutional ownership, firm profitability and industry type are found not to be determinants of CSR disclosure. Originality/value - This study is important because it uses the agency theory to ascertain the influence of specific board characteristics and ownership structures on disclosure. As a result, it provides important implications for CG regulators and different stakeholders and provides an evaluation of the recently applied Saudi CG code from the CSR disclosure perspective.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates whether the existence of a separate risk committee and risk committee characteristics are associated with market risk disclosures. It also tests whether the role of a risk committee in affecting market risk disclosures varies for different firm life cycle stages. Research Findings/Insights: Using 677 firm-year observations of financial firms from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries during the years 2007-2011, we find that firms with a separate risk committee are associated with greater market risk disclosures, an effect that is more pronounced for mature-stage firms. Furthermore, findings suggest that risk committee qualifications and size have a significant positive impact on market risk disclosures. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study complements the corporate governance literature by incorporating agency theory, legitimacy theory, stakeholder theory, and the resource-based theory to provide more robust evidence of the impact of a separate risk committee and the firm life cycle on market risk disclosures. Our results support the monitoring effect of a separate risk committee and suggest that a separate risk committee can improve "firm-level corporate governance" in the GCC countries characterized by a poor informational environment. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Findings from this study provide evidence that the existence, qualifications, and size of risk committees may be used as a channel to improve the disclosure level, suggesting a policy prescription for regulators and policymakers. Investors may also find these results useful in forming their own expectations about firm-level risk disclosures. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Agency theories predict that older firms make value-destroying acquisitions to benefit managers. Neoclassical theories predict instead that such firms make wealth-increasing acquisitions to exploit underutilized assets. Using IPO cohorts, we establish that, while younger firms make more related and diversifying acquisitions than mature firms, the acquisition rate follows a U-shape over firms' life cycle. Consistent with neoclassical theories, we show that acquiring firms have better performance and growth opportunities and create wealth through acquisitions of nonpublic firms throughout their life. Consistent with agency theories, older firms experience negative stock price reactions for acquisitions of public firms. (c) 2015 the American Finance Association.

In prior research which explores the relationship between organizational slack and corporate social performance (CSP) it is implicitly assumed that slack is homogeneous and positively affects CSP. In this study we build on recent research which argues that slack is heterogeneous and can be conceptualized as financial, human resources, and innovational in nature. We view the slack-CSP relationship from both organizational and agency theory perspectives. We propose that different slack conceptualizations and the contrary assumptions of aforementioned theories hold divergent implications for CSP. We test our hypotheses on a longitudinal sample of public corporations in the United States and confirm this divergent impact. Our results suggest that the relationship between organizational slack and CSP is more complex than previously understood. We discuss the implications of our findings for the slack-resource hypothesis of CSP. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Research and development (R&D) investment affects future operating earnings. Behavioral theory claims that slack resources benefit innovation, whereas agency theory argues that they represent a form of inefficiency and inhibit innovation. This paper thus examines how slack resources affect the relationship between R&D investments and firm performance based on two dimensions of R&D: R&D capital and R&D expenses. R&D capital captures long-term R&D investment, whereas R&D expenses represent R&D investment in the current year. This study is undertaken in Taiwan using a large 5-year dataset within high-tech industries. Slack resources are broadly classified into absorbed slack with low managerial discretion and unabsorbed slack with high managerial discretion. We find that absorbed slack negatively affects the relationship between R&D investments and performance, as proposed by agency theory. We further find that unabsorbed slack has a slightly curvilinear effect on the positive relationship between R&D capital and firm performance. The proposal of behavioral theory thus is more valid when focusing on unabsorbed slack resources. Our findings suggest that it is necessary to identify the types of slack and R&D investments that are being considered when discussing the impacts of R&D investment on performance.

Agency theory-grounded research on boards of directors and firm legitimacy has historically viewed CEO power as de-legitimating, often taking this fact for granted in theorizing about external assessors' evaluations of a firm. With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be. Data from 151 U.S. semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms over a 10-year period generally support our predictions. (c) 2016 Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose - Theories develop over time and are influenced by both events and people. Looking primarily at the applications between contracting principal-agent relationships, the purpose of this paper is to explore how agency theory emerged from a number of economic and social developments. In doing so, the authors explain how this once dominant theory comes up short regarding varying realms of entrepreneurship as well as with multiple modern business phenomena. Design/methodology/approach - The authors first present a brief overview of agency theory. Second, the authors identify major events and people and address how they impacted the development of agency theory. Third, the authors provide insights on agency theory across three contexts (strategic entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, and family business). Implications, limitations, and future research directions are then offered. Findings - The authors provide a deeper understanding of agency theory, thus broadening its underpinnings and enabling readers to more readily understand why agency theory is limited in its explanation of certain and modern business phenomena. The authors find that some of the seminal influences to agency theory are quite dated which has limited its explanatory power in terms of the modern day business and with more recent disciplines such as entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications - The authors are limited by their choices of major events that influenced agency theory at the expense of not being able to include everything that may have impacted the theory over time. These limitations, however, are offset by the research implications. As the authors highlight the underpinning of agency theory, the authors subsequently provide scholars and practitioners with five primary boundary conditions, each of which are in need of attention for agency theory to maintain relevant explanatory power. Originality/value - A deeper understanding of agency theory can be gained by looking at its underpinnings. By presenting numerous principal-agent conflicts and demonstrating areas in which it has fallen short (i.e. entrepreneurship and more recent business phenomenon), we shed light on the obstacles agency theory must overcome in order to maintain its position as a prominent theory.

Research summary: We draw on behavioral agency theory to explain how decision heuristics associated with CEO stock options interact with firm slack to shape the CEO's preference for short- or long-term strategies (temporal orientation). Our findings suggest CEO current option wealth substitutes for the influence of slack resources in encouraging a long-term orientation, while prospective option wealth enhances the positive effect of slack on temporal orientation. Our theory offers explanations for non-findings in previous analysis of the relationship between CEO equity based pay and temporal orientation and provides the insights that CEO incentives created by stock options (1) enhance the effect of available slack upon temporal orientation and (2) can both incentivize and de-incentivize destructive short-termism, depending upon the values of current and prospective option wealth. Managerial summary: We explore how compensation design can play a role in affecting the CEO's preference for short- or long-term strategic projects. When the CEOs have accumulated option wealth, they are more likely to invest in the long term. Yet when they have a large number of recently granted options with the potential to generate significant wealth in the event of successful risk taking, the CEO is more likely to prefer the short term in order to achieve personal wealth gains more quickly. The more liquid assets the firm holds, the weaker both of the aforementioned effects. An implication for boards is that they should anticipate CEO short-termism if the CEO has been granted new options, underlining the potential negative consequences of option compensation.

Purpose: By revisiting the agency theory literature, this paper aims to both incrementally advance historical viewpoints and reveal four prominent influences on agency theory: Weber and Simon, The Great Depression, Cooperation and the Chicago School. This is critical given that understanding the history behind the authors' major theoretical lenses is fundamental to using these theories to explain various phenomena. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a plethora of archival sources and following the influence-mapping approach used by other management history scholars, this manuscript synthesizes historical accounts and archival information to provide a clearer picture of the major historical influences in the formation of agency theory. Findings: We shed light on four areas related to management history that helped propel agency theory. Whereas past scholarship has not recognised them as influencers, we find and show how the industrial revolution, unionization, the stock exchange and other management approaches all played a role in the development of agency theory's core tenants. Originality/value: We extend upon the influential people and events that shaped agency theory, thus providing a fuller understanding of the theory's usefulness. Moreover, we fill in gaps enabling scholars to better understand the context in which the core tenants of agency theory were developed. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study examines the effect of institutional ownership on dividend payouts through the lens of agency theory. We hypothesize that only institutions with certain traits are likely to monitor. Monitoring institutions will use dividend payouts as a tool to mitigate firms' agency problems, conditional on those firms' financial performance. We find that (1) there is a positive relation between lagged long-term institutional ownership with a large stake and the dividend payout ratio, (2) the positive relation is more salient in firms with high agency costs, and (3) the positive relation is more salient when external monitoring is weak. These findings support that (1) concentrated and long-term institutional investors play a monitoring role and (2) monitoring institutions use dividend payouts as a monitoring device. Our findings are robust to endogeneity tests, level and change models, alternative income-based dividend payout measures, alternative measures of long-term institutions, and sub-period analyses.

Why are some entrepreneurs able to start a new firm more quickly than others in the venture creation process? Drawing on pecking order and agency theory, this study investigates how start-up capital structure influences the time to either new firm founding or quitting the start-up process. The temporal aspect of the start-up process is one that is often discussed, but rarely studied. Therefore, we utilize competing risk and Cox regression event history analysis on a nationally representative sample of US entrepreneurs to investigate how start-up capital structure impacts the time in gestation to particular kinds of start-up outcomes. Our findings suggest that external equity has an appreciable impact on new firm emergence over time, and that the percentage of ownership held by the founders attenuates the benefits of external equity.

This article seeks to examine the relationship between the board size and firm performance. Existing literature on board size is based on different theories of corporate governance. While agency theory and resource dependency theory suggest that the board size positively affects performance, stewardship theory favours smaller board size and argues that larger board size negatively impacts the firm performance. The present article adds to the empirical literature by employing panel data analysis of 145 non-financial companies listed in the NSE CNX 200 Index of India corresponding to 16 industries. The study is carried out for a period of five years from 2008 to 2012. The firm performance has been measured using Tobin's Q and the market-to-book value ratio (MBVR) as market-based measures and return on assets (ROA) and return on capital employed (ROCE) as accounting-based measures. The fixed effect model, random effect model and feasible generalised least square (FGLS) regression models are applied to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. The results conclude that the board size has a positive and significant impact on the firm performance. (c) 2016 Institute of Public Enterprise.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: This study focuses on the role of Say-on-Pay as a mechanism that aims to promote the efficiency of corporate governance by providing an additional channel for the expression of shareholder "voice." Initially introduced in the UK, Say-on-Pay has subsequently been adopted in a large number of countries and it has recently received significant attention from regulators, media, and the general public. The purpose of this study is to review prior literature related to Say-on-Pay and its impact on firm value and corporate decision making. Research Findings/Insights: Our study highlights the interdisciplinary nature of research on Say-on-Pay. We also shed light on conceptual gaps and empirical discrepancies in prior studies, indicating that many questions linked to Say-on-Pay and its importance for the executive pay-setting process remain largely unanswered. Theoretical/Academic Implications: At a theoretical level, we highlight potential areas for development of the existing theoretical framework for Say-on-Pay, which is at present rather limited and primarily influenced by agency theory. At an empirical level, we propose a substantial number of avenues for fruitful future research on this topic. Practitioner/Policy Implications: In the light of recent proposals for extending the role of Say-on-Pay within the corporate governance framework, our findings are particularly relevant to regulators. More thought is needed about changing its nature from advisory to binding, as the degree of its effectiveness and the dynamics of the voting process are still unclear. Our study could also be informative for the media and the general public, especially given the increasing attention afforded to Say-on-Pay. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Because prior research has largely adopted an agency theory perspective and focused extensive effort on examining shareholder-centric corporate governance mechanisms and their outcomes for shareholders or select groups of stakeholders, relatively little work has focused on whether governance structures can maximize outcomes for all stakeholders. We adopt an integrated, stakeholder-agency theory perspective to explore a set of corporate governance mechanisms that potentially can help firms generate greater engagement with a broad array of stakeholders. We test the relationship between stakeholder-centric governance and corporate social performance using a sample of 342 firms in 24 countries over four years and find that certain corporate governance mechanisms can indeed be construed as 'stakeholder-centric' as they positively impact corporate social performance.

Previous studies report inconsistent findings regarding how board monitoring influences firms' research and development (R&D) intensity. This study uses agency theory and resource dependence theory to argue that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between these two constructs. By using board capital theory, the present study also postulates that this curvilinear relationship varies depending on the firm- and industry-specific human capital of outside directors. 467 firm-year observations collected from a randomly selected sample of large public firms from high-tech industries between 2005 and 2010 largely provide empirical support for these arguments. The findings contribute to the corporate governance literature by refining the understanding of the costs and benefits associated with board monitoring. The curvilinear relationship reported herein may also help reconcile prior inconsistent findings. The results also contribute to board capital theory by emphasizing the role of outside directors' firm-specific human capital in the context of R&D investments. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of the audit committee (AC) independence, financial expertise, internal audit function, audit quality and ownership concentration on earnings quality (EQ) and, consequently, ascertain whether the AC's independence and financial expertise has a moderating effect on the relationship between internal audit function and EQ. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample is 508 firms listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia (formerly known as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) for the years 2009 to 2012. EQ was measured using two modified Jones models of discretionary accruals. Findings: The findings reveal that the independence of AC and investment in internal audit function, as well as the Big4 audit firm, are related to greater EQ. Ownership concentration is found to be associated with lower EQ. The study provides evidence that AC's independence moderates the relationship between internal audit function (investment in and sourcing arrangements of internal audit function) and EQ. It also shows that AC's financial expertise moderates the relationship between sourcing arrangements of internal audit function and EQ. Practical implications: This study extends the prior related literature by examining the AC's independence and financial expertise as moderating variables on the relationship between internal audit function and EQ. Social implications: Policymakers might use the findings regarding EQ in relation to governance practices, to recognize the important roles played by the AC's independence and financial expertise on the effectiveness of internal audit function with EQ. Originality/value: This study uses the agency theory and resource dependence theory to provide empirical evidence on the impact of internal audit function and AC on EQ in the ownership concentration environment.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in the association among the board of directors, audit committee effectiveness and the cost of debt between the family- and non-family-owned companies in the Sultanate of Oman. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a panel data set that has multiple observations on the same economic units. Each element has two subscripts: the group identifier, i (68 companies listed on the Muscat Securities Market), and within the group index denoted by t, which identifies time (2005-2011). The regression model of this study is based on the random effects model, which, according to the Hausman and Breusch-Pagan (LM) (Breusch and Pagan, 1980) tests, is an appropriate model. Findings - This study finds that the association between a board of directors' effectiveness and cost of debt is negative and significant for the full sample and non-family firms. This relationship, however, is weak and not significant for family firms. Additionally, this study indicates that audit committee effectiveness has a significant effect on the cost of debt based on the full sample and family firms, but is not significant for non-family firms. Originality/value - This study examines firms in the Sultanate of Oman, where family ownership control is common. Based on a framework conceptualized according to the agency theory, using data from Oman enables a comparison between family and non-family firms with respect to the effect of the board of directors' and audit committee's characteristics as a composite measure. This composite measure captures their combined effect on the propensity of the cost of debt. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The management literature has devoted increased attention to nonmarket activities of firms, such as political involvement and social responsibility, including philanthropy. While these activities may be presumed to have the intent of improving the competitive position of firms or enhancing their reputation, firms have recently increased their support for or opposition to a wide array of politically charged social issues with no direct performance motivation. These "sociopolitical issues" are vastly different from corporate social responsibility and corporate political activities, as they are divisive, emotionally charged, and institutionally contested social issues. In this article, we explore sociopolitical issues and develop a distinct model that relies on multiple theoretical perspectives - agency theory and a push-versus-pull perspective of stakeholder theory - to provide complementary or at times competing explanations for firm involvement in such controversial issues. We also explore the contexts (or facilitating institutional environments) that enable management to get involved in sociopolitical issues. In addition to drawing attention to this growing phenomenon, the article provides guidelines for future research on corporate participation in politically charged social issues.

This study examines the influence of managerial ownership on firm agency costs among listed firms in Bangladesh. This is an institutional setting that features a mixture of agency costs. This institutional setting has a concentration of ownership by managers, but the firms are not solely owned by managers. The extant literature suggests that the sacrifice of wealth by the principal and potential costs associated with monitoring the agents is known as the agency cost. This study uses three measures of agency cost: the 'expense ratio', the 'Q-free cash flow interaction', and the 'asset utilisation ratio'. The finding of the study is that managerial ownership reduces the firm agency cost only under the 'asset utilisation ratio' measure of agency cost; this is robust with regard to a number of robustness tests. Furthermore, the non-linearity tests suggest that the convergence of interest is evident with very high and low levels of managerial ownership. The entrenchment effect by the owners is evident at moderate levels of managerial ownership. Although there has been great scepticism among management researchers on the validity of agency theory, overall, the findings of this study do not reject the validity of agency theory. Given that the entrenchment by managers is evident at certain levels of ownership and that the agency problem may still exist between insiders and outsiders, legislative guidelines for controlling share ownership may be required.

This article examines the relationship between long-term orientation, family involvement in the top management team (TMT), and family firm performance. On the basis of agency and stewardship theory, we propose that the inclusion of family members in the TMT only enhances firm performance if it induces a long-term orientation among management. An empirical analysis involving 201 privately owned family firms from Germany supports our theory that a long-term orientation helps align family and organizational goals. As such, it represents an important mediator that links family involvement in the TMT to performance. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Prior work examining the antecedents of capital structure for small and medium-sized enterprises in emerging markets is limited. This paper sheds light on how the corporate governance mechanisms adopted by firms on the newly established Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) in China influence their use of debt. We find that the financial leverage of GEM firms is positively influenced by executives' shareholding and their excess cash compensation. Ownership concentration appears to reduce leverage, whereas the percentage of tradable shares increases leverage. In contrast, institutional investors' shareholding does not influence the level of debt. Traditional factors such as tax and operating cash flow are insignificant in explaining the debt levels among GEM firms. (c) 2016, The Author(s).

Entrepreneurial universities are a catalyst for regional economic development and growth. Yet, the entrepreneurial university may not always capture the full gains made by the broader economy due to opportunistic behavior by its faculty scientists. We expand agency theory to address conditions when opportunistic behavior persists in the face of substantial information symmetry and where principals appear to tolerate opportunism despite the authority to sanction their agents. Using a sample of 105 US research universities and 73,603 scientists, we demonstrate that some scientists privately leak discoveries invented while working for their universities. Counter to prior prediction, we find that universities acting as principals often do not retaliate even when having knowledge of such opportunistic behavior and the capability to punish non-complying agents. To extend theory, we examined contexts that exacerbate and alleviate such overt opportunism: High-value discoveries and sizable entrepreneurial activity are associated with greater opportunistic behavior, whereas efforts to empower those who have close professional ties with scientists--their departments and technology commercialization offices--are related to reduced opportunism. To complement our empirical analyses, we provide a stylized mathematical model that shows how agency theory can improve its predictive power once it formally recognizes certain conditions under which agents wield substantial bargaining power over their principals, who in turn seem to tolerate agents' overt opportunistic behavior.

In the private sector, research on information technology (IT) governance has frequently applied the classical view of agency theory and focused on the controlling role played by the board of directors in constraining a potentially opportunistic manager/agent. However, in the public sector, the board of directors does not exist and there may be less need to focus on the controlling aspect of governance and more need to focus on the politically challenging distribution of state resources. In this U.S.-state-based study, we adopt, apply, and extend the legal view of agency theory past its sole focus on the board of directors as the solitary mediating hierarch in order to examine the strategic mediating hierarch role played by the state legislature and then conceptualize and test for the existence of a tactical mediating hierarch played by the IT steering committee and the production role of an independent Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) in using a fee-for-service funding model. We apply these concepts to extend theory to examine the combination of roles that lead to superior outcomes for the state (the principal) versus those necessary for the IT department (the agent). Our results show that by shifting from the control-oriented view of governance in the private sector to a more mediating view in the public sector, important practices may be portable between the public and private sector, despite their widely differing structures.

This paper examines whether and to what degree agency conflicts in ownership structure affect firm leverage ratios and external financing decisions, using a universal sample of UK firms from 1998 to 2012. We use two distinctive measures to capture ownership structure, namely, managerial share ownership (MSO) and institutional ownership. Our empirical results show a non-monotonic relation between MSO and the debt ratio, supporting two competing theories: interest alignment theory and the management entrenchment hypothesis. Nevertheless, institutional ownership is found to be positively related to firm leverage levels. Our results further suggest that firms with concentrated MSO decrease their leverage by increasing the probability of issuing equity over bonds, an effect strengthened during hot market periods.

Motivated by agency theory, we explore the effect of corporate governance quality on corporate social responsibility (CSR), using the governance standards provided by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). Our evidence reveals that firms with more effective governance make significantly less investment in CSR. It appears that managers tend to over-invest in CSR and are forced to reduce CSR investments when corporate governance is more effective. In particular, an improvement in governance quality by one standard deviation translates into a decline in CSR investments by 7.16%. Our fixed-effects analysis also shows that, within firms, when governance quality improves over time, CSR investments decline significantly. Using the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as an exogenous shock that improves the quality of corporate governance, we demonstrate that high-quality governance is not merely associated with, but rather brings about, lower CSR investments.

Purpose - Maintaining cooperation and avoiding opportunism is essential for a healthy venture capitalist (VC) - entrepreneur relationship. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the role of control and trust for developing a cooperative VC-entrepreneur relationship in an agency environment in the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a multiple case study approach to investigate ten VC-entrepreneur dyads. It uses data collected from both primary and secondary sources. Content analysis was used as the data treatment technique. Findings - The empirical evidence indicates that VC-entrepreneur relationships emerging in the early stages suffer from low agency risks and use more of relational mechanisms to curb opportunism and develop cooperation while relationships at an advanced stage suffer from higher agency risks and employ more of control mechanisms to address it. Practical implications - The findings can be utilized to enhance cooperation in VC-entrepreneur relationship by identifying the appropriate context to apply relational or control mechanisms, which would eventually lead to better performance of the venture. Originality/value - This distinction results in the development of a theoretical model which shows how the dual governance mechanisms of control and trust interact with one another to affect confidence in partner cooperation as an entrepreneurial venture raises multiple rounds of venture capital across various stages. The data collected from Indian VC-entrepreneur dyads offers a rich description of the relationship dynamics across the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Product-harm crises are ubiquitous in today's marketplace. Prior research has explored the negative consequences associated with these crises and highlighted effective crisis management strategies. Limited attention, however, has been devoted to exploring the antecedents of such crises. The authors use agency theory to explore corporate governance and top management team (TMT) characteristics that impact firms' likelihood of experiencing a product-harm crisis. They argue that family firms, firms with higher levels of managerial ownership, and firms in which the marketing function has a higher influence in the TMT are likely to exhibit a higher strategic emphasis on product quality. Strategic product-quality emphasis, in turn, mediates these firms' lower likelihood of encountering a product-harm crisis. An analysis of 116 S&P 500 firms across 2006-2011 provides considerable support for the authors' arguments. These results have important implications for practitioners and for scholars working in the areas of innovation, family business, and corporate governance. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to employ agency theory to identify the determinants of the audit delay among Palestinian companies listed on Palestine Stock Exchange (PSE). Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the agency theory, eight hypotheses are tested using data collected from the year 2011 annual reports for all the 46 listed companies on PSE. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the influence of a set of company characteristics, ownership structure variables, and corporate governance mechanisms. Findings - The result of the analysis demonstrated that the audit reporting delay is influenced by the board size, corporate size, status of audit firm, company complexity, existence of audit committee, and ownership dispersion. Research limitations/implications - The main shortcoming of the current study is that the analysis covered the Palestinian companies' annual reports for only one year. A time series analysis might give fuller and understandable picture about the audit report lag (ARL) determinants. The outcome of the study canbeusedbycompanies' managements and policy makers in Palestine to improve future disclosure. Originality/value - This paper adds to the limited audit delay literature in Middle East countries in general and Arab World in particular. This paper not only examines the determinants of the audit delay but also attempts to theorize such delay. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In the public sector, the strategic quest for IT-based innovation often starts by hiring a successful private sector CIO and hoping his or her prior experience will transfer. However this often ignores the existence and influence of other entities and IT governance structures that form the innovation ecosystem. Applying the legal view of agency theory to the U.S. state innovation ecosystem and using a crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (csQCA) approach, we investigate factors that are associated with public sector IT-based innovation. We find that CIO characteristics, structural oversight mechanisms, CIO relationships with authorities, and the state environment combine to form configurations that lead to both high and low performance.

Because security analysts, who serve as brokers between public firms and investors, arrive at their forecasts by incorporating guidance from managers, there is immense pressure on the managers to meet or beat analyst earnings forecasts; moreover, investors reward (penalize) firms for exceeding (missing) analyst forecasts. Reasoning that decisions taken in response to analyst forecasts involve discretionary budgets, the authors study four contingent conditions under which quarterly analyst forecasts drive unanticipated adjustments to advertising and R&D budgets, and the long-term consequences of these budgetary changes. The choice of contingent conditions is related to agency theory-driven concepts of monitoring and bonding costs. Results from a panel data set of 515 firms and a hierarchical Bayesian model that provides firm-level coefficients show that both artificially imposed incentives on managers (monitoring costs) and personal career management concerns (bonding costs) moderate the extent to which managers react to analyst forecasts. Specifically, (1) bonus versus equity proportion of CEO compensation enhances the likelihood of managers reacting to analyst forecasts with unanticipated decreases in advertising and R&D budgets; (2) output experience of CEOs decreases this likelihood; (3) throughput experience of CEOs increases this likelihood; and (4) increasing marketing and R&D intensity decreases this likelihood. The authors also find that the unanticipated adjustments in advertising and R&D budgets adversely affect long-term firm returns and risk. (c) 2016, American Marketing Association.

Buyer-supplier relationships are often framed as principal-agent relationships, based on contractual arrangements that temporarily align the goals of both parties. The underlying notion is that the relationship between buyers and suppliers is adversarial in nature and that the supplier, acting in the role of the agent, will take advantage of the principal if not sufficiently controlled. We propose that there is empirically also another type of partnership which reflects the propositions of stewardship theory. According to this theory, suppliers are motivated to work autonomously towards contractually agreed objectives. We analyse how the agency and stewardship theories differ regarding their descriptions of autonomy, motivation, identification, authority, stakeholder orientation and short- versus long-term collaboration. We analyse the case of a first-tier supplier and four second-tier suppliers situated in Turkey in the area of Istanbul which collaborate with the aim of improving their social and environmental performance. The results show that the relationship between the partners in this case has become more collaborative over time and can now be described in terms of stewardship theory rather than in terms of agency theory. We conclude that the distinction between agency and stewardship relationships is empirically meaningful in the context of supplier-buyer relationships and adds a new aspect to our understanding of how to achieve more sustainable supply chains.

Manuscript type: Empirical. Research question/issue: We empirically examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. Because campaigns for increased gender diversity may be driven by either economic efficiency or social legitimacy concerns, we condition our analysis on activists' motivations for achieving their objectives. Research findings/insights: Based on a sample of US S&P 1500 firms over 1997-2011, we find that female board representation and board independence are negatively associated with the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. We further document that financially motivated activists are more likely to target firms with extremely low female board representation than are socially motivated activists. Targeted firms significantly increase their female board representation in the two-year period following proposal initiation, relative to that of a matched sample of non-targeted firms, with no significant differences observed across activist motivations. Theoretical/academic implications: Our findings provide empirical support for the effectiveness of shareholder activism in shaping corporate governance. Our work also suggests that shareholder activists' underlying motivations are an important conditioning variable in governance research, with both agency theory and institutional theory providing insight into differing motivations. Practitioner/policy implications: Our findings suggest that shareholder proposals are an effective mechanism for increasing board diversity, irrespective of activist motivations. However, we note that mean female board representation for both targeted and non-targeted firms remains far below the level of representation sought by various activist groups. For policy-makers, this suggests that legislative action may be necessary to achieve these corporate board diversity goals in the US. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

The widely publicised product recalls of lead-paint tainted toys in 2007 caused serious concerns among consumers, investors and the government. The widespread practice of global outsourcing in toy industry further intensifies consumers and investors' uncertainties about toy safety. This paper assesses the stock market reaction to recent toy recall announcements. Based upon the theoretical underpinnings from agency theory, signalling theory and prospect theory, it also develops an understanding of factors that influence the direction and magnitude of the stock market reaction. One hundred and forty-five toy recall announcements in 2000-2014 were analysed using event study and linear regression. The results show that the announcement of a toy recall was associated with a negative stock market reaction. The stock market reaction was more negative for toy product recall announcements by retailers or distributors, smaller source firms, toys with more severe hazards and source firms with higher growth potential. This paper contributes to the product harm crisis literature by extending the automotive industry-based literature to toy industries and studying their unique features. It is important that toy industry managers are aware that the stock market penalty for a product recall increases with the degree of hazard. Moreover, toy companies, retailers and distributors with high growth potential should be aware of the signal sent by following a proactive recall strategy.

Using principal-agent theories, this study examined differences in the perceptions of nonprofit chief executive officers (CEOs) and board chairs on key governance aspects, including board performance, leadership, satisfaction with diversity, and board meetings. Using data from the CEOs and board chairs of 474 nonprofit organizations, we found statistically significant differences in the governance perceptions of these leaders of nonprofit organizations. The findings provide support for an agency theory explanation about the differing interests of principals (board chairs) and agents (CEOs). The findings suggest that these two sets of nonprofit actors frequently operate from different perspectives, potentially affecting the governance of their organizations.

We identify limits of 'reflexive governance' by examining the UK Code of Corporate Governance that is celebrated for its 'reflexivity'. By placing the historical genesis of the Code within its politico-economic context, it is shown how its scope and penetration is impeded by a shallow, 'single loop' of reflexivity. Legitimized by agency theory, the Code is infused by a 'cultural grammar' that perpetuates relations of shareholder primacy as it restricts accountability to narrow forms of information disclosure directed exclusively at shareholders. Engagement of a deeper, 'double loop' reflexivity allows account to be taken of the historical conditions and theoretical conceptions that shape practices and outcomes of corporate governance. Only then is it possible to disclose, challenge and reform narrow conceptions, boundaries and workings of 'reflexive governance'. (c) 2015, The Author(s) 2015.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of board of directors and audit committee effectiveness on the level of internet financial reporting (IFR) disclosure practices. Design/methodology/approach - The sample consists of 152 listed financial companies in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Based on agency theory, the authors posit that board of directors and audit committee effectiveness influence corporate IFR disclosure practice. Content analysis approach, based on an un-weighted index of 35 IFR items is used to measure the level of IFR disclosure. Thus, multiple regression analysis is utilized to analyse the results of this paper. Findings - The results show that board of directors and audit committee effectiveness has significant influence on the level of IFR disclosure. Research limitations/implications - One potential limitation of this paper is that the sample is drawn only from the GCC listed financial companies. Therefore, the findings cannot be generalized to other than the financial institutions. Practical implications - The finding(s) highlights the importance of board of directors and audit committee characteristics in corporate governance and in the development of financial markets that foster IFR disclosure. Originality/value - This paper extends previous IFR disclosure studies by considering both the role of board of directors and audit committee effectiveness score in examining IFR disclosure.

The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between corporate performance and corporate governance by companies listed on the Palestinian Stock Exchange. Accounting and market performance measures were used to proxy corporate performance. Corporate governance represented by the board of directors' size, the frequency of the annual meetings of the board, existence or otherwise of an audit committee, institutional investors ownership and foreign ownership. To achieve the objective of the study, all non-financial companies listed on the exchange and published their annual reports during the period between 2010 and 2012 were used. The result of the analysis revealed that corporate performance is negatively associated with corporate governance. This implies that the result is inconsistent with agency theory. This might be due to the fact that corporate governance in Palestine is still at its infancy stage. Copyright (c) 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study analyses the effects of agency conflict between "active family owners" (who participate in firm management) and "passive family owners" (who do not do so) on the performance in unlisted Spanish family firms wholly owned by family members. We employ agency theory to argue that ownership concentration by active family owners and governance mechanisms (direct control by passive family owners, existence of board of directors, and family governance mechanisms) improve the firm performance and that this effect intensifies in later-generation firms. Our findings show that family managers' ownership and family governance mechanisms have a positive influence on the performance in second- and later-generation firms. The results also show a positive effect of direct control by passive family owners over active family owners in second- and later-generation firms. However, the existence of a board of directors is not related to family firms' performance. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper addresses the effect of having multiple large shareholders on shareholder protection. More specifically, we examine to what extent this effect depends on whether such large shareholders are beneficiary or fiduciary. Research Findings/Insights: Analyzing longitudinal, hand-collected data covering Swiss listed companies, we find that having several large shareholders leads to overall higher shareholder protection (i.e. adoption of more formal corporate governance mechanisms). This is because large shareholders have an interest in putting more formal governance mechanisms in place when there is another large shareholder that might try to extract rents at the expense of others. Moreover, we find that this effect is driven by the presence of several beneficiary shareholders, i.e. shareholders that invest their own wealth in the company in contrast to dispersed ownership and fiduciary shareholders, i.e. shareholders acting on behalf of others. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Building on recent developments in agency theory, this paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by empirically showing that potential "principal-principal" conflicts among large shareholders lead to overall better shareholder protection in terms of more formal governance mechanisms being adopted. This finding contrasts with situations in which there is only one large shareholder that does not have an interest in strengthening formal corporate governance. Our findings imply, however, that the characteristics of the large shareholders matter: Fiduciary shareholders in the Swiss setting are mostly passive buy-and-hold shareholders and therefore do not engage extensively in improving shareholder protection. Beneficiary shareholders, in contrast, directly intervene in the governance of the firm (i.e. governance by voice), so that in the presence of multiple beneficiary shareholders, more formal governance mechanisms help to monitor not only management but the other large shareholders as well. In addition, more formal governance mechanisms serve as a platform to coordinate their diverging objectives. Practitioner Implications: We demonstrate the influence of a second (or several) large beneficiary shareholder(s), on corporate governance and the benefit to all shareholders. In addition, we propose the strengthening of governance mechanisms as a platform to reconcile conflicting interests among prominent shareholders and contribute to the debate on the allocation of certain voting privileges to long-term shareholders.

Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent of risk disclosure and the factors determining this for all listed banks in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach-Relying on a theoretical framework based on agency theory and the creation of a risk disclosure index (RDI) based on International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, Basel II: market discipline, and prior literature, hand-collected data from the annual reports of all 30 banks traded on the Dhaka Stock Exchange over 2007-2012, creating 180 bank-year observations, are analysed. Findings-The study suggests that implementation of IFRS 7 and Basel II: market discipline standards in a non-mandated environment raised the extent of risk disclosure in every category of financial institution risk (market, credit, liquidity, operational and equities). The effect can be attributed to regulatory concerns and voluntary adoption of international disclosure standards in the banking industry in Bangladesh. Specifically, whilst the determinants of disclosure vary across types of risk, the number of risk committees, leverage, company size, the existence of a risk management unit, board size and a Big4 affiliate auditor are significant determinants of at least one category of risk disclosure. Research limitations/implications-The source of risk disclosures is limited to listed banks' annual reports. Practical implications-The RDI, developed in this paper, contributes to the literature by: first, quantifying the extent of each of five types of risk disclosure; and second, identifying the factors determining them. Stakeholders, particularly depositors and investors, can use this index to select or monitor their bank of interest. Originality/value-The RDI was developed according to the most relevant standards-IFRS 7 and Basel II: market discipline, plus prior scholarly literature. This type of benchmarking has not been conducted to date in previous studies. Inferences about risk disclosure are based on archival data derived from all listed banks in a virtually unregulated environment. Further, the study complements the literature by providing support for the applicability of agency theory in investigating the level of risk disclosure by banks.

This study examines the impact of CEO inside debt on earnings management. Theory predicts that CEOs with higher inside debt holdings adopt less risky corporate policies and choose investment policies that result in less volatile earnings. Under such circumstances, CEOs would face weaker demand for income smoothing. Consistent with these expectations, our results reveal that CEO inside debt is negatively associated with both accrualand real activities-based earnings management. We also find that firms with higher levels of CEO inside debt are less likely to meet or slightly beat analysts' earnings forecasts. Furthermore, the capital market response to positive earnings surprises is greater when CEOs hold higher positions of inside debt. Overall, our findings suggest that inside debt counteracts CEOs' incentives to smooth earnings through earnings management and investors understand the deterrence effect of inside debt on earnings management.

This study incorporates insights from both institutional and family socioemotional wealth perspectives with agency theory to examine the relationships among governance practices, family ownership, and information disclosure quality. Employing a sample of 516 publicly listed firms in Taiwan over a period of 5 years (2006-2010), we found that high levels of board independence and board activity have a significant positive effect on disclosure quality. Further, family ownership positively moderated the relationship between board independence and disclosure quality. This relationship is stronger with a higher level of family ownership. The results support the institutional proposition that family-owned firms that pursue socioemotional wealth are more likely to promote information transparency to gain legitimacy and enhance their reputations with outside stakeholders.

CEO succession is a key theoretical and empirical issue in the fields of organizations and strategic management. Previous studies investigating the influences and effects of CEO succession mostly focus on post-succession contexts. This study focuses on the pre-succession context and offers a comprehensive theoretical framework based on agency theory and stewardship theory. Specifically, this study empirically tests the influence of several pre-succession factors on the founding CEO's decision to either sell the family firm or hire a professional manager as a successor. The results show that executive compensation schemes and industry dynamism separately influence the degree of stewardship through perceived pay premium and industrial growth potential. The findings help explain CEO succession decision-making in family firms, and provide empirical evidence for the incentive mechanisms between executive compensation schemes, industry dynamism, and professional managers' stewardship behaviors. This study broadens agency theory, stewardship theory, and upper echelons theory's explanation of CEO succession decision-making in family firms. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Many governments seek to impose diversity in the boardroom, but the consequences of doing so are inconsistent and could decrease firm performance and economies. This paper shed light on this diversity at board level topic by conceptualizing the relationships as firm value and diverse board. Reasonable theoretical arguments drawn from Upper-echelon theory and agency theory suggest that board characteristics (gender, ethnic and age diversity) may have either a positive, negative, or neutral effect on the firm value. To investigate this phenomenon relevant hypotheses are developed to test diversity at board level and its impact on firm value with the use of appropriate variables and measures. A total sample of large 60 top Malaysian non-financial companies is selected on the basis of their market capitalization from the population of 938 listed companies of Bursa, Malaysia. To investigate this empirical study, data were collected from the Datastream (Thomson Reuters) database and manually, over the period 2009 to 2013 (5 years). This study incorporates econometrics methodology on panel data analysis, which is used rigorously for hypothesis testing. The age profile of Directors has a significant positive impact on firm value. However, gender and ethnic diversity have no significant impact on firm value. The results indicate that demographic diversity at board level does have a relationship with market value.

Purpose: This study aims to understand the antecedents of export performance at the firm level. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, the authors investigate how the board composition determines the export competitiveness of the firms operating in an emerging country from the point of view of corporate governance mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations. The separation of chairman of board of directors and chief executive officer (CEO) positions has significantly positive impact on export performance. On the other hand, the authors find no support for the position that inside director professional representation neither reduce nor increase all measures of export performance of firms. In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Findings: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is a negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations.

In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Research limitations/implications: Export performance is one of the most widely researched areas within international marketing research but least reached topic of management. However, exporting continues to be an important mode of internationalization for multinational companies, especially operating an emerging economy. This study is one of the first studies on the impact of governance factors such as board structure on only export performance rather than overall (firm) performance in light of international management. In other words, the study of the determinants of exports in the context of an emerging economy is an important contribution to the literature, given that our understanding of how the board composition determines the export competitiveness from the point of view of firms operating in an emerging country such as Turkey. Moreover, this research investigates this relationship at objective export performance dimensions using primary data set from listed and non-listed export firms. Practical implications: The current study offered in-depth information to multinational companies that aim to gain a competitive exporting advantage in Turkey. Further, the results of this study give managers an opportunity to see the reasons behind the success of the exporting firms from the point of view of corporate governance mechanism. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors contribute to this recent stream of research providing evidence on the effects of governance mechanism on the export performance from the point of view of emerging countries. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, and international management, the authors provide a new framework that models the linkages between board composition and export performance. This work helps us to gain a deeper understanding of how board dynamics contribute to the internalization of firms. Research in this area has been sparse, although some studies have linked governance with export intensity. In this effort, the authors differentiate from previous studies in several ways.

Based on Upper Echelons Theory and Agency Theory, we explore the effect of CEOs' power through their tenure, board committee membership and other corporate governance factors on idiosyncratic volatility. Our study addresses the gap in the literature to find the direct link between the source of corporate governance practices and idiosyncratic volatility in stock price. We use a generalised method of moments in a panel analysis of Australian firms for 2004-2013 and a robust model that controls for firm size, firm age, trading volume, market-to-book ratio, dividend payout, the global financial crisis, product market competition and financial intermediaries. We find that CEOs who have stronger managerial power are associated with lower idiosyncratic volatility. This determining factor remains significant with the inclusion of widely-researched firm characteristics and external factors on idiosyncratic volatility in our robust analysis.

This study extends the family firm performance literature by focusing on birth order differences among descendant CEOs. Data collected from a sample of Korean family firms yield three insights. First, descendant birth order is directly associated with differences in the distribution of control through ownership, leadership (i.e., CEO), and the incorporation of outside board participation and governance. Second, descendant birth order also moderates the relationship between outside block holdings and firm performance. Third, we find evidence suggesting that because of firm performance differences, first-son descendant CEOs may find themselves more often replaced over time. (c) 2016, (c) The Author(s) 2016.

We tested the organization-level effects of manager pay-for-performance practices on nonmanagement employee turnover within the context of agency theory and equity theory-two frameworks commonly applied to understand compensation policy and practice. We also propose an alternative theoretical perspective that predicts that managerial pay-for-performance policies may strain the employment relationship and increase nonmanagement employee turnover, unless there are HR practices that train and incentivize managers to treat employees well. We compare these alternative models to establish how well each framework explains the observed effects. Agency theory and equity theory receive limited empirical support in our lagged panel data set of organizations, whereas broader empirical support is established for the strain effect of manager pay-for-performance on the employment relationship. We discuss the implications of our findings for compensation theory, research, and practice. (c)2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study presents evidence of the influence of gender diversity on the pay system and the monitoring of executives in Spain. In this country/context, characterized by a few male dominant shareholders acting simultaneously as executives, there is an ongoing discussion regarding the enactment of laws to promote gender equality on the boards of directors of large listed companies. This paper presents several contributions. On the one hand, the scarce previous evidence on this topic is focused on US firms. On the other hand, this study includes the role of ownership structure as a factor that indirectly moderates the relationships between gender diversity on board and monitoring effectiveness in terms of executive directors' compensation. Furthermore, this paper makes an important effort to control endogeneity. The sample examined includes 120 companies listed on the Spanish stock market during the period 2004-2011. The results show a positive and highly significant effect of the presence of women independent directors on the proportion of variable pay in the compensation of executive directors. Our findings also point out the negative moderating effect of ownership concentration: the more concentrated is ownership in the hands of internal majority shareholder, the less is the link between board diversity and pay-for-performance systems.

Empirical findings on the relationship between CEO shareholdings and earnings manipulation are inconclusive. In response, this study attempts to shed more light by suggesting that this relationship is influenced by situational contingencies that affect CEO perceptions of the costs and benefits associated with earnings manipulation. To support this perspective we draw on the prospect theory and the approach/inhibition theory of power to examine the relationship between CEO shareholdings and earnings manipulation in light of CEO power. We test this relationship on a sample of 16,873 observations from 2,257 US public firms. Findings show that increasing CEO shareholdings has a negative effect on earnings management, and on re-statements due to irregularities, and that duality positively moderates these relationships. The findings contribute to the corporate governance practice since they have implications for the design of CEO remuneration packages. (c) 2016 European Academy of Management.

The ownership structure of Chinese firms has experienced significant changes over the last three decades, including the development of a fast growing stock market through which a large number of domestic firms have become publicly traded corporations. These changes have drawn increasing attention from researchers of corporate governance. In this article, we review the empirical research on corporate governance in China, with a focus on the internal and external governance mechanisms that have been investigated and the findings about the effectiveness of these mechanisms. On the basis of our review of 132 studies, we summarize the major findings and discuss the limitation of agency theory in understanding the governance issue in Chinese firms. We offer several ideas (e.g., the importance of the social context, new conceptualization of governance, different outcomes of governance, and data/method issues) for a new agenda to guide future research in the corporate governance of firms operating in the Chinese and other emerging economy contexts.

This contribution outlines the rising and promising research topic related to investment readiness level (IRL) of Small and Medium Sized Companies (SMEs). To advance this field of investigation and to bring potential future research directions to light, this paper reviews and explores the current state of research by means of a literature review contemplating quantitative facets in the methodology. While facilitating comparisons in applied methods of earlier development and progress, it uncovers core areas where research is still required. By considering the present body of literature focusing on the IRL of SMEs as a whole, this paper ends by proposing two essential recommendations for future research effort. The paper captures the multi-faceted nature of IRL to reveal the range of conditions of alternative financial sources affecting the activities of researchers, entrepreneurs, investors and politicians alike.

This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by examining relations between family involvement and CEO compensation. Using a panel of 362 small U.S. listed firms, we analyze how founding families influence firm performance through option portfolio price sensitivity. Consistent with the dual agency framework, we find that family firms have lower CEO incentive pay, which is further reduced by higher executive ownership. Interestingly, such incentive pay offsets the positive impact that families have on firm valuation. Collectively, our results show that, compared with nonfamily firms, lower incentive pay adopted by family firms due to lower agency costs mitigates the direct effect of family involvement on firm performance. Once accounting for CEO incentive pay, we do not observe performance differences between family and nonfamily firms. (c) 2016 International Council for Small Business

Purpose: Borrowing from arguments of agency theory, the present study aims to investigate the moderating effect of the deviation from optimal franchising on the relationship between corporate governance provisions and firm financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 35 publicly listed US restaurant firms for the 1990-2008 period. The study uses a hierarchical regression with cross-sectional time-series fixed effects. Findings: The results show that the deviation from optimal franchising worsens the negative relationship between corporate governance provisions and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The availability of governance data restricts our sample to large publicly listed firms in the US restaurant industry, limiting the ability to generalize results for small and privately held restaurant firms. Practical implications: Firm executives should not only pay attention to which corporate governance provisions they adopt but also strive to maintain an optimal level of franchising. Originality/value: The key contribution of this study to governance literature is that this study demonstrates how the presence of multiple governance mechanisms influences firm performance.

Recent studies have criticized MBA programs for their association with self-serving behavior, although there is little empirical research to establish the firm-level consequences of that relationship. We explored whether MBAs versus non-MBAs in a sample of celebrated CEOs of major U.S. companies--thus CEOs who have achieved and had opportunity to exploit their fame--were more apt than their counterparts to engage in self-serving behavior that benefits them but disadvantages their companies. We assessed this behavior via the pursuit of costly growth strategies, an inability to sustain performance, and the capacity to obtain superior private benefits in compensation. Our analysis of 444 star CEOs celebrated on the covers of major business publications confirmed that an MBA education either fosters or is related to such behavior among these executives.

Recent analyses of U.S. public family firms (PFFs) show that family firms outperform other forms of organization. However, scholars call for more studies to determine why PFFs outperform the market. High performance work systems (HPWSs) reflect the extent to which an organization adopts and implements a strategic approach in HRM practices and could be why PFFs outperform. Using the stewardship perspective, agency theory, and the resource-based view of the firm, this study empirically examines the relationship among family governance oversight, HPWS, and performance at PFFs. Using a sample of 159 Taiwanese public firms, the empirical results indicate that independent directors on the board and the level of family member board participation associate with HPWS adoption. Adopting HPWS also mediates the effect of independent directors and subjective firm performance. This finding has both theoretical and practical implications. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Borrowing from agency theory and using a sample of 145 entrepreneurs, this study contributes to entrepreneurship literature by providing a fine-grained explanation about how a decision-making mechanism such as decentralization influences the relationship between family involvement and innovativeness, and risk taking of family firms. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the importance of considering heterogeneity of family firms and the focal role of decentralization in spurring up firm-level entrepreneurship.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore factors influencing the effectiveness of buyer initiated behavioral-based governance methods (BBGMs). The ability of BBGMs to improve supplier performance is assessed considering power imbalances and the resource intensiveness of the BBGM. Agency Theory is used as an interpretive lens. Design/methodology/approach: An explorative multiple case study approach is used to collect qualitative and quantitative data from buying companies involved in 13 BBGMs. Findings: Drawing on Agency Theory several factors are identified which can explain BBGM effectiveness considering power differences and the resource intensiveness of the BBGM. The data show that even high resource intensive BBGMs can be implemented effectively if there are benefits for a powerful supplier. Cultural influences and uncertainty of the business environment also play a role. Originality/value: This study develops a series of propositions indicating that Agency Theory can provide valuable guidance on how to better understand the effectiveness of BBGMs. Underlying mechanisms are identified that explain how power imbalance does not necessarily make improvement initiatives unsuccessful.

In this study, we examine how board characteristics, such as the independent director ratio, board size, and the number of interlocks, influence the investment of slack resources into research and development (R&D) by a firm. Both the agency theory and resource dependence theory predict a positive influence of independent director ratio on the financial slack-R&D investment relationship. However in the case of board size and number of interlocks, resource dependence theory argues for a positive moderating effect, while agency theory predicts a negative effect. The hypotheses are tested on the seven-year panel data of 172 firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry, an emerging economy, high technology industry. We find broad support for the resource provisioning role of the board of directors, which is attributed to the emerging economy context of the Indian pharmaceutical industry, where firms face high levels of opportunity but lack resources to make use of them effectively.

Purpose: Research disputes whether family businesses are more or less innovative than their nonfamily counterparts. So far, no consistent results have been achieved. The recently introduced willingness and ability framework suggest that idiosyncratic behavior is only to be expected if both sufficiency conditions - willingness and ability - are fulfilled. The purpose of this paper is to test this hypothesis empirically. Design/methodology/approach: A large cross-sectional sample of German small- and medium-sized enterprises is used. The sample offers - alongside numerous moderators commonly used in innovation research - several family firm definitions. Given the censored nature of the endogenous variable chosen, a Tobit model is used. Findings: Drawing upon agency theory and the ability and willingness paradox in family firm innovation, it finds family firms to be less innovative only if both willingness and ability conditions are fulfilled. Originality/value: To the best of the knowledge, the study provides the first attempt to test the willingness and ability theorem. Therefore, the commonly used family firm-specific measures (self-assessment-, ownership-, and management criterion) are operationalized to better understand swwhat drives innovativeness in family firms. The findings thus add to the ongoing discussion on what really drives family impact on firm-level decisions. (c) 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study investigates the association between investment decisions and financial reporting quality in the context of family firms versus non-family firms. Building on the classic agency theory and the behavioral agency theory, we argue that financial reporting quality may play a different role on investment decisions for family and non-family firms. We address our research question by using a sample of listed firms in Taiwan from 1996 to 2011. Consistent with the behavioral agency theory, our findings suggest that family firms are more likely to under-invest than non-family firms in order to protect their socioemotional wealth, and financial reporting quality is more negatively associated with family firms' under-investment behavior. The existence of internal financing channels attenuates this negative association. However, this study does not find a significant role on such association when a family member serves as the chief executive officer. These results are robust after controlling for the potential endogeneity issue of financial reporting quality, alternate measures of inefficient investment as well as internal financing channels, family firm subsample, and different industry groups. This study contributes to the literature on the relation between financial reporting quality and investment decisions by highlighting the unique characteristics of family firms.

On the basis of agency theory and resource dependence theory, as well as other corporate governance literature, it is predicted that board composition measured as the ratio of non-executive to executive board members and the number of directors on a firm's board can be positively related to firm performance. This study seeks to test the predictions of this body of theory and to investigate the form of the empirical relationships among these effects. In so doing, this study tests theory that relates these variables in the context of a developing country, using data from South Africa's Johannesburg Stock Exchange, over a seven-year period, 2006-2012.

With the aim of achieving an advanced understanding of current research on unrelated diversification and providing fruitful groundwork to foster active interchange between disciplinary traditions, this paper detects articles from two relevant research streams; i.e., strategic management and financial economics. We first provide a brief overview of management thinking on unrelated diversification strategy. Then, we present a conceptual map that offers a comprehensive appreciation of unrelated diversification strategy antecedents (i.e., environmental and institutional, organizational value-enhancing, and managerial drivers), implementation process (i.e., managerial complexity, misallocation of resources, and structural inertia), and consequences (i.e., diversification premiums and discounts). Finally, we unpack the major gaps in our current knowledge that may help refocus the research agenda on unrelated diversification strategy and revamp the apparent waning proclivity of this issue.

Purpose: Many sales organizations use traditional control systems such as agency theory, which entails motivating salespeople using rewards and punishments, as if they are mechanical beings that are devoid of emotions and spirit. Research shows that such control leads to dissatisfied customers, disengaged salespeople and poor organizational reputation. The purpose of this study is to present governance based on workplace spirituality as an alternative approach, wherein salespeople's emotional and spiritual development is given primary importance. This is proposed to result in favorable performance and behaviors in alignment with organizational and customer goals. Design/methodology/approach: The study builds a conceptual model from an extended literature review. Findings: The developed conceptual model for workplace spirituality-based governance in sales organization consists of organizational structural factors, such as control and reward systems, as antecedents of psychological experiences of workplace spirituality in salespeople. These experiences are then proposed to result in salespeople's increased customer orientation and objective performance, with organizational commitment as a mediator. Practical Implications: The study has implications for organizations that govern salespeople by fiddling constantly with their salespeople's incentive plans but find that most of these changes have little effect. The study proposes that companies will have more satisfied customers and successful salespeople, if they manage their salespeople's emotional and spiritual side. Originality/value: This study is the first to devise a governance system in selling organizations that is based on workplace spirituality. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between ownership structure and indebtedness for a sample of 2,544 Spanish small and medium enterprises. A System Generalized Method of Moments methodology is applied to control for the heterogeneity and endogeneity problems. The finding shows a negative effect of several measures of ownership on debt ratio. Therefore, the presence of an individual as main shareholder has a positive effect on debt, while the presence of a corporation as main shareholder exerts a negative influence. As research implications, this paper includes the agency problem based on principal-principal conflicts to explain the capital structure of small and medium enterprises, going beyond traditional principal-agent conflicts. The main practical implications of the paper is that owners who seek equity financing can use the results of this study for understanding better why investors are reluctant to invest in their small and medium enterprises. Policymakers can use the results of this study to develop better policies and to promote better provision of information for all stakeholders. About the contribution of this study, we are not aware of any paper that uses a panel of small and medium enterprises operating in a French-civil law country to examine the relationship between indebtedness and three different proxies of the ownership structure.

Jensen (1986) predicts that managers with more free cash flows (FCF) available show an opportunistic behavior, which leads to the emergence of the FCF risk. Consequently, determining the relative importance of factors affecting the FCF risks is vital. The major purpose of this article is testing Jensen's assertion by identifying relative significance of the factors influencing FCF risks via artificial neural network (ANN). In effect, seven independent variables relating to FCF risks including debt policy, ownership concentration, ownership level, managerial ownership, state ownership, size of the firm, and profitability draw on the literature. The study collects 1224 company-year data from Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) for the period 2001-2010. The study applies the Pearson's correlation and a three layer ANN. The results of testing the hypotheses show that, among the preceding 7 factors, profitability is the most important factor in determining FCF risks. Following profitability, the second and third most important factors are the debt policy and size of the company. Consequently, this finding posits a great implication for the stock markets and contradicts Jensen's (1986) study. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Islamic banks are banks that are set up to operate within the Islamic business framework that is more equitable and based on socio-economic welfare of the society and the people. In Islamic law on commercial transactions and other related contractual activities (the framework), transparency and adequate disclosure are the fundamental determinants of a successful and peaceful relationship between the contracting parties. This is because the stakeholders of Islamic banks believed that the prescriptions of the framework would be the key determinants of the bank's Ethical Identity Disclosures (EID). This study aimed at exploring and identifying the practical determinants of EID in Islamic banks. Disclosure information in annual reports (from 2007 to 2011) of 21 Islamic banks operating in Bahrain and Malaysia was gathered and analysed using Ethical Identity Index (EII) and Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) models. The results of EII and MRA on nine ethical disclosure dimensions consisting of 80 constructs and 4 assumed determinants of EID among Islamic banks indicated that EID of both countries is low and that independent directors do not affect the level of social disclosure. However, board size, Shari'ah supervisory Board and investment account holders can significantly influence the disclosure level in Islamic banks. Hence, we conclude that our findings are in conflict with main theories such as agency theory, however supports institutional theory.

Firms simultaneously choose both their capital and their executive compensation structure. Using the Internal Revenue Code 162(m) tax law as an exogenous shock to compensation structure in a natural experiment setting, I identify firm leverage changes as a result of chief executive officer (CEO) option compensation changes. The evidence provides strong support for debt agency theory. Firms appear to decrease leverage when CEOs are paid with more options and when CEO options become a higher percentage of future cash flows. The findings are robust to controlling for corporate governance and convertible debt. (c) 2015 Financial Management Association International

Prior research suggests that information technology (IT) project escalation can result from the deaf effect, a phenomenon in which decision makers fail to heed risk warnings communicated by others. Drawing inspiration from stewardship theory, we posited that when messengers carrying risk warnings about a project are seen as collaborative partners, decision makers are more likely to heed the message. Conversely, we theorized that when messengers are seen as opponents, decision makers are more likely to exhibit the deaf effect. We further posited that certain psychological factors (i.e., framing and perceived control) would moderate the effect of the messenger-recipient relationship on the deaf effect. To test these ideas, we conducted two experiments. When messengers were seen as collaborative partners, recipients assigned more relevance to the risk warning and perceived a higher risk, making them less willing to continue the project. Framing the outcomes associated with redirecting or continuing the project in terms of losses (rather than gains) weakened this effect. However, when recipients perceived a high degree of control over the project the effect was strengthened. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.

This study aims to investigate the influence of board interlocking in income smoothing practices in public companies with shares traded on the BM&FBOVESPA. To achieve this objective we adopted a sample comprised of 58 Brazilian companies included in the Bovespa index. The study is classified as empirical and analytical and uses as a proxy for income smoothing a metric called the "smoothing factor" (SF), obtained through the factor analysis technique using the metrics EM1 and EM3 from Leuz, Nanda and Wysocki (2003). As independent variables we employed indicators of social network analysis. From a theoretical point of view, the study is relevant and innovates in making the connection between the resource dependence theory, the agency theory and board interlocking. In practical terms, the study shows the effects of the constitutive elements of corporate social networks, arising from the board interlocking structure, on income smoothing accounting practices. Regression with panel data using fixed effects showed that the constituent elements of corporate social networks tend to influence the practice of smoothing in the sample used. The results of the study show that companies that share board members with other organizations which smooth their results tend to adopt this organizational practice more easily, which can be explained by: (i) companies causing variations in performance due to operational decisions or financial reporting choices; and (ii) managers making use of discretionary practices in the reporting of profits.

In this study we are concerned with understanding Israeli entrepreneurs' selection criteria in choosing a venture capital (VC) firm. Our primary aim was to investigate how startup experience impacts entrepreneurs' trade-offs between resource-related criteria and criteria related to the conditions of the deal. Hypotheses are drawn from agency theory, the resource dependence perspective and extant VC research. Data is gleaned from interviews with 144 Israeli entrepreneurs that are either in the process of acquiring VC or have recent experience of raising it. Hypotheses are tested with ordinal logit models. Results demonstrate that there is a negative relationship between startup experience and the importance entrepreneurs attach to valuation, and that the importance attached to a VC firm's network and reputation moderates this relationship. In addition, the importance attached to a VC firm's network moderates the relationship between startup experience and the importance assigned to contractual terms. Furthermore, results indicate that while inexperienced entrepreneurs attach more importance to valuation than experienced ones, they tend to emphasize it less when they seek to gain access to a VC firm's network of contacts. Entrepreneurs are shown to be more concerned about valuation when they approach less reputable VC firms, particularly if the entrepreneur has substantial startup experience.

While privatization has long been a central pro-market strategy for promoting competitiveness, little is known about which aspects of this multilevel process impact firm performance. Agency theory predicts that privatization will improve firm performance due to changes in monitoring by shareholders, the incentives of management, and the political control of the government. Measuring how each of these three pathways impact firm performance separately is difficult, however, as most privatizations result in the transfer of both ownership and control to private investors, influencing several of these pathways at once. This article is able to circumvent this limitation by examining changes to firm performance from the minority privatization of Indonesian state-owned firms during whic\h firms experience only changes in monitoring, as majority state ownership and control remain the same. Difference-in-differences analyses suggest that changes to monitoring improve firm performance by 9-13%, controlling for cross-sectional, time-invariant, and time-varying firm characteristics, macroeconomic issues affecting all firms, selection issues, and considering several alternative hypotheses. Altogether, this article suggests that firm performance via privatization can improve through changes to monitoring alone, without implementing the costly organizational changes required by complete privatization or requiring that the state relinquish control of socially important firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between boards and board activity and subsequent business performance, in the context of high-growth companies, through the lens of decision making and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: A critical realist approach was used to conduct a longitudinal multiple-case study of two medium-sized, quasi-public high-growth companies. Data collection included first-hand observations of boards in session, semi-structured interviews with key actors and the inspection of board and company documentation. An iterative approach to analysis was used to gain an in-depth understanding of how the boards worked and how they sought to exert influence. Findings: The paper provides empirical insight about board involvement in strategic management. A proactive involvement by boards in the strategy development process and assessment of strategic options, and a collaborative form of board involvement in strategic management together with management is indicated as being important if the board is to exert influence beyond the boardroom. A conceptual model of a collaborative form of board-management interaction is developed. Practical implications: The paper provides guidance for boards, suggesting that a more direct level of involvement in strategic management by the board together with management may be material to improved business performance. Originality/value: The paper responds to calls for more research on the relationship between boards and business performance. It contributes much-needed first-hand evidence from within the boardroom.

Despite the increasing use of the agency perspective in studies of headquarters-subsidiaries relations in the multinational corporation (MNC), opponents fundamentally question its utility. In an attempt to contribute to this debate, we evaluate prior studies and develop considerations for future research. Our review of extant studies of headquarters-subsidiaries relations that make (explicit) use of the agency perspective reveals two significant shortcomings. First, we identify a need to validate the underlying assumptions when using the agency perspective in studies of headquarters-subsidiaries relations. Second, we detect a need to better account for the complex nature of headquarters-subsidiary relations in the MNC. A focus on these two areas can improve the use of the agency perspective and, ultimately, help resolve the contentious debate over the utility of the agency perspective.

This paper considers the potential role played by different kinds of shareholders in a firm's international level, distinguishing the firms quoted in the UK from those listed in the countries of Continental Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain). Our results confirm that different kinds of ownership affect the overall level of a firm's internationalisation. Family ownership has a negative impact on foreign sales in the UK but not in Continental Europe, while bank ownership has a negative impact on the scope of FDI in Continental Europe but no impact whatsoever in the UK. Institutional investors positively impact the scope of both foreign sales and FDI in the UK, while in Continental Europe they have a negative impact on foreign sales. These different results contribute to explaining why previous studies that have focused on just one country or a single measurement of internationalisation have come up with such contrasting results.

This paper examines the effects of board quality on the relationship between corporate bankruptcy and nomination committee effectiveness. We argue that the proportion of outside directors, a proxy of board quality, arguably captures the extent of board control and resources. Based on dataset from 1835 firm-year observations for 98 bankrupt and 269 non-bankrupt UK listed non-financial firms between 1994 and 2011 and using the agency and resource dependence theories, we predict and find that nomination committee effectiveness negatively affects corporate bankruptcy and that board quality mitigates the negative effects. The results lend support to the notion that firms benefit from board quality in terms of outside directors' ability to monitor CEO on behalf of shareholders and also provide advice, counsel and legitimacy to the firm. This study extends the present research on corporate bankruptcy by providing evidence on the impact of board quality and nomination committee effectiveness on UK corporate bankruptcy.

In this study, we investigate how persuasiveness of self-Assessment-based post-completion auditing (PCA) reports on capital investment is constructed. We examine what makes companies consider that information in these reports rises to an acceptable quality level. The investigation was motivated by extant agency theory (AT) informed literature suggesting that self-Auditing will entail obvious risks for the quality of PCA reports in terms of data manipulation. We employed actor-network theory as our method theory. The empirical evidence of our case study came from 24 semi-structured interviews and the analysis of the construction of 22 PCA reports of strategic investments in one of the major European forest companies. We add to the capital budgeting literature by identifying and discussing the role of various conditions affecting the construction of persuasiveness of PCA reports. We maintain that the existence of three conditions (i.e. An appropriate collective process, alignment with relevant external/internal reference points, and following of formal guidance) can play a major role in facilitating the production of a persuasive PCA report. Additionally, the paper is able to make sense of the complex process of fabricating the persuasiveness of PCA reports, which would remain a black box when examined from the AT viewpoint only.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Governments worldwide bestow orders of merit upon their citizens as a recognition of distinguished service. In this paper, I study whether orders of merit can function as an external form of perquisite through which the government can supplement the compensation given by a publicly listed firm to the CEO. Research Findings/Insights: I build upon the literature on perquisites to develop hypotheses on the relationship between orders of merit and executive compensation. The predictions are tested through an empirical analysis that revolves around the 1974 legal reform in which Sweden discontinued the conferral of orders of merit to citizens. The difference-in-differences methodology I employ enables me to make causal statements on the relationship between orders of merit, firm performance, and monetary compensation. I find that orders of merit function as symbols that visibly confirm social status vis-a-vis the general public and are valued by CEOs as a substitute for the need to engage in conspicuous consumption. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support that orders of merit can be seen as an external form of perquisite that can substitute for monetary compensation. Essentially, this is evidence that governments can affect CEO salaries through the provision of a non-monetary status good. The findings also indicate that CEOs not only care about distinguishing themselves as "superstars" among their peer group of corporate leaders but also value non-monetary symbols that emphasize their social status in relation to the general public. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Companies should take into account that CEOs may receive valuable status goods from the government when determining compensation policies. In addition, governments should consider that the removal of non-monetary awards may result in higher levels of monetary compensation in publicly listed firms. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

We draw on archival resources and maritime and accounting history literature to explore the role of Royal Navy (RN) pursers between 1665 and 1832. Through an agency theory lens, we investigate accounting-related practices pursers used to control consumable rations, including the 'purser's (short) measure.' The records pursers were required to keep suggest that the RN was at the forefront of the development of cost and materials accounting, and in the keeping of detailed accounting records. We provide fresh insights in to the purser's role and his association with the gestation of materials waste controls, standard costing, and audit and accountability processes.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide insights into the conduct of recruitment process outsourcing (RPO), based on a real-life case study of one company in Malaysia. The paper analyses the company's process of recruitment outsourcing from beginning to end, in three sections: RPO decision, RPO implementation and RPO outcome. Design/methodology/approach - The case study was carried out through semi-structured interviews with relevant respondents, including the country HR manager, the HR staff and operation managers in the organisation, plus with the RPO provider. Findings - The key findings, from a theoretical and academic viewpoint, are that RPO decisions and implementation cannot be fully or properly explained by one theory, but are better explained by integrating transaction cost economics, the resource-based view and the Agency Theory. The study also highlights the importance of involving end users in the RPO process. Research limitations/implications - While this single case study gives a clear, in-depth insight into the issues in this particular instance, future research extending to a wider range of organisations would serve to expand the findings and provide more generalisable results. Practical implications - Practitioners and service providers should be able to draw valuable lessons from the experience of Tech-solution, particularly from the different perceptions and levels of satisfaction about the service provider's performance between internal HR and the internal end users (operation managers). Originality/value - This paper provides a specific and detailed analysis of RPO implementation in practice. It also addresses the call for more RPO outsourcing-specific research in the extant literature. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

A key decision for the design of principal-agent agreements is how much control or authority the buyer (or principal) should be allowed to exercise in relation to the seller (or agent). Historically, agency theory has viewed exchange agreements as ranging from those in which the buyer has very high authority over the seller (formal authority) to those in which the buyer and seller are relatively independent so there is little or no authority relation (market exchange). However, some principal-agent agreements reverse the authority relationship usually assumed in agency theory by allowing the seller to exercise authority over the buyer. The authors study this unexplored type of agency agreement and refer to it as "authority relinquishment." Using data collected from interviews with clients and guides on commercial high-altitude mountain expeditions, the authors identify conditions that make authority relinquishment likely. They also identify the benefits and drawbacks of authority relinquishment and compare them with the benefits and drawbacks of two frequently studied approaches to managing agency relationships - formal authority and authority decentralization.

We propose a model of security governance that draws upon agency theory to conceptualize the InfoSec function as a fiduciary for business users. We introduce a ternary typology of governance and test the efficacy of governance on goal congruence and information asymmetry. Our survey of information security managers finds that: (1) governance enhances goal congruence but does not impact information asymmetry, and (2) perceived information security service effectiveness is positively related to both information asymmetry and goal congruence. Contrary to what agency theory suggests, in the InfoSec context, information asymmetry can be exactly what is needed to enhance the principal's welfare. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications of these findings. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional agency theory predicts that when a large company is trading solvently, shareholders will align their interests with those of the directors, but that this may also mean that when the company is financially distressed, directors will prefer shareholder interests to those of the creditors (even if there is no residual value for the shareholders in the company). Both the law and the market respond to this problem, and to date the situation has been held in some sort of approximate balance. However, this article examines the consequences of alignment of shareholder and director interests when a large private equity company is in financial distress, in light of the debt restructuring which is likely to be in contemplation and the type of director who is often retained. It argues that in these cases directors may have an incentive to support creditors' debt restructuring plans, and, paradoxically, the closer the alignment of their interests and those of the shareholders when the company is trading solvently, the greater this incentive to prefer creditors may be (even if there is still a residual interest for the shareholders in the company). The implications of this for the law and for the market are explored. (c) 2016, The Author(s).

This study aimed to examine a long-term motivation for franchising by considering the influence of experience franchisors gain through conducting the franchising strategy. The study mainly investigates the moderating effect of franchising experience on the relationship between three main motivations for franchising (derived from agency theory, resource scarcity theory, and risk-sharing theory) and firms' degree of franchising in the restaurant context. Dynamic panel data model was employed and the findings suggest that not only do restaurant companies' franchising experience positively affect firms' degree of franchising, but also that those experiences positively moderate the relationship between risk-sharing motivation and the degree of franchising. The findings lead to theoretical and practical implications and suggestions for future research. (c) International Association of Hospitality Financial Management Education.

This paper investigates whether auditors' client acceptance and pricing decisions following the resignation of the incumbent auditor in family firms are significantly different from those in non-family firms. Relying on the auditing literature (client acceptance and audit pricing) and using insights from the agency theory, we document that successor auditors incorporate a firm's ownership structure into their acceptance and pricing decisions following the resignation of the incumbent auditor. Big 4 auditors are more likely to serve as successor auditors following auditor resignations in family firms as opposed to non-family firms. The changes in audit fees following auditor resignations in family firms, however, are significantly smaller than those in non-family firms. These results hold when we account for whether a family firm is managed by a founder, a descendant, or by a professional manager, and when we use the percentage of shares held by the family members as another proxy for family ownership. Additional analysis further demonstrates that the likelihood of financial restatements in family firms in the post-resignation period are significantly lower than those in non-family firms. Overall, our findings suggest that Big 4 auditors perceive family firms from which the incumbent auditors resigned as being less risky than their non-family counterparts.

Given the growth of franchising globally, now is an important time to consider the international expansion trends of franchisors. This study examines current trends in the international expansion plans of United States franchisors using a unique data set drawn from 438 announcements on the International Franchise Association's website made by 85 franchisors over nine years. The findings describe the scope, duration, markets, entry modes used, and expansion rationale. Contrary to past practices, United States franchisors are more focused on expanding into the emerging markets of Asia rather than the developed markets of the West. It appears that they are attracted by the growth in these markets. Finally, the results are used to summarize the key trends in international franchise expansion and to generate propositions for future research. Some limitations and implications for practice are discussed. (c) 2016, Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Whereas the agency theory predicts that dual-class shares decrease firm performance, the stewardship theory predicts that dual-class shares increase firm performance. The cumulative findings on the performance consequences of dual-class shares have been weak and/or inconclusive. Because endogeneity is a constant challenge in empirical corporate governance studies, this study uses a unique law change in Switzerland as a source of exogenous variation in the fraction of firms with dual-class shares. Controlling for firm fixed effects and time-varying confounders, we find that dual-class shares neither harm nor benefit firm performance on average. However, dual-class shares increase firm performance if the firm requires external finance and dual-class shares decrease firm performance if the firm does not require external finance. External financing needs mitigate the agency costs between controlling and minority shareholders and create a context in which dual-class shares facilitate firm-specific investments instead of private perquisites. The study's results have both managerial and policy implications. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Blockholders impact strategic firm decisions because they are better at monitoring managers than dispersed shareholder groups. Nevertheless, we do not sufficiently understand how preferences of different blockholder types impact strategic firm decisions. We discuss this in the context of takeover premiums offered for publicly listed firms. Prior studies have argued that managers are often tempted to offer excessively high premiums. Consistently, blockholders might better control managers and ensure lower premiums. To better understand the impact of blockholder preferences, we focus on the special case of family firms. Specifically, drawing on the behavioral agency model, we hypothesize that bidders with family blockholders offer lower premiums than bidders with other blockholders or bidders without blockholders. Our empirical results support our hypotheses based on a sample of 149 takeover offers. (c) 2015, (c) The Author(s) 2015.

Purpose: Franchising is one of the fastest-growing operating modes in Brazil. In 2014, the Brazilian Franchising Association reported 2,492 active brands in the country. Some theories with an economic point of view, such as the agency theory, plural forms theory, or scarcity principle, explain why companies choose franchising. However, did the decision makers and founders of these franchises decide on this strategy taking only economic reasons into consideration? The purpose of this study is to understand the a priori criteria (prior to the decision) that executives took into account when adopting this strategy and the key motivations for this decision. Originality/gap/relevance/implications: The literature emphasizes the economic reasons for the success of the franchise model, but it does not focus on the founders' motivations when they choose this strategy. This is the gap that this study seeks to address. Dissonance could arise between economic reasons and entry motivations that could result in consequences for the management of new franchises. Key methodological aspects: Ten companies of different industries and different life cycle stages involved with the franchise model were scrutinized using a semi-structured questionnaire based on the literature on decision theory and franchising. Summary of key results: Behavioral factors significantly influence decision makers when choosing the franchise model. Key considerations/conclusions: This study distinguishes the economic reasons from the executives' motivations when choosing the franchise model and highlights the importance of non-economic factors in this decision.

The audit committees, as a part of the internal corporate governance mechanisms, play an important role to enhance the financial reporting quality. The busyness of audit committee members of a firm in boards and committees of other firms can affect its independent functioning, ceteris paribus. The current study examines, first, the association between multiple directorships of audit committee members and quality of financial reporting in India, second, whether endogenously determined busyness limits of busyness of the audit committee members provide better insights than those exogenously mandated by regulators. The study finds that endogenously determined busyness limits of sub-samples and the full sample explain the association between multiple directorships of audit committee members and financial reporting quality in a better way than those stipulated by regulators. Further, a lower (higher) level of busyness of audit committee members enhances (deteriorates) financial reporting quality of firms. (c) Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This paper asks the question whether international executives receive higher pay than their non-international peers. Building upon human capital theory and agency theory, we assume that highly international executives achieve higher market value in terms of their level of compensation than less international executives. To investigate this relationship, we use a multidimensional construct of internationalisation and differentiate between fixed and variable pay components of top executives. Based on a comprehensive sample of top executives from Germany's DAX firms, we find empirical evidence that 'being international' pays off for the individual in terms of variable compensation but not in terms of fixed compensation. We also demonstrate that the structure of compensation is affected by the internationalisation level of the supervisory board members. Hence, we show that governance bodies who are deciding on management board members' compensation should not be neglected in top management research. Copyright (c) 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The study analyzes the characteristics that motivate the voluntary disclosure on intangible representing organizational structural capital of the banking organizations registered on stock exchanges: Brazil and Spain. Traditional accounting is not approaching the real value of the organizations, obtained by its intangible capital. To mitigate the marked difference between the book value and the market price of these organizations, the trend to voluntary disclosures on their intangible resources has emerged. The asymmetry of information, resulting from not accounting for the organizational structural resources is studied by 2 theoretical perspectives. Agency theory suggests that the voluntary disclosure of information reduces agency costs. The theory of the cost of the owner assumes that reveal information generates additional costs, as well as the possibility of loss of its competitive advantages. This research examines 174 annual reports of 29 banks, from 2006 to 2011. The technique of multiple linear regressions using the method of least squares with panel data was used. The test results confirm the hypothesis that large banks, the most profitable and the oldest are more motivated to voluntarily disclose information representing organizational structural capital.

In 2003, a new UK corporate governance Code recommended that the CEO should not become chairman of the same firm. The UK regulator, adopting an agency theory perspective, argued that this prevents powerful CEOs from clinging to power, to the detriment of firm performance. An alternative viewpoint, offered by stewardship theory, proposes that managers are inherently motivated to act in the best interests of the company and such controls are unnecessary, bringing no benefits to shareholders. This study therefore asks: (i) Does allowing the CEO to remain as chair damage firm performance? (ii) Did the changes to recommended best practice affect the number of CEOs remaining as chairman? (iii) Did the Combined Code (2003) affect the use of relay-style succession in the UK? Analysing a sample of 225 CEO routine departure events from 1996 to 2007 produces the answers: (i) this practice caused no apparent harm to accounting or stock market performance; (ii) there was a significant reduction in the practice in the period following the reform; and (iii) while UK firms were employing relay-style succession practices prior to the reforms, this has since abated. Overall, the evidence fails to support the agency view adopted by UK regulators. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd

The degree of auditor independence is an important issue in the performance auditing literature. However, little attention has been paid to the influence of the context in which an audit body operates. This paper investigates how an audit model with a high degree of auditor independence, which is consistent with agency theory's rather formal view of relationships in organizations, functions in a context with more informal relationships, as implied by stewardship theory. Based on two case studies and a survey, the paper concludes that Dutch councilors are more satisfied with audit reports if in their municipality there is a fit between context and audit model.

This article builds on the agency-stewardship approach to examine if the impact of related and unrelated diversification strategies on firm performance is contingent on the leadership style of diversifying Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) ranging from the agent model to the steward model. For this purpose, it proposes four hypotheses which are empirically tested using data from a sample of 183 Spanish firms. The findings provide new insights about the relevance of CEOs' leadership style so that a right fit between diversification type and executive leadership style seems to be crucial for firms pursuing growth and profitability benefits.

This study assesses the link between nomination committees' presence and size as well as male directors on nomination committee and gender diversity in Ghanaian boardrooms. We use a dataset of 25 listed and 20 unlisted Ghanaian firms for January 2006 to December 2012; nine years after the Ghana Government endorsed an Affirmative Action Plan to achieve 40% representation of women on all boards by the year 2000. We employ probit and logit regressions to test our hypotheses. Listed firms and financial institutions are more likely to have more gender diverse boards. By contrast, we have no evidence to support the link between board gender diversity and board size, firm age, firm size, firm ownership, board composition and nomination committees' presence and size as well as male directors on nomination committee. Overall, our results raise questions on the appropriateness of the continual use of both the agency and resource dependency theories in explaining board gender diversity in developing economies' perspective.

This study attempts to investigate the effect of the ownership structure characteristics (ownership concentration, managerial ownership and government ownership) on firm performance (ROA) among non-financial Omani companies during 2012-2014. For achieving the objective of this study, 81 firms were taken as a sample to test the above relations. The sampling was obtained from annual report of the companies for three years with a total sampling equal to 243 firms. Multiple regression analysis was employed to test the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. In addition, this study tried to fill the gap in the existing literature concerning the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance in the developing countries such as Oman. This study found a positive and significant association between ownership concentration and government ownership to firm performance (ROA).

The main aim of this paper is to show that even when integrating the findings of behavioral economics, agency theory's conception of interactions at work does not actually account for cooperative behavior. The paper draws on the distinction between the concepts of individual and person to critically examine this conception and show that, while work is mostly organized on the assumption that workers are self-interested individuals, management rhetoric addresses workers as persons in an attempt to prompt their cooperation and personal commitment. This managerial paradox may partly be due to the prevalent influence of agency theory's prescriptions and has been contributing to a severe deterioration of the quality of working life. But it also indicates that agency theory has to confront serious theoretical and prescriptive dilemmas. (c) 2016 The Association for Social Economics.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the possible trade-off between accountability and enterprise in the context of comply or explain governance. The issue was addressed through examining the effect of compliance with the corporate governance code (CGC) on corporate entrepreneurship (CE) and organisational performance. Design/methodology/approach: Based on cross-sectional survey and content analysis of annual reports, the level of CE and compliance with the CGC were measured in the large and medium-listed companies in the UK during 2010. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used for data analysis. Findings: The results suggest no conflict between compliance with the CGC and CE in the UK, which can be attributed to the flexibility of the "comply or explain" approach. This implies that no trade-off between accountability and enterprise in the context of comply or explain governance. Practical implications: The study provides evidence in support of the regulatory governance framework in the UK and the comply or explain approach at large. This evidence contributes to the debate on the rules-based or principles-based governance, which may affect future CG regulations. It can also guide the directors to achieve the balance between their conformance and performance roles. Originality/value: The study bridges the gap between CG and CE disciplines through developing a theoretical model that integrate contingency and agency theories lenses. Adopting a holistic approach provides insights into the relationships between CG and CE, rather than investigating the effect of each of these practices separately on organisational performance.

Tension often arises when Chapter 6 business rescue practitioners (BRPs) are appointed by directors to rescue their distressed businesses. Regulating by means of standard agency contracting becomes irrelevant in the resulting multiple relationships. Looking through the agency lens, using analytic autoethnography and compiling narratives, this paper explains the perceptions of what appear to be quasiagency relationships and obtains a better understanding of these. The findings suggest that the apparent principal-agent relationships suffer from asymmetries of goals, information access, informal power and diverging perceptions of moral hazard, transaction costs and adverse selection. As a solution, contracting has been shown to have limited value owing to outcome uncertainty and measurability. This is because the tasks of the BRP are non-programmable and term-dependent. The findings provide filing directors, shareholders, creditors, regulatory authorities and BRPs in this newly instituted regime, with enhanced understanding of how the relationships manifest in practice and overcome the non-contractibility of the newly formed relationships.

This paper employs agency theory and resource dependence theory to explore relationships between Australian national sport governing bodies and commercial tour operators. These relationships produce domestic and international travel packages to major sport events and can provide commercial revenue to sport governing bodies. The research identifies agency challenges inherent in the relationships and how these are managed by sport governing bodies. Findings indicate that while sport governing bodies and tour operators interact to generate revenue, the two parties have divergent attitudes toward risk, particularly risks associated with pursuit of profit. The sport governing bodies manage interaction with tour operators through control of event tickets, a perishable and finite resource. The research contributes insights into the challenges confronting sport governing bodies attempting to diversify revenue into commercial sport tourism, as well as the underexplored role of sport bodies in facilitating major event tourism.

Purpose: We take a state-stewardship view on corporate governance and executive compensation in economies with strong political involvement, where state-appointed managers act as responsible "stewards" rather than "agents" of the state. Methodology/approach: We test this view on China and find that Chinese managers are remunerated not for maximizing equity value but for increasing the value of state-owned assets. Findings: Managerial compensation depends on political connections and prestige, and on the firms' contribution to political goals. These effects were attenuated since the market-oriented governance reform. Research limitations/implications: Economic reform without reforming the human resources policies at the executive level enables the autocratic state to exert political power on corporate decision making, so as to ensure that firms' business activities fulfill the state's political objectives. Practical implications: As a powerful social elite, the state-steward managers in China have the same interests as the state (the government), namely extracting rents that should adhere to the nation (which stands for the society at large or the collective private citizens). Social implications: As China has been a communist country with a single ruling party for decades, the ideas of socialism still have a strong impact on how companies are run. The legitimacy of the elite's privileged rights over private sectors is central to our question. Originality/value: Chinese executive compensation stimulates not only the maximization of shareholder value but also the preservation of the state's interests.

Committees on a board of directors are now subject to recommendations by regulations in practically all jurisdictions. At the same time, scholarly work on the topic has escalated since the mid-1990s. In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

Purpose: This paper aims to explore an alternative approach to regulation for addressing governance problems relating to director and executive remuneration in publicly listed firms. The author investigates the development of hybrid regulatory framework, composed of state regulation and self-regulation, for remuneration governance in Australia. Design/methodology/approach: The synthesis of constructs borrowed from agency and institutional theories and its contextual analysis examines the effectiveness of formal (state regulation) and informal (self-regulation) institutions for the development of a hybrid of regulation. Thereafter, the author examines the impact of hybrid regulation on remuneration disclosure behavior in Australia. Findings: The author finds that improvement in disclosure is primarily driven by the establishment of remuneration committees and separate role of chief executive officer (CEO) and chairperson but weakened by the presence of CEO at remuneration committee and presence of remuneration consultant. Originality/value: Global crises have called for greater transparency and protection of investors through state regulation alone. However, corporate governance, being a social practice that is shaped by diverse interests, calls for a holistic approach. A useful contribution of this study is that through an in-depth examination into the stages and actors of the government interventions involving the balancing of tension between conflicting forces, it provides insights for developing an effective regulatory hybrid which has greater acceptance for corporate governance. In conclusion, it implies the significance of priming the social arena through active engagement of diverse market forces prior to introducing state regulation.

Based on Ajzen (1985) Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the concept of agency theory as well as moral development, this study proposes a behavioral intention model consisting of agency situation, moral development, and the three dimensions of TPB, including attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. This study decomposes the above three factors into multi-dimensions in examining accountants' behaviors with regard to earnings management, moral development, and agency problem conditions to provide a comprehensive understanding of the behavioral intentions of earnings management. The main results of this study indicate that the "attitude" dimension is the only significant variable of TPB that explains the earnings management intention of accounting practitioners. Further analysis also suggests that the accounting practitioners' "attitude" could be more effectively influenced through inculcation of the concept of "altruism". In addition, the behavioral intention of accounting practitioners engaged in earnings management is significantly affected by agency situation and moral development. We find significant interaction between the two variables. (c) 2016, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

Stock options (hereafter SOs) have been extensively investigated by the literature. The debate has been mainly grounded in the agency theory that has interpreted these tools as mechanisms to align the conflicting interests of managers and owners towards the shareholder value maximization. However, the latest empirical evidence suggests that SOs are often used by opportunistic managers to extract rents to the detriment of shareholders. In addition, literature identifies the perceived cost as a further theoretical lens to interpret the use of SOs. Despite the growing interest around the topic, the research is still fragmented and fails to present a comprehensive picture on the factors that affect the aim of SOs. Our literature review attempts to fill this gap by providing a systematization of the studies on the topic. The paper concludes by presenting the theoretical and practical implications of the study and suggesting directions for future research. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Based on the Behavioral Agency Theory and the socio-emotional wealth model proposed by Berrone, Cruz & Gomez-Mejia (2012), this work focuses on measuring and validating the model and its relationship to family firm's results. It also analyzes some characteristics such as size and age of the family businesses to determine their influence on the relation between socioemotional wealth and family firm's results. Unlike other studies, an empirical study was made in private family firms (not listed in the stock market). The study suggests that family firm's outcomes are positively related to socioemotional wealth. Furthermore, the 5 dimensions model of socioemotional wealth is valid but requires adjustments in some dimensions. (c) 2016, Allied Academies. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this article is to examine the Intellectual Capital (IC) disclosure strategies of high-tech companies under different theoretical perspectives (agency, signalling and proprietary costs theories). According to the agency theory, the failure of traditional financial statements to report the 'soft assets' would lead knowledge-intensive firms (where the components of IC are structurally higher) to provide a higher level of disclosure in order to reduce the greater information asymmetries with external firm agents. However, because of the highly proprietary nature of IC information (proprietary costs theory) as well as the relevance of IC information to externally signal the key sources of superior quality of a company (signalling theory), different IC disclosure strategies may be adopted by managers of intellectual-capital-rich firms, depending on the particular motivations associated with firm-specific characteristics of these companies. Therefore, this study aims to better understand which theoretical framework under examination (if any) is best at interpreting the observed IC disclosure policies of high-tech companies. To this end, we deduce, and test, a set of hypotheses in accordance with the theoretical frameworks considered. The study also takes into account the effects of changes in the governmental regulation concerning non-financial information that occurred during the period examined. The empirical analysis is conducted on all Italian high-tech listed companies and based on longitudinal data (of 5 years: 2007-2011). By using longitudinal data and the population of all of the high-tech Italian companies, the analysis overcomes the well-known limitations of the sampling and the cross-sectional data that provide snapshot results. The findings reveal that the companies' disclosure strategy primarily depends on the specific category of the IC information. In particular, the results suggest that the proprietary costs theory prevails in explaining the companies' disclosure behaviour on internal IC information. The signalling theory prevails in the explanation of the communication strategies about external IC most likely to enhance investors' confidence in the intangible key value drivers relating to relational capital. Finally, for companies examined, higher levels of ownership diffusion represent the primary incentive to disclose human capital information to reduce agency/monitoring costs (in presence of higher leverage) or signal to the market the superior quality (in presence of higher profitability). This article extends the existing empirical literature on IC disclosure behaviour in high-tech industries by analysing the disclosure strategies of high-tech companies under different theoretical perspectives including proprietary cost theory. In addition, the comprehensive regression model (with specific two-way interaction terms) used in this study expands on the extant approaches for the analysis of IC disclosure determinants allowing to capture some aspects that could be omitted when only the explanation variables taken separately are considered. This study has practical implications for various parties, such as regulators. It provides empirical evidence for the primary limits (relating to the proprietary costs) to an introduction of mandatory law requirements regarding the information on internal structure of IC. In particular, our findings prove that companies exposed to the threat of competitive disadvantages prefer not to provide - by formal channels, such as annual reports - additional internal IC information.

The governance structure and financial performance of organizations have the potential to support the strategic direction of organizations in embedding social and environmental initiatives into their business activities. This is because CSR initiatives require top management commitment and support from stakeholders. In addition, the availability of financial resources could further enhance the CSR initiatives and influence strategic development. The aim of this study is to examine the influence of governance structure (specifically ownership and board structure) and financial performance on CSR reporting among Malaysian public-listed companies. The agency and signaling theories have been employed to underpin the theoretical perspectives of the study. The data for this research was sourced from content analyses of both the annual and sustainability reports of the top 100 public-listed Malaysian companies. The study reveals that board independence, board size, and the presence of women directors on the board significantly influence the reporting of CSR information. Nonetheless, government and foreign ownerships were not significant determinants of the reporting practice. In terms of financial performance, profitability was found to be significant in signaling the behavior of companies to disclose CSR information. Overall, the results of the study largely imply that board structure and profitability of organizations are critical towards the enhancement of CSR initiatives of companies. Social implications: Findings of this study indicate the positive role of women directors on the extent of CSR disclosure, which encourages diversity in the board of directors.

We respond to the call for a more balanced view of agency (Tourish, 2014: 88) by presenting an account of the forced resignation of Jean-Marie Messier as CEO of the major French company, Vivendi Universal, in 2002. Messier's ousting arose from a struggle for board control involving an exercise of power that was influenced strongly by kinship relationships, interlocking directorships, and business alliances; and by the interplay between a nouveau riche (Messier), an influential old guard shareholder family (the Bronfmans), and an established elite (of prominent representatives of French business). Collusion between the French business establishment and the Bronfman family created a coalition of interest and a locus of control that managerial and agency theories explain inadequately. We highlight the potential for a reading of class relationships in terms of structuration to foster better understanding of the complexities involved when the board of a major corporation decides to support, or withdraw support for, their CEO. We highlight several context-specific structures and mechanisms that were influential in determining corporate control and CEO agency. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

This chapter investigates the influence of the board composition and leadership on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) disclosure. The empirical study of 68 Tunisian listed companies and 100 Egyptian listed companies reveals that board independence, foreign directorship, female directorship and state directorship, influence positively CSR disclosure. However, these findings indicate that CEO duality has a negative impact on CSR disclosure. Overall, the findings are consistent with the agency theory as well as the stakeholders theory and suggest that CSR disclosure seems to result from the willingness to meet shareholders' expectations in terms of transparency and voluntary disclosure of non-financial information.

This study examined the processes undertaken by compensation committees (CCs) on Indian public company boards building on the CC process study of U.S. public company boards reported in Hermanson et al. (2012). The Indian data reported here were gathered through scripted, in-depth, semi-structured interviews of 21 Indian directors (17 CC members, two Management Committee members and two directors, all of whom dealt with compensation matters on their boards).In keeping with agency theory predicates, Indian CC processes were designed to safeguard the independence, knowledge and expertise of CC members, while ensuring they had access to the resources needed to make sound and informed decisions. Compensation principles emphasized paying for performance, ensuring a proper mix of compensation, benchmarking to market practices and retaining good talent. There were some process differences among Indian organizational archetypes like family businesses, public sector firms, multinational subsidiaries (MNCs) and promoter-controlled firms, suggestive of neo-institutional theory influences. Notable differences from U.S. CC practices were that Indian CC practices were less formal, and directors were seen to be more partners of management playing broader roles extending beyond traditional agency-theory-driven fiduciary responsibilities. Some of these differences could portend the existence of secondary (principal-principal) agency problems. There were other process differences from U.S. practices, arising from institutional and cultural variations. In particular, institutional frameworks and statutory limits appeared to circumscribe the Indian CCs' role, enabling greater managerial oversight of CC processes and engendering a more collectivist ethos among CCs in India. CC practices in the Indian context also lead us to discern some elements of an underlying tension between agency theory and institutional theory. These underlying tensions are further compounded by firm ownership differences (family, business group, MNC subsidiary, government owners, majority control, etc.). This is where we argue that neo-institutional influences based on ownership structure differences manifest themselves. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents a pioneering attempt at depicting these latent tensions between agency and institutional theory, and in teasing out how neo-institutional influences impact CC practices, thereby furthering our understanding of these phenomena. Cumulatively, these findings provide important directions for advancing theory, and enabling a more grounded and holistic understanding of CC processes.Since CCs were not mandatory for Indian public companies at the time this study was conducted, requiring CCs on all Indian company boards (as the revised 2013 Indian Companies Act has mandated ) would provide an added fillip to legitimizing and formalizing the role of this committee. However, because of the existing differences in the institutional and socio-cultural contexts, it is unlikely that CC processes across the Indian and U.S. company boards will converge and become completely uniform or homogeneous.

The purpose of this paper is to find the determinants of quantity as well as quality of the risk disclosures in annual reports of banking sector of Pakistan. The paper employs the word count approach to measure the quantity of risk disclosures in annual reports whereas to measure the risk disclosure quality (RDQ), RDQ index is adapted from the study by Barakat and Hussainey in 2013 after making some changes. The researcher selected a data sample on desired variables for a period of 7-year (2008-2014) through 31 scheduled banks (excluding 7 Foreign Banks) and run generalized least square as the researcher supposed there was an effect of endogeneity in the model. The researcher found confirmation that, banks with a higher proportion of independent non-executive board directors, lower ownership proportion of executive management, banks with a high asset value and banks having non-governmental ownership tend to present to their stakeholders a higher degree of risk disclosure in terms of volume of information as well as quality of the disclosure. Practically, the results recommend that there should be strict regulations by the supervisory body to enhance the quantity and quality of risk disclosure by banks in their annual reports. Further, audit committees of the banking institutions should positively play their vital role in this regard. As another practical suggestion, the findings demonstrate that banking institutions operating in Pakistan may improve their own RDQ and quantity by appointing independent outside board directors and ensuring the audit committee activities as effective monitors of risk disclosure and advisors for risk disclosure management at bank level.

This paper proposes to investigate the postulations of renowned agency theory and shareholder value (SHV) in relation to corporate governance (CG) attributes. SHV is of a great concern to the shareholders of firms. SHV have been investigated by numerous studies of CG but with inconsistent empirical evidence. This study will focus on investigating the impact of CG attributes on SHV measured by Tobin's Q or return on both equity and assets. The paper conceptualized four attributes (Separate leadership, proportion of Independent director, independent chairman, independence of nomination committee) from CG mechanism in relation to SHV in companies listed on BURSA Malaysia. This is a conceptual paper which proposes to investigate the relationship between SHV and separate leadership, SHV and proportion of independent director, SHV and independent chairman, SHV and independence of nomination committee in the context of Malaysia. The proposed study has value for Malaysian government, policy makers, corporate boards, stock exchange and shareholders by highlighting the distinct impact on SHV and its relation with separate leadership, proportion of independent director, independent chairman, and independence of nomination committee.

The study employs a quantitative design,employing cross-sectional data from the annual reports of the sampled companies. The results provide evidence of partial support for the agency theory,as gender was positively related to financial performance,while political connection and Chief Executive Officer incentives were negatively related with performance. The finding of the study should interest organisational stakeholders such as auditors shareholders and managers. (c) 2016,Econjournals. All rights reserved.

This paper aims to provide an overview of the trend or focus in the research of corporate governance in emerging countries with the aim to identify the gaps in the existing literature. The review notes that corporate governance research in emerging countries is dominated by economic perspective,in particular the agency theory,as researchers follow the strands of research conducted in the more advanced countries,especially the US and the UK. This paper argues that although influential,agency theory is unable to provide sufficient understanding on many issues related to practices for the fact that corporate governance is not happening in social vacuum; it is affected by various other institutional factors and local context. Hence,in order to gain better understanding of corporate governance in emerging countries,alternatives perspectives or theories,such as institutional theory,should be employed by the researchers.

The presence of key institutional investors/owners and BOD characteristics as highlighted by Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) may have influence on the yield to maturity (YTM) of bonds and sukuk. It is argued that higher institutional ownerships will produce enhanced active monitoring on cost of debt and presumably more control on the likelihood of default risk occurrence as measured by the size of yield spreads for conventional bonds and sukuk. Agency theory also explains the relationship between principal and agent and the possible misalignment of interest of both parties is reflected through the incurrence of what is termed as agency cost. To reduce this agency cost requires the necessity of incurrence of cost of monitoring and controlling by the principal which in large firms is represented by institutional investors which delegated this responsibility to the appointed board of directors (BOD). Thus, the main objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between these corporate governance mechanisms with respect to institutional investors and BOD characteristics with the default risk as proxy by yield spread of bond and sukuk in Malaysia. The data are obtained from firm issuers' annual reports, Bondinfo Hub of Malaysian Central Bank, Malaysian Department of Statistics and Bloomberg databases for the period beginning 2000 to 2014. Unbalanced panel data are applied for the tests which cover the pooled ordinary least square (OLS), fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models. The results suggest that the presence of institutional ownerships does have an inverse relationship on the default risk for long-term sukuk. However, the results do not support any relationship between institutional ownerships and long-term conventional bonds defaults. Mixed result reveal by BOD characteristics.

The changes recommended by the New Public Management (NPM) in public accounting have given special attention and importance to the evaluation of mayor's performance by citizens/voters. Thus, this study aims to assess the impact of accounting information on the re-election of Portuguese mayors. Taking the agency theory as a point of departure, we start from the following research question: Does the accounting information disclosed by the municipalities influence the re-election of Portuguese mayors? The research methodology used in this study is the quantitative type, through which a multivariate analysis of data was performed on 308 Portuguese municipalities, in the period 2005-2008, based on the election results of 2009. The results from the binary logistic regression show that some indicators of accounting nature have impact on the re-election of mayors in Portugal, namely, the components of financial accounting and municipal revenues.

This study examined the influence of agency conflict Type I (as represented by managerial ownership and institutional ownership), and agency conflict Type II (as represented by control rights, cash flow rights, cash flow rights leverage) on earnings management. A model was developed and tested using a sample of 108 pyramidal structure companies listed on Indonesian stock exchange from 2008 to 2012. Data were collected and analyzed using least square regression model. The result showed that there is a significant association between managerial ownership and control rights. However, control rights (in agency conflict Type II) have the greatest influence on earnings management. Consequently, Type II agency conflict have the largest influence on earnings management compared to Type I agency conflict. The significance of the study is the potentials to assist the institutions and investors know the actual company performance and provides a better understanding of the agency theory more broadly viz. the relative impacts of Types I and II agency conflicts.

This study examines whether the characteristics of the board of directors may affect the level of remuneration, for two samples having different systems of governance for the period from 2002 to 2010. Given the importance the financial crisis for executive pay, investigations in executive compensation during periods of crisis are very limited. This study provides a contribution to the literature where we tried to determine if the manager takes advantage of this period of instability. The results indicate the positive impact of the period of crisis on the level of compensation of the U.S. manager, which is not true with his French counterpart. To our knowledge, no study has been conducted on board effectiveness during periods of instability. The results show that during this period this mechanism is unable to control the manager who benefits from excessive compensation.

Corporate governance (CG) emerged many centuries ago, despite the debate on this subject and the widely-held view that it commenced in the 2000s. Thus, CG is not a new practice and over time it has become a precise system. In this study, the origins of CG are examined by the author in order to shed light on the underlying facts concerning the roots of this discipline and its history. By introducing such facts, it provides the background of the emergence of CG as clear principles and mechanisms. In the organizational sense, this study is considered important for both investors and organizations in applying the principles of CG and its mechanisms in all countries worldwide. The objective of this paper is to provide useful information to both researchers and practitioners in relation to CG including the fundamental principles and its history. This paper will present a solution to fill the gap in the literature concerning the relationship between CG and a firm's performance in such instances when the results of examining such a relationship are found to be inconsistent. A number of factors have contributed to this author's desire to research the relationship between a firm's performance and CG and that includes the author's experience and understanding of accounting over the years especially in the CG discipline, and also further to an in-depth literature review.

Agency theory, despite its influential normative prescriptions, has been subject to a long-standing critique from management scholars for being theoretically inconsistent and empirically unsubstantiated. The article examines how agency theory is rooted in contractarian theory of the firm that by and large renders extant corporate law irrelevant and instead emphasizes the auxiliary benefits of the market (i.e. financial markets). What is addressed as 'the market for corporate control', based on the ceaseless pricing of the shares and bonds issued by public firms, is portrayed as a more effective mechanism for disciplining managers and monitoring the corporate system than corporate legislation and court ruling. This argument, derived from elementary neoclassic economic theory, turns a blind eye to the historical roots of corporate law and overstate the ability of the, e.g., shareholders to assess managerial decision-making on basis of information available in the market. Ultimately, agency theorists and contractarians, in their pursuit of free-market capitalism, seek to disconnect the corporate system from the authority and regulatory control of the state.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze certain organizational changes that occur after privatization. More specifically, the authors analyze from an agency theory perspective how changes at the corporate governance level (ownership type/structure and board of directors) influence firm strategy, and what implications these issues have for the design of compensation mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology employed in the study can be described as a longitudinal multiple case study approach. A multiple case study enables the comparison of pre- and post-privatization periods in five Spanish companies. This methodology is especially suitable to track the organizational changes occurring in relation to the firms' internal management. Findings - First, the variables that traditionally relate to greater board independence in monitoring do not suffer from variation after privatization. Second, the interests of the firms' new ownership have an impact on firm strategy after privatization. Finally, compensation system design clearly aligns with firm strategy after privatization. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on a multiple case study approach, which limits the scope and generalizability of the findings. Originality/value - Whereas research in privatization generally adopts a macroeconomic or political perspective, organizational and managerial implications are current aspects in need of further examination. This research offers a study that integrates three sets of variables (corporate governance, strategy and compensation) that have been rarely analyzed in this context.

The sensitivity of managerial compensation to the firm's risk is a controversial issue. While some articles find evidence supporting the agency theory that predicts a negative relationship between pay-performance sensitivity and risk, others support the managerial ownership that predicts a positive relationship between these factors. This article reconciles these theories and provides evidence that these two theories are not conflicting, when tested properly, using industries risk characteristics. In this articled, we distinguish between new- and old-economy industries, and demonstrate that managerial ownership theory applies to new-economy firms, which are high-tech firms that operate in more uncertain environments, whereas the agency theory applies to old-economy firms that operate in more traditional industries. We further control for the size effect and find a positive relationship between pay-performance sensitivity and risk for medium and large size new-economy firms. Furthermore, we find that high-tech companies increased their CEOs noncash compensation dramatically during the high-tech market crash between 2000 and 2002 to cushion the fall in their CEOs wealth in the company. This caused CEOs pay-performance sensitivity to risk to become negatively related to their firms' risk during that period. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The aim of this chapter is to project the agency theory about triple helix; being more specific, corporate governance mechanism about the entity's organizational structure that emerge as intermediaries partnerships within the triple helix (structured as a spin-off, business incubator, business accelerator, science park, among others), having as a base the agency theory. In this context it is proposed a governance framework starting with two drivers that make part of is known as governance throughput: the macro-structure of power and the organization's management macro-processes. In this framework has built an array of classification of governance environment, based on information about the implementation of normative governance mechanisms and supervision generating quadrants with favorable and unfavorable levels of each dimension of governance drives. The proposed framework does not predict optimal decisions about key issues in governance (accountability, disclosure, compliance and fairness), but lists mechanisms to secure theoretical foundation that can mitigate the agency problems, hoping thereby to contribute to better understand the governance environment in partnerships within the triple helix.

Traditional agency theory (principal-agent conflict) has been a widely-accepted theoretical perspective for understanding corporate governance practices in developed economies. Institutions in these economies are characterized by effective contract enforcement, disperse ownership, separation of ownership, and control and protection of minority shareholders' rights. However, the principal-agent relationship, alone, may not be appropriate for analyzing corporate governance in emerging-economy institutional contexts, in which these institutional characteristics are often absent, weak, or poorly implemented. Scholars characterize corporate governance in emerging economies as having a conflict of interest between controlling and minority shareholders, known as the ''principal-principal agency model''. This relatively new sub-field has attracted the attention of scholars across disciplines including finance, economics, and strategy. The present chapter attempts to synthesize and review conceptual and empirical developments regarding principal-principal conflicts, and suggests possible directions for future studies.

Agency theory and socio-emotional wealth theory are central when explaining family firm advantages. However, research has not uncovered the extent to which reasoning from these two theories can also explain family firm advantages linked to the homeland production mode. This paper addresses this issue, building on the above-mentioned theories through an illustrative single case study of the family firm Weibel Scientific. The case study stresses that characteristics of family firms can be exploited in the homeland production mode and lead to reduced agency costs and social capital benefits. Furthermore, the case study highlights that there are important aspects to consider regarding the way in which these characteristics affect agency costs and social capital, and how these effects are influenced by the production locational mode. From this, it is concluded that arguments from agency theory and socio-emotional wealth theory can explain family firm advantages associated with the homeland production mode.

Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: The purpose of this study is to ascertain the effects of valuable resources on two factors: the competency to reduce clients' transaction costs and the performance of export intermediaries. The impact of intermediaries' competency to reduce clients' transaction costs on performance is also investigated while the moderating effect of intermediaries' learning orientation on resources, competency to reduce clients' transaction costs, and performance is further examined. Design/ Methodology/ Approach: A postal survey of 400 export intermediary firms was conducted. Samples were accessed from the official database of the Department of Export Promotion, the Ministry of Commerce, Thailand. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses of the study. Research findings: Based on the three theoretical framework of transaction cost theory, agency cost theory and resource-based theory, results show that resources positively affect both intermediaries' competency to reduce clients' transaction costs and performance. It is also noted that intermediaries' competency to reduce clients' transaction costs positively impact on performance. In addition, no moderating effect of learning orientation is found. Theoretical contributions/ Originality: This study is an original attempt to examine the moderating effect of learning orientation on three factors: the relationship among resources, the competency to reduce clients' transaction costs, and performance. Practitioner/ Policy implications: The results show export intermediaries' resources and competencies improve their performance. This will indirectly facilitate export promotion efforts. Research limitations/ Implications: This study surveyed the export intermediary firms in Thailand. Future research may be conducted on a larger scale by focusing on other ASEAN countries as well as survey the performance of firms using export intermediaries. (c) 2016, University of Malaya.

This study was conducted on the related party transaction (RPT) and earnings management. Agency theory provides that managers may engage into self-enrichment transactions to maximize their benefits at the detriment of the shareholders of the firm. Though,management or concentrated ownership was suggested as the possible solution to this problem,this form of ownership structure has its peculiar problems which are termed as Type II agency problem. Controlling shareholders are found to be using their voting power to extract extra benefits from the firm through the insider information and in many instances engage in detrimental RPTs at the expense of minority shareholders. This study have identified how and why controlling shareholders or managers use RPT as a means to perpetrate accrual-based or real activity earnings management. It was recommended that empirical study be conducted to investigate whether disclosure regulation can constrain the controlling shareholders or management against the use of real-activity management through RPT.

Traditional agency theory assumes monitoring is good for the principal, but we investigate an unintended effect: diminishment of the agent's preference for honesty. We hypothesize greater dishonest behavior in a monitored environment than in a non-monitored environment, when the agent has the opportunity to cheat outside the scope of monitoring. Relevant theories to explain such behavior are behavioral agency theory, where trust and reciprocity are thought to alter contractual outcomes, and the fraud-triangle theory, where the ability to rationalize deviant acts affects behavior. We utilize participants who have been acclimated to either a monitored or an unmonitored condition in an immediately preceding experiment and seamlessly continue that treatment. Within each of these conditions, participants perform a simple task with a performance-based monetary reward. Half self-report and can safely cheat, while the other half are verified; the difference between verified and self-reported scores is a proxy for dishonest reporting. As hypothesized, unmonitored individuals reciprocate with honest behavior, while monitored individuals tend toward dishonest behavior when the opportunity arises. Implications for fraud prevention are discussed. (c) Copyright 2016 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This purpose of this paper is to explore variations in the extent of control mechanisms, according to country of origin and organizational characteristics, in a challenging country of domicile. Design/methodology/approach: A survey research design involving the use of a questionnaire as the primary data source was adopted. A total of 350 subsidiaries were initially randomly selected and contacted in person, or via telephone and e-mail, of which 147 agreed to take part in the study and responded to the survey. Findings: The authors find that Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) from highly financialized Liberal Market Economies will be associated with a greater reliance on formalized control mechanisms; this will enable the MNE's headquarters to closely monitor subsidiary managers according to objective measures, to ensure that the maximum shareholder value is released. Research limitations/implications: This study reveals a greater reliance on control mechanisms in larger firms, reflecting a desire to maximize bureaucratic economies of scale. Practical implications: The authors find that the presence of expatriates regardless of country of origin leads to greater decentralization, suggesting foreign firms do not trust local staff. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies of this nature conducted for the region of Middle East - and the only one the authors are aware of for Saudi Arabia. Further, it sheds new light on the impact of contextual circumstances on how closely firms monitor their subsidiaries, the challenges of doing business in the Gulf region and the consequences of the large-scale usage of expatriates.

The main aim of this article is to compare the financial performance of private and publicly traded companies in accordance with ownership structure and size. The analysis carried out in the article leads to the conclusion that in Poland private companies perform better than companies that are publicly traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE). Statistically significant results are obtained for medium-sized companies. Moreover, it turns out that medium-sized enterprises operate better than large companies as far as profitability is concerned, at least in the group of private companies where results are statistically significant. The analyses conducted in the article are aimed at filling in the gap in studies comparing profitability between publicly traded and private companies. (c) 2015 The Authors.

This research seeks to contribute to neo-institutionalism by connecting cognitive variables of the decision maker to the decision maker's ability to take non-isomorphic action. The insights developed in this article are based on the study of a business school in India, and the case study method has been adopted with participant observer technique. The study shows that organisations are sometimes exposed to more than one of the isomorphic forces--coercive, mimetic, and normative, the forces acting together or against each other. In such situations the decision maker is sometimes required to adopt non-isomorphic actions, which signify a departure from the dominant force. I have used the concepts of institutional theory and stakeholder-agency theory, and the evidence in the case, to argue that the decision maker needs the cognitive ability of systems thinking in order to adopt non-isomorphic actions. Two attributes, moral agency and self-efficacy, act as moderators in influencing the decision maker's ability for non-isomorphic action. A model has been developed based on the above propositions.

Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to philosophically address the issue of managerial opportunism and to describe the paradox of the opportunistic executive, particularly when the CEO could be considered as a "criminal-to-be". Design/methodology/approach-It will be seen to what extent governance mechanisms really contributeto prevent managerial opportunism, particularly through compensation packages ("financial carrots"). Then, Oliver E. Williamson's viewpoint will be analyzed on opportunism, as his theory has largely influenced the way agency theories actually define managerial opportunism. Williamson was thinking opportunism without referring to philosophical works. The gap in exploring three basic types of opportunism will be filled: the Smithian egoist, the Hobbesian egoist and the Machiavellian egoist. Findings-The Smithian egoist tries to reach an equilibrium between self-interest and compassion, while the Hobbesian egoist is motivated by self-interest, desire of power and the attitude of prudence. The Machiavellian egoist is always searching for power and makes followers' fear arising. The way governance mechanisms and structures should be designed and implemented could be quite different if the CEO actually behaves as a Smithian, Hobbesian or Machiavellian egoist. CEO's propensity to commit financial crime could largely vary from one type to another: low risk (Smithian egoist), medium risk (Hobbesian egoist) or high risk (Machiavellian egoist). Research limitation/implications-Smith's, Hobbes' and Machiavelli's philosophy was chosen because the agency theory sometimes refers to it, when defining the notion of opportunism. Other philosophies could also be analyzed to see to what extent they are opening the door to opportunism (for example, Spinoza). Originality/value-The paper analyzes managerial opportunism from a philosophical viewpoint. Whether executives are Smithian, Hobbesian or Machiavellian egoists, their opportunism cannot give birth to similar behaviors. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a model explaining the roles of right-hand person and the factors contributing to the successful relationship between the top executive and the right-hand person. Design/methodology/approach - In-depth qualitative case studies are conducted. Longitudinal observations, interviews with six right-hand persons and the top executives in three organizations are conducted to test the propositions of the model. Findings - Results indicate that different types of congruence between the top executive and the right-hand person are required when the right-hand person is performing the roles of an implementer and joint decision maker. Research limitations/implications - This study extends the leadership literature by investigating the phenomenon of right-hand person of the top executive, which has seldom been studied systematically or scientifically. It provides insights and serves as a stepping stone for future research in this area. One key limitation is that it is a qualitative study with limited samples under investigation. Practical implications - Practical implications concerning how to build up a successful relationship between the top executive and the right-hand person can be drawn from the proposed model. Insight concerning how to collaborate between the top executive and the right-hand person can be drawn from the in-depth case analyses. Social implications - The phenomenon of right-hand person is not limited to business organizations. The collaboration between the key decision maker and his chief assistant should be applicable to other contexts such as non-government organizations. Originality/value - To the best of the knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates the right-hand person phenomenon in the literature. As the right-hand person of the top executive can have important influence on organizational performance, the study may serve as the stepping stone for further understanding of this important phenomenon.

North American charity ventures collect donations for the needy or suffering. Few studies have analysed philanthropic ventures and altruistic promoters. In the charity industry, donors mandate intermediaries (agents) to transfer donations to beneficiairies. One of the underlying assumptions of agency theory is that agents attempt to maximize their personal welfare and compensation; this behaviour may not always be in the best interests of beneficiairies. What is the typical business model of a charitable organization? Is there a monitoring process? What is the social return on investment? The complex patterns of inter-stakeholder relationships, both good and bad, are scrutinized. The research threads it way into the 'complexity code' of charities via archival data and forensic science data. This article also deciphers the altruism of agents via a new behavioural matrix. To conclude, a complexity-aware monitoring process is submitted. Thus, the article sheds new light on the complexity of charities and proposes directions for future research.

Investment funds are potentially plagued by principal-agent problems between investors and fund management companies, in particular with respect to fees. Market forces play a role in mitigating these problems, but based on existing empirical studies, there can be doubts about whether these forces are sufficient for protecting investor interests. When market forces fail, there is room for fund boards to add value for investors. U.S. funds have mandatory independent directors who are empowered to be the watchdogs for the fund investors, negotiating fees with the fund management company on their behalf. This is not the case for Luxembourg funds that are established in accordance with the EU Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive. This study uses a sample of Luxembourg UCITS funds and shows that, although there is no regulatory requirement, approximately half of the sample funds have appointed at least one independent board member. A survey among board members of the sample funds showed that, in the absence of the requirement to negotiate fees with the fund management company, Luxembourg boards give relatively low priority to costs, which they see as primarily the responsibility of the promoter, leaving the monitoring to market forces. This finding is irrespective of whether or not the board has (semi-) independent board members. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This study investigates the role of external monitors, in the form of analyst recommendations, on CEO pay cuts. We use the theories of signaling and optimism to arrive at propositions that predict the relationship between analyst recommendations as external monitors, and CEO pay cuts. CEO pay cuts - which constitute a strong incentive for CEO behavior - have received only limited attention in extant research. Analysis of data for US public firms from 1998 to 2013 suggest that firms with strong external monitoring mechanisms, such as public analyst recommendations, are more likely to implement pay cuts. Our findings reveal that analyst recommendations serve as important and objective external signals and a monitoring mechanism for determining CEO pay cuts. Specifically, low-performing firms and firms with high CEO pay before analyst recommendations are more likely to integrate the analyst downgrades in their decision process regarding CEO compensation. From our analysis, practitioners could learn that - even though they might find it difficult to implement CEO pay cuts - such pay cuts are not only effective but also could be implemented based on external signals from analysts. A takeaway for external analysts is the powerful effect that their negative signals have on CEO pay cuts, thus questioning the optimism bias that is so prevalent in the industry. In order to serve as truly 'objective' external monitors, analysts should use ratings judiciously as signaling mechanisms. (c) 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

This paper discusses the cause of the conflict between principal and agent, looking for answers in the disciplines of biology, particularly in the science of criminal anthropology. A setting has been made between the findings of the agency theory and white-collar crime theories, reinterpreting the actions of the agent from their configuration between instinct, heritage and personality. The results in the biological sciences could provide new interpretations and explanations in administration science, moving towards better interpretations of the conflict through more empirical content theories. Overall, despite the ongoing conflict between the parties, their dynamic boosts the results sought by the principal. (c) 2016 Universidad ICESI. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

This chapter describes a theoretical framework that can be used to understand the impact of board gender diversity on board effectiveness and firm performance. It highlights four key theories: agency theory, resource dependency theory, gender role theory and upper echelons theory. The chapter reviews the arguments in the corporate governance literature for greater female boardroom representation. It deals with the ethical case and it considers the business case. The former is concerned with the principle that there should be no discrimination in the workplace, while the latter focuses on the benefits that women bring to the boardroom by drawing from a broader talent pool of directors. The chapter reviews the possible costs associated with an increase in the gender balance of boards. It concludes with an evaluation of the evidence, both positive and negative, concerning the effectiveness of greater female boardroom participation in improving business performance.

Historical accounting research provides evidence, within the framework of agency theory, of the conflict of interests produced in the organisation. By means of a longitudinal study based on primary sources, the present study aims to examine how agency relationship is regulated by means of formal contracts, as well as to explore the function performed by accounting within that relationship. The case study on which our research is based, and which might constitute an important contribution to the field, examines the leasing of the State tobacco monopoly to a private corporation, from the beginning of this process (1887) until this monopolistic activity starts to decrease (1986). The findings underline that the specific contracts established lead to a significant control of the principal over the agent, and that not all conditions required in order to consider them as "good contractual agreements" are met. On the other hand, accounting appears as a key factor in State control of the lessee corporations. The main conclusion of the study is that the agent takes more risks in the leasing, and that the principal maintains an opportunistic behaviour throughout the whole process, which questions the most widespread assumptions on the theory, and suggests the possibility of softening of the initial assumptions.

During the second half of the nineteenth century, a growing interest in joint-stock corporations emerged. At the same time, managerial opportunism was observed in many of these corporations. Inefficient capital markets and inadequate transparency of operations as well as their results were characteristics of the time. Little was known about the means to reduce this opportunism. This knowledge grew over time out of pragmatic ideas, which foreshadow elements of present day agency theory. The important question to be answered by these pragmatic ideas was how managers could be influenced to act according to the goals of the owners of these corporations. In this paper, we draw on mostly academic literature of the nineteenth century to illustrate the developments of such pragmatic ideas. The presentation is structured by major mechanisms of agency theory. It is shown that attempts at reducing asymmetry of information by limiting corporate activities to less risky business, belief in high moral standards of managers or governmental supervision of operational activities were basically unsuccessful ideas. However, the empowerment of shareholders by introducing a supervisory board and the offering of monetary incentives showed more promise. Obviously, these ideas were not perfect. The pros and cons of any of these instruments became more visible over time, which led to better legal structures for establishing supervisory boards. With respect to monetary incentives, the contemporary debates seem to have been quite enlightened as compared with recent discussions. (c) 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This paper presents evidence on the role of ownership in dealing with corporate expropriation of listed companies in Malaysia. From the perspective of expropriation, a single controlling shareholder is always associated with such behavior due to their power and control at the expense of minority shareholder. However, subsequent individual or coalition of large shareholders can be an important corporate governance tool by providing effective monitoring that would lessen the possibility of expropriation by the controlling shareholder. Relating to that, this study evaluates the role of controlling and large shareholders in dealing with corporate expropriation. It is found that there is a negative relationship between single controlling shareholders and dividend payout ratio indicating that firms with only controlling shareholder will pay a lower dividend due to possible expropriation through profit diversion by controlling shareholder. Using Herfindahl Index as a proxy for ownership contestability, the presence of large shareholders along with controlling shareholder has a positive relationship with dividend payout implying that increased contestability helps to curb the power of controlling shareholder to expropriate fund for their own benefit. In accordance with agency theory, the outcome suggests that large shareholders play a monitoring role in minimizing the Type II agency problem. It is also verifying the argument made based on the Catering Theory of Dividend that the presence of large shareholder brings benefit to all shareholders as they are able to reduce profit diversion by demanding for higher dividend.

This paper provides a brief review of the state of knowledge in the field of agency theory. The managerial power approach assumes that a chief executive officer is able to affect the scale of his or her pay. However, Kaplan (2012) and others see a different picture of the corporate-governance landscape, hence they provide certain market-based explanations for high compensation. Our paper examines the relationship between a firm's performance and the amount of managerial compensation, and the ability of a CEO to affect a board's decision regarding his or her total compensation. The dataset consists of 75 companies traded in the capital market in the US. Our panel dataset covers a 10-year period from 2004 to 2013. We developed a single equation panel data model. The resulting parameter values provide a different picture of CEO power and the interconnection between a firm's performance and CEO pay in both sectors.

The high level of completion along with deceitful financial reporting has recently pointed the increasing consideration of researchers and academicians on the internal controls and internal audit functions (IAF). IAF in banks has several principles that are essential to be adhered. The bank's management bears the final responsibility to apply these principles properly and effectively to avoid such corporate scandals that would shake the confidence of investors and make it hard for organizations to enhance equity within the stock market. Thereby, they would need to understand the internal factors which influence their profitability performance. The main purpose of this paper is to develop the relationship between new standards of IAF issued by Basel Committee (2012) and banks' performance. In addition, it presents a theoretical research framework to understand this relationship supported by literature review from recent studies. The literature review indicates that practicing IAF creates discipline and enhances effectiveness of control and governance practices which are necessary to promote performance in the banks. Due to limitations of literature in bank sector, future studies are suggested to broaden the research empirically and highlight more on the effective IAF that can lead to better banks' performance.

This paper investigates performance drivers in a State Owned Enterprise from a perspective of contending organizational theories. It is based on BPC, an SOE that has gone through varied performance trends under different business models over the last 44 years. The study uses both qualitative and quantitative data from the last 15 years and finds that good performance has been supported by notions of the agency, stewardship and resource theories while a blanket pursuit of the stakeholder theory undermined sustainable performance, just as public choice theory implications. Two perspectives emerge: a broadened view of the agency theory reconciling traditional shareholder centric interests with those of the wider society and a residual societal benefits inherent in the public choice theory.

Manuscript type: Empirical Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically determine whether the one-rule-fits-all approached adopted by the Nigerian Securities Exchange Commission in terms of the separation of board chairman form the CEO promotes firm performance irrespective of the firms' ownership structures, in Nigerian with strong dominance of family owned firms. Design/methodology/approach: The study is restricted to firms quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Pooled data for 18-years period 1994-2011 were collated from published annual reports and statement of accounts of 91 ownership dispersed firms and 72 ownership concentrated firms. Two equation system Ordinary Least Square multiple regressions were used to estimate the relationship between firm financial performance and CEO duality along ownership structures in Nigeria. Findings: The findings of the study showed that while board duality was negative in predicting the financial performance of ownership dispersed firms; same cannot be said of ownership concentrated firms (family owned firms) as duality was found to be positive in predicting financial performance. Research Limitations/Implications: Paucity of substantial local literature on institutional perspective of agency constitutes the major limitation of this study. Although, this study is meant to close this gap, the implication is that foreign theoretical and empirical literature standpoint constitutes the bulk of the review, which may not explain reasons for any identifiable local trends in Nigeria. Practical Implication: The study reveals the importance of taking into cognizance, institutional perspective of agency theory in solving the excess power assigned to the board of directors, especially for family owned firms, where the family members have strong incentive to monitor the managers. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the institutional perspective of agency theory from Nigerian institutional perspective. The study revealed the importance of accommodating individual country specificities in draft corporate governance laws. (c) 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

From the Agency Theory point of view, the role of the board of directors is critical for supervision as well as for the control performed over management, preventing opportunistic behavior by shareholders in general and particularly by controlling shareholders against minority shareholders. Some corporate scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Nortel Networks and AIG, among others) have led to a growing interest on the quality of corporate government because all of those failed firms showed failures in their corporate governance. The delimitation of board functions and the identification of new good practices that allow them to perform their role properly and efficiently is one of the main challenges for governments and regulators in order to ensure their control mechanism duties, whilst restoring the confidence of decision-makers (investors and creditors). In fact, scholarly literature on the subject has linked board performance to different issues (for instance: board structure, nomination practices, diversity, experience and training, internationalization, incentives, remuneration, or board committees). Below is a review of the principles, practices and proposals arisen at the international context to improve board of directors' practices. The purpose of this overview is to point out the main challenges for the future in this regard. (c) 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

This study determines the variables influencing capital structure of firms. Firms would adapt themselves according to the economy and formulate a capital structure that would maximise their shareholder wealth. A total of 11,341 firm years from the year 2000 to 2015 are taken. This study reviews various theories (trade off theory, agency theory, pecking order theory) of capital structure. The results of this study suggest that profitability, non-debt tax shield, growth opportunity, liquidity and age of firm are negative and significant whereas size, assets tangibility is positive significant impact on the capital structure of firms. The findings allude to the reinforcement of pecking order theory which leads to establish that capital structure models forged in developed countries. It would be a helpful reference to managers/executives responsible for designing the capital structure of a company in such a corporate environment which can help to achieve the objective of shareholder's wealth maximisation.

The Agency Theory addresses the issue of conflict between principal and agent, thus its application to public sector concerns the government and the public. There is a population by the demand information, to assess the agent's management. The concept of voluntary disclosure relates to information provided by the government to the population. In this context, the aim of this paper is that socio-political and economic variables influence the disclosure levels in the electronic portals in the state of Parana, Brazil. The calculation of the disclosure level was performed by the Municipal Public Disclosure Index (PDI-M). The results indicate that socio-political-economic variables that influence the disclosure levels were the Middle Income Household per Capita, Illiteracy Rate, Municipal Debt and population.

Purpose - The purpose of this chapter is to analyse how in recent years the rediscovery that extreme inequality is returning to advanced economies and has become widespread. What is at issue are the causes of this inequality. It is becoming clear that the wider population, particularly in Anglo-American economies have not shared in the growing wealth of the countries concerned, and that the majority of this wealth is being transferred on a continuous and systemic basis to the very rich. Corporate governance and the pursuit of shareholder value it is argued has become a major driver of inequality. Methodology/approach - The current statistical evidence produced by leading authorities including the US Federal Reserve, World Economic Forum, Credit Suisse and Oxfam are examined. The policy of shareholder value and the mechanisms by which the distributions from business take place are investigated from a critical perspective. Findings - While the Anglo-American economies are seeing a return to the extremes of inequality last witnessed in the 19th century, the causes of this inequality are changing. In the 19th century great fortunes often were inherited, or derived by entrepreneurs from the ownership and control of productive assets. By the late 20th century as Atkinson, Piketty and Saez (2011) and others have highlighted, the sustained and rapid inflation in top income shares have made a significant contribution to the accelerating rate of income and wealth inequality. Research implications - The intensification of inequality in advanced industrial economies, despite the consistent work of Atkinson and others, was largely neglected until the recent research of Picketty which has attracted international attention. It is now acknowledged widely that inequality is a serious issue; however, the contemporary causes of inequality remain largely unexplored. Practical/social implications - The significance of inequality, now that it is recognized, demands policy and practical interventions. However, the capacity or even willingness to intervene is lacking. Further analysis of the debilitating consequences of inequality in terms of the efficiency and stability of economies and societies may encourage a more robust approach, yet the resolve to end extreme inequality is not present. Originality/value - The analysis of inequality has not been neglected and this chapter represents a pioneering effort to relate the shareholder value orientation now dominant in corporate governance to the intensification of inequality.

While developing the operations manual of three eco-laundry shops established by a Smokey Mountain cooperative, I discovered an alarming disparity in salary schemes among the social enterprises. Cooperatives in the Philippines embody the values of stakeholdership in that they balance the needs of all stakeholders to increase social performance. But in this case, principal- agent compensation practices were implemented towards increasing profitability. A discussion on compensation and organizational rewards allows for further understanding of the process in which these compensation packages were developed by the decision-makers. After using the survey method, measurable business indicators were evaluated to distinguish the effects of profitability, productivity, customer loyalty, and service quality on compensation. This study will show that leaders in this case did not uphold stakeholder values congruent with cooperatives, but instead implemented performance controls at the expense of more hardworking employees. A proposed compensation scheme which could be seen as more equitable by all employees is then discussed. (c) 2016 by De La Salle University.

Corporations are increasingly being pressured to manage their business risks including their social and environmental risks. The aim of this study is to examine the extent to which plantation companies in Malaysia address their social and environmental risks and the role of the board of directors in motivating the disclosure of risk management information. The agency theory was used to underpin arguments for the study. Content analyses of the annual and sustainability reports of forty (40) public-listed companies in the plantation industry for the year 2013 was undertaken to examine the quantity of risk management disclosure among these companies. The data for the multiple regressions was analyzed using the Structural Equation Modelling technique of Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS). The results of the study revealed that for social risks, Community Involvement issues were the most disclosed item while for environmental risks, the companies were concerned with Pollution Abatement/Environment awareness risk management issues. The findings from the study revealed that board professionalism was significant in inducing management to provide risk management information to stakeholders. However, board interlock and board size were not significant drivers motivating risk management disclosure. The findings from the study suggest that the professionalism of board members is critical to guide managements towards revealing risk management information. The findings from the study provide evidence that plantation companies in emerging economies such as Malaysia are becoming concerned about the social and environmental impacts of the palm oil plantation to the community and are taking steps to address these issues.

In the last decade, the interest for the study of ownership structure as a determinant of diversification arises. However, there is a lack of researches that analyze the influence of the nature of the ultimate owner in the level and type of diversification. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to analyze the diversification strategies used by the main Spanish business groups whose parent company is listed on the stock markets, and to study the differences between family and non-family business groups, considering in these last, the type of ultimate owner. In the study a sample of ninety-nine listed companies is used, where companies that constitute the business group are identified. In the paper are used as econometric methodologies the binomial logistic models and panel data models. The results show that family nature of business group positively influences in specialization and related diversification and negatively on unrelated diversification. Family groups differ most form those non-family groups where there is not a reference shareholder than can exercise effective control and ownership dispersion is higher, the groups referred as "non effective control". The research allows further analysis of differences between family and non-family groups, considering the nature of the ultimate owner for non-family groups.

Research summary: In this paper, we theorize and empirically investigate how a long-term orientation impacts firm value. To study this relationship, we exploit exogenous changes in executives' long-term incentives. Specifically, we examine shareholder proposals on long-term executive compensation that pass or fail by a small margin of votes. The passage of such "close call" proposals is akin to a random assignment of long-term incentives and hence provides a clean causal estimate. We find that the adoption of such proposals leads to (1) an increase in firm value and operating performance--suggesting that a long-term orientation is beneficial to companies--and (2) an increase in firms' investments in long-term strategies such as innovation and stakeholder relationships. Overall, our results are consistent with a "time-based" agency conflict between shareholders and managers. Managerial summary: This paper shows that corporate short-termism is hampering business success. We show clear, causal evidence that imposing long-term incentives on executives--in the form of long-term executive compensation--improves business performance. Long-term executive compensation includes restricted stocks, restricted stock options, and long-term incentive plans. Firms that adopted shareholder resolutions on long-term compensation experienced a significant increase in their stock price. This stock price increase foreshadowed an increase in operating profits that materialized after two years. We unpack the reasons for these improvements in performance, and find that firms that adopted these shareholder resolutions made more investments in R&D and stakeholder engagement, especially pertaining to employees and the natural environment.

Managerial risk taking is a critical aspect of strategic management. To improve competitive advantage and performance, managers need to take risks, often in an uncertain environment. Formal economic assumptions of risk taking suggest that if the expected values for two strategies are similar but one is a greater gamble (uncertain), managers will choose the strategy with a more certain outcome. Based on these assumptions, agency theory assumes that top managers should be compensated or monitored to achieve better outcomes. We review the theory and research on agency theory and managerial risk taking along with theories that challenge this basic assumption about risk taking: the behavioral theory of the firm, prospect theory, the behavioral agency model and the related socioemotional wealth perspective, and upper echelons theory. We contribute to the literature by reviewing and suggesting research opportunities within and across these theories to develop a comprehensive research agenda on managerial risk taking.

We show that firms with younger CEOs are more likely to experience stock price crashes, including crashes caused by revelation of negative news in the form of breaks in strings of consecutive earnings increases. Such strings are accompanied by large increases in CEO compensation that do not dissipate with crashes. These findings suggest that CEOs have financial incentives to hoard bad news earlier in their career, which increases future crashes. This negative impact of CEO age effect is strongest in the presence of managerial discretion. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of CEO age for firm policies and outcomes.

Business enterprises lie at the core of ecosystems that drive economic development and growth in market economies; yet, until recently, mainstream economics has mostly treated firms like homogeneous black boxes run by opportunistic managers. The field of strategic management has developed a more nuanced approach to the understanding of how firms are created, organized and grow, how they innovate and compete and how managers manage. One of the leading paradigms in the field is the dynamic capabilities framework. In this paper, contrasts and complementarities are drawn between dynamic capabilities and economic theories of the firm, including transaction cost economics and agency theory. Connections to the Cambridge school are highlighted, including the duality between Keynes's 'animal spirits' and the dynamic capabilities entrepreneurial owner/manager. Leibenstein's x-inefficiency is juxtaposed here with d-ineffectiveness. Knowledge-based theories of the firm consistent with Cambridge conventions emerge. Intellectual exchange between strategic management and economics is encouraged to help improve the intuition behind models of firms and the economy. (c) The Author 2017.

Research summary: Agency theory suggests that external governance mechanisms (e.g., activist owners, the market for corporate control, securities analysts) can deter managers from acting opportunistically. Using cognitive evaluation theory, we argue that powerful expectations imposed by external governance can impinge on top managers' feelings of autonomy and crowd out their intrinsic motivation, potentially leading to financial fraud. Our findings indicate that external pressure from activist owners, the market for corporate control, and securities analysts increases managers' likelihood of financial fraud. Our study considers external governance from a top manager's perspective and questions one of agency theory's foundational tenets: that external pressure imposed on managers reduces the potential for moral hazard. Managerial summary: Many of us are familiar with stories about top managers "cooking the books" in one way or another. As a result, companies and regulatory bodies often implement strict controls to try to prevent financial fraud. However, cognitive evaluation theory describes how those external controls could actually have the opposite of their intended effect because they rob managers of their intrinsic motivation for behaving appropriately. We find this to be the case. When top managers face more stringent external control mechanisms, in the form of activist shareholders, the threat of a takeover, or zealous securities analysts, they are actually more likely to engage in financial misbehavior.

This article intends to review the theoretical aspects and empirical evidences made on agency theory. It is aimed to explore the main ideas, perspectives, problems and issues related to the agency theory through a literature survey. It discusses the theoretical aspects of agency theory and the various concepts and issues related to it and documents empirical evidences on the mechanisms that diminish the agency cost. The conflict of interest and agency cost arises due to the separation of ownership from control, different risk preferences, information asymmetry and moral hazards. The literatures have cited many solutions like strong ownership control, managerial ownership, independent board members and different committees can be useful in controlling the agency conflict and its cost. This literature survey will enlighten the practitioners and researchers in understanding, analysing the agency problem and will be helpful in mitigating the agency problem.

Multinational corporations (MNCs) are facing increasing pressure on two fronts - the demand for more transparency and disclosure and the need to implement good corporate governance practices. This paper develops several testable hypotheses that address these issues based on agency theory and stakeholder management approach arguments. As such, the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs and firm-level governance structures are discussed. CSR is measured using Transparency International's study on the disclosure practices of the world's largest MNCs. Links between board size, board independence, and duality are explored. The results indicate that board independence and board size are strongly and positively related to several CSR practices. In addition, extractive industries have a significant and positive impact on the level of CSR activities. Policy and managerial implications related to these findings are also discussed.

This study investigates the impact of board gender diversity on dividend payments in the context of emerging economies. Using a dataset of listed firms from India, China and Russia over the period 2007-2014, we find strong and robust evidence indicating that board gender diversity is negatively related to cash dividend payments in all emerging economies. Moreover, we find that state-ownership positively moderates the relationship between gender diversity and dividend payments. However, this effect is observed only for China and Russia. In additional analyses, we find that the negative link between board gender diversity and dividend payments is more pronounced during the financial crisis. However, the moderating role of state-ownership does not remain significant during the financial crisis. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

This study investigates the impact of internal corporate governance on the relation between disclosure quality and earnings management in the UK listed companies, in particular whether governance mechanisms have deterrent effect on earnings management similar to firms' disclosure quality. Unlike prior literature, we measure a number of board and audit committee-related governance instruments, three disclosure quality proxies (i.e. Investor Relation Magazine Award, Forward-Looking Disclosure and Analyst Forecast Accuracy) and the Modified Jones Model to test the hypotheses of the study on a matched-pair sample data of Investor Relation Magazine Award winning and non-winning firms. Our findings in the OLS and sensitivity analyses using Heckman Procedure and 2SLS regressions consistently report a significant negative association between earnings management and disclosure quality for all proxies in restraining earnings management. In contrast, corporate governance variables are mostly insignificantly related to earnings management. This provides an emerging trend of the outperformance of disclosure quality over internal governance mechanisms in lessening earnings management. These findings warrant due attention of the policy makers, investors, corporate firms and other stakeholders in shaping a high-quality disclosure and governance regime in corporate settings to mitigate managerial manipulations of earnings across the countries in the world.

Research summary: Past inquiry has found that implementing complex competitive repertoires (i.e., diverse and dynamic arrays of actions) is challenging, but firms benefit from doing so. Our examination of the antecedents and outcomes of complex competitive repertoires develops a more nuanced perspective. Data from 1,168 firms in 204 industries reveal that complexity initially harms performance, but then becomes a positive factor, except at high levels. We use agency and tournament theories, respectively, to examine how key governance mechanisms--ownership structure and executive compensation--help shape firms' competitive repertoires. We find that the principals of agency theory and the pay gap of tournament theory are both important antecedents of competitive complexity, and an interaction exists wherein firms build especially complex repertoires when both influences are strong. Managerial summary: In boxing, the fight does not always go to the bigger or stronger person, or even to whomever throws the most punches--the fight is sometimes won by the boxer who is unpredictable, such as throwing an uppercut when the opponent expected a right hook. Similarly, when companies compete in the marketplace, advantage is afforded not only to those with more resources or who engage in more competitive activity, but also to those whose actions are unpredictable. In this study, we develop the notion of "competitive complexity," which describes the diversity and changing nature of a company's competitive moves. Implementing complex competitive repertoires can be painful in the short term but, if done correctly, can help company performance in the long run. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG, 2007 and 2012) on the performance of the listed companies in Malaysia. The agency theory and resource dependency theories indicate that the firms with strong corporate governance outperform firms with weaker governance. This paper explores this relationship in a developing country like Malaysia having different institutional environment compared to western countries. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a sample of 113 listed companies in Malaysia. The study incorporates the endogenous relationship between corporate governance, firm performance and leverage. Findings: The study analyzes how the corporate governance framework affected firm performance in Malaysia with the help of self-developed corporate governance index (MCGI). The authors' findings show that the performance of the firm is positively and significantly related with corporate governance measured by MCGI. Secondly, corporate governance of sample firms shows marked improvements after implementation of MCCG 2012 as compared to MCCG 2007. Originality/value: The findings of this paper support the agency and the resource dependency theories. The study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the corporate governance and firm performance in emerging economy and builds a case for enforcement of strong corporate governance code by government agencies.

Despite the growing research evidence on the effect of powerful CEOs on organizational outcomes, their role in shaping the firm's innovation agenda has received little scholarly attention. This study examines the effect of CEO power on exploratory and exploitative innovation. Drawing from core arguments of Behavioral Agency Theory, this study proposes that firms led by powerful CEOs are likely to pursue more exploratory and less exploitative innovations. Furthermore, these relationships are significantly strengthened by CEO Outsider Status. Using data from 150 U.S. firms, the results reveal a significant positive relationship between CEO power and explorative innovation. Contrary to predictions, firms led by powerful CEOs engage in more not less exploitative innovation when the CEO is appointed from outside the firm. Overall, the findings provide a more nuanced explanation of the link between CEO power and organizational innovation. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Previous earnings management research has largely focused on firm-level governance mechanisms in single countries or on macro-level variables in multiple countries. Building on this research, we incorporate firm ownership predictors along with national institutional dimensions to explore why firm decision makers in emerging markets vary in their earnings management behavior. Our theoretical framework integrates agency and institutional theories proposing that firm-level ownership mechanisms do not function in isolation, but are reinforced or attenuated by elements of the institutional governance environment. The multilevel empirical analysis of 1200 firms in 24 emerging markets indicates that controlling ownership is positively related to earnings management. We find that the level of minority shareholder protection in a country weakens this positive relationship. We also find that regulatory quality strengthens the negative relationship between institutional ownership and earnings management activity. It is hoped that awareness of how firm ownership structures interact with national-level institutions in affecting firm-level behavior will help managers and investors develop skills and practices to better cope with business norms in emerging economies.

Research summary: Cash can create shareholder value when used for adaptation to unfolding contingencies, but can also reduce value when appropriated by other stakeholders. We synthesize arguments from the behavioral theory of the firm, economic perspectives like agency theory, and the value-creation versus value-appropriation literatures to argue that the implications of cash for firm performance are context-specific. Cash is more beneficial for firms operating in highly competitive, research-intensive, or growth-focused industries that are typical of contexts requiring adaptation in the face of uncertainties. Conversely, cash is more detrimental to performance in firms that are poorly governed, diversified, or opaque, as are typical of contexts where stakeholder conflicts, information asymmetries, or power imbalances can encourage value appropriation by other stakeholders. Managerial summary: Cash can create shareholder value when used for adaptation to unfolding contingencies, but can also reduce value when appropriated by other stakeholders. While cash-rich firms have higher performance on average, with those in the 75th percentile having a market-to-book value 15 percent higher than those in the 25th percentile, we find that the performance benefits of cash depend on the context. Cash is more beneficial for firms operating in highly competitive, research-intensive, or growth-focused industries that are typical of contexts requiring adaptation in the face of uncertainties. Conversely, cash is more detrimental to performance in firms that are poorly governed, diversified, or opaque, as are typical of contexts where stakeholder conflicts, information asymmetries, or power imbalances can encourage value appropriation by other stakeholders.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine the impact of Shari'ah supervisory boards (SSBs) on the performance of Islamic banks (IBs). It also tests whether SSBs' attributes affect the performance of IBs. Based on a sample of 1, 803 Islamic bank-year observations from 82 banks in 15 countries over the period 1993-2014 and controlling for factors known to affect bank performance, this study reveals a robust and significant positive relationship between SSBs and Islamic bank performance. This study also shows that the characteristics of SSBs affect the performance of IBs. This research reveals how SSBs influence the performance of IBs, as well as the processes and roles SSBs use to ensure Shari'ah compliance in business transactions. Design/methodology/approach - The purpose of this study design is to relate SSB presence, size and diversity to financial performance using three techniques. The first technique is a multivariate data analysis that analyzes data arising from more than one variable. The second technique is a clustered regression (clustering by bank), which corrects for serial correlation and produces unbiased t-statistics. Because this sample is drawn from panel data, it is expected serial autocorrelation of the independent variables and error term within banks. In cases where within-company correlation exists, t-statistics based on average regression coefficients from year-by-year regression are upwardly biased and potentially severe (Peterson, 2009). Therefore, this study uses a technique that agrees with Stock and Watson (2002), who show that the standard method of calculating heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors for the fixed-effects estimator generates inconsistent variance estimates. Thus, using the clustered regression is consistent with the fixed-effects estimator. The third technique is a two-stage least-squares regression that helps build an instrumental variable for robustness tests purposes. Findings - The findings suggest that large corporate boards and large SSBs are more efficient in dealing with different monitoring and advisory roles than small SSBs. Consequently, this suggests that increasing the size of corporate boards and SSBs should improve monitoring and advisory functions, management behavior and organizational performance. Research limitations/implications - It is possible that there is an upper limit to this benefit, however; we do not explore this limit, which therefore provides opportunities for additional research. Because Shari'ah compliance relates only to a rational legal framework of negative screening relegated to interest prohibition and limiting uncertainty. The interest prohibition and limiting uncertainty have not been investigated between the two samples due to data unavailability. In addition, limited accounting-based measures of financial performance may not accurately portray IB performance; hence, an additional market measure is implemented, which is Tobin's Q. Practical implications - Ultimately, these findings could help IBs improve their financial results by enhancing their internal and external governance mechanisms (Walsh and Seward, 1990). They provide a basis for developing larger, more diverse SSBs that are more focused on complying with Shari'ah and corporate governance. The results also have significant policy implications for improving firm-level corporate governance versus improving country-level institutional factors. Both views have their advocates. However, it is very difficult to reform the legal system in a short time. Still, this study shows that struggling IBs have a way to improve their corporate governance and simultaneously improve their financing environment. Originality/value - This research contributes to the literature on the effects of SSBs on IBs' organizational financial performance, processes and roles. It is the first to examine empirically the underpinnings of how SSBs affect organizational financial performance via agency theory and contingency theory. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

We identify how barriers to absorptive capacity limit success in integrating external technology by firms in emerging markets. We refine previous barriers to absorptive capacity and classify them into internal (managerial biases and weak social integration mechanisms) and external (muted activation triggers, conflicting source relationships, and feeble appropriability regimes). We also identify how particular conditions in emerging markets (higher restraints on incentives, higher information asymmetries, and weaker contract protection) heighten the barriers. Using agency theory as the theoretical base, we provide a better understanding of absorptive capacity and of the influence of the home country on capability upgrading. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The recent financial crisis has brought to the forefront the need for companies to effectively manage their risks. In this regard, one approach that has gained prominence is enterprise risk management (ERM). Importantly, little is known about the link between ERM and the financial reporting process. This link is critical, because it is imperative that financial reporting adequately depicts the financial status (e.g., valuations, estimates) and associated risks of a company as revealed by ERM. Additionally, from an auditing perspective, ERM affects the risks of misstatement, which should impact audit planning. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to examine the experiences of audit partners, CFOs, and audit committee (AC) members ("the governance triad") on the link between ERM and the financial reporting process. To determine whether members of the governance triad focus on monitoring, strategy, or both, we also examine their definition of and experiences with ERM with respect to agency and/or resource dependence theory. To address these issues, we conduct semistructured interviews of experienced individuals that form the governance triads from 11 public companies. There are three major findings from our study. First, importantly, all three types of participants see a strong link between ERM and the financial reporting process. Second, despite recognition of the broad nature of ERM, the predominant experiences of the actual roles played by triad members center on agency theory, while resource dependence may be relatively underemphasized by all triad members. Finally, CFOs and AC members indicate that auditors may be especially underutilizing ERM in the audit process, suggesting an "expectations gap.". (c) CAAA

This study examines how financial reporting quality affects corporate dividend policy. We find that higher quality reporting is associated with higher dividends. This positive association is more pronounced among firms with more severe free cash flow problems and among firms with higher ownership by monitoring-type institutional investors. Further analysis of the relation between reporting quality and under-/over-payment of dividends suggests that reporting quality largely mitigates underpayment of dividends. Additionally, both a granger causality test and a difference-in-difference analysis of dividend changes around a quasi-exogenous reporting event yield evidence consistent with the direction of causality going from financial reporting to dividends. Overall, these findings are consistent with financial reporting quality acting as a governance mechanism that induces managers to pay dividends by disciplining free cash flow problems. Our findings support the view that dividends are the result of enhanced monitoring (Jensen 1986; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny 2000).

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Past empirical efforts in corporate governance have examined the effects of large shareholders with excess control rights on tunneling activities. However, no study has systematically investigated the effects of multiple large shareholders on excess leverage policies and tunneling in an emerging country environment where minority rights protection is weak. In this study, we examine the role of multiple large shareholders and the effects of control contestability of multiple large shareholders on firm excess leverage decision and tunneling by controlling shareholders. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of 2,341 Chinese firms for the years 2001 to 2013, we document that the contestability of multiple non-controlling large shareholders relative to controlling shareholders reduces the adoption of excess leverage policies, tunneling and enhances capital investment. Another intriguing finding is that the government, as a controlling shareholder, exerts significant influence and reduces the monitoring effectiveness of multiple larger shareholders. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By addressing the role of multiple large shareholders on excess leverage decisions, this study makes an important contribution to the corporate governance literature. We extend the recent developments in agency theory regarding the role of multiple large shareholders in constraining expropriation of controlling shareholders with excess control rights and their effect on firm leverage decisions. Our results support the theoretical models which indicate that the presence of multiple large shareholders is an important and efficient internal governance mechanism that mitigates a firm's agency costs, particularly, in an emerging market environment where corporate governance is weak and inadequate to curb the tunneling problem.

Research summary: Corporate scandals of the previous decade have heightened attention on board independence. Indeed, boards at many large firms are now so independent that the CEO is "home alone" as the lone inside member. We build upon "pro-insider" research within agency theory to explain how the growing trend toward lone-insider boards affects key outcomes and how external governance forces constrain their impact. We find evidence among S&P 1500 firms that having a lone-insider board is associated with (a) excess CEO pay and a larger CEO-top management team pay gap, (b) increased likelihood of financial misconduct, and (c) decreased firm performance, but that stock analysts and institutional investors reduce these negative effects. The findings raise important questions about the efficacy of leaving the CEO "home alone.". Managerial summary: Following concerns that insider-dominated boards failed to protect shareholders, there has been a push for greater board independence. This push has been so successful that the CEO is now the only insider on the boards of more than half of S&P 1500 firms. We examine whether lone-insider boards do in fact offer strong governance or whether they enable CEOs to benefit personally. We find that lone-insider boards pay CEOs excessively, pay CEOs a disproportionately large amount relative to other top managers, have more instances of financial misconduct, and have lower performance than boards with more than one insider. Thus, it appears that lone-insider boards do not function as intended and firms should reconsider whether the push towards lone-insider boards is actually in shareholders' best interests.

This paper examines the relationship between board structure and corporate risk taking in the UK financial sector. We show how the board size, board independence and combining the role of CEO and chairperson in boards may affect corporate risk taking in financial firms. Our sample is based on a panel dataset of all publicly listed firms in the UK financial sector, which includes banks, insurance, real estate and financial services companies over a ten year period (2003 - 2012). After controlling for the effects of endogeneity through the application of the dynamic panel generalized method of moments estimator, the findings of this study suggest that the presence of non-executive directors and powerful CEOs in corporate boards reduces corporate risk taking practices in financial firms. The negative relationship can be explained within the agency theory context, where managers are regarded as more risk averse because of the reputational and employment risk. An increased power concentration is therefore expected to enhance the risk aversion behaviour of directors. The findings however, do not show any significant effect of board size on corporate risk taking in financial firms. As this study covers recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code on the role of corporate boards in managing firms' risk, the empirical evidence could be useful for corporate governance regulation and policy making.

This study relies on environmental stewardship, a stakeholder-enlarged view of stewardship theory, and institutional theory to analyze the relationship between CEO compensation and firms' environmental commitment in a worldwide sample of 520 large listed firms. Our findings show that environment friendly firms pay their CEOs less total compensation and rely less on incentive-based compensation than environment careless firms. This negative relationship is stronger in institutional contexts where national environmental regulations are weaker. Our findings have important theoretical meaning and practical implications. Results show that CEOs do not necessarily act opportunistically; rather some of them may be willing to act as stewards of the natural environment and accept a lower, less incentive-based compensation from environment friendly firms. This study also provides evidence of the important influence of the institutional context in setting-up CEO compensation as the relationship is stronger when national environmental regulations are weaker. Our findings question the universal validity of agency theory in explaining CEO compensation. Compensation based on pecuniary incentives might be less indicated to motivate CEOs who feel rewarded by playing a stewardship role for environment friendly firms. When designing compensation for CEOs, compensation committees and external compensation advisors should consider psychological and institutional factors that might affect CEO motivation.

We test in a European context the impact of countries' lending infrastructure on SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises) capital structure. Devised from Berger and Udell (2006), this infrastructure is comprised of the information, legal, judicial, bankruptcy, social, tax and regulatory environments. We find that SME debt is higher in countries with more efficient bankruptcy environments in terms of debt recovery and in countries with less stringent regulatory environments by way of lower capital regulatory requirements for banks. Components of the lending infrastructure are found to differ with debt maturity. Long-term debt is synonymous with efficient bankruptcy environments, whilst the information and legal environments matter more for short-term debt. The regulatory environment is important for both long-term and short-term debt. Our results also lend support for the Pecking-Order, Trade-Off and Agency theories of capital structure.

A growing number of recent studies highlight an avenue of entrepreneurship in family business. Previous studies have examined the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and firm performance, and generate inconsistent results probably due to the omission of the moderating role of family governance. To explicitly address this gap, this study investigates how entrepreneurial orientation (EO) influences firm performance in the contingencies of family and nonfamily firms by considering the influence of family governance. Built on agency theory and stewardship theory, the empirical findings of this study show that EO is positively associated with the concurrent and sustaining performance of firms, and such positive relationships are particularly strong when family ownership is combined with active family management and control; while in passive family governance, the EO-performance relationship becomes insignificant. These findings suggest that the potential advantages of EO can be better realized in family firms because active family governance alleviates agency problems and facilitates stewardship within firms when family CEOs, family top management, family chairpersons, and family directors are in presence.

The relationship between HRM and well-being has received a significant amount of research attention; however, results are still contested. Our study addresses this phenomenon in the Higher Education sector. We specifically investigate the association between performance management and the perceived well-being of academic staff. Our research finds that the application of a directive performance management approach, underpinned by agency theory ideas as evidenced by a high reliance on performance measures and targets, is negatively related to academics' well-being (i.e. the more it is used, the worse people feel). In contrast, an enabling performance management approach, based on the learnings of stewardship theory, emphasising staff involvement, communication and development, is positively related to academics' well-being. We also find the positive relationship between enabling practices and well-being is mediated by how academics experience their work (i.e. their perceptions of job demands, job control and management support). These results indicate that current trends to intensify the use of directive performance management can have consequences on the energy and health of academics, which may influence their motivation and willingness to stay in the profession. This research suggests that an enabling approach to managing performance in this context, may have more positive effects. (c) 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This paper studies how governance drives entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in small firms. We argue that founder status and ownership create powerful personal incentives for small firm CEOs to engage in behaviors that influence EO. Integrating stewardship theory and the principal-principal branch of agency theory, we test our hypotheses on a sample of 339 Swedish firms, and find that CEO founder status is significantly and positively associated with EO, while CEO stock ownership significantly but negatively predicts EO. We additionally test two boundary conditions that show that the founder-CEO's prior managerial experience in start-up firms positively moderates the founder-EO relationship, while contrary to expectations, CEO ownership diversification has no effect on the negative association between ownership and EO. Thus, our study adopts a corporate governance perspective to explain how variations in EO across small firms are driven by the goals and motivations of its leader. Our research also shows that in small, private firms the balance of power is tipped in favor of the CEO rather than the board of directors. Finally, we underline the importance of adopting alternative theoretical lens like stewardship and principal-principal agency, given that traditional principal-agent problems are largely mitigated in the small firm context.

Family business research suggests that family involvement in the board (FIB) may have both positive and negative effects on entrepreneurship. To reconcile these conflicting views, this study builds on stewardship theory, agency theory, and the resource-based view and proposes a nonlinear relationship between FIB and entrepreneurial orientation (EO) to explore how board task performance moderates this relationship. Using a sample of 208 Belgian private family firms, the findings show an inverted U-shaped relationship between FIB and EO, with EO declining beyond moderate levels of FIB. Furthermore, board monitoring task limits the negative effects of high FIB on EO, whereas the board service task does not have any significant effect. This study offers a more nuanced view of the governance conditions that affect EO in the context of private family firms, an overlooked topic in the family business field. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This article examines whether agency or stewardship is the more effective form of managerial governance within family firms. Synthesizing arguments regarding the differential tendencies of nonfamily versus family managers and the bifurcated manner in which they are likely to be governed, we propose asymmetric responses to agency versus stewardship mechanisms. Our empirical results provide evidence challenging common assumptions regarding the behavior exhibited by nonfamily versus family managers and the mechanisms by which each is governed. Although our findings also provide evidence of response asymmetry, they nevertheless point to the greater effectiveness of stewardship over agency governance irrespective of a manager's family affiliation.

The agency theory and law and finance literatures show good country governance encourages financial development, mitigates agency problems, and increases firm value. Drawing on these literatures, we develop a theory that benefits from good country governance are portable by firms across countries through cross-border acquisitions. Using acquisitions from 56 countries from 1990 to 2007, we find that acquirers can transport the benefits from good country governance, so that they gain more from acquiring targets with worse country governance than their own. As predicted, the acquirer's stock-price reaction to acquisitions increases with the country governance distance between the acquirer and the target.

We draw on the socioemotional wealth perspective to examine the influence of family ownership on firms' noncompliance with corporate governance codes. Our results yield an inverted U-shaped effect of family ownership on noncompliance. While the family influence and control dimension leads to high levels of noncompliance, socioworthiness stemming from image and reputation dimension lessens noncompliance. In the presence of potential agency conflict, the control dimension prevails over reputation, even in countries with strong governance institutions. Our findings have critical implications for family business theory, for governance policy making and also for better understanding corporate governance in family firms.

Research summary: Shareholder activism has become more widespread, yet the role of corporate governance as antecedent to shareholder activism remains equivocal. We propose a new conceptual model that characterizes the stochastic of observable shareholder activism as a compound product of two latent components representing (1) shareholder activists' propensity to target a company and (2) executives' propensity to settle activists' demands privately. Our model explicitly decouples corporate governance expectations for the two latent components embedded in activism process, and thus allows us to relax assumptions of homogenous shareholder interests and constrained managerial discretion where corporate managers are expected to negotiate privately and settle only value-creating activist demands. Bayesian analysis of zero-inflated Poisson regression reveals that corporate governance relationships with activism vary across shareholder demands and private settlements. Managerial summary: Increasing shareholder activism has generated debates as to whether activism promotes managerial accountability and responsibility or instead encourages managerial short-termism. Our research model allows for heterogeneous interests among a company's shareholders. We theorize and empirically investigate a broader role of corporate governance: governance mechanisms need to ensure that executives are not (1) ignoring activists' value-increasing demands or (2) accommodating activists' value-decreasing demands in a private, opaque manner that disenfranchises other shareholders. Our results indicate that corporate governance implications differ for visible shareholder demands in contrast with private activism. A plausible application of our model is that it provides estimates of the probability of the numbers of shareholder demands to be received by a firm and the probability of privately settling a demand.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

This study aims to examine the influence of board independence on corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting by publicly listed companies in Malaysia. Content analysis was used to determine the extent of CSR reporting. A reporting index consisting of 51 items was developed based on six themes: General, Community, Environment, Human Resources, Marketplace and Other. An Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression was used to examine the relationship between board independence and firm CSR reporting. The results indicate that the association between board independence and company CSR reporting is industry specific. Overall, the empirical evidence partially supports agency theory.

This study seeks to understand the leading role played by the blockholders and their true governance mechanism, in the French context, characterised by complex ownership structures. We focus on the role that second-tier shareholders can play in the optimal governance of companies and in their capacity to solve both principal/agent and principal/principal agency conflicts. Using a sample of 2118 observations between 2000 and 2009, we find that second-tier shareholders exercise effective additional monitoring when power is contestable but increase principal/principal agency costs in the presence of a controlling owner. We also show that shareholder homogeneity reduces agency conflicts. Our results demonstrate that the level of control contestability is essential in the understanding of governance mechanisms. Such contestability is to be found simultaneously at institutional level, at the level of the balance of power between blockholders, and according to the nature of the shareholders. Thus, the usual agency theory conclusions are debateable when the legal framework offers little protection of minority shareholders, and when ownership structure is complex and heterogeneous in nature. The study of corporate governance must therefore encompass a twofold analytical perspective, namely, an institutional and a socio-organisational one. The analysis and findings could be particularly useful in assessing corporate governance in the context of several European countries with a similar self-dealing legal environment to the French one, including Italy and Greece.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the links between company ownership structure and financial performance in the context of the largest Central European stock market. Using the framework of agency theory, the authors address the question of the expropriation effect by dominant owners and the effect of collusion between shareholders of different types on company performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test hypotheses on the relations between ownership concentration and the involvement of different shareholders (state, CEO, industry and financial investors) vs return on assets (ROA). The authors adopt the panel model controlling for endogeneity and sector of operation and analyze the data from the unique sample of 495 Polish non-financial firms listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in years 2005-2014 with a total of 3,203 observations. Findings: The authors identify a negative correlation between ownership concentration by the majority shareholder and ROA, which corresponds with the expropriation rationale of blockholders. The authors also observe negative effects due to ownership concentration by the second largest shareholder, supporting the notion of collusion. The results show that ownership by industry investors is associated with a higher ROA. Ownership by the CEO, state and financial investors proves to have no statistically significant effect on performance. Originality/value: The paper further develops the nature of ownership-performance relations in the specific economic context of a post-transition, emerging European stock market, weak external corporate governance mechanisms, insufficient investor protection and significant concentration of share ownership. The results add to the understanding of monitoring vs expropriation effects by large owners and the collusion between different types of shareholders. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This research examines the relationship between independent directors, the audit committee (AC), and firm performance, taking into account the impact of the chief executive officer's powers and block shareholders. We use the maximum likelihood estimator, based on agency theory assumptions and cylindered panel data, to examine three models of firm performance. The results show that the independence of the board is reflected clearly by increased economic and equity performance of the firm. However, an AC that is fully independent or meets frequently is associated with lower firm performance. Unlike pension funds, institutional shareholders can be considered an effective control mechanism in the context of France. Our results development includes advanced explanations for market liquidity and shareholders' portfolios. The study period ends before the European regulation on ACs came into effect in 2008. This allows for an appreciation of soft law in French corporate governance. It also lets us compare the data with the way firms operate their boards one decade later. The evidence provides useful guidelines on the supremacy of soft law in corporate governance and suggests that the composition and functioning of the board of directors should be moderated based on the firms' context. The specificity of the cylindered panel data helps to better examine the impact of the board and AC's independence and functioning in French corporate governance structure.

Board leadership has always been conceptualized as a tradeoff between two desirable yet mutually exclusive organizational attributes. Classical organization theory prescribes unity of command, achieved by combining the chief executive officer (CEO) and board chair positions; in contrast, agency theory prescribes independent monitoring, achieved by separating the CEO and board chair positions. Extant theory does not acknowledge the possibility that a compromise might exist between these competing theoretical prescriptions, one which might reduce their mutual exclusivity. Such a compromise has emerged in practice, however: the lead independent director. In the present research, we initiate theoretical exploration of this compromise between the prescriptions of agency theory and classical organization theory, addressing the questions of when a board will choose to appoint a lead independent director, who among the independent directors will serve in the position, how lead independent director appointment will impact firm performance, and whether this compromise is a permanent solution or a stepping stone to a more extreme outcome. Analysis of S&P 1500 firms from 2002 to 2012 reveals that lead independent director appointment reflects balanced power on the board, impacts firm performance positively under the right conditions, and generally becomes institutionalized as a permanent governance structure.

We examine the longitudinal relationship between ownership structure and firm internationalization, in a sample of Indian firms. Drawing on principal-principal (PP) agency theory and the resource-based-view (RBV) of the firm, we argue that divergent preferences (motivations) of a firm's owners affect the firm's propensity to internationalize, while resource heterogeneity among these owners (owners' capability to access and provide resources) affects the firm's capability to internationalize. We argue that both motivation and capability are required for firms to pursue internationalization and that when either of these is missing in an owner, that owner's shareholding will be negatively associated with internationalization. Additionally, our results uncover an interesting dichotomy. While family owners with lower levels of ownership favor their firms' internationalization, they do not favor it at higher levels of ownership. Our results indicate that foreign owners appeared to adjust their roles to accommodate the preferences of the dominant family owners. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This article theoretically and empirically intertwines agency and stewardship theories to examine their distinct and combined influences on family firms. Primary matched triadic data from CEOs, family employees, and nonfamily employees in 77 family firms suggest that agency and stewardship governance affects individual-level behavior and firm-level performance. Specifically, agent behavior is highest under conditions of coexisting low agency governance and high stewardship governance and is lowest when agency and stewardship governance coexist at high levels. Furthermore, when high levels of agency and stewardship governance coexist, family firm performance is the highest. Theoretical implications and future research directions are discussed.

Taking a combination between agency theory and resource dependence theory, we point out that directors' capital may have an effect on R&D strategies. A sample of both high-tech and low-tech industries for the period 2007-2011 is used. The results indicate that, regardless of the type of industry and the specific expertise on R&D intensive companies, board members with multiple directorships influence R&D corporate strategies. The resources acquired by directors through their experience and connections positively influence R&D intensity, but only if directors can carry out their monitoring activity adequately. This evidence implies a step forward in the understanding of the role of board of directors in corporate strategy, thus having significant implications for academics, companies and regulators, which are both theoretical and practical.

Emerging evidence suggests that pay dispersion among non-CEO top management team (TMT) members harms firm performance, which raises questions about why firms' owners tolerate or even support it. Prior research shows that the key distinction between founder and family owners is that in addition to firm performance and growth goals, family owners pursue socioemotional goals. On the basis of this distinction, we develop and test theory linking founders' and families' ownership to TMT pay dispersion. Consistent with our theory, a Bayesian panel analysis of Standard & Poor's 500 firms shows that founder owners use less TMT pay dispersion and that family owners, relative to founder owners, use more, although that declines across generations. We also provide evidence that TMT pay dispersion harms firm performance. Our theory and results are significant because they help to explain why some owners favor compensation practices that cause TMT pay dispersion, despite evidence that this harms firm performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to adopt an agency theory approach to investigate the integration of environmental issues into management control systems (MCS). Prior environmental accounting research has focussed on increasing organisations' environmental accountability by "monitoring" through external reporting to stakeholders. However, this overlooks the alignment of agents' interests within the firm. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study is undertaken in a large Australian listed property trust to investigate how agents' interests may be integrated with environmental objectives through the use of MCS. Findings: From the case an analytical framework is developed to illustrate how environmental issues are incorporated into organisational behaviour through MCS. The findings include, single objective environmental MCS; multiple objective MCS, which include priorities that specify environmental and economic trade-offs; and balancing MCS, which provide overarching decision-making principles without priorities. Practical implications: The findings provide examples of how an organisation may integrate environmental issues across a range of MCS and the things to consider in doing so. Originality/value: This paper draws on an agency perspective as an approach to incorporate environmental issues into MCS and to align behaviour. It explains a new way in which tensions can be managed. This study is one of the first to adopt the control package approach in investigating the incorporation of environmental issues in MCS.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate simultaneous relations between corporate governance (CG) practice and cash flow right, cash flow leverage (the divergence between control right and cash flow right of controlling shareholders). The two ownership measures reflect alignment and expropriation incentives of controlling shareholders. This study also examines the effect of multiple large shareholders (MLSs) on CG practice. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses publicly listed companies (PLCs) excluding those from the Indonesian finance sector during 2011-2013 as the samples of the study. Two-stages least squares regression models were used to test the simultaneous relations between CG practice and ownership structure variables. The study develops a CG instrument to measure CG practice based on ASEAN CG Scorecard, that comprehensively covers OECD CG principles and that can be used for panel data. Findings: CG practice has a positive influence on cash flow right and has a marginally negative impact on cash flow leverage, while cash flow right and cash flow leverage have a marginally negative impact on CG practice. Further, the existence of large MLS complements CG practice, but as the control right of the second largest shareholders becomes closer to the largest shareholder, the complement relation becomes less important. State- or foreign-controlled PLCs practice better CG than other PLCs. Research limitations/implications: Studies on CG/ownership structure need to treat CG and ownership structure as endogenous variables in their research design. In addition, the level of rule of law in a country should be taken into account when examining the relation between CG and ownership structure. The interrelation among CG, ownership structure, capital structure and firm performance has been studied in the context of dispersed ownership structure and strong rule of law. Thus, future study needs to examine the interrelation among these four concepts in countries with high concentrated ownership and weak rule of law. Practical implications: To minimize the risk of expropriation, investors in the capital market need to select shares of PLCs that practice CG suitable for the ownership structure of PLCs, have high ownership by the largest shareholder and have no divergence between control and ownership right, and or have MLSs. PLCs may need to choose the level of CG mechanism in the context of their ownership structure and consider the benefits and costs implementing them. Social implications: The study supports the "one size does not fit all" perspective on CG and, thus, it supports the recently enacted financial service authority (FSA) rule requiring PLCs to follow the "comply or explain" rule on the CG code for PLCs. The FSA needs to enforce the compliance of PLCs with CG rules and encourage PLCs to implement CG in substance, not just in form. To strengthen the positive impact of good CG practice in attracting investments in capital market, the regulator needs to improve investor protection rules and ensure strong rule of law. Originality/value: The study is the first to examine the simultaneous relation between CG practice and both cash flow right and cash flow leverage of the largest shareholder. It is also the first that investigates the impact of MLS on CG practice. It explores the complement and substitution relation between the two concepts in reducing agency costs. In term of research design, the study develops a CG instrument that is based on OECD CG principles, that can be used for panel data and that uses public information.

More and more boards are tapping interim CEOs to temporarily fill the corner office. Prior research indicates the negative performance implications of this decision; yet, little is known about the rationale behind this decision. Our aim is to fill this research gap. Drawing on agency and human capabilities frameworks, we examined the contextual elements that influence a board's decision to pursue temporary leadership. Within a sample of 375 successions occurring between 1998 and 2005, we found that boards of directors were more likely to select interim CEOs under certain succession conditions, namely, when the prior CEO was forced out and there was no heir apparent or when the prior CEO had served for a short tenure. Our results highlight the importance of context in succession selections and provide insights into why a board would pursue a decision with seemingly negative repercussions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

In connection with the literature on strategic reward and agency theory, this study investigates the effects of incentive pay on employee outcomes and firm performance. We identify employee outcomes, such as commitment and competence, as mediating processes that explain the effects of incentive pay on firm performance. We further propose procedural justice climate and environmental turbulence as boundary conditions that determine the strength of the effects of incentive pay on employee outcomes. The research model is tested using multisource data collected at three time points over a five-year period from 227 Korean companies. Our analysis confirmed that incentive pay enhanced employee commitment and competence, which, in turn, improved the operational and financial performances of firms. The effect of incentive pay on employee commitment was negative for firms with a low procedural justice climate, but positive for firms operated under a highly turbulent environment. By contrast, the effect of incentive pay on employee competence was positive only for firms operated under a stable environment. This study enriches the literature by presenting and validating plausible underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions under which strategic performance-contingent incentive pay affects firm performance.

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate that notwithstanding the fact that stewardship theory embraces things like trust of directors, their professionalism, loyalty and willingness to be concerned for the interests of others, as well as rejecting the foundations of classic agency problems that are asserted by agency theory, board accountability is as relevant to stewardship theory as it is to agency theory. Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies the theory underlying board accountability in corporate governance, which is so often applied both in the corporate governance literature and in practice with agency theory in mind, to stewardship theory. Findings - While the idea of accountability of boards is generally associated with an explanation and conceptualisation of the role and behaviour of directors as agents within classic agency theory, the paper demonstrates that board accountability is a necessary part of board life even if the role of directors is explained and conceptualised in terms of stewardship theory. Practical implications - The paper suggests some accountability mechanisms that might be employed in a stewardship approach. Originality/value - While many authors have talked in general terms about board accountability and its importance, this is the first paper that has engaged in a substantial study that links board accountability directly with stewardship theory, and to establish that accountability is necessary.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the association between firm size, profitability, leverage, auditor type and internet reporting and investigate the moderating effect of legal system, investor protection, masculinity, economic development, construction of disclosure index and measurement proxies of independent variables. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts a meta-analytic review for 59 research papers to synthesise quantitatively the results of previous literature on the determinants of internet reporting. This study uses Hunter and Schmidt's (2004) procedures to conduct the analysis. There are three main procedures to be followed: calculating the weighted effect size, calculating observed correlation variance and sampling error variance and, finally, testing for homogeneity and moderating effects. Findings: The results indicate a significant positive association between firm size, profitability, leverage, auditor type and internet reporting. The results confirm the prediction of agency theory, signalling theory, political cost hypothesis and diffusion of innovation theory. Moreover, the results show that investor protection, masculinity, economic development, construction of disclosure index and measurement proxies for independent variables moderate the association between profitability, leverage and internet reporting. Research limitations/implications: This study suffers from some limitations. First, corporate governance variables such as board size, role duality and board independence were not included in the analysis due to the limited number of studies that discuss the association between corporate governance and internet reporting. Second, the study does not control for the endogeneity problem. Practical implications: Future research has to consider the moderating effect of investor protection, masculinity, economic development, construction of disclosure index and measurement proxies for independent variables on the association between corporate characteristics and internet reporting. Future research can extend this work by examining the association between corporate governance, ownership structure and internet reporting. The findings regarding the determinants of internet reporting should be on concern of regulatory authorities. Originality/value: This study contributes to and extends previous meta-analysis literature by examining internet reporting determinants, as previous financial reporting meta-analysis studies give no attention to internet reporting.

Drawing on agency theory and the resource-based view, this study examines the moderating effect of hotel ownership structure on the relationship between high-performance work systems for service quality (HPWS-SQs) and service performance as well as the curvilinear relationship between hotel service performance and hotel profitability. Results from surveys and archival data of 126 hotels showed that when hotels were owned and operated by brands, HPWS-SQs had a positive effect on service performance. Moderated mediation analyses showed that service performance as a mediator accounted for the moderating effect of ownership and management structure on the relationship between HPWS-SQs and hotel profitability. In addition, service performance demonstrated an inverted U-shaped relationship with hotel profitability. These findings advanced the understanding of the boundary conditions and influence processes of HPWS-SQs on financial performance in service settings. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper traces the career of Michael Jensen, a Chicago finance PhD turned Harvard Business School professor to reveal the intellectual and social conditions that enabled the emergence and institutionalization of what we call the "neoliberal common sense of capital," what others have called the "shareholder value" view of the American firm. Jensen's work was embraced by a generation of corporate raiders aggressively advancing new financial practices and discourses. His contribution, commonly understood as "agency theory," was intertwined with the transformations in corporate management and governance of the last decades of the twentieth century--from the junk bond market in the 1980s to the exponential growth of CEO pay in the 1990s to the shareholder value management strategies of the 2000s. While debates about the spread of neoliberal ideas and governance tools have largely centered on the transformations of the state and international institutions or the role of actively organized intellectual networks, this essay emphasizes the importance of identifying specific carriers of particular transformations within the space of American "business discourse".

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of investments in organisational resources and corporate governance features on market-based performance of Islamic banks (IBs). Design/methodology/approach: The required data to calculate different constituents of banks' investment strategies and governance mechanism were hand collected from 268 annual reports. Different regression models were used to determine the impact of investment in human and structural capital and corporate governance features on market performance of IBs. Findings: The paper finds that investments in knowledge resources (human capital, in particular) have a significantly positive impact on the market value of IBs. The results further reveal that IBs' strategy to rely on long-term human capital accumulation can be seen as idiosyncratic problem-solving knowledge capital. Based on market measure, the paper finds role duality to have a significant positive impact and the size of the advisory board to have the opposite effect on market value. Research limitations/implications: This study includes IBs only and ignores other Islamic financial services providers such as Takaful (insurance) companies. The study leaves this chasm to be filled by future researchers. Practical implications: The findings may serve as a useful input for both Islamic bankers and regulators to apply knowledge management in their institutions. Furthermore, the dominant role of human capital also provides insight to managers with respect to business performance levers. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is to provide insight into the Islamic banking business model using a unique hand-collected data set, to identify the effect of investments in organisational resources and bank governance on market value in before, during and after financial crisis.

This study uses both a functionalist paradigm of social theory and agency theory assumptions to examine whether CEO remuneration is performance sensitive and, vice versa, whether companies that pay their CEOs more perform better. Our analysis is based on the sample of 330 large European firms for the period from 2009 to 2013. The findings of panel data analysis confirm that CEO compensation is positively associated with corporate performance, and vice versa. The simultaneous estimation, in which we treat both compensation and firm performance as endogenous using a two-stage least squares method, shows that companies tie bonuses to accounting-based measures and this incentive pay enhances corporate internal performance. However, compensation linked to market-based measures does not improve firm performance. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional agency theory typically focuses on a unidirectional problem, in which an agent behaves opportunistically against the interests of a principal. Yet, this conceptualization is too limited to fully describe all aspects of principal-agent relationships. This article presents a more comprehensive framework explaining a potential three-directional problem--that is, (i) agents behave opportunistically against the interests of principals, (ii) principals behave opportunistically against the interests of agents, and (iii) relationships between agents and principals representing confluence of interests affect the interests of third-party stakeholders. The article provides evidence of these problems, describes their unique characteristics, and outlines implications for society. It concludes with a discussion focusing on the implications of the proposed framework for purported governance solutions, the ongoing debate between shareholder and stakeholder views of the firm, and business practices.

Based on agency theory, this study analyzes whether family firms are more compliant with corporate governance recommendations than non-family firms in the context of emerging markets. Using a unique sample of 826 observations of the highest ranked companies on the stock exchange indices of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico during the period 2004-2010, we hypothesize that family firms may adopt better corporate governance practices to substitute for the absence or inefficiency of a regulatory system and to mitigate the agency problem between majority and minority shareholders. Additionally, we propose a corporate governance compliance index considering the legal and institutional framework of the region. The empirical results indicate that family firms report a higher corporate governance index. We find that board composition (independence, size and COB-CEO duality) does not moderate corporate governance compliance of family firms but rather such variables have a direct effect on the corporate governance index.

Research Summary: While the notion of subsidiary autonomy has received considerable attention within the international business literature, extant research is yet to comprehensively distinguish between the different types of subsidiary autonomy. This article outlines a key type that is independently claimed by the subsidiary, 'assumed autonomy,' and makes the following contributions: first, we outline the causes for this type of autonomy. Second, we elucidate how assumed autonomy is viewed by the head office. In doing so, the article also challenges previous applications of agency theory within the subsidiary-headquarters context, arguing the need for a refined, more nuanced interpretation in this setting to reflect a revised set of agency theory assumptions. Managerial summary: Despite representing a key issue in subsidiary management today, the types of autonomy that may be acquired by, or available to, a subsidiary are not yet fully understood. This article aims to reduce the confusion in this respect by outlining a key type of autonomy that is 'assumed' by the subsidiary without explicit delegation from the head office. We explain the reasons why this type of autonomy may be developed by the subsidiary and also how it is likely to be viewed by the head office. We anticipate that this will in turn have significant implications for the ongoing viability and value of the subsidiary within the multinational, and it highlights the importance of head office managers adopting a more open-minded approach to proactive subsidiary behavior.

This reflection focuses on what insights Catholic Social Teaching (CST) can provide for corporate governance. I argue that the 'standard' agency theory is overly reductionist and insufficiently incorporates important economic limitations (such as asymmetric information, incomplete contracts, and the need for coordination) as well as human frailty. As a result, such agency theory insufficiently distinguishes firms from markets, which can easily relativize how we treat others and facilitate rationalization of unethical behavior. I then explore how three pillars of CST--human dignity, solidarity, and subsidiarity--can help overcome these limitations. CST proposes a vision of the business corporation as a community of persons, working together in cooperative business relationships toward the shared purpose of contributing to human flourishing.

In this study we introduce a justice perspective to examining the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards over the allocation of firm residuals that ultimately determines CEO compensation. Framing CEO pay as the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards focuses attention on the power of CEOs to increase their share of firm residuals in the form of increased compensation, and the diligence of boards of directors to constrain CEO opportunism. Framing this negotiation through a theory of justice offers an alternative perspective to the search for pay-performance sensitivity. We predict and find that as board diligence in controlling opportunism declines and CEO power increases, CEOs are increasingly able to capture a larger portion of firm residuals relative to shareholders. This finding supports critics who charge that CEO pay violates norms of distributive and procedural justice. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Purpose: Presently, one of the major governance issues faced by management and shareholders of organizations is the gender composition of the boards of directors and audit committees. This study aims to examine the impact of gender diversity in audit committees on the accuracy of management earnings forecasts disclosure in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample comprises 190 Malaysian companies issuing IPOs that transformed into public companies during the period 2002-2012. Earnings forecasts accuracy (quality) is proxied by absolute forecast error and the study model is developed based on the frameworks of the signalling theory, the agency theory and the resource-dependence theory. Findings: The study proposes that female directors introduce a set of specific features in the boardroom that serve to improve investor protection and efficient monitoring of management. However, findings reveal an insignificantly positive relationship between gender diversity in audit committees and absolute forecast error, which shows that more female directors in audit committees could translate into more errors and less accuracy in earnings forecasts. Practical implications: Considering the recent regulatory developments that encourage the number of women on the board of directors, the findings obtained have significant implications for policymakers. The study findings can also be invaluable to investors, investment analysts, market players and researchers. Originality/value: The composition of the board of directors and audit committees in terms of gender plays a significant role in the promotion of effective corporate governance practices. This study is one of the pioneering studies that examines the advantages of gender diversity in the board of directors. It is also the first study to extend IPO literature by investigating the role of gender diversity in audit committees in the enhancement of accurate management earnings forecasts included in the IPO prospectuses.

This paper investigates the relationship between decision making power of chief executive officers (CEOs) and corporate capital structure in the context of emerging market characterized by deep collectivism and less prescriptive regulatory and legislative environment. Using a sample of 297 firms listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange SMEs Board from 2009 to 2013, it finds a hump-shaped association between CEO power and leverage suggesting a strong nonlinearity between these two variables. Furthermore, the results show that the entrenchment effect of CEO power on firm leverage becomes more fiercely in state-owned firms. Our findings are robust to alternative calculation procedures for the CEO power index and to alternative estimation techniques. The shareholders and policy makers might leverage our findings to improve the performance of CEOs in the Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper aims to identify the factors that affect dividend payments for Saudi Arabian Islamic and conventional banks and to test whether the factors that affect Islamic banks' dividend policy differ from the factors affecting conventional banks' dividends. Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression was run on data for six Islamic banks and six conventional banks. Findings: The paper found that profitability, lagged dividends and leverage are all significant determinants of Islamic Banks' dividend policy. Lintner's (1956) model applies to Islamic bank's dividend policy, as Islamic banks who payout dividends commit to their payments. All factors included in the study (profitability, liquidity, leverage, growth and lagged dividend) are found to be significant determinants of conventional banks' dividend payments. Research limitations/implications: Future research should include ownership variables in the regression to test the agency theory regarding dividends. Ownership variables were not included in the study because of data availability issues. Practical implications: The results of this study have practical implications for analysts, investors and regulators. For Islamic banks to compete in the local and global deposit markets, their management must carefully decide upon their dividend policy. As conventional banks are distributing stable dividends, it is time for Islamic banks to plan for a stable dividend policy to send positive signals to the market. As newcomers to the market Islamic banks should avoid spontaneous and inconsistent dividend distributions that do not carry any signals to the market. It will be difficult for Islamic banks to raise capital or attract investors because of their lower dividend yields compared to conventional banks. Boards of directors of Islamic banks should use dividends as an agency monitoring device; large-scale retention of earnings encourages behaviour by managers that does not maximize shareholder value. Dividends, then, are a valuable financial tool for these firms because they help firms avoid asset/capital structures that give managers wide discretion to make value-reducing investments.

Performance appraisal interviews remain central to how employees are scrutinised, rewarded and sometimes penalised by managers. But they are also often castigated as ineffective, or even harmful, to both individuals and organisations. Exploring this paradox, we highlight the influence of agency theory on the (mal)practice of performance appraisal. The performative nature of human resource management increasingly reflects an economic approach within which its practices are aligned with agency theory. Such theory assumes that actors are motivated mainly or only by economic self-interest. Close surveillance is required to eliminate the risk of shirking and other deviant behaviours. It is a pessimistic mind-set about people that undermines the supportive, co-operative and developmental rhetoric with which appraisal interviews are usually accompanied. Consequently, managers often practice appraisal interviews while holding onto two contradictory mind-sets, a state of Orwellian Doublethink that damages individual learning and organisational performance. We encourage researchers to adopt a more radical critique of appraisal practices that foregrounds issues of power, control and conflicted interests between actors beyond the analyses offered to date.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how Moroccan institutional investors view dividend policy. It discusses the importance these investors attach to the dividend policy of their investee firms, how much influence they exercise in shaping investee firms' dividend policies, their reactions to changes in dividends, and their views on various explanations for paying dividends. Design/methodology/approach: A mail survey provides a respondent and firm profile and responses to 28 questions involving various explanations for paying dividends and 30 questions on different dividend issues. Findings: Institutional investors attach substantial importance to dividend policy and prefer high dividend payments. Although liquidity needs are a major driver, taxes play little role in shaping dividend preferences. Respondents agree with multiple explanations for paying dividends giving the strongest support to catering, bird-in-the-hand, life cycle, signaling, and agency theories. Research limitations/implications: Despite a high response rate, the number of respondents limits partitioning the sample and testing for significant differences between different groups. Practical implications: The lack of communication between Casablanca Stock Exchange (CSE) listed firms and institutional investors may depress stock prices and increase volatility. The results suggest agency problems and a weak governance environment at the CSE. Originality/value: This study documents the importance that institutional investors place on dividend policy, their reactions to changes in their investees' dividend policy, and the methods used to influence these firms. It extends previous research by reporting the level of support Moroccan institutional investors give to various explanations for paying dividends. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

We examine the effect of the form of ownership on the profit efficiency of bank holding companies (BHCs) before and during the US financial crisis. For the pre-crisis period, the difference in profit efficiency between privately held and publicly traded BHCs is small. For the crisis period there is no statistically significant difference. These unexpected results suggest that agency issues do not affect the relative profit efficiency of private and public BHCs, or more likely, that these are offset by pressures for efficiency from capital markets and managerial labor markets and the advantages of specialization, a very important consideration in commercial banking.

Purpose - The aim of this study is to advance research on the position of the CISO by investigating the role that CISOs play before and after an IT security breach. There is a dearth of academic research literature on the role of a chief information security officer (CISO) in the management of Information Technology (IT) security. The limited research literature exists despite the increasing number and complexity of IT security breaches that lead to significant erosions in business value. Design/methodology/approach - The study makes use of content analysis and agency theory to explore a sample of US firms that experienced IT security breaches between 2009 and 2015 and how these firms reacted to the IT security breaches. Findings - The results indicate that following the IT security breaches, a number of the impacted firms adopted a reactive plan that entailed a re-organization of the existing IT security strategy and the hiring of a CISO. Also, there is no consensus on the CISO reporting structure since most of the firms that hired a CISO for the first time had the CISO report either to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Information Officer. Research limitations/implications - The findings will inform researchers, IT educators and industry practitioners on the roles of CISOs as well as advance research on how to mitigate IT security vulnerabilities. Originality/value - The need for research that advances an understanding of how to effectively manage the security of IT resources is timely and is driven by the growing frequency and sophistication of the IT security breaches as well as the significant direct and indirect costs incurred by both the affected firms and their stakeholders.

Purpose: Using a contingency approach, the purpose of this paper is to study how organizational factors (such as the organizational life cycle, firm size, firm ownership concentration and firm technology) determine the relative importance of the monitoring and provision of resources roles provided by board members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights the importance of contingency factors in carrying out board's roles using a sample of 579 European firms registered in the STOXX Europe 600 index. The authors used a longitudinal analysis for the period from 2002 through to 2011. Findings: The results show that the monitoring role is more relevant for companies that are large, are operating at the mature and stagnant stages, have a dispersed ownership and are low-technology. However, the provision of resources role is more relevant for companies that are in the growth and stagnant stages, and have a concentrated ownership. Originality/value: The traditional analysis that relates the board's structure and composition to the board's roles focuses on determining what board should be the best. It plays little attention to analyzing which organizational factors affect the importance and presence of monitoring or resource dependence roles. In this regard, this work adds significant insights to agency theory and resource dependence theory as, with a contingency framework, the research aims to find what functions the board needs to develop in order to get better firm performance.

This paper critically documents the rise of autonomy in subsidiary management literature, and develops an agenda for future research in this key area. Integrating and updating the seminal works of Paterson and Brock (2002) and Young and Tavares (2004), the paper begins with a critical review of subsidiary autonomy within the streams of subsidiary management literature. This leads to an assessment of the key contemporary issues requiring further investigation. These issues center around two key types of autonomy: assigned and assumed. We argue these types represent a more accurate, in-depth conceptualization of subsidiary autonomy, and also have significant implications for key related topics, including subsidiary development. This is depicted in an integrative model that draws upon agency theory, the network model of the MNE, the decision process perspective and the bundling model in presenting a revised view of subsidiary autonomy, and offers a basis for further research within the field.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Family firms, as insider-controlled companies, should be less likely to exhibit CEO turnover after poor performance and may thus promote enhanced focus on long-term goals. However, when a non-family CEO is in charge, the relatively limited empirical evidence is contrasting. Some studies find that only family CEOs are immune from the threat of dismissal following poor financial performance, while other studies show that family firms discipline their CEOs for poor financial performance regardless of their family status. In this work, we try to reconcile these contrasting findings and investigate what ownership and governance conditions influence the owners' pressure on the CEO to achieve short-term financial results. Research findings/insights: Drawing on a longitudinal dataset that covers the entire population of Italian medium and large family companies, we find that when family ownership is concentrated in the hands of few family shareholders or there is a low number of family members involved in the board of directors, non-family CEOs are less likely to be dismissed after poor performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study, adopting the behavioral agency theory as the guiding framework, highlights the importance for governance decisions of the potential goal divergence among principals in closely held ownership structures. Our results also add to the still scant literature on the relationship between family owners and non-family CEOs. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research suggests that, in the decision to hire a non-family CEO, family business owners should not only assess their gaps in managerial skills but also carefully consider the ownership structure and family involvement conditions. On the side of professional non-family managers, our results offer insights on ways to address the employment relationship with the controlling family. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Despite the widespread use of performance-based management in higher education, empirical research on its actual impact has remained scarce, particularly in Europe. With agency theory as a framework, our study utilised survey data collected from Finnish universities in order to explore the influence of performance management on perceived teaching and research performance of senior academics. Our findings suggest that, although academics hold a quite positive view of performance measurement as such, this attitude does not correlate with perceived high performance in either teaching or research. Moreover, our results suggest that perceived high performance among academics still relates primarily to acknowledgement from the academic community and academic achievement rather than to measurement and financial incentives.

The increased research focus on the networked perspective of the multinational enterprise (MNE) reflects a greater delegation of responsibility from corporate headquarters (CHQ) to subsidiary and intermediary units such as regional headquarters (RHQ). This shift has increased the intensity of political interactions between key actors within the MNE. Despite the recent rise in studies on the micro-political perspective of the MNE to date, little empirical work has explored this issue in the context of the CHQ-RHQ relationship. Drawing insights from agency theory and micro-politics, the authors focus on the context in which RHQs develop micro-political strategies in order to manage the flow and exchange of knowledge with CHQ. They show how RHQ may exhibit a 'dual agency' role when dealing with CHQ, in that it is characterized as a principal and agent, each requiring different micro-political knowledge strategies. As a principal, RHQ will develop micro-political knowledge strategies to increase alignment with CHQ. As an agent, RHQ develops micro-political knowledge strategies to pursue its self-interests. Having identified different RHQ agency roles, the authors develop a conceptual model that outlines how alignment and self-interest-seeking behaviours from RHQ are manifest through different micro-political knowledge strategies in its agency relationship with CHQ.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the relationship between the firms' ownership and control structure and their export performance. The literature is traditionally focused on the relationship between firms' performance and internationalization, with the relationship between ownership and control structure with internationalization being much less studied, particularly in the context of family firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors focus their study on the Portuguese wine firms due to their increasing importance in the Portuguese economy and in the promotion of the country's exports and image abroad. They used a balanced panel data sample of 82 firms for the period from 2011 to 2015 and applied a random effects model and a Tobit specification. Findings: The degree of family involvement shows a negative and significant relationship with internationalization, meaning that family firms that intend to internationalize should be open to receive external managers with international experience and increase their internal competencies to enhance internationalization. Originality/value: This paper extends the literature since assesses, at the light of the agency theory, the presence of differences in the internationalization degree and export intensity between family firms that are managed and controlled by the owners and family firms that are managed by non-family members, with an application to a less studied sector and country.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate whether family CEOs benefit investment efficiency under uncertainty with Chinese family firms and to test the moderating effect of ownership structure, including family ownership, the separation of family control from family ownership and the multiple large shareholder structure. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effects models are designed for a sample of 5,734 firm-year observations for Chinese family firms from 2009 to 2014. Findings: The results show that investment efficiency is low under uncertainty, and having family CEOs can reduce this negative relationship. Further analysis reveals that for firms with family CEOs, the negative effect of uncertainty on investment efficiency is weaker when the family has higher ownership, when family control is less separated from family ownership, or when family firms have multiple large shareholder structures. Research limitations/implications: The authors do not distinguish founder-CEOs and descendant-CEOs. Most of Chinese family firms are still managed by founders, so the authors cannot explore the generation effect although different generations manage firms differently. Because family succession is becoming a more and more important problem in China, further research may be able to explore the generation effect. Practical/implications: This paper suggests that in emerging economies with weak investor protection, outside minority shareholders can avoid expropriation from family owners by investing in firms with large family ownership, little separation of family control from ownership or multiple large shareholder structure. In addition, policymakers can encourage institutional investors to participate in family business to improve corporate governance. Originality/value: Drawing on both Type I and Type II agency theory perspectives, the authors argue that although family CEOs can generally benefit firms' investment efficiency, the benefits vary with firms' ownership structure. In other words, family CEOs are not absolute agents or stewards but some extent of combination of both. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the cross-cultural impact of CEO-Chair's gender to the likelihood of CEO duality firm's bribery. Design/methodology/approach: Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze data of 5,837 CEO duality firms from 21 countries. Findings: Firms with male CEO-Chairs were found to have higher propensity to bribe than their female counterparts. Moreover, cultural values of institutional collectivism and performance orientation strengthened gender's impact to bribery. In contrast, future orientation weakened the gender-bribery relationship, as opposed to the proposed effect. Practical implications: Key findings of this study can be utilized to increase awareness and widen perspective on the roles of CEO-Chair's gender and national culture on bribery. These can also be useful in the selection of CEO-Chair, design of educational programs on ethics as well as government and non-governments' programs and policies to minimize incidents of bribery. Originality/value: There are no existing studies on CEO duality firm's bribery which performed cross-cultural analysis on the impact of CEO-Chair's gender, making the study a novel contribution to business ethics, organizational structure, corporate governance, management decision, transparency, and accountability.

The purpose of this study is examine how agency theory and stewardship theory lead to different firm-level outcomes on an array of different outcomes. Based on these differences, we argue for the development of an agent-steward measurement scale, which will help researchers classify chief executive officers (CEOs) along an agent-steward continuum. This, in turn, will spur research to predict and test CEO behaviors and firm-level outcomes. Agency theory suggests CEOs take advantage of their powerful positions to maximize their personal economic utility, whereas stewardship theory suggests CEOs are motivated through intrinsic awards and will balance their interests with those of other stakeholders. We use these theories to examine possible differences in CEO behaviors. This is important because different CEO behaviors might lead to differing impacts on important firm-level outcomes. This paper reviews the relevant agency and stewardship literatures, then offers propositions regarding CEO behaviors from agent and steward perspectives.

This paper aims to provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between board leadership structures and executive compensation. According to agency theory, the combined position of CEO and Chairperson of the Board (COB) entails greater compensation for the CEO in order to reduce conflicts of interest. In the literature, combined board structure is generally considered to generate additional costs for companies. However, the choice of two separate structures implies the payment of incentive compensation for the COB in addition to that defined for the CEO. This paper investigates the financial cost of duality when compensation packages are set for both leaders. Our results suggest that although combined board structure is associated with higher incentive compensation for the CEO, the overall compensation cost to the company is no higher when the chairperson's compensation is considered.

We examine the relationship between the educational attainment of board chairperson and CSR disclosure in Indonesian banking industry. The underlying theory borrows agency theory positing that the characteristics of board chairperson matters in predicting the overall board performance in fulfilling monitoring responsibilities. Our dataset consists of 86 banks during 2009-2014. Univariate analysis shows that the majority of board chairpersons hold an undergraduate degree. Multivariate analyses find that educational attainment is positively related to CSR disclosure. Further tests reveal that the effects of educational attainment are contingent to the rank of awarding universities and the independence of board chairperson. However, MBA/accounting/economics educational background is insignificantly related to CSR disclosure. Copyright (c) 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Taking into account that it is in the nature of the modern corporation that risks are distributed over several agents, we discuss in this paper the organisational behaviour as it results from such dispersal of responsibilities for both the principal and the agent. We explore the hypothesis that dispersal of responsibilities could be the result or a cause of a lack of consensus between the principal and the agent. Our findings suggest that a dispersal of responsibilities has a negative impact on the principal-agent relationship and that it represents a foundation for theoretical and empirical approaches to organisational behaviour. We find that agent perceptions of a dispersal of responsibilities are linked to his/her resistance to the principal's interests, but this relationship is deeper than was suggested by previous research. However, if the sharing of responsibilities does not run parallel to that, we may have as a result what we call an agency problem.

We combine agency theory with the law and finance approach to analyze how the legal protection of investors and the corporate ownership structure affect corporate investment in research and development (R&D). We use information from 956 firms from the five most R&D-intensive industries in 19 developed countries. Our results show that better protection of investors' rights by the institutional environment has a positive influence on corporate R&D. We also find that corporate ownership concentration works as a substitute for legal protection. This finding means that R&D investment of the firms in the countries with poor legal protection increases as ownership becomes more concentrated. Our results also show that the identity of shareholders has a relevant effect: Whereas banks and nonfinancial institutions as shareholders result in lower R&D, institutional investors as shareholders increase corporate investment in R&D.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the presence, expertise, independence, size and meetings of the audit committee (AC) have an effect on corporate insolvency. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 insolvent and 269 solvent UK-listed non-financial firms from 1994 to 2011. Findings: The authors find that corporate insolvency is negatively related to thenieetings and independence of the AC but not to AC's presence and size. The authors also observe that financial expertise on the AC is not related to corporate insolvency. These associations are robust to different specifications, while after controlling for board composition, board size, the number of board meetings, CEO duality, financial and firm characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The study's approach has two main limitations: neglect of small and medium private unquoted firms and more regulated corporate governance environment. Practical implications - The findings lend support to the continual use of the agency theory as an explanation in understanding the role of the analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of the AC in reducing the likelihood of insolvency. Social implications: The findings support continued efforts to strengthen boards' ACs in the wake of high profile insolvencies. The findings will assist regulators and firm management to design appropriate ACs (e.g. independence) and processes (e.g. number of meetings). Originality/value: The authors provide empirical evidence on the impact of the AC on firm insolvency in the UK context, an important but neglected area in research.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the influences of corporate governance on intellectual capital disclosures in chief executive officers' (CEOs') statements in annual reports. Design/methodology/approach: Index score, word count and overall tone of CEOs' intellectual capital disclosures are calculated to represent the extent, amount and tone of these disclosures, respectively. With a sample of 78 FTSE 100 companies, this paper uses content analysis and empirical analysis to examine the impacts of board size, board composition and shares concentration on the above three measures of CEOs' intellectual capital disclosures, controlling for company size, profitability and leverage ratio. Findings: Empirical results demonstrate a significant positive relationship between board composition and the extent, amount and tone of CEOs' intellectual capital disclosures and a significant negative relationship between shares concentration and the amount of these disclosures. Originality/value: This paper focuses on the impacts of corporate governance on CEOs' intellectual capital disclosures. It also groundbreakingly measures the tone of CEOs' disclosures.

This study investigates dividend initiation as the product of the imbalance of power between shareholders and management in U.S. firms from 2003 to 2012. We find that dividend initiation is associated with a stronger governance structure (strong shareholders' rights and board independence), in accordance with the outcome model. We do not identify a single motivation for dividend initiation. Dividend-initiating firms tend to rely on various forms of governance balanced by the interests and ownership of CEOs and directors. Firms with institutional owners are more likely to initiate dividends concurrent with the turnover of the CEO. Dual CEOs initiate dividends when they own more shares, and boards of directors initiate dividends with a higher personal ownership stake when shareholders' rights are weak. We also find that when initiation is due to stronger governance, it is significantly related to the firm's investment opportunities, while for weak governance firms, that relationship is not observed. We interpret this as evidence that, under weaker governance, the decision to initiate dividends is motivated by agency conflicts rather than investment or capital structure considerations. (c) 2017

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of internal corporate governance mechanisms on the capital structure decisions of Chinese-listed firms. Design/methodology/approach - Using a large and more recent data set consisting of 2,386 Chineselisted firms over the period from 1998 to 2012, the authors use different statistical methods (OLS, fixed effects and system GMM) to analyse the effects of firm-specific and corporate governance influences on capital structure. Findings - The authors find that the proportion of independent directors and ownership concentration exert significant influence on the level of Chinese long-term debt ratios after controlling for firm-specific determinants and split share reforms. Further analysis separating the sample of this paper into state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privately owned enterprises (POEs) suggests that ownership concentration in the hands of the state leads to decrease in debt ratios. Research limitations/implications - The finding implies that concentrated ownership in the hands of the state appears more efficient compared to their private counterparts in their monitoring role. Originality/value - This paper extends prior literature, which has concentrated disproportionately on firm-specific influences on capital structure, to the effects of within-firm governance mechanisms on capital structure decisions. The paper contributes to the agency theory-capital structure discourse in an emerging country context where corporate governance system appears weak. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The objective of this study is to understand the linkages among executive compensation, corporate governance and performance of the Indian family and non-family firms. Further, the study also analyzes the level of shareholding pattern of the Indian family firms on their performance and the executive compensation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have collected panel data of the companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The data set consists of 284 companies (both family and non-family) for the period 2005-2014. The authors have made use of a dynamic panel data model with generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation to formulate the hypotheses and used fixed-effects regression model to check the robustness of our findings. Findings - The authors find support for the agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory in the paper. Specifically, variables related to executive compensation, corporate governance (board size, proportion of independent directors on board, chief executive officers duality and other directorships held by the executive directors outside the company), firm performance (Tobin's Q), leverage and shareholding pattern of the family are significant in this study. Practical implications - The study has practical implications for all stakeholders of the family and non-family firms, especially in the emerging market economies. It can be used as a reference guide by various other stakeholders of the family firms, viz., customers, educators, tax authorities, government and society. Originality/value - The authors confirm that their research is original and provides valuable insights on the Indian family firms. The authors study cross-holding of directorships, inter alia, in the Indian family business groups. As most of the previous studies in the Indian context ignored this important aspect, this study is unique in nature. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Innovation investment decisions are always riskier business decisions, especially when it is a question of spending on research and development, but it is a vital area of decision-making which enhances growth and sustainability. First, we attempted to investigate the bidirectional causality between R&D and profitability measured in terms of NP (net profit), ROA and ROE through Granger causality test from a sample of 255 sample Indian listed firms for a period of eight years ranging from 2008 to 2015, while finding unidirectional causality only between R&D expenditure and profitability, we moved for analysing the magnitude of relationship through multiple regression model which revealed that R&D expenditure negatively affects the profitability but affects the profitability of subsequent years positively while taking lags. Further, moderating regressions equation was employed to assess the moderating role of corporate governance variables such as board size, board independence, family ownership, foreign and institutional ownership with controlling effects of size, market capital and liquidity position. The results revealed that all moderating variables except board size affect the slope of regression positively, but technically only family ownership moderates the relationship between R&D expenditure and profitability as there is significant change in f-value while moderation effect of family ownership is taken into consideration. Only board size affects negatively the relationship questioning the role of internal board and their interest in innovation for maximising personal benefits on the expense of risk-bearing shareholders and stakeholders. Our results were in conformity with some prior studies but have also shown contradiction with results of developed estates regarding role of board for balancing the agency theory conflicts, hence creating room for Indian corporate culture with a full-fledged system which can strike a balance between interest of agents and principals with protection to minority shareholders and overall stakeholders.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the topic of agency problems in service ecosystem for innovation. It specifically explores the corporate policies aimed at encouraging collaboration, so as to prevent opportunistic behaviors within the innovation hub, where service exchange is central for innovation creation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply the agency theory framework to the hub as a service ecosystem in order to understand how it would be possible to address agency problems between the firm (principal) and the other actors of the hub (agents), involved in peer-to-peer interactions. The research explores the case study of a high-tech leading company, which is a pioneer in the use of the hub for supporting its innovation process. Data are collected through semi-structured interviews to some key informants of the Hub Program regarding structure and organization; participation; incentives and monitoring. Findings - In service ecosystems, corporate policies are based on commitment, psycho-social incentives and social control may encourage collaboration among the actors, thus contributing to align their own interests to the hub's innovation common goals. Research limitations/implications - Given the exploratory nature of the research, the paper is based on a single case study. Thus, it is not possible to either generalize the results or evaluate any statistical correlation. Practical implications - The paper provides a wider awareness about the benefits and risks related to service ecosystems for innovation, and advise both managers and practitioners about appropriate corporate policies to better address the agency problems. Originality/value - This study enhances the literature on service ecosystems, highlighting the importance of corporate policies in preventing opportunistic behavior of actors in order to ensure the value co-creation process. It also extends the agency theory application to informal and not-hierarchical contexts. Besides, it suggests practitioners a way to reconcile the different interests of the firm and the other hub's participants. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines how ownership concentration affects dividend payout, and ultimately firm performance. Regression analyses are performed on a dataset spanning 11 years (2005-2015) among Malaysian publicly listed firms. The results show that shareholders with concentrated ownership play an important role in determining dividend payout and driving firm performance. Specifically, ownership concentration is associated with low dividend payout, but it improves firm performance. Overall, this study suggests that ownership concentration may also be an effective monitoring mechanism.

This paper investigates the relation between director compensation structure and shareholder interests in the context of acquisitions. Our evidence suggests that acquirer firms that compensate their directors with a higher proportion of incentive-based compensation have significantly higher stock returns around the announcement. Compared to acquirers in the low equity-based compensation group, acquirers in the high equity-based compensation group outperform by 9.54% in a five-day period surrounding the announcement date. These results hold even after controlling for endogeneity issues. We further find that acquirers with higher equity-based pay exhibit greater improvements in stock price and operating performance in the three years following acquisitions. An increase in director equity-based pay also results in a lower acquisition premium for targets. These results indicate that equity-based compensation provides incentives for directors to make decisions that meet the interests of shareholders. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the most significant determinants of capital structure of manufacturing firms in India and to investigate whether the capital structure models derived from foreign research provide convincing explanations for capital structure decisions of Indian firms by using multiple regression model. Design/methodology/approach - Different conditional theories of capital structure like trade off theory, pecking order theory and agency theory are reviewed to formulate testable propositions concerning determinants of capital structure of manufacturing firms. Multiple regression model and correlation matrix have been used as statistical tools to investigate the most significant determinants of capital structure of manufacturing firms in India with the help of SPSS Software for a sample of top 100 manufacturing firms listed in BSE. Findings - The results suggest that variables like asset composition, business risk and return on assets are positively related to debt ratio whereas firm size and debt service capacity are negatively related to debt ratio. The asset composition, business risk and return on assets appear to be significant determinants of capital structure, while firm size and debt service capacity are insignificant determinants. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this study are consistent with predictions of trade off, pecking order and agency theory of finance which helps in understanding financing behaviour of firms in India. Practical implications - This study has laid some ground work to explore the determinants of capital structure of Indian firms upon which a more detailed evaluation could be based. Furthermore, empirical findings should help corporate managers to make optimal capital structure decisions. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first that explores the most significant determinants of capital structure of manufacturing firms in India by using the most recent data. Moreover, this study also confirms that same factors affect the capital structure decisions of firms in developing countries as identified for firms in developed economies.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate whether operating and market performance are aligned to CEO compensation and how board governance and dividend policy could influence pay-performance link in the capital market of Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: The hand-collected information on 219 non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan stock exchange (PSX) is acquired over the period 2012-2016. Additionally, panel data technique, namely Prais-Winsten (PCSE) and 2SLS (robust standard errors) regression are applied to account for the heteroscedasticity, serial correlation and endogeneity issue. Findings: The empirical results indicate that CEO compensation is positively associated with operating performance and market performance. The evidence also provides partial support to agency perspective that board independence and optimal board size could positively, while CEO duality negative moderates the relationship between operating performance and CEO compensation. However, none of these mechanisms are proved to be effective in aligning market performance to CEO compensation. In fact, dividend policy negatively moderates the association between firm performance (operating and market) and CEO compensation. Thus, contrary to the agency theory's proposition, dividend policy cannot be utilized as a substitute control device in the absence of strong corporate governance mechanisms. Practical Implications: In light of this empirical evidence, regulatory bodies in Pakistan could improve corporate governance mechanisms as well as CEO compensation structure to ensure remunerative and ethical financial market. Originality/value: This study contributes to the academic literature by validating the underexplored pay-performance alignment propositions of agency theorists, especially in the reference of Pakistan.

For a long period of time, researchers from the corporate governance field have been interested in finding out what drives companies' performance. The present study identifies five attributes of boards - size, age, female representation, proportion of non-executive directors, and chairman-CEO duality - in an attempt to link these to diversification strategy and financial performance. These relations are investigated using archival sources of data for a sample of 56 publicly traded companies from an emerging economy. The results are consistent with other studies performed abroad and at the same time offer new theoretical and managerial perspectives on the issues analyzed. The findings offer some valuable insights into the decision of corporate diversification at both theoretical and managerial level. The results provide support for both managerial hegemony and agency theory. Board members have little involvement in the strategy-making process as this is most often an attribute of managers, where as the existence of more members without executive responsabilities is a determinat of superior company performance.

Family ownership has emerged as one of the most crucial determinants of corporate strategy in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Nevertheless, few studies examine the impact of family ownership and corporate governance on the internationalization of SMEs. We apply the resource dependency theory and agency theory to investigate the impact of family ownership and the moderating impact of institutional ownership on SME internationalization. Using 232 samples of Korean internationalizing SMEs from 2003 to 2013, we find a positive relationship between family ownership and internationalization indicating that the latter may be encouraged by family ownership. Institutional ownership acts as a moderator in the relationship between family ownership and internationalization, implying that internationalizing SMEs with high family ownership tend to internationalize as institutional ownership rises. An important implication for SMEs that depend on international expansion to remain competitive is the crucial need to establish long-lasting relationships with institutional investors, especially in South Korea.

The article tries to examine the relationship between equity ownership held by the foreign institutional investors and firm performance both in a static and a dynamic framework. We also examine how the relationship differs between group-affiliated and stand-alone firms. By employing the 2SLS panel data estimation technique on 137 BSE listed Indian firms, the study finds that foreign institutional investment has a positive influence on the firm performance as measured through Tobin's Q and ROA.Application of linear dynamic panel data estimation in a dynamic framework also yields similar results.The latter method also shows that FII has a positive significant effect on Tobin's Q in group-affiliated firms. The results are analysed from the perspective of a multi-theoretic approach consisting of agency theory, information asymmetry theory, institutional theory and resource dependency theory.

This paper examines how family firms substitute corporate governance with family governance and self-governance at different stages of their development. We argue that the types of agency problems that family firms face as they pass from one generation to the next determine the extent to which these mechanisms can be used as substitutes for one another. Our empirical investigation provides evidence that in the early stages of a family firm's life cycle, instruments of self-governance lessen the need for mechanisms of corporate governance, whereas in the later stages, instruments of family governance can substitute for mechanisms of corporate governance.

Diversification is a common goal for many small firms, yet research examining whether small firm ownership structure influences their use of the tactic is limited. As such, this paper provides one of the first empirical investigations of the subject by examining whether the presence of a corporate parent positively influences the likelihood that small firms will utilize diversification. Results indicate that small firms with corporate parents are more likely to use both related and unrelated diversification than comparable firms that are independently owned. Such findings are noteworthy because diversification may be more beneficial for small, independently owned firms, yet small, subsidiary firms appear to be better able to utilize diversification. Implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2017 Small Business Institute.

Some business ethicists view agency theory as a cautionary tale - a proof that it is impossible to carry out successful economic interactions in the absence of ethical behaviour. The cautionary-tale view presents a nuanced normative characterisation of agency, but its unilateral focus betrays a limited understanding of the structure of social interaction. This article moves beyond unilateralism by presenting a descriptive and normative argument for a bilateral cautionary-tale view. Specifically, we discuss hat swaps and role dualism in asymmetric-information principal-agent relationships and argue that the norm of reciprocity can function as a moral solution to agency risks in adverse-selection and moral-hazard problems. Our bilateral cautionary-tale formulation extends the normative boundaries of agency theory, while leaving the fundamental economic assumptions of agency theory intact.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: We examine determinants of cash holdings in Chinese subsidiaries of US multinational corporations (MNCs), a setting where growth opportunities make cash holdings desirable for investment opportunities but also vulnerable to potential expropriation because of poor investor protection. Research Findings/Insights: We show that headquarters accumulate larger cash holdings in foreign subsidiaries with locally registered patents and in foreign subsidiaries operating in the same industry as corporate headquarters. Further, foreign cash holdings are higher when these are safeguarded by a subsidiary board. Moreover, the effect of shared industry on subsidiary cash holdings is larger when a board is installed in the subsidiary. Finally, the positive relation between a subsidiary's capability to innovate and to transfer knowledge and its level of cash holdings is stronger when the subsidiary is led by US expatriate CEOs. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results indicate that MNCs accumulate cash in foreign subsidiaries with innovation and knowledge transfer capabilities. Furthermore, and in line with agency theory, we find that MNCs safeguard foreign cash via the installing of subsidiary boards and expatriate CEOs. These findings suggest that the installing of monitoring devices are crucial in reducing the potential expropriation risk of foreign cash holdings. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our study highlights the importance of considering foreign subsidiaries' positions in innovation and in knowledge transfer when MNCs make decisions on the levels of overseas cash holdings. It offers insights regarding the importance of subsidiary boards and expatriate CEOs in monitoring and controlling foreign subsidiaries. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine an association between board demographics and corporate performance using a sample of Pakistani firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange in the 2014 year. Design/methodology/approach: This study is unique in that corporate performance is examined using a mixture of performance measures: accounting-based measures (return on assets), market-based measures (Tobin's Q, earnings per share, and total return) and economic profit measures (economic value added). Findings: The results of this research show a significant positive relationship between board size, minority representation on the board and the appointment of a family director and enhanced firm performance. However, contrary to expectations, the authors also find that instead of adding value, the appointment of independent directors to Pakistani firm boards negatively impacts firm value. Originality/value: This study adds to a growing body of empirical evidence that suggests that agency theory-based corporate governance recommendations adopted in developed economies may not be relevant to emerging economy firms.

Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the service and hospitality industries are critical for economic development in Latin America. However, due to information asymmetries, access to capital is a major obstacle for SMEs to expand their activities. Drawing from agency theory, the purpose of this study was to examine the financial constraints of SMEs in the service sector, particularly the case of hospitality firms in Latin America, due to requirements associated with mitigating information asymmetries. Using a logit model, we investigated whether financial requirements acting as mechanisms to mitigate information asymmetries, such as fixed asset collateral requirements and financial statement audits, would be associated with credit constraints for small- and medium-sized firms. We further investigated whether, due to their unique financing characteristics, SMEs in the hospitality industry would be less credit constrained than other industries in the service sector. Results suggest that SMEs subjected to collateralized fixed assets and auditing requirements, separately, were more likely to be credit constrained. However, our findings indicate that both financial requirements, when used together, decreased the likelihood of credit constraint for SMEs in the hospitality industry. (c) The Author(s) 2017.

We aim to investigate the decision process leading to the adoption of corporate governance practice at a cooperative. This paper expands current knowledge by presenting the institutional logics approach as a complement to decision-making process studies. Literature on the decision process grounds the investigation, supported by corporate governance and agency theory. We draw on oral history for collecting and analyzing data from documents, observation and interviews related to the decision process. A total of 19 interviews were conducted with members and employees of the cooperative. We used the Atlas TI software to organize the data and then subjected them to content analysis, based on the historical analytical method. By demonstrating how logics are a basis for the adoption decision, the paper provides evidence of how hybridization operates as a mechanism for balancing actors' demands in response to contrasting institutional pressures or expectations. In addition, we provide recommendations to management with respect to corporate governance decisions. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) and Summer Olympic National Sporting Organisations (NSOs) to determine the effect the relationship has on Olympic performance outcomes. Five Olympic NSOs were examined: Athletics Australia, Cycling Australia, Rowing Australia, Swimming Australia and Yachting Australia. All five NSOs represent sports in which Australia has consistently achieved strong results at previous Olympic Games. These NSOs receive significant funding from the ASC and, as such, are expected to achieve success at the Olympic Games. The ASC-NSO relationship was examined through an agency theory framework whereby the 'contracts' between the ASC (principal) and the NSOs (agents) were investigated through a survey, interviews and document analysis to identify potential management issues that may affect Olympic performance outcomes, such as agent or principal opportunism. The findings identified a lack of a collaborative high performance sport system in Australia, with the findings emphasising concerns over the ASC's management of NSO programmes. While the ASC staff identified their organisation as the leader of high performance sport in Australia, the study's NSO participants did not believe that the ASC had the capacity, capability and knowledge to fulfil this role.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of board composition on the profitability of banks in Tanzania. First, it examines the differences between local and foreign-owned banks in terms of their boards and profitability, and then the contribution of board composition to banks' profitability. Design/methodology/approach: The paper utilizes a secondary panel data set of information on the boards, their operations and financial statements of 35 banks. The data were collected between 2009 and 2013. The authors tested the stated hypotheses using descriptive and econometric analyses. Findings: The results show a significant difference in board composition and profitability between local and foreign-owned banks. Local banks have a higher income and profits. With their contextual knowledge they are able to attract diverse board directors who contribute positively to their performance. The paper also found that large boards and those with women on them were associated with high profitability. Research limitations/implications: The study focused on three aspects of boards, which are size, foreign directors and women's representation. The paper is limited in the sense that other aspects of composition that also affect performance are not included in the study. Practical implications: The paper suggests that in order to maximize profitability, banks should increase the number of directors. Many board members can share skills and knowledge, which can improve performance. Women are underrepresented on boards. With current changes in policy and education in emerging countries, there is a need to increase their representation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the agency theory by showing that large boards are indeed efficient at monitoring and bringing in profits, especially in an emerging economy where there are multifaceted risks at country and company level. These risks require shareholders and investors to have a much better understanding of the banks and that is where a large board plays a key role. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not gain sufficient economic returns despite their significant economic contributions. A possible cause of poor SME performance is weak corporate governance. However, the corporate governance of SMEs is rarely investigated. Ownership structure provides SMEs with a monitoring mechanism that enhances performance. This study examines the relationships between board characteristics (including size, composition boards, CEO duality, expertise, and ethnicity) and SME performance in Malaysia. This study also explores how such relationships can be moderated by monitoring ownership structure. Survey results on SMEs in Klang Valley and Selangor areas show that non-executive boards and CEO duality are significantly and positively related to firm performance. In comparison, management ownership is significantly and negatively related to performance. Board size, expertise, ethnicity, and family ownership are not significantly related to SME performance. Findings indicate that good corporate governance improves decision making and firm performance. Furthermore, agency theory can explain conflict of interest in SMEs and the importance of corporate governance in enhancing their performance.

This study utilised the comprehensive database of non-financial firms listed on the stock exchanges of 12 Sub-Saharan Africa countries in the period 2005-2009 to examine the determinants of capital structure of these firms. The findings indicate that capital structure is negatively associated with profitability and tangible assets, which is supported by the pecking-order theory and the trade-off theory, respectively. Furthermore, the findings show that capital structure is positively associated with free cash and firms' growth, which is consistent with the agency theory and the pecking-order theory, respectively. The results have implications for practitioners, such as business managers, bankers and lenders as well as for capital structure research. Furthermore, the study confirms that association between capital structure and some specific characteristics of firms is inconclusive as some results differ from the results of previous studies. This indicates that there is a need for scholars to conduct more studies to unravel the capital structure puzzle. Copyright (c) 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Information asymmetry in an employment relationship is much researched in the organization studies literature because of its consequences for employment contracts, compensation, and rent appropriation by the involved parties. However, its psychological antecedents have not been adequately addressed so far. We conceptually investigate the psychological drivers of supervisor-subordinate information asymmetry by primarily invoking social exchange theory. Whereas agency theory examines how information distribution is driven by self-interest seeking, social exchange theory emphasizes how individuals may be motivated to fulfill social obligations and not by exclusive self-interest seeking. This paper advances several propositions regarding the influence of a subordinate's and supervisor's psychological variables, such as relational identification, disposition for relational trust, assumed similarity, and the shaping techniques used by a supervisor on information asymmetry. In doing so, it highlights the underlying social exchange (social attraction and reciprocity), and the cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes. The influence of the psychological variables on information asymmetry may be moderated by contextual factors, such as interactional justice climate in teams, agency costs, and the type of employment relationship.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the importance of socioemotional wealth (SEW) to family firms in Poland viewed through the lens of the events surrounding the first hostile takeover bid of the post-communist era on the Warsaw Stock Exchange when the clothing company Vistula & Wolczanka (V&W) made an unsolicited, leveraged bid for the family-controlled jewelry company W. Kruk. Design/methodology/approach: The 2008 takeover and its aftermath are described in the context of the corporate governance and legal environment in Poland. The case study events demonstrate the connection between firm behavior and SEW theory. Findings: After the acquisition of W. Kruk by V&W, the Kruk family purchased stock in the newly named Vistula Group and gained influence over the supervisory board in concert with a business ally, eventually wresting back control of the company in the style of a Pac-Man "defense." The case study illustrates the importance of SEW in family firm takeovers. Research limitations/implications: The case study design has limitations for generalizability. Nevertheless the research highlights the important role of SEW preservation in understanding the market for corporate control of listed family firms in Poland. Practical implications: Understanding the reaction by family firms to takeover bids requires recognition that there is a tradeoff between financial and SEW considerations, not just financial gains and losses. Originality/value: The case study demonstrates the importance of SEW to family firms and suggests that the balance of power in takeovers on the Polish stock market rests with incumbent management.

This study explores two ownership issues in private family firms. First, we investigate the relationship between the ownership of family CEOs and firm performance, and postulate that this relationship in private family firms is more complex than the inverted "U" relationship found in public family firms. Second, we predict a potential moderating effect of the second largest owner, who may exert a monitoring role on family CEOs. We focus on private family firms as recent studies show that private family firms have distinct features compared to public family firms, and that findings documented in public family firms may not apply to the ubiquitous, but much less studied, private family firms. We have applied agency theory to develop the two hypotheses, used secondary data on a large sample of private family firms, utilized an adjusted conventional quadratic technique to test the hypotheses, and validated the findings using a second method of piecewise linear specification. The results show that the non-linear relationship between the ownership of family CEOs and firm performance is more complicated than the often-documented inverted "U" shape from public firms. Meanwhile, the second largest owner with a high enough ownership stake can impose a positive moderating effect by mitigating potential agency problems caused by family CEOs.

In this study, the effect of ownership structure characteristics namely government ownership, foreign ownership and institutional ownership, upon non-financial Omani firms performance (ROA) for the years 2012-2014 was examined. To achieve the study objective, the researcher obtained 81 sample firms in order for the above relationship to be tested. Sampling was taken from the firm's annual reports for three years. A total of 243 firms were selected, 81 for each year. For the purpose of testing the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, multiple regression analysis was employed. The study aims to fill the gap in extant literature regarding the ownership structure-firm performance relationship in Oman, a developing nation. The findings showed a positive and significant relationship between government ownership and foreign ownership, and firm performance (ROA). Some recommendations for future studies were provided prior to concluding the work.

Purpose: Since joint venture experience obtained from inward FDI may create a positive or negative impact on ownership mode choice, it is difficult to predict its direct impact. The purpose of this paper is to combine the organizational learning and agency perspectives to find whether CEO power can moderate the effect of inward joint venture experience. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 337 foreign entries conducted by 77 Chinese firms during 1998-2008, this study has tested some interaction effects of inward joint venture experience and CEO power measures. Findings: The author finds that inward joint venture experience interacts with CEO ownership and CEO duality, respectively, to have a negative impact on the selection of high-equity mode. Originality/value: This study contributes to entry mode literature by finding that inward (but not merely outward) FDI experience can influence entry mode choices and by combining agency theory and the organizational learning perspective to solve the theoretical conflicts created by the two opposite effects of a FDI experience.

Purpose: Based on agency perspective on temporary agency workers, the purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between firms' agency problems and agency cost on agency workers; moreover, intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation are considered in seeking to understand how they moderate this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Hsinchu Science Park directory of corporate affiliations as a sample frame, the authors adopted a paired questionnaire which included two parts in order to consider the possible problem of common method variances. The first part is completed by the manager of the firms and the second part is completed by his/her temporary agency workers. Finally, 94 firms completed questionnaires, providing a total sample of 94 R&D managers and 458 temporary agency workers. The rate of participation was 31.65 percent. Findings: Using a questionnaire survey of 94 high-tech firms, from which a total of 94 R&D managers and 458 temporary agency workers participated, the results show that firms' agency problems have a positive influence on the agency cost of monitoring temporary agency workers. In addition, while this relationship is negatively moderated by extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation has a non-significant moderating effect. Originality/value: The managers of firms should consider not only the short-term flexibility of employing temporary agency workers, but also the long-term cultivation of promoting great agency workers. This could maximize the efficiency of the interaction between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Of course, the firms should think about how to reduce the agency problems created by goal conflict, information asymmetry and risk sharing with temporary agency workers, because this could also provide a chance for the firms to decrease agency costs spent on monitoring.

In this paper we analyze the relationship between conformity to executive remuneration standards, corporate ownership, and the level and structure of CEO compensation for large European listed companies in the years 2007 and 2010. We show that controlled corporations conform to executive remuneration standards less than widely held firms. We also show that weaker compliance is associated with lower CEO pay and more cash-based incentive structures. We interpret this "conformity gap" from the perspective of individual firms and from a societal perspective, with the aim to contribute to frame the policy questions concerning executive pay at controlled corporations. Different policy implications depend on whether the conformity gap reflects a lower need for managerial incentives, given the monitoring by controlling shareholders, or the latter's willingness to extract private benefits of control. We argue in this paper that the former hypothesis prevails, so that regulators should abstain from increasing the level of enforcement of executive remuneration standards.

Contemporary government reforms are changing how performance is measured and evaluated, by shifting the focus from inputs and processes to outputs and outcomes. This study uses agency theory, institutional theory, and organizational information processing theory to hypothesize and assess how particular organizational and institutional factors affect the disclosure of outcome information by public organizations, drawing on an empirical analysis of 214 Italian public organizations. Organizational size, mode of service delivery, and the degree of regulation are all strongly associated with the disclosure of outcome indicators in external performance reports.

This paper analyses the performance effects of management controls and goals for the business across both male and female-controlled farm and rural family businesses revealing that female-controlled farm and rural family businesses do not underperform their male counterparts. (c) 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.
Purpose: Prior research indicates that family businesses have fewer management control practices in place and are more likely to have non-economic goals for their firm. Further, researchers in this domain contend that female-controlled businesses tend to underperform compared to male-controlled businesses. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the performance effects of management controls and goals for the business across both male and female-controlled farm and rural family businesses. Design/methodology/approach: The data used in the analyses are from the 2012 Intergenerational Farm and Non-Farm Family Business Survey. The sample comprises 576 small- and medium-sized rural family businesses. The authors used probit analysis to model both family business objective and subjective success for women and men. Findings: The results suggest that female-controlled farm and rural family businesses do not underperform their male counterparts in terms of objective or subjective assessments of performance. The results do indicate, however, that strategic management via management control practices within the firm influence objective and subjective performance differently across male and female-controlled farm and rural family businesses. Originality/value: The results provide three primary contributions to the family business literature. First, the authors determined that strategic management practices via management control mechanisms, as well as the monitoring of managers, are of significance to the objective performance (i.e. gross income) of both men and women-controlled farm and rural family businesses. Second, the authors found that communicating economic vs non-economic goals do not influence satisfaction with the firm's performance, but do influence the probability of success for female-controlled family businesses. Finally, the authors find that when we compare male and female-controlled businesses in the same industry, while controlling for family and business factors, men and women do not differ in a statistical sense in objective or subjective performance.

The objective of this paper is to systematize and analyze existing empirical studies of the relationship between family involvement in family businesses and their financial returns. With this purpose in mind, a systematic review of papers has been carried out. These papers have been selected with criteria clearly defined in the most relevant databases of social sciences, aiming at seeing whether this relationship is positive or negative. Based on the findings, three trends of the studies analyzed were obtained: positive relationship, negative relationship and neutral relationship. With these heterogeneous results it has been concluded that the relationship between the family businesses and their performance are complex and probably moderate or affected by factors that are not included in these analysis.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how executive pay schemes influence managerial efficiency, which the authors measure as the risk-adjusted firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilized hierarchical regression to test the hypotheses. Findings: The authors find that as options constitute a higher percentage of total compensation packages, subsequent firm risk-adjusted performance declines. The authors also find an inverse relationship between TMT stock ownership and risk-adjusted performance. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that the firm stakeholders should reconsider the likely influence of option-based incentives and equity holdings on the risk-adjusted performance. Originality/value: Most executive compensation research focuses on either the pay-to-performance or pay-to-risk links. However, in this paper, the authors combine both the performance and risk dimensions simultaneously. (c) 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We examine whether predictions of capital structure theories hold true for Indian SMEs. In order to do so we conduct a panel data regression to test how the firm characteristics affect their capital structure decisions. Results suggest predictions of pecking order theory to be useful in explaining the capital structure decisions of Indian SMEs for short-term debt only and support the applicability of trade-off theory implying that greater the operating risk faced by a firm, more inclined it is in reducing its leverage. We do not find any evidence for the applicability of agency theory. (c) Serials Publications Pvt. Ltd.

Although innovation is central to a firm's success and a top priority for most technology managers, firms commonly report disappointment that innovation outcomes do not match their original plans. This paper examines the difference in intended innovation and realized innovation using an exploration/exploitation framing. Its focus is on changes to defined innovation plans that occur after planning phases end. Extant literature and field research form the basis for hypotheses that are then tested using a large scale survey of an entire population of small and medium-sized high-technology enterprises (SMEs). Findings of compromised exploration in favor of exploitation, during the development phase, is quantified. Firms divert resources away from novel emergent exploration and into existing product development, thereby undercutting innovation plans. Intended innovation, established during the planning stages, is found to be compromised. Our hypotheses, that agency and resource dependence underpin a shifting between explorative and exploitative development, have support. The paper's theoretical contributions include the application of novel agency and resource dependence perspectives onto innovation. It informs ambidexterity research by indicating where, how much, and why erosion in the balance of exploration/exploitation occurs and provides new avenues for research into low innovation outcomes.

Purpose: The authors contend that immediately following the initial public offering (IPO), the new owners that replace the original ones are likely to request changes in two corporate governance mechanisms, board of directors and top management teams (TMTs). Following these alterations, the purpose of this paper is to propose that such changes will be detrimental for the performance of young entrepreneurial firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the post-IPO governance changes in young entrepreneurial firms. The sample consists of 185 companies that went public between 2001 and 2005. A hierarchical linear regression approach with the appropriate control variables is adopted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results revealed that, following the changes in ownership structure post-IPO, changes are observed in one of the corporate governance mechanisms the authors considered, boards of directors, but not TMTs. Consistent with the general theme of this study, the authors also observed a negative impact of changes in boards of directors on subsequent firm performance; this was not the case with TMTs. Research limitations/implications: Contrary to the fundamental contentions of agency theory, the results highlight the need for adopting a different approach for young entrepreneurial firms. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of preserving the entrepreneurial efficacy of young entrepreneurial firms. Originality/value: This paper challenges the fundamental contentions of agency theory in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results demonstrate that post-IPO shareholders' interference with the governance mechanisms results in lower performance. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

While prior research has generally shown a positive price reaction to voluntary declarations of compliance with codes of corporate governance, this is the first paper to examine how investors react to the release of mandatory corporate governance reports. Positive reactions to declarations of compliance are generally interpreted in terms of signalling effects for those companies more committed with transparency. However, once corporate governance reports are mandatory, such signalling effects make no sense anymore. In the current context, the market would react according to the relevance of the information conveyed by the report. While prior related research has examined market reactions only through the behaviour of returns, we use three indicators: returns, price volatility and trading volumes. Our main result would be the lack of a significant market reaction to the release of corporate governance reports. This finding is robust as it is reported for each indicator of market reaction. However, for some subsamples of firms we show some weak reactions in the lines suggested by the agency theory. Our results might have some implications for regulators and policy makers when designing corporate governance regulations. (c) 2017 European Academy of Management

Motivated by agency theory, we investigate the effect of board size on corporate outcomes. To address endogeneity, we exploit the variations in the director-age populations across the states in the US. We argue that firms with access to a larger pool of potential directors tend to have larger boards. Consistent with this notion, our empirical results show that firms located where the size of the director-age population is larger have significantly larger board size. Because the director-age population represents broad demographic trends outside of any firm's control, it is unlikely related to firm outcomes or policies and should be exogenous. Using the director-age population as our instrument, we estimate the effects of board size on firm value and profitability. Our approach is less vulnerable to endogeneity and is more likely to show a causal effect. (c) 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand how higher education institutions (HEIs) in developing countries can migrate their physical administrative work environment to a virtual platform to improve information management. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs an interpretive case study approach and a combined lens of activity and agency theories to understand how a developing country HEI attempted to improve its information management by migrating from a physical to a virtual administrative work environment. Findings: The findings show how contradictions caused by role conflicts, administrative staff's fear of elimination and external consultants' limited understanding of administrative rules and procedures can hamper work environment virtualisation. Such challenges should be resolved in order to achieve a successful virtual work environment that supports timely and accurate information management. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by its single case perspective in one developing country. However, future studies can compare the experiences of HEIs from developed and developing countries in order to account for contextual differences. Practical implications: The study provides practitioners with insight into how to address conflicts between employees (as potential users) and external consultants during virtual system development and implementation. In particular, role conflict, fear of eliminating some administrative staff and consultants' limited understanding of administrative work procedures should be resolved for successful work environment virtualisation. Originality/value: The study is the first attempt to offer rich insight into the challenges associated with administrative work environment virtualisation for improved information management in HEIs, through the principal-agent relationship.

Using NCUA credit union call report data, I find that uninsured depositors and excess share insurers provide valuable monitoring benefits for credit unions for the years following the 2008 financial crisis. I find that the capital ratio, liquidity ratio, and delinquencies-to-total loans and leases decrease with an increase in the percentage of deposits that exceed the $250,000 per depositor regulatory threshold of standard deposit insurance. The influence of uninsured depositors is generally more significant for small credit unions than large credit unions. The results for the precrisis period are not consistent with those of the postcrisis period. However, the results are consistent across the six-year period following the financial crisis. Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that uninsured depositors are value-maximizing stakeholders who exercise control over the firm.

Prior research shows that internationalization increases information asymmetry and conflicts of interest between managers and outside investors, which lead to greater agency problems. Agency theory predicts a demand for higher quality auditors when agency problems are more severe. This study investigates whether the extent of internationalization influences auditor choice and whether audit quality has performance implications for internationalization. Using a set of U.S. firms from 2003 to 2009, we find the extent of internationalization positively related to audit quality. Furthermore, higher quality audits positively moderate the relation between internationalization and firm performance. Taken together, these results suggest that higher quality audit mitigates the agency problem associated with internationalization. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Conflicts of interest represent an increasing problem in organizations, given the expansion of stakeholder concerns, needs, and expectations. Existing remedies to address these conflicts largely involve aligning management incentives with the interests of investors, or recusing parties with special interests from the decision-making effort. Both focus on a dyad between the primary stakeholder and the decision-maker. However, increasingly complex situations involving multiple stakeholders exist. The added complexity of considering multiple stakeholders heightens uncertainty that can facilitate the pursuit of self-interest. Ironically, a potential remedy may involve ensuring the presence of competing interests. A review of military procurement suggests that competing interests can mitigate self-interest.

Grounded in agency theory, this study explores whether the separation of ownership (by shareholders) and control (by managers) in firms is an essential determinant of the valuation effect of joint ventures (JVs). This is achieved by examining the efficacy of incentive alignment mechanisms and their contingency effects. Based on a sample of 963 U.S. firms' JV investments, the results show that poor JV performance is linked to lower levels of executive ownership and reduced equity compensation. The possibility of managers acting for their own self-interest in corporate JV investments is further supported by the stronger positive performance effect of incentive alignment mechanisms documented when firms have a higher level of free cash flow or undertake JVs in unrelated business domains. Both performance measures of short-run announcement effects and long-run stock returns yield similar results. Our results underscore the importance of governing executives' self-interested actions in their JV engagements. (c) 2017

In light of the need to develop mechanisms of control, protection, and transparency regarding the relationships between principal and agent, and with the aim of eliminating or reducing the agency problem, corporate governance has emerged. Based on Agency Theory, separation of ownership and control of activities derives from the complexity of organizations. In this context, this study aims to analyze the relationship between dimensions of complexity and corporate governance in companies listed on the Sao Paulo Stock, Commodities, and Futures Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA), in which contingency factors might influence organizational characteristics. The investigation gathers data from a sample of 162 companies listed on the BM&FBOVESPA. The following statistical tests were used in the data analysis: Factor Analysis, Multiple Linear Regression, Correspondence Analysis, and Correlation Analysis. For measuring complexity, contingency variables such as age, size, diversification, and internationalization were adopted; and, to assess corporate governance, a representative index of the adoption of good governance practices was used. The results show that organizational complexity is explained by the size and diversification variables, whereas operational complexity is explained by the size, diversification, and internationalization variables. It was observed that in the two dimensions of complexity - organizational and operational - corporate governance was influenced by the diversification, internationalization, and age variables, with the latter involving an inverse relationship. It is concluded that companies displaying more complexity, in its two dimensions, record a higher level of corporate governance, which confirms the research hypothesis.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of managerial education levels on the wealth effect at the time of investment announcements, by testing two competitive hypotheses: the agency theory-based overinvestment hypothesis vs the Q-theory-based organizational legitimacy hypothesis. Design/methodology/approach: The authors construct the sample by hand-collecting the announcement dates of capital investments from major newspapers published in Taiwan from 2006 to 2014. The authors then use the event study methodology to estimate cumulative abnormal returns at the time of investments announcements to measure the wealth effect. Finally, the authors examine the wealth effect for capital-investing firms with higher managerial education vs those with lower managerial education. The authors also conduct a cross-sectional regression to test the relation between the wealth effect of capital investment and managerial education. Findings: The empirical results indicate that the wealth effect at the time of investment announcements is less favorable for firms with better-educated managers; this negative relation is mitigated for firms with higher institutional ownership and is aggravated for family-controlled firms; and the overall findings are supported by the agency theory-based overinvestment hypothesis, suggesting that higher managerial education lead to greater managerial optimism/overconfidence, which in turn increases the likelihood of overinvestment and implies a less favorable wealth effect associated with capital investment. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by proposing a new, unexplored stock market's reaction channel through which managerial education signals adverse information about potential overinvestment behavior, even though many studies suggests that managerial education serves as an indication of knowledge/capability and improves firm performance.

Purpose: This paper aims to present case study evidence on the changes in the relations between chief executive officers (CEOs) of large firms and shareholders in the past three decades of the twentieth century. In line with insights from agency theory, the CEOs have experienced increased scrutiny from their principals, the shareholders. This development has affected financial communication and investor relations as well as stock market prices. Design/methodology/approach: The Dutch electronics firm Royal Philips NV in the transition period of 1971-2001 has been studied using publicly available disclosures and stock market prices. A descriptive case study approach is combined with event study methodology. Findings: It was observed that the increased emphasis on shareholder interests has affected the interactions between Philips' respective CEOs and the shareholders' reactions to strategic decisions as measured by stock price changes. Around the beginning of the twenty-first century, clarity and openness in CEO communication was the norm and deviations were punished with volatile stock prices. Research limitations/implications: The study relies on publicly available data. Originality/value: The case study of Philips can be extrapolated to other exchange-listed firms in the late twentieth century, which faced changed expectations about the role of the CEO, investor relations and the CEO's accountability toward shareholders. This transition is relevant not only as a historical observation, but also as a background to studies in finance and management about top management and financial markets.

In this study, we examine the effects of corporate governance practices on financial performance of Pakistani listed firms. On the bases of agency theory, MM theorem, and theory of firm, we suggest that corporate governance effects firm performance directly as well as indirectly via mediation of capital structure and dividend policy. The model was tested using a cross-lagged analysis of 100 non-financial firms with the structural equation modeling (SEM). The study concludes that corporate governance improves financial performance by exploiting capital structure and dividend policy. The findings of this study, highlights the importance of corporate governance practices for peer firms to restructure their debt and dividend policies for the enhancement of their financial performance.

Background: Intestate death can lead to the distribution of assets against the personal wishes of the deceased and is a problem in India, as 80% of Indians die without making a last will. Following the concepts of decision theory (i.e., the theory of choice), stewardship theory, agency theory, and signaling theory, the purpose of this study is to examine the influence of meditation on estate planning decisions. This study also seeks to extend previous findings on the influence of religious beliefs on the estate planning decisions of Canadians to that of Indians. Methods: Employed and self-employed individuals from India were surveyed regarding their perceptions of meditation and estate planning decisions. Results: The survey indicates that mediation positively influences the estate planning decisions while individuals who practice meditation have greater preferences for estate planning compared with those who do not. The findings suggest that individual assets, family size, and education positively influence the estate planning decisions of Indians. Conclusion: Reported meditation, individual assets, family size, location, education, and gender are positively correlated with the estate planning decisions of Indians. (c) 2017, The Author(s).

To this day, corporate governance remains the topic of the most intense discussions among scholars, especially concerning its legal and regulatory development over the past few years. Since most of the current developments deal with global concerns about the impact of recent financial crises and their related scandals, academics have not yet been able to settle the score with long-standing matters of corporate governance. Indeed, under the significant influence of an Anglo-Saxon culture, largely disseminated among the literature, the prevailing theoretical framework of corporate governance is still based on a series of preposterous presumptions. These outdated presumptions appear to originate more from rhetorical statements than any deep analysis of the issues characterizing the early era of modern corporate governance. Because over the years they have fulfilled their task of supporting the development of capitalism throughout the industrial world and providing a legitimate rationale for corporate owners to adopt certain aggressive and reckless behaviors, these corporate governance presumptions have since been held up as the cornerstones of an efficient social economy, profitable for all and everyone. With the global economy having encountered a few unfortunate setbacks over the past decades, it is important to question the legal value of these presumptions, as they might have more to do with unsubstantiated myths than any extensive legal or scientific work. The aim of this article is not to present the paramount truth on this topic, but rather to highlight the discrepancies between what have always been considered as the foundations of corporate governance, and what corporate governance should have been had it not been implemented with the sole intention of nurturing certain illegitimate purposes of modern capitalism, such as shareholder primacy or financial profitability. Therefore, this article explores five typical corporate governance myths: (1) the corporation as a nexus of contracts, (2) the shareholders as owners of the corporation, (3) the shareholders as the only residual creditors of the corporation, (4) the effectiveness of shareholder activism, and (5) corporate governance as a legitimate rationale for shareholder primacy. The aggregate theory of corporations - which maintains that the corporation is nothing less than a nexus of contracts and that it may only benefit the shareholders - held its own throughout most of the twentieth century, but now finds itself faced with some more inclusive and realistic theories of unprecedented rigor, such as the consideration of the corporation as an institution pursuing a social purpose. Considering shareholders as the owners of the corporation might therefore be a thing of the past as well. Undeniably, what the recent ups and downs on the financial markets have shown the world is that corporate directors ought to be considered as the central core of the corporation, acting collectively, but independently from the shareholders, and promoting the success of the company, in the interests of all corporate stakeholders. Consequently, shareholders can no longer be considered the owners of the corporation, dictating to directors how they must govern, because the corporation has its own legal personality, effectively managed and controlled by the board of directors. Subsequently, neither can they be considered as the only residual creditors of the corporation, as all the other stakeholders' investments are also at stake. More importantly, while shareholders have become more active over the years, the effectiveness of their involvement in the management of the corporation has been questionable, as they often lack long-term vision and considerations for other stakeholders' interests. Finally, it is quite arguable to still promote shareholders' primacy in today's world, as law, jurisprudence and doctrine have, timidly but still, embraced the stakeholder theory which states that the board of directors has to consider the whole corporation's interests first, rather than simply focusing on short term profitability for the shareholders.

This article examines the association between the equity concentration and agency costs as well as the impact of agency costs on performance of non-financial firms listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). These relations are examined by using dynamic panel data and a two-step robust system estimation for the period 2010-2013. The study uses three proxy variables to measure agency costs. The results show that the equity concentration has no significant impact on agency costs, and the agency costs have no significant impact on firms' performance. In addition, the study shows no evidence to support the agency theory in non-financial firms listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). This study provides a better understanding of the association between equity concentration, agency costs and a firm's performance. (c) 2017, (c) 2017 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

A number of studies have concentrated in exploring the audit service provided by audit firms, and the related fee charged. Factors such as an audit firm's brand and its reputation and the skills and experience of auditors' are some of the important variables influencing the audit service fee. There is a lack of evidence of a relationship between an audit premium and audit quality or the monopoly of an audit firm. In addition, a significant increase in the non-audit service fee has posed a dilemma to auditors' ethical principles. It appears that the auditors have compromised their independence, objectiveness, and professionalism to provide the financial statement assurance in order to maximize their revenues. This impression has triggered the focus of this research to revisit the determinants that control the audit and non-audit fee and empirically explore whether the above claim is valid in the context of Malaysia's business environment. This research is crucial due to increasing corporate scandals recently reported in Malaysia. The analysis was undertaken on the Annual Reports of 2012 using the partial least square (PLS) for a sample study of 100 firms listed in Malaysia's stock exchange. The analysis revealed that only the firm characteristics of foreign shareholding, market capitalization, and foreign operations have a significant relationship with both the audit and nonaudit fee.

While agency theory has been an important part of accounting academic research, many researchers have suggested that other theories should also be considered. One such theory is the theory of cognitive dissonance. In this study, the authors develop competing hypotheses based on agency theory and the theory of cognitive dissonance regarding the decision to record an impairment of goodwill. Using an archival research methodology, they test the hypotheses on a sample of 2,274 firm-year observations. The results are consistent with the theory of cognitive dissonance even after controlling for variables that have been found to be significant under agency theory. The authors conclude that there is strong evidence to suggest that agency theory does not uniquely explain the results of management decisions as seen through financial reporting data.

This study aims to examine the effect of corporate tax avoidance to the corporate cash holdings. Recent tax avoidance research found that tax avoidance is able to facilitate managerial rent extraction in the form of transfer of resources owned by the company. This study attempts to test how the relationship of tax avoidance with the amount of cash held by the company. The sample consists of 46 non-financial, non-property, non-real estate and non-construction companies from 2009-2016, with a total 368 observations. The study uses two different cash holdings measures to test the robustness of the research results. This study cannot find evidence that tax avoidance have a significant relationship to the level of cash holdings in public companies in Indonesia. Both measurements of cash holdings gave the same conclusions to the results of the study. This study provides an insight that agency theory in the context of tax avoidance and corporate cash holdings in developing countries such as Indonesia needs to be explored further as the agency conflict in Indonesia as a developing country is more principal-principal conflicts.

Purpose: Previous research leads to contrasting hypotheses about the relationship between extra effort of employees and the level of job security. According to agency theory, job security leads to lower levels of extra effort and social exchange theory argues that extra effort requires job security. The purpose of this paper is to formulate a set of hypotheses based on these theories. Besides considering them as mutually exclusive, they are integrated into a single theoretical framework that argues that both theories can apply, depending on the conditions and social context (in terms of the social security system). Design/methodology/approach: Data from the International Social Survey Program (2005) including 22 countries from around the globe are analyzed using multilevel analysis. Findings: The study provides evidence that social security moderates the relationship between job security and extra effort. Originality/value: This study differs from previous research as it focuses on two sides of insecurity in the workplace and because it analyzes a large data set to include institutional factors.

This study investigates the relation of executive cash compensation and gender characteristics of senior executives of Thai listed companies using 1,660 firm-years observations from 2009 to 2013. The findings show that male executives earn more cash compensation than do their female counterparts and that compensation is higher for male CEOs whose educational qualifications were Master's degree or above. Companies with a higher proportion of male executives and with better firm performance (measuredby ROA, ROE, and Tobin's q) pay higher cash compensation. The results conform with the Expectancy theory that male executives receive more compensation than do female executives because of their (expected) abilities to make higher returns to the firm's assets. Other significant determinants are that older and larger firms pay more cash compensation to the executives (Life cycle theory) and that companies with a higher proportion of independent directors (Agency Theory) and higher ownership concentrations (Stewardship theory) offer less compensation.

Using agency theory and prospect theory, this paper examines the motivational and cognitive determinants of investment escalation by multinational corporation (MNC)'s foreign subsidiary expatriate managers. This paper posits that the impacts of career incentive structure and negative framing are moderated by the individual-level cultural values of decision makers. Unlike previous studies that focused on the agency costs incurred by locally hired agents, this paper provides new insights into the agency costs incurred by expatriates assigned by the home country headquarters. This paper also provides suggestions that future research can fill the gaps in the literature on agency problems in MNCs.

This paper extends Jensen and Meckling's agency cost theory. A clockwise rotation of their budget constraint represents better performance by agents compared to owners and higher firm values. This extension incorporates Alchian and Demsetz's view of the firm, wherein firm values increase when managers are employed. It is then sub-optimal for owner-managers to directly expropriate non-pecuniary benefits through the firm as in Jensen and Meckling. It is instead Pareto optimal that owner-managers who seek to expropriate non-pecuniary benefits do so using the firm's higher value, and trading it for the non-pecuniary benefits they desire in the open market.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of family control and management in the quality of accounting information in Brazilian companies, with a focus on timeliness. The sample consisted of 72 Brazilian companies and 1,656 observations from 2008 to 2013. The results show that family-controlled companies are quicker to recognize good news related to the price of the respective stock. On the other hand, family managed companies showed low accounting timeliness in relation to recognition of good news. The findings contribute to the agency theory and the literature on family firms and confirm that such companies experience fewer agency problems arising from conflicts between majority and minority shareholders. In addition, the agency conflicts between the management and minority shareholders can be compounded by the recognition of good news not being in family managed firms. (c) 2017 Taylor & Francis.

Corporate Governance systems adequately address problems related to accountability and transparency in developed countries. However, in emerging economies these systems are susceptible to exploitation by self-interest-minded individuals entrusted in managing the organization in some cases, by majority shareholders in other cases and at times by third parties from outside the organization. This exploitation falls under the concept of Agency Theory which emerges as a matter of concern that should be dealt with by Corporate Governance systems. Under the Agency Theory, the author classifies the Agency related problems into three types; "Type One", "Type Two" and "Type Three". All three types emanate from the separation of ownership and decision making complemented by the natural reality of self-interest requiring thus internal mechanisms of control in order to mitigate the Agency problems along with all Agency related costs. The paper then deals with such mechanisms. (c) 2017 by IGI Global.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between board dependence, antitakeover provisions and their influence on corporate entrepreneurship (CE). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses agency theory as a framework to expand on the board dependence-CE relationship by injecting the moderating role of antitakeover provisions to the model. Using data collected from 350 publicly traded firms, a panel regression analyses was conducted on both innovation and venturing components of CE. Findings: The findings of this study show a negative relationship between board dependence and CE. Further this study shows that such a negative relationship becomes weaker when higher levels of antitakeover provisions are injected into the model. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of large publicly traded firms within the information and manufacturing sectors, and so our findings may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other variables representing CE (e.g. new product introductions) may add to this line of research in the future. Practical implications: Understanding the role of board of directors within a firm may help foster CE throughout the organization. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by incorporating the influence of environmental factors (e.g. antitakeover provisions) and examining the relationship between corporate governance and CE using both measures of innovation and venturing.

Purpose: Shareholders and managers can work in a hierarchy in which principals attempt to control the actions of agents to achieve the wealth objective. Alternatively, shareholders and managers can work together as a cooperative team in which shareholders provide financial capital and managers provide human capital. The authors aim to examine the different implications for value creation provided by the two approaches. Design/methodology/approach: By comparing the literature on the value implications of the incomplete contracting framework and control arrangements in principal-agent hierarchies, the authors identify deviations from optimal outcomes and suggest solutions. Findings: The review indicates that a cooperative framework has some advantages over the hierarchical model. The stability of human capital and the relationship between managers and shareholders can be enhanced when shareholders provide capital in increments which vest over time and latitude for renegotiation of agreements is built into contracts. Practical implications: By surrendering control using stock options programmes, managers are free to invest in relationship-specific assets. Shareholders can control the provision of capital by withdrawing investment if insufficient returns are realized, i.e. if stock options do not meet vesting requirements. The market can then be left to do its work. Originality/value: This paper provides an original review of literature on cooperation and hierarchies in the shareholder-manager relationship and proposes solutions to identified deviations from optimal outcomes.

Multinational companies are continually seeking innovative methods to compete globally. In the 1980s, top managements were judged on their ability to restructure the corporation and, in the 1990s, on their ability to identify, cultivate and exploit the core competencies (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990). In the 2000s, managers are expected to deal with changes in the times and uncertainties surrounding their companies. To improve efficiency companies seek innovative strategies. One innovative strategy that was exploited in the 1990s was outsourcing. In this chapter transaction cost theory (Coase, 1937; Williamson, 1975), agency theory (Jensen and Meckling, 1976), and signalling theory (Ross, 1973) are used tounderstand the economic and behavioural aspects of outsourcing and the implications of outsourcing for accounting practices.

This chapter introduces stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory. Stakeholder theory suggests organizations must be accountable not only to investors but also towards a multiplicity of stakeholder, whose expectations and interests can affect or be affected by the organizations' actions. We provide an overview of the descriptive, normative and instrumental approaches to stakeholder theory, along with a classification of stakeholders and a comparison with agency theory. We then define the concepts of legitimacy and social contract, outline the main literature on legitimacy theory and compare it to stakeholder theory. Finally, we discuss both stakeholder and legitimacy theory in the context of Behavioural Accounting Research and provide suggestions for future research.

This chapter explores the possible connections between Behavioural Accounting Research and agency theory. To begin, we describe agency theory and its origins. Given our focus on behavioural accounting, we concentrate on how the individual is influenced by accounting processes and reports, rather than on how accounting leads to outcomes based on the aggregate behaviour of market participants. In our view, Behavioural Accounting Research is linked to agency theory by explaining the role compensation, information, contracts and monitoring play in agency theory. A sample of research is used to illustrate how behavioural accounting researchers have employed agency theory in their papers. Finally, possible research directions are discussed.

Purpose: This study aimed to analyze determinants related with the delisting of Brazilian companies, through the analysis of the problems of agencies coming from structures of property/control and the internationalization of organizations. Originality/value: The present work seeks to fill the existing gap of more detailed studies related to the delisting of companies in the Brazilian capital market. In addition, it presents a contribution to the literature through the analysis of the relationship between Corporate Governance, Corporate Internationalization and Deslisting from the perspective of Agency Theory. Design/methodological/approach: Four econometric models based on existing literature were elaborated and then analysis of logit regressions with panel data. For data of all organizations listed in BM&FBOVESPA in the period between 2006 and 2015, period in which it was found that 205 businesses closed down their capital. Findings: As a result, it was observed that when considering the year before the delisting, organizations which have greater concentration of property had higher probability of closing their capital, which does not occur when analyzing the control structures. As to the entrance mode into international market, it was noted that there is a negative relationship between entrance mode non-patrimonial and volunteer delisting.

The paper reviews theories of corporate governance with regard to financial institutions, in particular, the banking sector. The conventional theory underlying corporate governance does not suggest a differential approach to its application among different organisations. While many organisations subscribe to some form of corporate governance, the manner the principles are applied vary from one organisation to another, one sector to another and one country to another. Financial institutions are a special category of corporations because of the various services they provide to the sectors of the economy, their failure of which can be costly to society (e.g. the effects of the Global Financial Crisis, 2007-2009). The negative externalities that can affect households and firms when there is a breakdown in the provision of financial services arguably justify regulation. Thus, the governance mechanisms that safeguard the interests of shareholders in conventional corporate structures might not be adequate in the case of financial institutions. Cognisant that there is little research regarding corporate governance of financial institutions including Islamic banks, this paper reviews contemporary literature on the subject matter and provides further insights.

Corporate entrepreneurship requires senior executives to evaluate proposals for investment and projects from corporate entrepreneurs. Properties of technology make this evaluation difficult, creating a knowledge gap. Whether through opportunism, overconfidence, and overconfidence, corporate entrepreneurs are likely to induce overinvestment in projects, perhaps at the expense of corporate goals. In this paper we analyze this problem using the tools of agency theory, and identify a solution, staged commitment, used and useful in many areas of business. (c) 2018 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

Important corporate governance mechanisms such as ownership concentration and debt used by the large firms can affect firm performance and value in developed markets. The mixed findings - which are non-conclusive in the literature - pertaining to these relationships pose questions about the exact nature of the relationships between these mechanisms and firm value. Moreover, the mixed findings in the literature have resulted in the endogeneity issue of the former becoming central to discussions in corporate governance and corporate finance studies. The research in this book focuses on the dynamic endogeneity issue to investigate whether this issue influences the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm value in the largest Australian firms based on agency theory. The study investigates this issue through three different advanced econometric models and tests based on agency theory: two-way fixed effects (FE) and the two-step system known as the generalised method of moments (GMM). The book concludes that dynamic endogeneity is not a serious issue in influencing the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm value in the largest Australian firms. These models can be applied to other countries for investigating similar corporate governance and finance issues. (c) 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

CEO duality motivates executives to boost financial performance and withhold unfavourable news, which increases future stock price crashes. Using China's listed firms from 2004 to 2014 as the sample, we present evidence CEO duality exerts positive effects on stock price crash risk. Moreover, the positive effect of CEO duality on crash risk is strengthened when the firms have relatively higher R&D expenditure, lower market competition, and lower analyst coverage.

In particular, there are two objectives in this research, first, to provide empirical evidence concerning the analysis of the adoption of IFRS as a moderating variable in the relation between the independent of commissioners to the number of board of commissioners and earnings management; second, to analyze the adoption of IFRS as a moderating variable in the relation between the dual position audit committee members and earnings management. The research was conducted on companies listed on the Stock Exchanges of Germany, Denmark, France, and the Netherlands from 2002 to 2013. It primarily employed agency theory. Moreover, it employed primary variables including adoption of IFRS, corporate governance, in particular the proportion of independent commissioners to the board of commissioners, dual positions of audit committee members and earnings management. The test results in this research conclude that: The results of testing of the model of accrual earnings management with the samples of companies listed on the stock exchanges of Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark indicated that the adoption of IFRS strengthened negative relation of the proportion of independent commissioners to the number of board of commissioners with accruals earnings management, so that the hypothesis 1 was acceptable. The hypothesis 2 stating the adoption of IFRS strengthen negative relation between the multi position of audit committee members and accrual earnings management was acceptable.

The aim of this article is to evaluate the relevance of the principal-agent model as a framework for the concession analysis of the Cameroonian railway. Several parameters define this agency relationship: the power delegation from the State principal) to the dealer (agent), the hypothesis of information bias in favor of the agent the existence of a risk sharing mechanism. However, the agency theory is undermined due to the poor definition of the perimeter of the concession. Consequently, there is an increase of agency costs and this paves the way for actors' strategic behaviors.

The business landscape is constantly changing, and such events eventually force organizations to restructure their form of management and control. As companies develop, there is a separation of functions between managers and owners, that is, shareholders cease to exercise the management of companies. With this separation some conflicts arise, among them we have the problems of agency, which is approached by the Agency Theory, where the interests of the managers distance themselves from the interests proposed by the shareholders, in this way the asymmetry of information occurs when the owner owns difficulties to observe all the actions of the administrator, which may be different from those that he himself would have chosen, when not all the parties know all the facts, that is, when the information is incomplete. The agent is directly linked to the day-to-day negotiations of the company, while the principal depends on the information that the agent gives him (NASCIMENTO and REGINATO, 2008). In this context, the Controllership has an important role in reducing information asymmetry caused by the agency problem: it seeks to balance information and thus act as a tool to support managers in decision making. This study aims at provoking a reflection on a possible subordination between Accounting and Administration. The methodology is based on a systematic review with bibliographic, descriptive and qualitative support. The CAPES / MEC journal platform was used, and the researches resulted in 339 articles published in the last 10 years, after analysis, 14 of these were separated for study. It is concluded that the Controllership plays an important role as a tool to support the Administration and the reduction of subordination. (c) 2017.

The objective of the study was to identify factors that can predict the outcome of tax inspection conducted by the Directorate General of Taxation (DGT) and earnings management practices in companies listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). To realize the intention, the agency theory was used as the basis of this study. It is used to explain the conflict among corporate taxpayers and DGT. The variables applied in this study are tax inspection, profitability, permanent differences, temporary differences, tax planning, and earnings management. This study examined 156 non-financial companies, which were inspected by the DGT in the period from 2008 to 2013. Path analysis was used to build a research model. This study indicated that temporary and permanent differences can be used to predict tax inspection results; whilst, permanent differences and tax planning affect earnings management. However, this study did not find any model, which can be explained by path analysis.

The study empirically investigates the relationship between corporate governance and the triple bottom line sustainability performance through the lens of agency theory and stakeholder theory. We claim, in fact, that no single theory fully accounts for all the hypothesised relationships. We measure sustainability performance through manual content analysis on sustainability reports of the US-based companies. The study extends the existing literature by investigating the impact of selected corporate governance mechanisms on each dimension of sustainability performance, as defined by the GRI framework. Our approach allows to identify which governance mechanisms foster triple bottom line performance, also revealing that some mechanisms fit only specific dimension(s) of sustainability. The fact-based findings provide support for a new beginning in the theorising process in which the theories must try not only to provide rationale for the impact of corporate governance on sustainability, but also to explain which dimension of sustainability might be more affected. The most important implication for practitioners is the support for sustainability practices, which may be gained through implementation of particular corporate governance mechanisms. The findings contribute also to the improvement of the ongoing standard setting process, in particular as it concerns the in-depth revision of the economic dimension of sustainability carried out under the new GRI framework.

This study develops a combined agency-resource dependence perspective and applies it to the study of interlocking directorates. It suggests that interlocking directorates may exert either a positive or a negative effect on subsequent firm performance, depending on the firm's relative resources, power imbalance, ownership concentration, and CEO ownership. A test on a sample of 145 Italian companies provides support for hypothesized effects. This study suggests that integrating agency and resource dependence theories provides a higher-order explanation of firm performance and helps advance both agency and resource dependence theories.

Research Summary: We investigate whether and how family ownership and management influence firms' internationalization strategies in an emerging economy in which family firms are dominant. Anchoring on the willingness and ability framework and drawing on the socioemotional wealth perspective and agency theory, we theorize how the heterogeneity among family firms in their ownership structures, concentration, and family involvement in management shapes the firms' internationalization strategies. We also theorize how certain contingencies, such as the presence of foreign institutional ownership and family management, moderate the relationship between family ownership and internationalization strategy. We test our predictions by using a proprietary, longitudinal panel dataset of 303 leading family firms from India and find support for most of our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Internationalization has emerged as a dominant strategy for firms in a globally interconnected world. We observe that ownership structure and management have significant bearing on internationalization strategies of family firms, as family owners and managers are more averse to internationalization. Family firms' aversion to internationalize is more pronounced when families can exercise greater control on firms' actions through the combined effect of higher family ownership (primarily through strategic control) and family's participation in management (through strategic, administrative, and operational control). However, certain contingencies, such as the higher ownership of foreign institutions and presence of professional managers, help business families improve their understanding of international markets, reduce the fear of the unknown, and better appreciate the benefits of internationalization, thereby aiding greater internationalization of family firms.

This paper proposes an agency model for headquarters-subsidiary relationships in multinational organizations with headquarters as the principal and the subsidiary as the agent. As a departure from classical agency theory, our model is developed for the unit level of analysis and considers two root causes of the agency problem--self-interest and bounded rationality. We argue that in the organizational setting, one cannot assume absolute self-interest and perfect rationality of agents (subsidiaries) but should allow them to vary. We explain subsidiary-level variation through a set of internal organizational and external social conditions in which the headquarters-subsidiary agency dyad is embedded. We then discuss several agency scenarios reflecting various levels of self-interest and rationality that lead to different manifestations of the agency problem. The proposed framework can inform more relevant applications of the agency perspective in organizational studies and motivate future research. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Management researchers have investigated how corporate governance mechanisms influence corporate social responsibility (CSR). The previous literature has been largely based on agency theory, which emphasizes the roles of effective monitoring and incentive alignment, but the empirical evidence has been mixed. This inconsistency may result from the assumption that each governance mechanism functions independently, even though they interact with one another to affect CSR. On the basis of a perspective of bundle of governance mechanisms, we examined whether multiple governance mechanisms act as complements or substitutes for each other in promoting CSR. Using a panel sample of U.S. firms for the years 2004 to 2010, we found that multiple governance mechanisms mainly act as substitutes to promote CSR. Our findings suggest that a similar level of CSR can be achieved with different combinations of governance mechanisms. Our study contributes to the fields of both corporate governance and CSR in theory and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Different design choices in the controls used to manage performance often lead to a range of unintended consequences, which have profound effects on individuals and organizations. This paper presents a mixed review (both systematic and eclectic) of the literature on the unintended consequences of performance management systems, and develops a typology to explain how and why they occur. It finds that the most salient unintended consequences of directive performance management systems are gaming, information manipulation, selective attention, illusion of control and relationships transformation. It argues that these consequences exist as a result of limiting factors such as ignorance, error, short-term concerns, fundamental values, self-fulfilling forecasts and changes in social relationships. The emerging typology-based theory suggests that the choice of control mechanisms is based on two key assumptions concerning goal-alignment and goal-uncertainty that relate back to ideas in agency theory and stewardship theory. It concludes that, in the design of performance management systems, the more the 'assumed' reality about the state of goal-alignment and goal-uncertainty diverges from the 'real' state of affairs, the more the resultant system is likely to create perverse unintended consequences, leading to poor organizational outcomes.

This paper investigates whether the characteristics of boards of directors and audit committees and the formation of the latter are associated with firm performance. Agency theory suggests that well-governed firms perform relatively better than their poorly-governed counterparts. However, resource dependency theory suggests that a board with more insider directors could have more expertise on how to better operate the firm, thus contributing to better firm performance. Using a sample of firms publicly traded on the Athens Stock Exchange during 2008-2012, we find that those having large-sized boards performed better, but firms having more independent board members performed poorly. We also find that firms with small-sized boards and those with boards having more independent members are more likely to form audit committees, but we failed to find any association between audit committee characteristics and firm performance. In addition, we do not find a negative relation between board independence and future firm performance. These findings suggest that boards of Greek firms take more active role in advising than monitoring. These findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, corporate managers, and investors, in general, and particularly, those in emerging markets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This paper explores the value of financial statement auditing in the public sector. The study applies theory about auditing from the private sector as well as the public sector to explore ways in which public sector auditing can be expected to be valuable. It shows that there are a number of complementary explanations that can be applied to examine the value of public audit, including agency, signaling, insurance, management control, governance and confirmation explanations. The evidence from research and history is generally consistent with the agency and management control explanations. There is some support for the signaling and insurance explanations, while research evidence suggests that governance has differing impact in the public sector compared to the private. The confirmation hypothesis is also potentially relevant. Reviewing the history of the development of public sector auditing functions shows that at least some developments were consistent with explanations such as agency theory and management control. Auditing in the public sector is an area where more research is valuable. The paper concludes with a discussion of issues for further investigation.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the impact of board characteristics on the financial performance of listed firms in Tanzania. Board characteristics, including outside directors, board size, CEO/Chair duality, gender diversity, board skill and foreign directors are addressed in the Tanzanian context by applying two corporate governance theories, namely, agency theory and resource dependence theory. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses balanced panel data regression analysis on 80 firm-years observations (2006-2013) from annual reports, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 key stakeholders. The study uses also a mixed methods approach and applies a convergent parallel design (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011) to integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Findings: It was found that in terms of agency theory, while the findings support the separation of CEO/Chairperson roles, they do not support outside directors-financial performance linkage. With regard to resource dependence theory, the findings suggest that gender diversity has a positive impact on financial performance. Furthermore, the findings do not support an association between financial performance and board size, PhD qualification and foreign directors. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of board-performance link and provides academic evidence to policy makers in Tanzania for current and future governance reforms. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the literature by providing new and original insights that, within a developing setting, extend current understanding of the association between corporate governance and financial performance. This is predicated, also, on the use of uncommon mixed methods approach. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the effects of firm performance and corporate governance on chief executive officer (CEO) compensation in an emerging market, Pakistan. Using a more robust Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation approach for a sample of non-financial firms listed at Karachi Stock Exchange over the period 2005-2012, we find that both current- and previous-year accounting performances has positive influence on CEO compensation. However, stock market performance does not appear to have a positive impact on executive compensation. We further find that ownership concentration is positively related with CEO compensation, indicating some kind of collusion between management and largest shareholder to get personal benefits. Inconsistent with agency theory, CEO duality appears to have a negative influence, while board size and board independence have no convincing relationship with CEO compensation, indicating board ineffectiveness in reducing CEO entrenchment. The results of dynamic GMM model suggest that CEO pay is highly persistent and takes time to adjust to long-run equilibrium. (c) 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Management literature is currently giving growing conceptual and empirical attention to the peculiarity and relevance of entrepreneurial attitudes in family firms, with divergent outcomes. Aiming at concretizing the effects of these attitudes, denoted by the entrepreneurial orientation construct, on family business performance and considering that family dynamics come into play in this relationship, we particularly investigate the impact of control mechanisms and family-related goals. Findings are based on a sample of 180 family firms and show that Proactiveness and Autonomy are particularly relevant to financial performance. Agency-problems avoiding control mechanisms moderate the effect of Innovativeness and Autonomy, while socioemotional wealth (SEW) goals moderate the effect of Risk-Taking, respectively. The usage of these mechanisms and managing SEW goals provide opportunities for a more efficient exploitation of entrepreneurial attitudes. (c) 2017, The Author(s).

We complement the resource-based view of the firm with agency theory in order to explore the link between R&D intensity and degree of internationalization of firms affiliated to Indian business groups. Results from the two-stage least squares panel regression estimation indicate research intensity is positively associated with the firm's degree of internationalization. The relationship is strengthened by the concentration of ownership by family and affiliated business group firms, the board of directors' professionalization, the wedge between voting and cash-flow rights, and the board interlocks of professional directors; but weakened by the board interlocks of family directors. Implications are discussed. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Research on corporate social responsibility (CSR) has traditionally focused on managerial discretion and stakeholders' influence. This study extends current research by addressing the effect of family firms and institutional owners on CSR performance, namely, CSR strengths and concerns. Based on stewardship theory and the socioemotional wealth perspective, we propose that family firms are more likely to value CSR performance. Next, drawing from multiple agency theory, we predict that institutional owners, unlike family owners, will influence a firm's CSR performance differently. We tested our hypotheses using a sample of 153 firms from 1994 to 2006 and found general support for our hypotheses. A higher percentage of family owned equity and the presence of a family CEO are found to increase CSR strengths, whereas transient institutional owners have an opposite effect. The presence of a family CEO and founding family are found to reduce CSR concerns. Contrary to our predictions, dedicated institutional owners are positively associated with CSR concerns.

The resource-based view posits that firms achieve competitive advantage from value creation through firm-specific investments held by key stakeholders: employees, suppliers, and customers. Shareholder-dominant (agency) theory holds that all residual income claimant rights belong to shareholders, circumscribing other key stakeholders' ability to appropriate value from their investment. However, recent enhancements to stakeholder theory grounded in property rights suggest that such stakeholders may need protection for implicit residual claims. A central purpose of this article is to build a model of the protection devices used to ensure these implicit rights. Individual ex ante devices such as stakeholder ownership only partially incentivize stakeholders' firm-specific investments because they are subject to two types of uncertainties--behavioral and environmental--and individual devices aimed at reducing one type of uncertainty may exacerbate the other. We therefore expand on efforts to establish a stakeholder theory of strategic management by proposing an integrated model of protection devices, which seeks to overcome the incentive dilemma in reducing both uncertainties by reducing barriers to stakeholder firm-specific investment. Our model also explores the conflicts and complementarities associated with device implementation. Finally, we discuss theoretical and practical implications, as well as future research opportunities associated with our model. Q Academy of Management Review 2018

Research Summary: Though research has focused on the ascent and acceptance of female CEOs, the post-promotion circumstances female CEOs face remain unclear. In this study, we focus on a critical post-promotion circumstance: the board chair-CEO relationship. Drawing on the gender stereotype literature, agency theory, and stewardship theory, we posit that firms appointing a female CEO are more likely to adopt a collaboration board chair orientation and less likely to adopt a control orientation. We further predict this effect is attenuated by female board representation. Using a sample of new S&P 1500 CEOs, we find support for our predictions regarding the collaboration orientation but not the control orientation. This research provides some evidence of benevolent sexism in the boardroom, with female directors acting as a countervailing influence. Managerial Summary: Whereas the notion that females encounter a glass ceiling on their path toward CEO is well documented, the conditions female CEOs encounter after promotion are less understood. The relationship between the board chair and the CEO is one important post-promotion condition. Board chairs can focus on monitoring and/or working together with the CEO. We suggest board chairs are more likely to work in close collaboration with female CEOs than with male CEOs. We attribute this to benevolent sexism, which explains that board chairs are more likely to collaborate with female CEOs because they view females as more conducive to, and in need of, this type of relationship. We also suggest this benevolent sexism is less prevalent when there are more females on the board. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine companies' reasons for voluntarily obtaining third-party integrated reporting (IR) assurance and the role of external auditors in the assurance process. Design/methodology/approach: By conducting 25 in-depth semi-structured interviews, a wide range of significant actors in the assurance process of integrated reports are addressed. In addition, archive materials are considered. The authors apply institutional theory, agency theory, and the diffusion of innovations theory to analyze IR assurance. Findings: Companies follow coercive pressures by their stakeholders when obtaining external assurance. They intend to appreciate their non-financial indicators and increase their credibility and reliability. Auditors play an important role as change agents for the implementation of IR assurance by, e.g., supporting the correct interpretation of the International Integrated Reporting Council standards and by promoting IR. Research limitations/implications: First, 25 in-depth interviews can only give a first insight about the stated questions. Second, this paper only considers auditors and company representatives from Germany. Third, investors were not questioned about their attitude toward IR assurance. Practical implications: The results may serve as a basis for the implementation of IR assurance. Originality/value: This study combines the relatively unexplored research field of IR with three established theories. Hereby, it exposes companies' motivation for obtaining external assurance and auditors' role on the assurance process. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect of political connections on earnings quality by simultaneously controlling the firm characteristics; to test whether Pakistani firms' ownership, specifically family ownership, plays a significant role in political connections-earnings quality association; to draw a conclusion about the agency theory in the context of Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was used to examine the influence of political connections and family ownership on the earnings quality of listed firms in Pakistan. The study uses historical data from 238 active non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange during the period of 2009-2015. The final data set comprises more than 1,600 firm-year observations from ten major non-financial industry classifications. To enhance the robustness of the empirical relationship, the study used several proxies of earnings quality in conjunction with robust regression methods and diagnostic checks. Findings: The present study's findings are consistent with the findings of the studies on agency theory previous literature, where politically connected firms have significantly lower earnings quality as compared to non-connected firms. The results also indicate that family firms have superior earnings quality than non-family-controlled firms. Furthermore, family ownership moderates the negative influence of political connections on earnings quality. This implies that family ownership diminishes the costs of political connections and improves the earnings quality of the firm. Originality/value: This study is different from previous research in three respects. First, it examines whether family ownership concentration has a moderating influence on the relationship between political connections and earnings quality. Second, it uses a robust methodology and extensive data set to examine the influence of political connections and family ownership concentration on earnings quality. Further, this study is the first to analyze the nexus between financial reporting quality and the political business environment in the context of Pakistan. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Offering product-service systems (PSS) arguably results in economic, environmental and social benefits but also entails significant challenges related to relational dynamics between the provider and the customer. Although prior studies suggest that adverse customer behaviour during PSS provision is likely, they provide a limited theoretical understanding of the conceptualization of such relational problems and, more importantly, offer few possible ways to address these problems. By applying the lens of agency theory, this study examines PSS provider-customer relational problems and solutions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify agency problems and propose mechanisms to mitigate adverse customer behaviour in PSS provision. Based on a multiple case study approach involving two manufacturing companies, several results are presented. First, we identify and describe two underlying reasons for adverse customer behaviour. These reasons are associated with goal differentiation and monitoring challenges. Second, different agency mechanisms (i.e. sharing, monitoring and trust) are presented as approaches to mitigate the likelihood of adverse customer behaviour. The matching of agency problems with agency mechanisms to mitigate these problems lays the groundwork for developing a framework for agency situation evaluation during the formation and ongoing phases of the PSS agreement. In addition, the choice of agency mechanism is found to be correlated with the maturity and type of customer relationship and can change over time as new customers become known and then become loyal. The proposed framework has major theoretical implications for the PSS literature as well as managerial implications for large manufacturing companies engaged in PSS provision. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The dynamic capabilities approach explains how firms create and sustain competitive advantages in dynamic environments if they exhibit technical and evolutionary fitness. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are not only exposed to industry dynamism, but also to dynamism in the different country environments in which they operate. Understanding the dynamic capabilities of MNEs thus requires analyzing not only the firm dimension, but also the country dimension and firm-country interactions of international business. Building on the analytical disaggregation of dynamic capabilities into: (1) sensing opportunities (or threats), (2) seizing (or neutralizing) them via expedient investments, and (3) transforming the firm and its resources and capabilities accordingly, we conceptualize the relationships between the dominant logics behind MNEs' sensing, seizing, and transforming and evolutionary fitness. First, we propose that a dominant logic behind sensing, based on an application of resource-based view thinking to the international business context (which we develop to separately explain the three component parts of MNEs' competitive advantages, i.e., non-location bound firm-specific advantages, country-specific advantages, and location bound firm-specific advantages), positively moderates the effect of sensing processes and routines on evolutionary fitness. Second, we propose that a dominant logic behind seizing, based on internalization theory thinking, positively moderates the effect of seizing processes and routines on evolutionary fitness. Third, we propose that a dominant logic behind transforming, based on a broad agency perspective extended to the international business context, positively moderates the effect of transforming processes and routines on evolutionary fitness.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of internal corporate governance mechanisms on insurance companies' risk-taking in the UK context. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a panel data of all listed insurance companies on FTSE 350 over the 2005-2014 period. Multivariate regression techniques are used to estimate the effect of internal corporate governance mechanisms on insurance companies' risk-taking. Findings: The results show that the board size and board meetings are significantly and negatively related to risk-taking. In contrast, the results show that board independence and audit committee size are statistically insignificant but negatively related to risk-taking. The findings are robust to alternative measures and endogeneities. Research limitations/implications: The findings have important implications for investors, managers, regulators of financial institutions and effectiveness of corporate governance reforms that have been pursued. Investors may further rely on internal corporate governance attributes to form expectations about risk-taking behaviour. Insurance companies need strong governance, as well as effective accounting and financial reporting standards, to enable proper insights into the company's financial position. Originality/value: This study contributes to the corporate governance literature and creates significant evidence regarding the role of corporate governance in constraining risk-taking behaviour in an industry with significantly complex context.

This paper sheds light on the incongruent findings concerning the relationship between family involvement and firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR). While prior studies have mainly taken the perspective of families' socioemotional wealth preservation, we approach this relationship from the perspective of behavioral agency theory, highlighting the important role played by CEOs' family memberships. Specifically, we posit that family firms are more likely to invest in CSR when their CEOs are members of the controlling families. Furthermore, we examine how family firms can employ long-term incentives to encourage non-family CEOs to act in the interests of the controlling families to preserve SEW and thus enhancing family firms' CSR performance. We tested our hypotheses using hand-collected data of family firms included in the S&P 500 index, in the period of 2003-2010. The empirical findings support our hypotheses that (a) family firms with family members as the CEOs have better CSR performance and (b) family firms tend to provide a high level of long-term incentives to non-family than family CEOs. In addition, long-term incentives strongly motivate CEOs to improve firms' CSR performance, regardless of their family memberships. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

This systematic literature review analyses the determinants and consequences of executive compensation-related shareholder activism and say-on-pay (SOP) votes. The review covers 71 empirical articles published between January 1995 and September 2017. The studies are reviewed within an empirical research framework that separates the reasons for shareholder activism and SOP voting dissent as input factor on the one hand and the consequences of shareholder pressure as output factor on the other. This procedure identifies the five most important groups of factors in the literature: the level and structure of executive compensation, firm characteristics, corporate governance mechanisms, shareholder structure and stakeholders. Of these, executive compensation and firm characteristics are the most frequently examined. Further examination reveals that the key assumptions of neoclassical principal agent theory for both managers and shareholders are not always consistent with recent empirical evidence. First, behavioral aspects (such as the perception of fairness) influence compensation activism and SOP votes. Second, non-financial interests significantly moderate shareholder activism. Insofar, we recommend integrating behavioral and non-financial aspects into the existing research. The implications are analyzed, and new directions for further research are discussed by proposing 19 different research questions. (c) 2018 University of Florida, Fisher School of Accounting

In much of the developing world, families represent the dominant form of firm ownership. This study investigates how this influences equity ownership strategies when firms venture abroad. Drawing on agency theory and institutional theory, we investigate the direct effect of board composition and family ownership on the equity-based ownership strategies of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in their affiliates, and how institutional distance may moderate this. Examining foreign affiliates of listed Turkish MNEs, we find that a high ratio of independent directors is negatively linked to levels of equity ownership of MNE affiliates. We also find that a high ratio of inside directors on the board is positively associated with the equity stake of MNEs in their affiliates. The significant interaction effect between board composition, family ownership and institutional distance helps explain the unexpectedly weak effects of institutional distance. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper aims to provide a twofold empirical comparison: first, a comparison between the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on agency costs proxies and firm performance measures, and second, this comparison was used before and after the 2008 financial crisis, capturing two different economic states. Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression methods were applied to two data sets of non-financial firms incorporated in the FTSE ALL-Share index over the period 2005-2011. Findings: The results provide evidence that not all mechanisms lead to lower agency conflicts and/or higher firm performance. Ownership identity has a significant impact and the role of the governance mechanisms changes with the changes in the economic conditions surrounding the firm. Research limitations/implications: The results lend support to the notion that forcing a certain code of practice on firms to follow could compel them to move away from conflict reduction governance structures. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a comparison of empirical evidence for the impact of board characteristics and ownership identity on agency costs and firm performance by using a comprehensive set of corporate governance mechanisms. This comparison challenges the prior studies that use performance as an indirect proxy for lower agency costs. Additionally, it compares the impact of the governance mechanisms during two different economic conditions. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research Summary: This study analyzes how the divestitures that are impelled by activist investors in their campaigns against public corporations affect shareholder value. Using hand-collected data on the activist campaigns that were launched against and the divestitures that were undertaken by Fortune 500 companies between 2007 and 2015, we find that activist-impelled divestitures are more positively associated with immediate and longer-term measures of shareholder value than comparable manager-led divestitures. These performance differences persist for nearly two years after the completion of these deals. Our results empirically test the idea that firms with agency problems unlock shareholder value when they divest, and support the notion that activist investors fulfill an important external governance function. Our work also opens new research opportunities and offers practical implications as well. Managerial Summary: This study investigates how divestitures that are undertaken at the behest of activist investors affect shareholder value. We find that divestitures that were undertaken under pressure from activist investors are associated with more positive shareholder returns than comparable divestitures that were undertaken voluntarily by managers. These performance differences persist for nearly two years after the completion of these deals, alleviating concerns about the purported short-termism of activist investors. Our findings suggest that activist investors may fulfill an important governance function by inducing managers to undertake strategies that they might not otherwise pursue, thereby unlocking shareholder value.

This study integrates behavioral agency theory with the conditions of willingness and ability to investigate how family ownership and family involvement affect the likelihood of initial international entry, both directly and interactively. A firm's initial international entry--its first expansion into a foreign market--is considered a major, and often risky, strategic action that enables a firm to compete and grow. Among family firms, variance in initial international entry is theoretically explained by the family's willingness and ability to participate. Using survival analysis on data representing 190 different family firms across 10 years, our findings support hypotheses suggesting that family ownership and involvement decrease the likelihood of initial international entry. However, these two forms of family control also act as interactive substitutes in relation to initial international entry likelihood. Our findings provide for a more nuanced understanding of family control heterogeneity in relationship to major strategic actions. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: While there have been extensive empirical investigations of pay-performance sensitivity, the perspective of performance-pay has received less attention to date. While executive compensation is sensitive to firm performance, firm performance is also likely to be affected by executive compensation. Adopting multiple theoretical perspectives, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether executive compensation has a greater influence on firm performance or whether the latter has a greater influence on compensation. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from a five-year period (2010-2014) for Financial Times and Stock Exchange 350 companies, the authors employ a set of simultaneous equation modelling to jointly investigate, after accounting for endogeneity problem, the mutual association of executive compensation and firm performance by employing four control variables (board size, non-executive directors, leverage and boardroom ownership). Findings: The authors find strong evidence for the greater influence of executive compensation on firm performance than the pay-performance framework. This finding supports the tournament theory compared with the agency perspective. Research limitations/implications: Inevitably, there are limitations in a wide-ranging study of this nature that could be addressed in future research. As any empirical study utilising company data, there may be concerns to the effect of survivorship bias and the manner in which companies have reorganised, if there is any, themselves during the period under examination. There are also issues as to missing data, some measures relating to both executive compensation and corporate governance are not provided by the BoardEx database. Practical implications: The study results provide evidence that using the tournament perspective by remuneration committees as a guide for determining executive compensation helps in achieving better performance. This helps in developing appropriate mechanisms for setting executive remuneration. Originality/value: This paper combines an empirical investigation of the frameworks of pay-performance and performance-pay and develops a system of six simultaneous equations to examine the associations between executive compensation and firm performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to integrate conventional corporate governance (CG) mechanisms into the Islamic banking framework in order to examine their impact on Islamic banks (IBs) financial performance (IBFP) within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) context. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a sample of 22 full-fledged IBs operating in the GCC countries over an 11-year period from 2005 to 2015. Using panel data approach, the paper develops an empirical model consists of five CG mechanisms and three control variables. The model parameters are estimated using feasible generalized least squares framework. Findings: The results show that five internal CG mechanisms have statistically significant relationship with IBFP, measured by Q-ratio. Insider shareholding is found to be positively associated with IBFP, while institutional and government shareholdings are found to be negatively related to Q-ratio, the results being consistent with the agency theory, strategic alignment theory and property rights theory, respectively. Moreover, the results reveal that large board size and CSR engagement negatively influence IBFP, once again lending support to agency theory and trade off theory, respectively. The control variables, namely, leverage, size and age are also found to have a statistically significant relationship with IBFP. Practical implications: IBs are urged to ensure transparency in the provision of innovative products fundamentally in contrast to conventional banking products as well as cater to the untapped markets by weaving Islamic values into the existing CG fabric, as a feasible solution to remain competitive. Originality/value: The paper examines the relationship between internal CG mechanisms and financial performance of listed and non-listed full-fledged IBs operating in the GCC countries.

Agency theory emphasizes the role of outside directors in mitigating free cash flow (FCF) problems, such as overinvesting FCF's into negative NPV R&D projects. In this paper we draw on and extend agency theory to argue that the underinvestment of financial slack towards a persistently high R&D-intensity is actually a greater problem for high-tech firms. Specifically, we claim that inside directors play a critical role for the board in safeguarding R&D investment by monitoring the CEO, and mitigating informational asymmetries for independent directors. We test our theory using a panel-data set of S&P 1500 firms in R&D-intensive industries from 1997 to 2007. Our empirical analysis reveals that inside directors positively influence the relationship between financial slack and R&D-intensity, and that their ability to ensure cash holdings are used to preserve R&D matters the most during periods of financial distress.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which chief executive officers (CEOs) deserve the pay they receive both in terms of over and underpayment. Design/methodology/approach: Rather than using the traditional normal distribution view in which CEO performance clusters around the mean with relatively little variance, the authors adopt a novel power law approach. They studied 22 industries and N = 4,158 CEO-firm combinations for analyses based on Tobin's Q and N = 5,091 for analyses based on return on assets. Regarding compensation, they measured the CEO distribution based on total compensation and three components of CEO total pay: salary, bonus, and value of options exercised. Findings: In total, 86 percent of CEO performance and 91 percent of CEO pay distributions fit a power law better than a normal distribution, indicating that a minority of CEOs are producing top value for their firms (i.e. CEO performance) and a minority of CEOs are appropriating top value for themselves (i.e. CEO pay). But, the authors also found little overlap between CEOs who are the top performers and CEOs who are the top earners. Implications: The findings shed new light on CEO pay deservingness by using a novel conceptual and methodological lens that highlights systematic over and underpayment. Results suggest a violation of distributive justice and offer little support for agency theory's efficient contracting hypothesis, which have important implications for agency theory, equity theory, justice theory, and agent risk sharing and agent risk bearing theories. Practical implications: Results highlight erroneous practices when trying to benchmark CEO pay based on average levels of performance in an industry because the typical approach to CEO compensation based on averages significantly underpays stars and overpays average performers. Originality/value: Results offer new insights on the extent of over and underpayment. The findings uncover an extremely large non-overlap between the top earning and top performing CEOs and to an extent far greater in magnitude than previously suggested.

Radical innovation is critical for firms to enhance their competitiveness. Whether they can achieve it, however, depends on organizational factors, including the corporate governance of the firm. In emerging economies in which shareholder protection is weak, large shareholders are widely used as an efficient governance mechanism to reduce agency problems. The literature on agency theory contains conflicting arguments regarding the role of large shareholders in firm innovation performance and has underestimated the role of social relationships between large shareholders and managers in determining the firm's innovation performance. By applying a stewardship theory perspective, this article argues that the characteristics of the relationship between large shareholders (owners) and managers, manifested as trust and shared goals, may explain variations in a firm's radical innovation. Drawing on data from 174 Chinese firms with large shareholders, our results show that trust has an inverted U-shaped relationship with firm radical innovation, whereas shared goals exhibit a positive linear relationship with radical innovation. Shared goals further moderate the nonlinear effect of trust on radical innovation. Trust is almost negatively related to firm radical innovation when there is a low level of shared goals. However, when there is a high level of shared goals, the relationship between trust and firm radical innovation is first positive, then plateaus, and finally becomes negative. These findings advance our understanding of the role of the relationship between large shareholders and managers as a driver of radical innovation and contribute to the innovation literature by providing a nuanced understanding of the key factors that influence the effects of the social aspects of governance on firm radical innovation.

This paper examines the effects of board composition and monitoring on the credit risk in the UK banking sector. The study finds CEO duality, pay and board independence to have a positive and significant effect on credit risk of the UK banks. However, board size and women on board have a negative and significant influence on credit risk. Further analysis using sub-samples divided into pre-financial crisis, during the financial crisis and post crisis reinforce the robustness of our findings. Overall, the paper sheds light on the effectiveness of the within-firm monitoring arrangement, particularly, the effects of CEO power and board independence on credit risk decisions thereby contributing to the agency theory.

In a study of family firms that included survey responses from both family CEOs and family member employees, we examined the roles that collaboration and CEO monitoring play regarding the prevalence of extra-role behavior, an important human resource outcome that can impact job performance and firm performance. Results indicated that an integration of stewardship and agency theories (manifested through interactions between family harmony and adaptability with monitoring) helps explain the level of extra-role behavior displayed by family employees. The findings lend some support for the argument that effective human resource practices in family firms should be balanced between instrumental governance mechanisms that reflect a monitoring approach and normative mechanisms that focus on collaborative efforts among family employees. When this balance is achieved, an environment of fairness and accountability rather than a tone of distrust and forced compliance may prevail in family firms, thus addressing a key human resource issue in this hybrid form of organization.

Purpose: Agency theory suggests that divergences will occur when a principal, e.g. client, and agent e.g. a project manager, interests are different in the execution of a project. The purpose of this paper is to explore if the agency theory can explain the subtleties integral to the behaviours and relationships between players delivering a public-private-partnership (PPP) in the context of an international development (ID) project. The intra-/interpersonal dynamics include governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and private commercial service providers. The authors develop a conceptual framework and provide evidence from a case study of the testing of a Road Safety Toolkit in Kenya to explore several propositions. Design/methodology/approach: Extant literature identified application of the agency theory, and the development of a conceptual framework. A case study describing an ID project was used to validate the propositions prior to the expansion of a research instrument for data collection in the field. Findings: Through the lens of the agency theory and the limitations imposed by exploring a series of propositions, several insightful conclusions have been derived from the case. ID projects have particular nuisances that make them unique when compared to the majority of commercial applications. An added dimension and level of complexity is a consequence of the PPP incorporating government, NGOs and private corporations. The case exemplified the need for PPP ID projects to build on partner networks to influence and disseminate outcomes. Some agency problems were far less prominent than would normally be seen in a commercial project. Research limitations/implications: The methodologies presented in this paper need to be adapted and practiced in different kinds of ID projects in order to get confirmatory analytical results. The limitations imposed by the use of the single case, whilst drawing insightful conclusions, would necessitate greater testing in the field. Practical implications: Although the problems of the agency theory are well researched in the operations management literature, there is limited application to ID projects and no previous research within the context of a PPP. Therefore, this work is important for greater understanding of the specific issues associated with project delivery of an ID. Social implications: Conflicting goals between principals and agents are common for organisations, which in turn affect inter-relationships on an international footing. The agency theory has had little attention in the project management field, yet is fundamental to relationships and communication. Originality/value: There has been little research that explores the agency theory in the context of a PPP involving governments, NGOs and private commercial service providers, executed as an ID project. This work, therefore, exhibits new and novel findings. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effects of some corporate governance mechanisms and executive compensation on audit fees in an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach: The study population consists of 540 observations and 90 listed companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange during the years 2009-2014. The statistical model used in this study is a multivariate regression model; besides, the statistical technique used to test the hypotheses proposed in this research is panel data. Findings: The changes in the value of a CEO's own firm stock option portfolio, in thousands of rials (Iran's currency), for a 0.01 change in stock return volatility and stock price are defined as Vega and Delta, respectively. The results demonstrated that there is a positive association between audit fees and delta, but not Vega; this means that a fee premium is linked to CEO Delta incentives. The findings show that Iranian companies pay more audit fees when they give managers more rewards. In addition, the results show that there is not a significant relationship between fees resulting from audit risk and Delta and Vega incentives of the board. Inconsistent with agency theory, the authors found that the independence of board members did not have any effect on audit fees. As a final point, the outcomes of the paper demonstrate that managers who invest in companies under their own management do not have any impact on the amount of audit fee. To put it another way, there is not any significant connection between the board ownership and audit fees. Practical implications: This is one of the most important studies that simultaneously surveys the impacts of corporate governance mechanisms and executive compensation in the Iranian audit market. The results of this study will reveal more than the role of corporate governance mechanisms for society and users of financial statements because as tools on the CEO actions, they always have to pay attention to the implementation of corporate principles in the economic entity' operation. Originality/value: The present study has examined the relationship between two cases of corporate governance mechanisms named the board independence and the board ownership with audit fees in a country where, to the authors' knowledge as in most other developing markets, such a relationship has not been a subject of empirical research. Moreover, the use of a two-dimensional measure of executive compensation, namely, Delta and Vega incentives, primarily considering research undertaken in an emerging market, as a valuable contribution may be observed.

The focus of this article is on public-private partnerships (PPPs). The aim is to both theoretically and empirically illustrate PPP agency problems in four PPP stages, as well as to identify potentially relevant solutions to the agency problems. The study employed a longitudinal case study of one PPP in a municipality in southern Sweden. Through an analysis based on interviews, observations, and documents, the study illustrates a number of agency problems faced by PPPs and highlights the importance of resource allocation, stakeholder management, and the creation of a common identity in reducing these problems.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of corporate governance, with particular reference to the role of independent directors on boards and audit committees, and media coverage on corporate transparency and disclosure. In addition, the paper also investigates the role of the media on independent directors' behaviours towards corporate transparency and disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the well-developed two-step system generalised method of moments approach on a sample of 99 Pakistan stock exchange (PSX) listed financial firms over the period 2007-2012. Findings: The empirical analysis shows that media and independent directors on audit committees play a significant positive role in line with agenda setting and agency theories in promoting corporate transparency and disclosure. On the contrary, the boards' independent directors are risk-averse and hold the information to protect their reputation. Nevertheless, the study does not find any significant influence of media coverage on independent directors' behaviours in promoting corporate transparency and disclosure. Practical implications: The findings provide some useful insight into cost benefits analysis of media coverage towards an understanding of independent directors' behaviours for promoting transparency and disclosure in financial sector. Moreover, the study findings can be useful for both shareholders and stakeholders in taking decisions about firm activities. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that proposed and tested a multi-level framework for corporate transparency and disclosure practices. In addition, this study is also among the very few studies that use financial sectors as a sample, in particular, and media coverage, specifically, thus adding some value to the limited literature.

This study empirically investigates the relationship between two key supplier performance measurement and management practices (i.e. monitoring and incentives) and suppliers' operational performance. Grounding on agency theory, a theoretical framework is proposed identifying the mediation effect of goal congruence and supplier opportunism within the direct relationship between monitoring/incentives and suppliers' operational performance. Related hypotheses are tested by applying structural equation modelling on a final sample of 305 responses, collected from a cross-country survey. Results uncover a nuanced and insightful picture: both monitoring and incentives positively affect the suppliers' operational performance. Goal congruence does not result as a significant mediator whereas supplier opportunism mediates the monitoring-performance relationship and the incentives-performance relationship. However, contrary to expectations, providing incentives to suppliers increases the chances of opportunistic behaviours, which in turn diminishes suppliers' operational performance. While the key empirical evidence supports the general positive impact of monitoring and incentives on performance, incentives appear as a double-edged sword due to their potential counterproductive effect in increasing supplier opportunism.

Purpose: Board size is an important dimension of corporate governance. The purpose of this study is to propose and test indirect effects of organization size on organizational performance via board size, in the context of industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study's predictions were tested in 288 medium and large organizations listed on the Australian Securities Exchange using archival data. Findings: The findings of this study suggest the following: organization size is positively associated with board size and this relationship is stronger in manufacturing organizations; board size is positively associated with performance and this relationship is conditional on industry; and organization size has an indirect effect on performance via board size, and this indirect effect is also conditional on industry. Research limitations/implications: The results provide some support for the resource dependency theory, agency theory and contingency theory. Practical implications: The findings suggest that directors should take into account the effects of board size and industry to provide a more precise assessment of the board's performance. Originality/value: It predicts and tests the pioneering moderating effect of industry (manufacturing vs services) on the organization size-board size, board size-organizational performance and organization size-board size-organizational performance relationships.

While academic researchers continue to debate the effect of board independence in increasing performance, its efficacy could also be reflected in whether firm performance is made more stable. Board governance activities are a constellation of actions aimed at managing agency costs and ensuring the viability of a company over time. The efficacy of such actions would, therefore, be reflected in a distal outcome, specifically, in lower firm performance variability. Boards that can control agency costs and limit both underinvestment and overinvestment would reduce a firm's deviation from its mean performance trajectory. Using a longitudinal sample of publicly traded companies in the United States, we find that board stability, board resource provision, and CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability. Board independence is not associated with performance variability. With increasing board independence, greater board stability and greater CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability, however, greater board resource provision is not associated with performance variability.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the direct and indirect effect of the existence of risk management on the relationship between audit committee and corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure in Palestine. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilizes a panel data of 31 Palestinian listed companies from 2010 to 2016. It also utilizes structural equation modeling (SEM) model. Findings: The results of SEM model find a significant positive relationship of the existence of risk management, audit committee meeting and audit committee size with CSR disclosure. However, audit committee financial expertise has a significant negative relationship with CSR disclosure. The results also find a significant relationship of audit committee meeting and audit committee financial expertise with CSR disclosure through the existence of risk management. Practical implications: This study is important to policymakers, accounting professionals and shareholders on the extent to which audit committee related to such committee efficiency in monitoring CSR disclosure. Social implications: This study adds to the existing literature by investigating the direct and indirect effect of the existence of risk management on the relationship between audit committee and CSR disclosure in Palestine as one of the youngest market in region that assists to test the validity of agency theory in a young and small emerging market context. Originality/value: It is the first study to investigate the direct and indirect effect of the existence of risk management on the relationship between audit committee and CSR disclosure in Palestine.

Purpose: This paper aims to discuss and explore the unique agency issues in Islamic banks which give rise to different agency conflicts exist in Islamic banks as compared to conventional banks. In addition, this paper critically examines agency theory in Islamic banking perspective by incorporating Islamic ethical considerations in the principal-agent setting. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper, and the discussions revolve around the review of literature of which important sources have been cited in a way that demonstrates a reasonable understanding of the topic. It attempts to create a discourse around the inclusion of Islamic ethical system in understanding the governance structure of Islamic banks. Findings: This paper concludes that Islamic ethical system embedded in the Islamic banks business activities shapes Islamic banks into organisations that place higher ethical considerations than conventional banks. Therefore, Islamic banks are likely to have less severe agency problems relative to their conventional counterparts. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalisability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications: As the discourse generated by the paper, it can ultimately enhance the understanding of Islamic governance structure in the perspective of agency issues. Social implications: As the discourse generated by the paper, it can ultimately enhance the understanding of Islamic governance structure in the perspective of agency issues. Originality/value: The paper attempts to bring to attention the important aspect of principal-agent relationship within the Islamic banking structures and explain the role of incorporating Islamic ethical system in enhancing the understanding of the principal-agent relationship.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of corporate governance internal mechanisms on tax disclosure in non-financial firms in Malaysia. Managerial ownership and incentive compensation are used as proxies to reflect corporate governance conduct. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses panel data set to analyse 286 non-financial listed companies on Bursa Malaysia for the years 2010-2012. Tax disclosure was gathered from the financial statements, particularly in the consolidated of tax expenses. Tax disclosure was measured using modified effective tax rate reconciling items. Multivariate statistical analyses were run on the sample data. Findings: This study finds that managerial ownership and incentive compensation do not significantly influence tax disclosure. On the other hand, it is found that there are significant positive associations between each of firm size and industry dummy, and tax disclosure. This means that company-specific characteristics are important factors affecting corporate tax disclosure. Research limitations/implications: This study extends the work of previous studies by suggesting that the signalling theory and the agency theory are the main theories concerned with tax disclosure and corporate governance. The authors add an additional appreciation of the contribution of corporate governance from the interested parties' tax disclosure evaluation in the Malaysian environment. Practical implications: The evidence found by this study has important policy and practical knowledge implications for the authorities, researchers, decisionmakers and firm managers. The findings provide them with some relevant insights on the importance of corporate governance practices from the companies' perspectives and contribute to the discussion of who verifies and deduces from tax disclosure directed by companies. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to examine the influence of the corporate governance internal mechanisms on tax disclosure in a developing nation like Malaysia. Although this paper focuses on a single country, it contributes significantly to the debate about tax disclosure in relation to "comply or explain", as suggested in the Code of Corporate Governance. This study shows that companies are trying to avoid as far as possible disclosing tax-related information. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Although agency theory implies that greater parent ownership can help mitigate agency conflict, principal-principal conflicts could arise among controlling and other minority shareholders. This study investigates corporate governance in publicly listed subsidiary firms after the establishment of small-cap markets, which is a unique setting in Japan. The results show that parent control has a negative relationship to dividend payout and firm profitability. However, parent control enhances sales growth, which is not consistent with parent control exploitation. Foreign shareholders moderate the conflict between parent firms and other shareholders related to dividends and firm profitability. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: The existing literature has focused heavily on investigating the effect of corporate social performance (CSP) on financial performance (FP) but has not paid sufficient attention to an inverse causation of the relationship. Moreover, while some of the literature argues that FP positively affects CSP, based on the slack resources theory, others have found negative effects of FP on CSP, supporting the managerial opportunism perspective. Thus, this paper aims to address the impact of FP on CSP. Further, this study examines the moderating role of franchising to better understand the relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses and expands the models derived from the CSP literature to confirm the effects of FP on CSP with the moderating role of franchising within the restaurant industry. Using two-way fixed effects models, it effectively addresses important problems embedded in the panel data. Findings: The findings show a positive effect of FP on CSP, which is inconsistent with Park and Lee's (2009) findings and supports the slack resources theory. Further, the interesting results show that the impact of FP on CSP diminishes as a firm franchises more, supporting the double-sided moral hazard framework of the agency theory. Originality/value: This paper fills the lacuna in both the existing literature on the relationship between CSP and FP and the franchising. This study contributes to enhancing restaurant practitioners' understanding of the double-sided moral hazard of agency theory unique to franchising context. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

When citizens are actively engaged in e-government processes as co-creators it leads to e-government development. Citizen participation in e-government is a recent phenomenon where government is seeking more involvement of citizens through different platforms. Whether citizens' participation through social media platforms leads to e-government development has been a debate in literature. In this research study, the authors investigate whether social media usage influences government's role in e-government development. Power distance between government and citizen also plays a role in deciding the extent of e-participation in e-government. In this study, the authors examine the relationship between social media, power distance, citizen engagement and e-government development. Using customer focus theory and agency theory, this study establishes that e-participation initiative by government acts as a mediator in the relation between social media usage by citizen as well as power distance to e-government development.

We study the agency theory by re-examining the effect of financial leverage on firm value. Moreover, we introduce a contingency variable: firm competitive strategy. To do so, we study non-financial firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2007 through 2013, resulting in 2,438 observations. Using the panel data technique, after controlling for firm-specific characteristics and industry differences, we find that leverage has a positive effect on firm value. Going deeper, we find that this effect is stronger for firms that apply a cost leadership strategy, differentiation strategy, or focused strategy. Copyright (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to set a research agenda so that future conceptual and empirical research can improve the understanding of why CEO pay and CEO performance are decoupled. Design/methodology/approach: The paper compiles and adds to many of the explanations provided by this special issue's nine commentaries regarding why CEO pay and CEO performance are decoupled. These explanations were grouped into two categories: economic (e.g. marginal productivity theory, agency theory and behavioral agency model) and social-institutional-psychological (e.g. CEO individual differences and characteristics and CEO-organization interactions). Moreover, new analyses based on additional data were conducted to examine measurement-related explanations for the observed pay-performance decoupling. Findings: Results based on alternative measures of pay and performance confirmed, once again, the existence of pay-performance decoupling. Research limitations/implications: This paper will stimulate research pitting theoretical explanations against each other to understand their relative validity in different contexts. Practical implications: The paper informs ongoing efforts to link CEO pay to performance. Social implications: The paper also revisits the decoupling of CEO pay and firm performance from a normative and value-based perspective (i.e. regarding whether pay and performance should be related). Originality/value: The paper clarifies that the articles in this special issue largely concluded that CEO pay is decoupled from CEO performance. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Related party transactions have become a key issue as a result of recent financial scandals. This study examines whether firms use related party transactions for earnings management, and then, whether they try to minimize detection through the format of related party transactions disclosure. Firstly, we analyze the association between related party transactions structure (types and parties involved) and the probability of reporting small earnings increase. Related party transactions may have significant impact on, and implications for, earnings management. According to the agency theory, related party transactions are used opportunistically, while the efficient transaction hypothesis argues that related party transactions meet the economic needs of the business. We next investigate the association between the probability of reporting small earnings increases through related party transactions and disclosure quality. Disclosure quality should be studied in relation to impression management and investor attention; this approach takes account of the idea that earnings management behavior may influence the quality of disclosure as a possible way of lowering conflict of interest. In line with the agency theory, our findings show that revenue related party transactions are more likely to be used to manage earnings than other types of transaction; related party transactions with ultimate parents are associated with lower probability of reporting small earnings increases compared to operations with other related parties. Lastly, our results confirm that the decision to engage in earnings management is related to lower disclosure quality. (c) 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: Since 2012, the Brazilian Stock Exchange has recommended that listed companies inform them if they have conducted voluntary disclosure. The purpose of this study is to describe the voluntary disclosure by companies listed in the B3 in Brazil and to analyze which characteristics of the board of directors influence this disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The study involves quantitative research using a sample of 285 companies and 575 reports from 2011 to 2014. A fixed-effects regression model with panel data was used for the analysis. Findings: The results were statistically significant for gender and duality variables, which confirms the theory that the presence of women as members of the board positively influences voluntary disclosure and that chief executive officer and chairman of the board positions have a negative effect. The age and independence of the board variables did not present statistical significance. Research limitations/implications: As a theoretical contribution, the authors aim to complement sustainability, finance and strategy research by using agency theory and measuring the variable of voluntary disclosure and the board, which is rarely studied in this context. Practical implications: As social and empirical contributions, a better understanding of this theme in the context of emerging countries, which is the peculiarities of Brazil with little information transparency and well-known corruption scandals, is likely to aid investors. Increased access to company information can help investors better select their investment portfolios and assist in the choice of their board representatives in companies in which they have participation and voting rights. Originality/value: The fact that Brazil is an emerging country, where the lack of transparency of information and corruption in these environments stand out the importance of studying the subject of voluntary disclosure in this context. All data were collected manually specifically for this research. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the effect of family ownership and board characteristics on Earnings Management (EM) in Jordan. This study combines the explanation provided in Agency Theory (Type II) and Socio-Emotional Wealth Theory (SEW) in order to understand how family firms are motivated for EM practices. This study also investigates the effect of board size, CEO duality and board education on EM practices. Using Modified Jones Model (1991), a sample of 43 Jordanian industrial firms listed in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) with a total of (258) firm-year observations for the period from 2011-2016 reveals a significant positive association between family ownership and EM but no evidence is found to support that board size, CEO duality and board education have an impact on EM decisions.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between corporate governance structures and stakeholder and shareholder value maximization perspectives in 267 African banks from 2006 to 2011. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used the Prais-Winsten ordinary least squares and random effect regression models to explore this relationship to ensure consistency and efficiency in results. The data for this study were collected from Bankscope. Findings: The results of this study show that corporate governance structures such as CEO duality, nonexecutive members and extreme large board size lead to a reduction in both shareholder and stakeholder value maximization. However, audit independence and board size also promote both shareholder and stakeholder value maximization. Although gender diversity promotes profit maximization, it was not significant in any of the models estimated. The results further suggest that the same corporate governance structures promote and detract shareholder and stakeholder value maximization in Africa although the effect of corporate governance structures was weightier on shareholder value maximization confirming the agency theory. Practical implications: From these findings, bank management must pursue the institution of good corporate governance structures and avoid weak corporate governance structures to promote shareholder and stakeholder value maximization. Also equity holders may have to pay particular attention to corporate governance structures because they benefit the most from the institution of good corporate governance structures. Originality/value: This study explores and compares how corporate governance structures promote shareholder and stakeholder value maximization separately in African banks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first of such studies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Employee engagement via corporate social responsibility (CSR) involves conflicts of interest between firms, employees, and political institutions. We examined the international transfer of employees of an airline company as a case study of a CSR strategy based on human resource management. From the dual approach of multiple agency theory and a resource-based perspective, we found that by increasing worker mobility costs, the European Union hindered the firm's CSR strategy of employee engagement. This contrasts with the stated aim of the European Union to promote worker mobility. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

This study examines if the effort of financially linked independent (FLI) directors enable firms to reemerge from bankruptcy, a major organizational crisis. Using a sample of 307 bankrupt U.S. firms with instrumental variables regression methodology, I find that the efforts of these directors are critical for firm reemergence. FLI directors' efforts increase the likelihood of reemergence as well as improve access to financial resources. In contrast, I do not find any evidence that non-FLI directors' efforts are associated with reemergence. I also find that resourceful but uninvolved directors are not helpful for firms trying to navigate their way out of bankruptcy. My study highlights (a) the changing nature of roles played by directors in various lifecycle stages, (b) the greater importance of resource provisioning over monitoring during reemergence, and (c) that efforts of FLI directors, and not others director categories, matter for reemergence. Overall, my study extends research that suggests directors' motivation may cause differential firm outcomes and provides evidence that directors do not always put in their best effort on behalf of their firms. This, I suggest, has profound implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

This chapter reviews prior, so far inconclusive, research on the risk behavior of family firms. On the one hand, scholars assume risk-averse behavior of family firms based on agency theory and wealth concentration arguments. On the other hand, scholars predict that family firms are willing to take substantial financial risks to preserve their SEW. By integrating finance, management, and entrepreneurship literature, we show that different underlying definitions of "risk" are key for a better understanding of family firms' risk behavior and subsequent strategic decisions. We provide a conceptual model, highlight gaps in the existing literature, and propose fruitful areas for further research. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

We investigate if agency theory effectively explains agency conflict in the context of a developing country namely, Pakistan. Utilising data from 26 semi-structured interviews, we found that in Pakistan, there is no variation in risk preferences of principals (minority shareholders) and agents (majority shareholders). We also found that remuneration packages and board independence are not effective tools for governing owner managers in Pakistan. Thus, policy makers must shift their focus from soft internal governance mechanisms of appropriate remuneration and board independence. We propose for a rigorous external audit function, and appointment of independent directors and external audit firms by regulator. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd

CEO compensation in family firms is affected by certain corporate governance characteristics, such as the generational stage of the firm (founder or descendant-controlled firms), the level of family involvement on the board of directors (lone or multiple family members sitting on the board) and the family status of the CEO (family or professional CEO). In this paper, we argue that moderating effects arise among these dimensions of heterogeneity. The results show that in firms owned by descendants, the presence of multiple family members is beneficial in lowering family CEO compensation, while the opposite is true in the presence of the founder. Moreover, within founder and descendant firms, the number of family representatives on the board exerts a strong influence on the compensation of family CEOs, whereas it does not affect the compensation of professional CEOs. The results also show that in certain family clusters, CEO compensation is higher than in nonfamily firms, thereby emphasizing that when comparing CEO compensation in family and nonfamily firms, it is important to consider the intersections among the heterogeneity dimensions of the governance of family firms. The findings of the paper contribute to the literature on the governance of family firms by showing that certain family firm types are more effective than others in keeping CEO compensation under control.

Family involvement in corporate governance through ownership, management, and board membership presents a unique dilemma for understanding the strategic impetus and costs of entrenchment decisions. The presence of shared family ties and the family-centered goals of firm principals call to question the applicability of extant agency arguments regarding the nature and antecedents of managerial entrenchment. Exploring this, we develop and test a model of family firm-specific determinants (i.e., family ownership and family's involvement in management and governance) of entrenchment in publicly traded firms by drawing upon principal-principal agency theory. Findings of the empirical analysis of family owned S&P 500 firms suggest family firms are motivated to entrench managers when doing so supports the pursuit of family-centric goals. However, the extent to which entrenchment supports such goals varies at different levels of family ownership. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the doer effect of service failure (SF), good prior experience (GPE) and recovery on overall customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions for multi-agents in tourism service supply chain (TSSC). It specifically focuses on internal and external failure and recovery. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a 2x2x3 between-subjects experimental design with 12 diverse scenarios. It aims to examine the main effects of GPE and the interaction effects of SF and recovery on overall customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions. Findings: The main findings show that consumers do not show favorable behavioral outcomes when they have GPE with an affiliated party. Results of the experiments demonstrate that for hotels, there is no interaction effect between failure and recovery regarding overall customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions; however, for travel agencies, an interaction effect has been found. This indicates that an internal failure (by travel agency) should be recovered internally to increase the behavioral outcomes for travel agency. However, if there is an external failure (by hotel) then the essential thing is providing a recovery. Originality/value: Although the service literature covers failure and recovery in diverse contexts, these concepts are rarely studied from a multi-agent perspective in the service supply chain literature. In such a chain, a failure by a different party may remain unresolved, and this may create a positive effect on another party, if they provide recovery for the failure. This means that the doer of the failure and/or recovery (the party responsible from the failure and/or recovery) may have an impact on behavioral outcomes. However, previous literature has neglected to focus on the important issue of which entity/party performs the failure and/or recovery, and the effect on behavioral outcomes. By focusing on a principal-agent relationship in a TSSC, the study aims to address this research gap. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study illustrates how control-ownership wedge impacts the monitoring role of the corporate board through the quality of audit services in Turkey. Turkey has made essential amendments in the field of external audit in order to enhance the quality of the financial report and integrate its own capital market with that of the EU. It would be of interest to examine the influence of these changes on clients' demand for high quality audit. The agency theory is integrated with the resource dependence theory to show that boards possess distinct incentives and ability to demand high quality audit to monitor management activities. Logistic regression and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) were used for regression estimations. The results indicate that board demographics, cognitive and structural diversity of board of directors, audit committee characteristics and audit quality are complementary and control-ownership wedge weakens the relationship between them which is an unfavorable outcome for minority shareholders. Thus, this study proposes that regulators should increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance in Turkey to accommodate the unique features of wedge firms and provide a protected environment for minority shareholders.

This study investigates the relationship between agency costs and ownership structure for a sample of listed Italian companies to determine the impact of shareholder coalitions on agency costs. Using a balanced panel dataset of 1956 firm-year observations for the period 2002-2013, the results provide evidence that ownership concentration and debt play a limited role in monitoring agency costs, whereas the type of shareholder plays an important role in either mitigating or exacerbating agency costs. Family-controlled firms and coalitions among non-controlling shareholders seem helpful in reducing agency costs. The results suggest that coalitions among non-controlling shareholders both in family and non-family firms reduce agency costs. The findings also indicate that multiple blockholders play a key role as mediators. The paper provides a new perspective on assessing the role of agency costs in a bank-based, civil law country. The results enable one to better understand the impact of blockholders on agency costs and their interactions within family-controlled firms. The results also provide support for both the entrenchment effect and the alignment-of-interests hypothesis. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Agency theory suggests that CEOs view dividends unfavorably because dividend payouts deprive them of the free cash flow they could otherwise exploit. Using Bebchuk, Cremers, and Peyer's (2011) CEO pay slice (CPS) to measure CEO power, we find that an increase in CEO power by one standard deviation decreases the probability of paying dividends by 17.48%. For dividend-paying firms, a rise in CEO power by one standard deviation reduces the size of dividend payouts by 5.91%. Share repurchases, however, are not influenced by CEO power, although they too take away the free cash flow from the CEO. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study aims to identify the determinants of Malaysian corporate Sukuk rating and attempts to find out which determinant has the most significant impact. Design/methodology/approach: The framework tries to establish a relationship between firm's size, profitability, Sukuk guarantee status and types of Sukuk with Sukuk rating from the perspective of Agency Theory and Information Asymmetry Theory. The data consist of 43 Sukuk issuances from 2006 to 2015. Multinomial Logistic Regression Model is then used to find out the significant determinants of Sukuk rating. Findings: The study found that only three variables significantly impact Sukuk rating. The results show that a guaranteed Sukuk Ijarah or a guaranteed Sukuk Musyarakah that is issued by a highly profitable firm has a higher likelihood of getting rating AAA or rating AA as compared to getting rating A. A type of Sukuk, particularly Sukuk Murabahah, is the most significant variable influencing Sukuk rating. However, firm size is not a significant determinant of Sukuk rating in the context of this study. Research limitations implications: The first limitation of the study is the relatively small sample size. Second, the study only tested four independent variables. Practical implications: Several implications are derived from the results of the study. First, new firms that are planning to issue Sukuk should consistently maintain a high level of profit and consider issuing debt-based Sukuk to ensure that the issued Sukuk have higher rating. To increase the likelihood of getting higher rating, they should also consider providing a third-party guarantor. As for existing Sukuk issuers that are in lower rating category, they should increase their profitability to be upgraded to higher rating category. Second, risk-adverse investors should invest in highly profitable, guaranteed and debt-based Sukuk, as these Sukuk are likely to be in higher rating category and provide guarantee in terms of capital payments during liquidation or bankruptcy. Third, to reduce information asymmetry, policymakers should make it compulsory for all Sukuk issuers to have their Sukuk rated annually and make it mandatory for all rating agencies in Malaysia to publish their Sukuk rating methodologies. Originality/value: This paper helps to expand the limited existing literature about the determinants of Sukuk rating, particularly for the Malaysian corporate Sukuk.

This paper investigates how cash flow influences the levels of investment and dividends in the shipping industry. Using generalized least squares (GLS) regressions the study reports how free cash flow (FCF) of shipping firms of different sizes influence investment and dividends. Moreover, it shows the role of debt in financing investment. The paper finds that FCF is a determinant of investment and dividends. Greater FCF leads firms to increase investment and reduce dividends. The use of debt alleviates overinvestment. This paper illustrates how shipping firms allocate FCF. The paper verifies that the agency theory can explain behaviour of managers with respect to the investment strategy. (c) 2018 The Authors

Purpose: This study aims to identify the factors that lead non-financial companies listed in the UK to use an internal audit function (IAF) as a monitoring mechanism. Although the use of an IAF in the UK is voluntary, no prior research has examined the drivers for using one. Design/methodology/approach: Financial and non-financial data were collected from the annual reports of 332 UK non-financial companies listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) Main Market. Univariate tests and multivariate logistic regression tests were used to test the research hypotheses. A theoretical framework based on both agency theory and transaction cost economics (TCE) theory was used to explain the economic factors affecting the use of an IAF. Findings: The study provides evidence that firm size, level of internal risks, agency problem between owners and managers and existence of an effective audit committee are associated with the existence of an IAF. Thus, the need to have strong internal control and risk management systems and to reduce both internal and external agency costs drives companies to have an IAF. These results suggest the importance of IAF as an internal corporate governance tool and the effectiveness of UK governance regulations in monitoring the effectiveness of internal control systems. Practical implications: Given the importance of the IAF's corporate governance role, the study provides some policy implications. Regulators should pay more attention to the issue of maintaining an IAF, especially by large companies, the relationship between the IAF and other governance parties, especially the audit committee, and the disclosure of more relevant information about the IAF's characteristics and practices. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the factors affecting the existence of the IAF within the UK's distinctive regulatory approach of "comply or disclose reasons". Furthermore, it provides a theoretical framework that explains how both the agency theory and TCE theory can interpret the adoption of internal audit.

This article analyses the relationship between CEO succession events and German firms' internationalization processes, which is represented by the degree of internationalization (DOI) growth and internationalization rhythm. Based on a theoretical framework combining elements of agency theory, institutionalism and upper echelons approach, we propose a longitudinal model to examine the relationships of both process variables with the number of CEO changes and succession type (internal vs. external succession), respectively. The results of our study of 102 German firms over 23 years (1990-2012) show an inverted U-shaped impact (no impact) of the number of CEO changes (succession type) on the DOI growth and a positive (negative) monotonic effect on the rhythm of internationalization.

Purpose: This paper aims to assess the risk reporting practices extent to which firm's and corporate governance characteristics explain risk-related disclosures (RRD) motivations across two European Latin countries (Portugal and Spain). Moreover, drawn on elements of agency, legitimacy, resources-based perspectives and institutional theory, this study also intends to assess whether the influence of corporate governance mechanisms on risk reporting is mediated by strategic/institutional legitimacy interests. Design/methodology/approach: From a sample of 60 non-finance Portuguese and Spanish companies with securities traded on the Euronext Lisbon stock exchange market and on the Madrid stock exchange market, respectively, at December, 2011, the Corporate Governance reports and the "risk/risk management" sections of the Management reports included on consolidated annual reports for 2011 were manually content analysed, according to prior literature. Further, multiple linear regressions were used to assess the potential relationships between corporate governance mechanisms and risk reporting. The paper's theoretical framework draws on elements of agency, legitimacy, resources-based perspectives and institutional theory. To understand the risk reporting practices of Portuguese and Spanish non-finance listed companies, the paper conducts a content analysis of 60 consolidated annual reports for 2011. Findings: Results indicate that visible companies, operating in a country with a weaker legal environment, and during periods of financial distress disclose more discretionary RRD, basically to contextualize their negative outcomes. Some corporate governance mechanisms were crucial to improve risk information. Originality/value: The paper goes beyond prior literature work and assesses whether the theoretical framework grounded on agency, legitimacy, resources-based perspective and institutional theory is suitable in explaining RRD in an under-researched setting (European Latin countries, such as Portugal and Spain, with low agency costs and different corporate governance models). Moreover, the analysis embraces a wider and homogeneous range of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms and uses a period in which both countries were severely affected by a sovereign debt crisis with negative impacts on company's liquidity and financial risks. A research setting like this has not been studied hitherto. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Drawing from agency theory and the attention-based view of the firm, this study extends the understanding of the conditions under which CEO duality is negatively associated with board monitoring in a privately held firm context. Measuring monitoring in terms of board members' involvement in behavioral control, output control, and strategy control tasks (Huse), results show that CEO duality is significantly and negatively related only to the behavioral control task. In addition, we show that this negative effect is contingent on whether ownership is concentrated in the hands of a controlling shareholder as well as the type of controlling shareholder.

The managerial ownership and its impact on financial decisions such as cash holding, and capital structure have been the subject of debate of corporate governance literature. The main objective of this study is to investigate the impact managerial ownership places on financing and cash holding decisions. In addition to that, the currents study is also offering an interesting insight on the issue of simultaneity of financing and cash holding decisions and also will discuss that how the interdependence changes as the level of managerial ownership changes. This study examines the data of 60 companies listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange over the period from 2013 to 2017. To trace the endogeneity, we have employed the Wu Hausman test. It evident from the results that the p-value of both models is significant, which confirms the endogeneity between cash holdings and capital structure decisions. In both models, the managerial the leverage and cash holdings are in positive relation. The MO appears in a non-linear relationship with both cash holding and capital structure decisions of textile firms. The results of the study are also providing support to agency theory, pecking order theory and signaling theory. (c) 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.

Proxy advisors are information intermediaries that enable shareholders to exercise their voting rights. While proxy advisors' influence is documented in market-based corporate governance systems, we know little about the corporate governance role of proxy advice in relationship-based governance systems. Drawing on agency theory and the comparative corporate governance literature, we theorize that shareholders are sensitive to the costs and benefits of monitoring by considering internal monitoring capabilities. We also theorize that relative to market-based corporate governance systems, proxy advice is both less influential and has lower predictive quality in relationship-based governance systems. We test our multilevel model using 13,497 voting results from 613 firms in 16 Western European countries and generally find support for our predictions. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Family business owners and researchers tend to overwhelmingly focus on the top-level structure of firms but ignore the middle-level practice - involving family members in the middle-management team. Compared to top managers at the strategic apex, middle-level managers are mainly responsible for internal operations and control, and the composition of the middle-management team has an immediate and direct impact on the overall workforce efficiency of family firms. Integrating agency theory and organizational justice perspective, we proposed that family involvement in middle management would have a negative impact on the labor productivity of family firms. We further corroborated this effect by identifying three boundary conditions at the individual (i.e., familial CEO), organizational (i.e., firm size), and regional (i.e., labor mobility) levels. Using a sample of 1,284 privately owned family firms in China, we found that family involvement in middle management, measured as the percentage of familial middle-level managers, was negatively associated with labor productivity. Furthermore, this negative relationship existed only when the CEO is a family member rather than a professional manager, when the size of the firm is large rather than small, or when the firm is located in regions with low rather than high labor mobility. These findings contribute to family business literature and provide practical implications for human resource management in family firms.

Stewardship theory of corporate governance is a normative alternative to agency theory. This article argues that the stewardship behaviour of managers results in exemplary corporate governance practices when the espoused values of the firm are aligned with the enacted values. The case study method is used to prove this argument by studying corporate governance practices in a family-owned business group in India. The Murugappa Group is a 100-year-old family-owned business group, known for their ethical practices and currently managed by the fourth-generation family members, without undergoing any split. The espoused as well enacted values of the group are studied and corporate governance practices of the group firms analysed in this article. The article focuses on the governance structure of the group, its succession planning practices and the ownership structure. The analysis indicates that aligning the enacted values with the espoused value helped the group to adapt itself to the changing external economic environment and continue creating shareholder value, the essence of corporate governance.

Family business research typically views family firms using the frameworks developed for non-family businesses (e.g., agency theory, institutional theory). Thus, using an evolutionary perspective on family may help address gaps in the family business literature, particularly regarding deviance. In the current study, we use kin selection theory to predict that family members receive preferential treatment and this history of privileges can create entitlement and lead genetically-related employees to misuse company resources. Using an experimental vignette methodology and data from 161 people recruited from an online panel, we found that the participants' purported genetic relatedness to the owner of a business increased their theft intentions and decreased their expected severity of sanctions and likelihood of being reported. Biological sex moderated the relationships between genetic relatedness and theft intentions, as well as between expectations of punishment and theft intentions. Specifically, when females expected higher severity of sanctions or likelihood of whistleblowing, they were less likely to report theft intentions, compared to males. The results of this study suggest that family business owners should protect against theft by all employees, including genetic relatives. Future research using field samples would help provide context for these findings. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact that PhD scientists serving on the board of directors of firms conducting hard science have on the R&D-based innovative performance of the firm. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are built upon extant theory, and they are tested using two-stage least squared regression that control for the endogenous nature of board composition. Results are robust to alternative specifications. Findings: This analysis shows that firms with higher numbers of PhD scientists on the board generate superior innovative output and more efficient monitoring; PhD board members with denser professional networks are more valuable as board members. Practical implications: This paper provides practical advice to innovative firms on how to create a governance process that simultaneously improves monitoring and boosts the innovative performance. Originality/value: This study is the first one to suggest that innovative firms can improve R&D monitoring and boost innovative output at the same time, and the first to investigate the role that PhD scientists can serve on the board of firms engaging in hard science.

This article fills a technical-scientific gap that currently exists in the Brazilian literature on corporative fraud, by combining the theoretical framework of agency theory, of criminology, and of the economics of crime. In addition, it focuses on a sector that is usually excluded from analyses due to its specific characteristics and shows the application of multinomial logit panel data regression with random effects, which is rarely used in studies in the area of accounting. The aim of this study is to investigate the occurrence of corporative fraud, as well as cases of fraud in Brazilian banking institutions, by using detection variables related to the Cressey fraud triangle. Research into fraud and methods of detecting fraud has grown in management literature, especially affer the occurrence of various corporative scandals in the 1990s. Although regulatory agencies have increased their investments in monitoring and control, fraud investigations and convictions are still common in the day-to-day administration of banks, as can be seen in the Brazilian Central Bank and the National Financial System Resource Council's databases of punitive proceedings. We believe that this article will have a positive impact in the area of accounting sciences, since it involves corporative fraud in a multidisciplinary form and because it provides the incentive to use a quantitative tool that can help increase the development of similar studies in the area. This study tested the theory that the dimensions of the fraud triangle condition the occurrence of corporative fraud in Brazilian banking institutions. Thirtytwo representative variables of corporative fraud were identified in the theoretical-empirical review, which were reduced to seven latent variables by the principal component analysis. Finally, the seven factors formed the independent variables in the multinomial logit models used in the hypothesis tests, which presented promising results.

This study examines the effects of family firms on the corporate social performance of Korean firms and analyses how their effect varies depending on the presence of family CEOs or chaebols. Based on the agency theory, we find that family firms exhibit lower corporate social performance. In particular, there is no difference in the performance of related stakeholders, such as society, consumers, environment, and employees, compared to non-family firms, but corporate governance registers as low performance. We further find that family firms managed by family CEOs show lower corporate social performance, whereas chaebol firms show higher corporate social performance.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the relationship between board composition and firm corporate social responsibility (CSR) scores of the top 30 listed companies in Australia, France, UK and USA. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 120 publicly listed companies covering a 10-year period from 2006 to 2015, the authors examine this relationship in a dynamic modelling framework, which controls for potential sources of endogeneity. Findings: The authors find that board composition appears to have no effect on large firms' CSR scores. This finding remains robust when they used out-of-sample analysis and is consistent with the perspectives of agency theory stakeholder theory and institutional theory. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it fills an important gap in literature on CSR and corporate governance, as less is known about how board composition affects social activities. Second, this study controls endogeneity and sample selection bias which are main econometric problems in CG and CSR studies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper examined the role of Shariah supervisory board (SSB) on internal Shariah audit effectiveness in Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) in Bahrain. The study employed two stages of data collection and analysis: review of the literature and structured interview with SSB and Head of internal Shariah audit departments deemed important within the IFIs, to examine the role of SSB on internal Shariah audit effectiveness. The paper concluded that Islamic agency theory could serve as a theoretical foundation to build the conceptual framework on internal Shariah audit effectiveness. In the light of the theory, it was proposed that internal Shariah audit effectiveness could be enhanced by their SSB, independence and experience. Due to the position of SSB as the ultimate oversight organ in the IFIs, the SSB could influence on internal Shariah audit effectiveness in IFIs. The research perspective, this is the first study using Islamic agency theory to examines the role of SSB on internal Shariah audit effectiveness in IFIs in Bahrain.

For decades, the economic theory of the firm referred to as agency theory has dominated business research and education in the United States. Although agency theory has been influential in accounting, finance, and managerial economics, it lacks informal and nonfinancial controls. Douglas E. Stevens resolves to enhance this theory through the incorporation of social norms. Drawing on historical context related to the firm, the theory of the firm, and social norm theory related to the firm, he demonstrates the importance of social norms in the formation and development of free-market capitalism and the firm. He also describes the latest theoretical, experimental, and archival evidence to exhibit the growing body of research that incorporates social norms into the theory of the firm. These foundations enable Stevens to create a comprehensive roadmap of agency theory that will have strong implications for practice and public policy. (c) Douglas E. Stevens 2019.

Design/methodology/approach: The study utilises a conceptual theory development approach. In doing so, it utilises key tenets of agency theory that are applied in a multi-principal-supplier relationship context and synthesised in a series of propositions. Findings: The study shows that MNCs have a variety of mechanisms for reducing the risk of suppliers' non-compliance by decreasing information asymmetry, increasing their bargaining power and simultaneously use of both rewards/sanctions, and reputation-based safeguards. Research limitations/implications: This is a conceptual theory development study, offering testable propositions, which have then to be empirically validated. Practical implications: The study showcases that managers of MNCs who find themselves in relationships with non-compliant suppliers have at their disposal a variety of mechanisms to reduce the risk of suppliers' non-compliance. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies that explore suppliers' non-compliance with codes-of-conduct at the level of a relationship, rather than a single firm. In this way it proposes a theoretical framework grounded in agency theory on managing relationships between multi-principal collaborators and their suppliers. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates the relationship between franchising proportion of a network and firm failure. Drawing from resource scarcity and agency theories, we show that franchising firms that overfranchise and do not structure their networks in congruence with these two theories have lower survival prospects. We test our arguments with extensive data from nearly 5000 franchising firms listed in Entrepreneur magazine. The findings suggest that franchising proportion has a U-shape relationship with network failure. Additional analysis shows that firm size and geographic scope moderate the relationship between the squared term of franchising proportion and network failure. For franchisors, our results highlight the importance of maintaining an appropriate mix of franchised and firm-owned outlets within a network. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Grounded in agency theory, this article investigates the effect of board independence on managerial ownership. We exploit the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the associated exchange listing requirements as an exogenous regulatory shock that raises board independence. Our difference-in-difference estimates show that board independence leads to significantly higher managerial ownership. In particular, firms forced to raise board independence exhibit managerial ownership that is 26.35% higher, relative to firms not required to raise board independence. Thus, board independence and managerial equity ownership constitute governance mechanisms that act as complements, rather than substitutes. Our empirical strategy relies on a quasi-natural experiment and is far more likely to show a causal effect than what has been documented in the literature. Finally, an instrumental-variable analysis reinforces our conclusion. (c) 2017, Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of board attributes on Sukuk rating in firms listed in Bursa Malaysia (Malaysian Stock Exchange) during the period of 2008 to 2013. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses ordinal logit regression model to examine the influence of board attributes (CEO-chairman duality, board size and board independence) on the dependent variable (RATING). Findings: The findings of this paper generally support the agency theory and stakeholder theory. Results show that after controlling for firm characteristics, the Sukuk rating is positively associated with CEO-chairman duality, board size and board independence; and negatively correlated with leverage while positively related to profitability and size. The findings of this study also provide evidence that having two positions in an organization as CEO and chairman could have added higher responsibility towards making corporate decisions and provide better Sukuk rating performance. In addition, findings show that the larger the board size, the better Sukuk rating. Also, higher board independence enjoys higher rating. Research limitations/implications: This study was limited to the investigation of the relationship between board attributes (CEO duality, board size and board independence) on Sukuk ratings using aggregate data from 2008 to 2013 among Malaysian Sukuk issuers. Practical implications: The findings of this paper describe the impact of board attributes on Sukuk rating in Malaysian Sukuk market which in turn gives the useful insights to many of the actors in the markets such as issuers, investors and policymakers which can be relied upon in making strategic decisions to issue and invest in Islamic bonds in Malaysian market. In addition, the findings could prove to be useful also for regulators because they are responsible for the acceptable level of corporate governance standards. Originality/value: This study contributes to the body of knowledge by focusing heavily on enhancing Sukuk ratings by reducing conflict between managers and Sukuk holders in Malaysia. Additionally, this study benefits from the agency theory and stakeholder theory to provide evidence on the effect of board attributes on Sukuk rating. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We study the organizational impact of internal control systems, by examining 1,593 firms with 15,606 executives over 2002-2010. We find that internal control systems explain a significant amount of executive and, in particular, CFO compensation, after controlling for other governance, executive personal characteristics, firm, and macroeconomic determinants of pay. Moreover, the negative relationship between pay and internal control systems suggests that executives operating in firms with ineffective internal control systems earn greater compensation. The results of the longitudinal analysis suggest that firms with ineffective internal control systems have greater agency problems and, consequently, greater levels of executive compensation. The CEO pay shows a nonsignificant relationship with internal control systems. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

This study established a broad theoretical framework combining agency theory and resource and capacity theory. We sought evidence of these theories' implications for corporate entrepreneurship (CE) and an understanding of how corporate entrepreneurship affects performance. To identify relationships between these theories and concepts, we designed a research model and tested it using data from a questionnaire to 114 multinational firms. Findings provide general support for this theory, indicating that CE is positively associated with principal management-based incentives and capabilities on performance.

Purpose: Based on agency theory, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants on the dissemination level of corporate governance disclosure (CGD). Design/methodology/approach: The sample of the study incorporates listed companies in Nifty 500 Index for the period 2009-2014. The Governance Disclosure Score calculated by Bloomberg is used as a proxy for the dissemination level of corporate governance information. In total, eight explanatory variables are uses, namely, board's size, number of board meetings, CEO duality, presence of women on the board, company's size, financial performance, Tobin's Q ratio and financial leverage. Findings: The results of study suggest a need for improvement in CGDs by Indian companies, as they fail to comply the majority of the proposed disclosure items. Furthermore, it is revealed that the number of board director, the value of company, the financial leverage and the presence of women affect negatively the dissemination level of corporate governance information. While, the size of company is the only determinant that positively affects the extent of CGD. Practical implications: The results are valuable because they reveal the attributes that determines which companies needs less or extra monitoring by shareholders and investors regarding the applied corporate governance practices. In addition, the study can be valuable to policy makers responsible for the regulation of company's accountability in relation to corporate governance practices. Originality/value: The study extents previous studies by incorporating for the first time Bloomberg's rating approach regarding the dissemination level of CGD in Indian context.

Background: The executive directors of a company are the agents of the shareholders and should manage the company in the best interest of the shareholders, not only for personal gain. It is therefore important for companies to ensure that they implement remuneration policies which will result in motivated employees who will execute decisions and actions which are in the best interest of the shareholders. However, it is widely acknowledged that the relationship between company performance and executive remuneration is weak. This implies that executives are still rewarded excessive remuneration regardless of the performance of their companies. Aim: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a relationship exists between the performance-based remuneration of executive directors and the financial performance of South African companies. Setting: The study was conducted in South Africa, specifically on companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Methods: The study design was quantitative and made use of a Pearson correlation and generalised least squares regression with bootstrapping at a 95% confidence interval to analyse the relationship between executive director remuneration and the financial performance of 42 companies in the consumer goods and services industry of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) from 2006 to 2015. Results: The study established that the remuneration policies in place for South African executive directors within the consumer goods and services industry seem to be affected by the share price of the company. Conclusion: In the South African environment, executive director remuneration is thus not directly related to profitability or company size, as was the case in some earlier studies. The link between executive director remuneration and share performance may be an indication that remuneration policies are based on the share price and are thus directly connected to the principle of shareholder wealth maximisation.

This paper investigates the influence of corporate governance on the performance of modern Chinese firms. Prior studies were inconclusive about the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. Little research investigates the performance implications of board structure in the post-institutional-transition era in China. Based on agency and resource dependence theories, this paper examines the impacts of board composition and leadership structure on the performance of Chinese manufacturing firms that went public on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges in 2010. The findings show that separating the posts of CEO and chair promotes better performance. However, appointing a larger proportion of outside independent directors to the board insignificantly affects performance. This research provides partial support for agency theory and extended insights into corporate governance in emerging economy firms. Copyright (c) 2017 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper argues that stakeholder relationships in volunteer tourism represent principal-agent relationships. Using principal-agent (P-A) theory as a theoretical lens, this paper highlights types of relationships between host communities and volunteer tourism organisations most conducive for effective host community participation in the monitoring and evaluation of volunteer tourism programmes. Based on a survey of 80 organisations, followed by qualitative interviews with representatives from 29 organisations, the research concludes that 'flipping' or reversing the conventional P-A model opens up a new perspective on principal-agent relationships in volunteer tourism. This in turn highlights opportunities for facilitating more effective host community participation in monitoring and evaluation which is seen as an essential element to the sustainability of volunteer tourism.

The study aims to evaluate the relation between ownership structure and firm performance; the sample included 171 firms from all the sectors in (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) KSA for two years, 2013-2014. Two dimensions of ownership structure were studied, concentration and identity of owner, which was subdivided into foreign, managerial, family and institutional ownership. One major financial tool was used to measure firm performance: return on assets (ROA). The study evaluated this relation using several control variables which are: firm size, firm age, financial leverage and industry sector. Ownership concentration was found to have a positive, statistically insignificant effect on company performance. Institutional ownership was found to have a positive effect on company performance. Managerial ownership did not have a significant effect on company performance; however, managerial ownership had a positive effect on performance. Foreign ownership was found to have a negative, statistically significant effect on firm performance, and family ownership was found to have a positive and statistically insignificant effect on firm performance. Other results were revealed by the study regarding company age, size, leverage and sector. The study contributes to the debate about agency theory and the separation that exists between shareholders and management. The study may benefit many interested groups in the KSA and other countries in making business decisions concerning this topic and other related decisions.

The objective of this study is to examine the effect of controlling shareholders' monitoring on firm performance through the implementation of operational efficiency commitment to environmental friendliness. Non-financial firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and joining the Environmental Performance Assessment Program (PROPER) are determined as the sample. Results indicate that controlling shareholders have a positive impact on operational efficiency commitment to environmental friendliness and also on firm performance. In addition, other key findings indicate that the controlling shareholders can improve firm performance through the implementation of operational efficiency commitment to environmental friendliness. The results of this study support the position of the agency theory, the stakeholder theory, and the legitimacy theory. Operational efficiency commitment to environmental friendliness is then suggested to be a meaningful strategy for the firms to obtain sustainable performance. (c) 2018 Vilnius University.

This article develops theory about an agency problem affecting the strategic human capital (SHC) of the firm. It proposes three categories of SHC-related choices managers must make that imply a trade-off between near- and long-term performance. Dispersed shareholding, firm coverage by securities analysts, and their practice of publishing quarterly earnings forecasts are argued to entail a bias in management incentives, shifting the balance in this trade-off toward near-term performance. To restore the balance, securities analysts would need to distinguish transitory from recurring effects of SHC-related choices in their valuation models (e.g., treating certain labor cost savings during cyclical downturns as transitory). Restoring the balance would also require them to anticipate long-term effects in their long-term earnings forecasts (e.g., long-term positive effects of retaining employees with valuable skills during cyclical downturns). The article discusses specific transitory cost effects and long-term effects they could potentially take into account. The skills and incentives needed by analysts to account for such effects are argued to vary across firm segments. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Scholars and shareholder activists have raised concerns about directors serving on multiple boards simultaneously. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 experienced diverse South African directors to investigate the causes and consequences of overboardedness. Interviewees identified the limited talent pool and board diversity targets as the main causes of overboardedness (or interlocking as it is also called). In line with the busyness hypothesis, poor meeting attendance by overboarded directors was highlighted by some participants. However, others claimed that director interlocking could offer invaluable access to social networks and resources, lending support to the experience hypothesis. Director busyness should hence be considered on a case-by-case basis. (c) 2018, The Author(s).

Background: There is a growing need for hospital supervisory boards to support hospital management in different areas, including (financial) monitoring, resource provision, stakeholder relationships, and strategic decision-making. Little is currently known about how boards' emphases on these various governance objectives contribute to performance. Purpose: Using a dominant logics perspective, this article aims to detect the governance logics that hospital boards emphasize, to determine whether there are distinct clusters of hospitals with the same sets of emphases, and to show how cluster membership relates to board characteristics and financial performance. Methodology: Using factor analysis, we identify latent classes of governance objectives and use hierarchical cluster analysis to detect distinct clusters with varying emphasis on the classes. We then use multinomial regression to explore the associations between cluster membership and board characteristics (size, gender diversity, and occupational diversity) and examine the associations between clusters and financial performance using OLS regression. Results: Classes of objectives reflecting three governance theories - agency theory, stewardship theory, and stakeholder theory - can be distinguished, and hospitals can be divided into four clusters based on their board's relative emphasis on the classes. Cluster membership is significantly associated with board characteristics. There is also a significant association between cluster membership and hospital financial performance, with two of three groups performing significantly better than the reference group. Conclusion: High performance in hospitals can be the result of governance logics, which, compared to simple board characteristics, are associated with better financial outcomes. Practice implications: Hospitals can influence the emphasis placed on different governance objectives and enhance organizational success by creating boards that are small enough to be effective yet diverse enough to profit from a wide variety of expertise and experience.

In a study of life science firms, we find that, in accordance with predictions drawn from agency theory and behavioral agency theory, CEO stock ownership is negatively associated with licensing while CEO stock options are positively associated with licensing. Furthermore, by combining theoretical insights from the capabilities literature with both agency theory and behavioral agency theory, we predict that a key measure of capabilities in the licensing context--a firm's alliance experience--significantly influences the ways in which CEO equity incentives impact licensing. More specifically, we find that, in accordance with our theoretical predictions, alliance experience positively (negatively) moderates the relationship between CEO stock ownership (CEO stock options) and licensing. Our study contributes to the wider literature on the determinants of licensing by examining whether licensing is sensitive to CEO equity incentives. We also extend the capabilities literature on licensing by examining the contrasting influences of a firm's alliance experience on the relationship between CEO equity incentives and licensing. Our findings also inform behavioral agency-based research on the effects of equity incentives by highlighting the usefulness of a capabilities perspective in augmenting our understanding of the behavioral role of CEO equity incentives.

Knowledge has become a key strategic resource for business success and has led companies to be concerned about managing their knowledge assets (intellectual capital). However, accounting as an information system has suffered a loss of reliability of the information provided, by showing that the market value of companies is higher than the book value shown in the balance sheets. This discrepancy has been one of the main reasons why companies voluntarily manage and disclose their intellectual capital. Relying on the agency theory and the resources and capabilities theory, this paper analyses the influence of corporate governance in the management of information intellectual capital. The methodology used was based on content analysis of annual reports using a analysis multivariate linear regression.

Purpose: Based on the findings of Aguinis et al. (2018) that only a few executives are properly compensated, the purpose of this paper is to examine potential causes and consequences of CEO overpayment and underpayment. Ineffective compensation of the CEO represents a governance failure by the board of directors. Better understanding the reasons for such failures may help boards to correct their processes and to enact more effective governance. Boards must look beyond the normally constrained focus of agency theory to examine executive characteristics and motivation. Thus, tailoring compensation plans and governance to the executive and organizational context requires attention to a broader set of theoretical notions. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Aguinis et al. (2018) work, this paper conceptually identifies and explains the causes and consequences of CEO overpayment and underpayment along with their implications for governance and future research. Findings: This paper identifies potential reasons for CEO overpayment and underpayment. For example, in addition to poor hiring decisions and inadequately designed compensation plans, CEO overpayment can occur because of executive hubris and greed. Alternatively, CEO underpayment may occur because of a poorly designed plan, inadequate information about the external labor market and the executive's interests in non-pecuniary benefits (e.g. socio-emotional wealth, altruism). Without proper monitoring and oversight by the board, firm performance commonly suffers. Originality/value: This work extends our understanding of why CEOs may be overpaid (e.g. hubris, greed) and why some executives may accept underpayment (e.g. desire for non-pecuniary benefits from SEW or altruism). This paper explains the consequences of ineffective corporate governance practices that allow inefficient CEO compensation. Finally, this paper explores several contingencies that can affect the governance practices and research needed to enhance our knowledge of this important area. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance for firms listed in the Jordanian stock exchange. The ownership concentration and owner's identity which includes block holders, family ownership, institutional ownership and managerial ownership are taken as independent variables in our study. Whereas, Tobin's Q, Return on Asset (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) are used as dependent variables. Pooled ordinary least square is used to test the hypothesis. The findings of the study have shown a great deal of agreement with agency theory. Results further revealed that Jordanian firms were following concentrated ownership, mostly family-based. The findings of this study have implications for researchers and policymakers in advancing the existing body of knowledge and formulating corporate policies.

Entrepreneurship research tends to focus on individuals and their actions. However, some entrepreneurial activities are borne and maintained through the efforts of several parties in entrepreneurial partnerships such as franchisor-franchisee relationships. Due to their very nature, these partnerships include economic and social exchanges. Such exchanges received limited attention in entrepreneurship literature. To address this omission, this study first delves into the theories of economic and social exchange to illuminate their relevance for entrepreneurial partnerships. Next, this paper puts forward an agenda for future research agenda based on the tenets of interdependent reciprocal exchange in entrepreneurial partnerships. This research effort has a potential to spur future studies on the use reciprocity in other areas of entrepreneurship such as social entrepreneurship and international entrepreneurship.

The use of volunteer tour guides by commercial tour operators has attracted little scholarly attention. This paper presents a qualitative case study of a commercially organized tour led by volunteer tour guides, and explores how the guides' status as volunteers shaped experiences of tour customers. Analysis, underpinned by stakeholder-agency theory, highlighted a range of service delivery issues that emerged during the tour. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed, with particular reference to how tour operators might negotiate the vexed issue of managing service delivery quality in the context of tour services paid for by customers, yet delivered by volunteers. Further research is required to explore potential differences in the willingness of tour operators to invest in human resource development initiatives for paid versus volunteer tour guides, along with possible flow-on implications for tour guides' role performance and customer satisfaction.

Public services have been subjected to processes of deregulation, competition, and privatization in many countries worldwide. One popular reform has involved focusing on competitive procurement. This context, where public and private organizations jointly deliver the service in a dyad, makes the market orientation of public services highly complex. The main elements of market orientation-intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination and responsiveness- have shown themselves to be valid and of significance in both the private and public sectors. Nevertheless, the empirical context of the public sector involves a complexity that has been poorly addressed in market orientation research. In this study, we research the Swedish public transport industry and survey buyer and provider organizations in order to determine how market-orientated activities are approached in public-private service dyads. We present three theoretically-underpinned relationship types - buyer dominated, provider dominated and collaborative - which we suggest as having implications for market-oriented activities. A survey of public transport authorities' (buyers, n = 48) and operators' (providers, n = 49) market orientation activities reveals the concurrent prevalence of characteristics from all three relationship types, as both parties try to dominate the relationship while also engaging in collaborative efforts. Drawing on our theoretical framework and our empirical results, we conclude that there are legitimate differences in the perspectives of buyers and providers, and that these differences, if acknowledged and properly managed, can provide valuable resources in the development of a joint market orientation in complex public-private settings.

Manuscript type: Review paper Research aims: This paper offers Southeast Asian researchers, particularly those from ASEAN, a vision to contribute to international agency theory literature. Design/Methodology/Approach: Most of the studies reviewed were identified during the author's preparation for this paper which involves Malaysia. Research findings: Three research streams to which Malaysian researchers can contribute are: political connections, family companies and corporate recovery. The socio-political contexts that have resulted in Malaysia being a suitable environment are also discussed. This paper identifies gaps in the literature; it accumulates arguments defining why the Malaysian setting is apposite and it also offers research design suggestions for Malaysians and researchers from Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, with some defining differences, to follow. Theoretical contributions/Originality: The outcome drawn from this paper assists Malaysian researchers in utilising the agency based theory to approach various topic selections and executions. The comparisons and contrasts made between Malaysia and the other three ASEAN countries may further motivate researchers of the ASEAN region to engage agency theory as a base for their research. Research limitation: A limitation to this paper is that the boundaries between the proposed categories of shareholder political connections are blurred. (c) 2018, University of Malaya.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) exhibit a wide variety of ownership structures but most are entrepreneurially controlled by founders or families. We investigate the relation between REIT ownership/control and REIT valuation. Using proxy data from 1994 through 2007, our analysis shows that, consistent with the incentive alignment prediction of agency theory, founder/family REITs, on average, have a higher valuation than non-founder/ non-family REITs. This result is driven by first-generation family and lone-founder REITs. Our results are also consistent with the entrenchment prediction of agency theory: limits on private benefits of control could lead to higher REIT valuation when founders/families do not occupy both board chairman and CEO positions.

Relying on two years' observations of 74 United Arab Emirates (UAE) listed firms, we examined the association between governance mechanisms (board size, audit committee, percentage of independent non-executive directors, external auditor, firm leverage and product market competition) and agency costs while controlling for firm size and industry type. We also utilised four different proxies to measure agency costs (asset utilisation, audit fees, expenses ratio and free cash flow measures) to test whether the effect of product market competition on agency costs is substitutive or complementary to internal governance mechanisms. The results show that the percentage of independent non-executive directors and type of external audit significantly influence proxies of agency costs when product market competition is factored out. However, this effect disappears when regressions include product market competition, suggesting that the competitive position of a firm has a substitutive effect to internal governance mechanisms.

Based on agency theory, this study investigates the consequences of carbon disclosure by non-greenhouse gas registered Australian companies on information asymmetry measures over a period after the introduction of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 and before the introduction of the Australian carbon tax. The level of carbon disclosure is scored through the content analysis of the annual reports. The findings support that carbon disclosure is negatively related to information asymmetry measures: the bid-ask spread and stock return volatility, in the year following disclosure. Overall, the research results are consistent with predictions of the agency theory and indicate that companies bear the extra voluntary reporting costs to achieve the perceived benefits of disclosure. The findings should be useful for corporate and stakeholders who are concerned about the value relevance of carbon disclosure in financial markets. For accounting standard setters, it highlights the urgency of carbon reporting guidelines. Copyright (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the impact of ownership structure on firm valuation and performance across different geographical regions within mainland China. Design/methodology/approach: The authors classify China in six geographical regions and use cross-sectional data of companies with A-shares listed on domestic stock exchanges in China for the year-end 2015. Using data from CSMAR and Wind database, they use multivariate regression technique and analytically compare the consistency of relationship between operational variables of ownership structure with corporate performance and evaluation. Findings: The authors find that institutional ownership and state ownership negatively affect market valuation throughout various geographical regions of China. Further, in East, Northwest, South Central and Southwestern parts of China, managerial ownership and concentration of shareholding among top ten shareholders positively influence return on equity (ROE). Interestingly, institutional shareholding negatively affects return on assets (ROA), while institutional ownership has a neutral effect on profitability margin in Northeast China. Although in northern part of China, this relationship is slightly positive. In East China region, state ownership and ownership concentration are directly proportional to profitability margin. Practical implications: As some of the findings exhibit weak state of market efficiency in some regions, the study may also be useful in identifying arbitrage opportunities across different regions. Moreover, this study suggests that regions with the same business environment and conditions anywhere around the globe invite same or similar ownership structure for better firm performance and valuation. Originality/value: The study provides unique understanding of relationship between ownership structure, market valuation and firm performance in various parts of China and will be an addition to the relevant literature. Given a change in company's ownership structure and considering its region of incorporation, this study will help investment analysts in assessing performance and market valuation of the firm. It will also assist several classes of investors, financial institutions and international businesses in making their investment decisions. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Boards sometimes cut a CEO's pay following poor performance. This study examines whether such CEO paycuts really work. We identify 1,496 instances of large CEO paycuts during the period 1994-2013. We then create a propensity-score-matched control group of firms that did not cut their CEOs' pay and employ a difference-in-differences approach to examine the consequences of paycuts. Our results show that, following a paycut, CEOs are likely to engage in earnings management in an attempt to accelerate improvement in the reported performance and to achieve a speedier restoration of their pay to pre-cut levels. Further, we find that improvement in long-term performance after a paycut occurs only for those firms with lower levels of earnings management after the paycut. Finally, we show that paycuts are more likely to lead to unintended value-destroying consequences in the absence of high institutional ownership or when the CEO is sufficiently entrenched, thereby impairing the effectiveness of internal monitoring by boards.

Drawing upon the resource-based view and agency theory, this study examines the effects of human resource management and the innovative capabilities of nonfamily members on the performance of family businesses. The results show that training and innovative capabilities influence performance, while strategic planning strengthens the relationship between human resource policies and performance. Moreover, family businesses with weak governance practices can initially benefit from innovation, but they must enhance their governance to sustain growth in performance. Family businesses should focus on the selection and training of nonfamily members to increase their innovative capabilities and enhance their performance. (c) 2018, (c) 2018 Taylor & Francis.

Debt-ridden corporate growth and increased vulnerability was one of the causes of the 1997 financial crisis in Korea. Introduction of the outside director system has been the core part of the board reforms following the crisis. Our estimation using instruments obtained from a natural experiment illustrates that outside monitoring has (i) improved capital structure of firms even when we control for the leverage regulation effect, (ii) enhanced compliance with leverage regulation and thus reduced business risks, and (iii) reduced excessive growth and excessive investment more consistently for the top 10 largest chaebols than non-chaebol firms and smaller sized chaebol affiliates. Our results shed some light on why existing studies report the positive effect of outsiders on firm value and add value to existing agency theory by illustrating that the effect of improved governance on capital structure could be non-linear.

This article aims at studying the influence of boardroom attributes on access to leverage in the French context. The empirical findings lead to several interesting results. They reveal a negative relation between the number of female directors on the board and the total and long-term leverage ratios. Due likely to the risk aversion of women, firms with more gender-diverse boards appear to use less levels of debt. This is consistent with the pecking order theory. The results also show that the size of the board, the frequency of its meetings and the average age of its independent directors positively affect the leverage ratios. They are coherent with the disciplinary role of the board stipulated by the agency theory. (c) 2018.

The chief information officer (CIO) is responsible for bridging the gap between two critical domains--technology and business, making the CIO's job uniquely different from other executives. As digital technologies become increasingly important to firms' competitive success, boards of directors and senior executives seek to align the CIO role with overall firm's objectives. Agency theory suggests that one way to create the alignment between an executive's efforts and firm performance is to implement appropriate equity compensation incentives (i.e., those resulting from stock and stock options) tying the executive's wealth to firm value. To date, research does not address what factors a firm should consider when designing CIO incentives and how these incentives influence firm performance. To address this major gap, we examine both the antecedents and performance consequences of CIO equity incentives. We assess organizational, environmental, and individual factors that influence CIO equity incentives and find that environmental and organizational factors are more important than individual CIO characteristics in the determination of CIO equity incentives. We also find that firms that create higher CIO equity incentives realize greater subsequent accounting and market performance. Our research contributes to the IT personnel literature by showing how firms can use compensation policies to leverage the CIO role to enhance overall business performance. (c) 2018

In the aftermath of the 2006 and 2014 Thai coups, observers declared the resurrection of the bureaucratic polity. Bureaucrats, though, remained influential even during the period of 1992-2006, when elected politicians were thought to command the Thai state. Bureaucratic involvement in politics poses a challenge for dominant political science theories of politician-bureaucrat relationships, which draw heavily from principal-agent frameworks. I apply agency theory to Thailand, testing three different hypotheses derived from the theory. Examining legislative productivity and control over bureaucratic career trajectories, I find that elected politicians increasingly acted as principals of the Thai state from 1992 through 2006, and to a lesser degree from 2008 to 2013. Thai bureaucrats, though, have frequently engaged in the political sphere, blunting political oversight and expanding their independence vis-a-vis politicians. This suggests that the principal-agent model overlooks the range of resources that bureaucracies can bring to bear in developing countries, granting them greater autonomy than anticipated. As such, theories of the politician-bureaucrat relationship in developing states need to better account for the mechanisms through which bureaucrats exercise policy discretion and political influence.

Prior agency-theory research has presented conflicting findings regarding the importance of board monitoring in motivating R&D. We reinvestigate this literature by examining the value monitoring exerts in abating both the agency costs of underinvestment and overinvestment in R&D. We argue that monitoring that relies on board independence has both benefits and costs associated with promoting R&D. While we assert that intense monitoring by the board heightens underinvestment in the US context, it can also provide discipline over a firms free cash flows. We test our theory using a longitudinal panel data set consisting of a cross-section of S&P 1500 US-firms between 1997 and 2007. On average our study finds inside directors increase overinvestment in R&D, but facilitate better resource allocation when a firm has rich growth opportunities. Also, while too much emphasis on outside directors heightens underinvestment in R&D, a more independent board encourages better resource allocation when firms have high free cash flows that need to be paid back to owners. Thus, our results suggest a more inclusive perspective of agency-theory can help managers make better R&D investment decisions. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This article empirically examines the occurrence of price-oriented maverick buying (MB) during supplier selection, in a direct purchasing process context. Drawing on agency theory, maverick buying, and total cost of ownership (TCO) literature, the statistically significant existence of price-oriented MB is investigated and the purchasing manager (PM)-related factors that influence such noncompliant behavior are determined. A discrete choice experiment is designed to simulate a TCO-based supplier selection process in which an established purchasing framework agreement stipulates PMs not necessarily be price-oriented (i.e., select suppliers primarily based on lowest price), and then models PM choice behavior in the supplier selection process (SSP), utilizing a conditional logit model (CLM) to determine PM compliance to the established purchasing framework agreement and identify if price-oriented MB exists. Statistical tests utilizing comprehensive primary and secondary data are then conducted to determine if correlational relationships exist between PM-related factors and PM price-orientation. Results indicate that three PM-related factors bear a significant correlational relationship to PM price-orientation. (c) 2016 Decision Sciences Institute

Drawing upon preceding empirical studies on the potential endogeneity of both debt and dividends in developed markets, this study investigates two-way causal relationships that can exist between payout decisions and debt policies in Malaysian listed companies. The analysis is performed by applying a simultaneous equations model (SEM) on a sample of 267 listed firms on the Main board of Bursa Malaysia during 2006-2014. The main findings indicate that when dividend is treated as endogenous, there is a positive impact on leverage. However, leverage is found to have a simultaneous negative impact on dividends. The findings also show that liquidity and performance positively affect dividends, although they have a negative effect on leverage. Additionally, this study documents an inverse relation between tangibility and debt, a direct relation between reputation and debt, and also confirms that larger firms tend to pay out a higher percentage of dividends per share.

Flexibility is often defined in terms of autonomy of actions, freedom of expression, balancing in competing opposites and agility in actions. Such flexibility assumes greater significance in the dynamic system in which business operates. In this mutually reinforcing system, Indian regulators have accorded flexibility to companies to decide the nature, type, tone and time orientation of risk disclosures (in annual reports) based on their competitive position. Accordingly, the paper strives to ascertain how this regulatory flexibility is leveraged by Indian companies. For the purpose, content analysis and textual analysis are employed on over 4000 annual reports of NIFTY500 companies, covering a period 10-year period from 2005 to 2015. In tune with agency theory, proprietary cost theory, duality theory and contingency theory, the findings indicate that companies that are in a better competitive position tend to make greater and more comprehensive risk disclosures. The results are robust at company level, industry level and sectoral level. Further, the results unambiguously reflect how this flexibility affected the strategic decision making during the time of global financial crisis. Amidst calls for increasing regulations, particularly in the domain of disclosures, these findings clearly highlight the need for regulatory flexibility in decisions that have strategic implications for firms.

Our study investigates whether agency costs arising from organizational structure in terms of the number of investment layers which connect the parent firm and its lowest-tiered subsidiaries within the corporate pyramid are associated with the value of cash holdings. Using a sample of Taiwanese publicly traded firms, we find that a change of a dollar in cash holdings is associated with less than a dollar change in market value. In line with our expectation, we find that the marginal value of cash decreases with the number of investment layers, supporting the agency theory of excess cash holdings. We also find that the negative association between the number of layers and the value of cash holdings is stronger for firms with high deviation between cash flow and voting rights and for family-controlled firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether real estate companies manipulate their earnings through the brokerage fee across ownership expropriation or not. Design/methodology/approach: This study considers Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange listed real estate firms to investigate how the brokerage fee in the real estate industry might affect the earnings management of firms across its ownership expropriation. Using annual report data, the authors investigate the associations over a panel for the period 2008-2012. Robust panel regression is used to divulge the probability values with reference by probit regression. Findings: Overall, the results show that high brokerage fees would drive more events of earnings management and that, generally, the ownership concentration among Malaysian real estate firms significantly affects the earnings management of the firms. Practical implications: This study shows that firm profitability and brokerage fees enhance the probability of firm's earnings management. A low brokerage fee would reflect low revenue to the company. Therefore, management would opt to manipulate earnings in order to overstate earnings, which garners more interest from investors. Originality/value: Real estate values in Malaysia have climbed steadily over the years due to a combination of reasons giving companies a higher brokerage fee. Earnings management has become a big issue for property investors. The study demonstrates the relationship between earnings management and brokerage fee across ownership expropriation which can be considered by shareholders in their own strategic planning and investors in their own investing.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between monitoring mechanisms namely, board and audit committee effectiveness, foreign and domestic institutional ownership and competition with voluntary disclosure of intellectual capital (IC) among listed banks in the Gulf Co-Operation Council (GCC) region. The content analysis was used to analyse IC disclosures of 137 listed GCC banks. A regression model is utilized to analyze the data. The results suggest that the monitoring mechanisms have significant relationship with the quantity of IC information disclosed. The findings contribute to support agency theory by indicating that corporate governance mechanisms and corporate voluntary disclosure can be used strategically by considering the mechanisms as a bundle since they work complimentary to reduce agency conflicts. In addition, the finding also suggests that foreign institutional ownership have more monitoring capacities than domestic institutional investors in relation to IC disclosure.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relation between corporate governance and corporate events' performance. Firms that engage in corporate events seem to perform at least as bad as similar firms that did not. Based on agency theory, the authors hypothesize that lower corporate performance is associated to differences in governance levels. Design/methodology/approach: Bessembinder and Zhang's (2013) approach to evaluate the performance of corporate events has been expanded by considering unique corporate governance features from Brazilian stock market. Findings: The results suggest that after controlling for governance levels, event rms and control rms have similar performance. A number of analyses were performed to rule out alternative explanations. Originality/value: The results call attention for the role of agency costs in evaluating corporate events' performance.

Share-based incentives, which theoretically align executive and shareholders' interests (agency theory), comprise a significant portion of executive remuneration. Detractors propose that such incentives could allow rent extraction (managerial power theory). To enable proper governance, stakeholders (both shareholders and regulators) need to be aware of the characteristics of share-based incentives. The aim of this study was to evaluate the trends relating to executive share-based incentives, as well as the reliability of available data sources thereof, in South Africa. Firstly, a trend analysis (2002-2015) was done for companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Share options were the most popular share-based incentive until 2008, but were then replaced by share appreciation rights (SARs) and later by full quantum schemes (performance and restricted shares). Compared to global evidence, SARs were popular for longer and full quantum schemes became prevalent later in South Africa. Increased use of full quantum schemes in later years signal improved alignment of executive/shareholder interest (in line with the agency theory). This study, secondly, commented on the reliability of the IRESS financial database in recording share-based incentives, when compared to the annual financial statements (AFS). Numerous discrepancies in IRESS significantly detracted from its usefulness as a sole data source when evaluating executive share-based incentives. Divergent disclosure practices in the AFS increased the risk that executives in South Africa could be utilising share-based incentives to extract rents from companies. It is recommended that regulators should prescribe comprehensive standardised disclosure for share-based incentives. (c) 2018, (c) 2018 South African Journal of Accounting Research.

Purpose: The study seeks to verify the influence of the board of directors' independence on the performance of BM&FBOVESPA listed companies and to analyse which agency conflicts influence the performance of the board of directors. Originality/value: The factor of Brazil being an emerging country which lacks a strict legal system and control factors against corruption in these environments and the public sectors emphasizes the importance of applying the best corporate governance practice code in the main developed countries, reflecting the need for effective supervisory bodies that contribute to better financial performance of companies. Design/methodology/approach: The study involved a quantitative survey using a sample of 33 companies in the highway operating segment and 220 reports from 2010 to 2016. A fixed-effects regression model with panel data was used for analysis. Findings: The results were statistically significant for the board's independence variables, which confirm the theory that the presence of independents as members of the board positively influences financial management and the company that holds the executive member and chairman of the board positions has a negative effect. The size of the board did not present statistical significance. (c) 2018 Mackenzie Presbyterian University. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the contrasting moderating effect of a firm's exploration on the relationship between the two types of long-term incentives (stock options/stock ownership) for the chief executive officers and a firm's long-term performance. Even though the two types of incentives are designed to improve long-term performance, the degrees of impact on long-term performance differ. Based on behavioral agency theory, this study theoretically and empirically examines the role of a firm's exploration on the above relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study used three archival sources to obtain data on stock options, stock ownership, patents and exploration, financial measures, and others. Based on a sample of 1,963 firms in various industries from 1995 to 2006, this study tested the moderating effect of a firm's exploration on the relationship between stock options/ownership and a firm's performance. Findings: This study reveals the contrasting moderating effect of a firm's exploration on the relationship between stock options/ownership and a firm's long-term performance: a positive moderating effect on the relationship between stock options and performance and a negative moderating effect on the relationship between stock ownership and performance. In addition, empirical evidence was added on the inverted U-shaped relationship between stock ownership and a firm's long-term performance. Originality/value: There is little research on a firm's internal characteristics that strengthen or weaken the effects of stock options and stock ownership on firm performance. This study demonstrates the differential moderating effects of exploration on the relationship between stock options/stock ownership and long-term performance. Such effects of exploration come from the different risk features of stock options and stock ownership. The key implication is that stock options could be more effective than stock ownership to enhance a firm's long-term performance when a firm has a strong exploration orientation.

Numerous studies have used agency theory (Jensen and Meckling, 1976) and capital scarcity theory (Oxenfeldt and Kelly, 1969) to explain franchising motivations. Although both theories may in part account for why firms choose to franchise, past studies have not seriously considered the potential relationship between franchising and capital structures. Using Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis, this study examined the impact of franchising on short- and long-term debt leverage. The final sample included 191 restaurant firms from 1980 to 2015. Sixty-five firms were non-franchise firms, while 126 firms engaged in the franchising business. The results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis showed that franchising has a significant effect on decreasing long-term debts and confirmed that franchising plays an important role as an additional source of long-term capital. Consequently, the capital scarcity theory is supported as one aspect of long-term debt leverage. However, franchise restaurant firms have larger short-term debt than non-franchise firms, although it is merely marginally significant. This contradicts capital scarcity theory but is in accordance with some past studies (e.g. Norton, 1988; 1995). This implies that franchisors constantly need short-term capital to support franchisees. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to shed light on how accounting, which has been recognised as a contributor to the modernity problem, has been influenced by secular anthropology, which hinges on the concept of "self". Based on Akbar S. Ahmed's concept of Islamic Anthropology, Islamic Accounting Anthropology (IAA) is proposed as an answer to shift the accounting paradigm. Design/methodology/approach: A case study in Indonesia was conducted by studying the development of the nation's Shariah accounting from the perspective of diffusionism as an approach to anthropology. Following the constructivist tradition, IAA, which rejects the Social Darwinism notion of the superiority of the West over the East as the basis of the evolution of civilisation, is used as tool to realise Islamic norms through synchronic-diachronic study, constructing an accounting concept and invoking accounting transformation through accounting education. Findings: This study finds that accounting has been greatly affected by secular Western culture through education and educators as agents that find their legitimation in country policies. Standard setters have also taken the same stance by siding with the capital market. By proposing IAA, it is hoped that Islam will replace the concept of "self-interest" as the faith of accounting and promote welfare for the ummah. Research limitations/implications: The problem of modernisation lies in the newfound faith of self-interest. In accounting, self-interest is ingrained in accounting theories such as Positive Accounting Theory, Entity Theory and Agency Theory, and thus accounting has become a tool to support neoliberal society. IAA will help produce accounting that is rooted in local wisdom and necessity yet very much embedded in Islamic values. Practical implications: IAA suggests that accounting education must be geared towards anthropology detached from the Orientalism-secularism concept. This shift can be accomplished by integrating IAA into the accounting education curriculum. Social implications: Based on IAA, accounting practices can be designed under the guidance of the Quran and result using a synchronic-diachronic approach. By changing the ontological view through accounting education, accounting can drive societal consciousness towards the welfare of society instead of self-happiness. Originality/value: Islamic accounting and anthropology are two subjects that are rarely discussed concurrently. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper explores the Shareholder Value (SHV) ideology as a social construction process marked by a reorganization of the business Management discourse as of the 1970s, after the institutionalization of the Agency Theory formulations. Such social construction can be explained according to the Bourdieusian notion of an organizational field portrayed in terms of a social subsystem, structured under diverse forms of capital, handled by each actor present in the organizational field construction here identified. These actors' engagement to the SHV field construction legitimized a new set of shared values and beliefs, materialized within Value Based Management (VBM) as of the 1990s, celebrating a new way of perception, experience, and acting in firms under such an ideology. Therefore, despite the anti-managerial impulse of the SHV ideology, as of the 2000s, a new social arrangement within the organizational field revealed the emergence of the Celebrity CEO, whose performativity of managerial actions simultaneously unveils the potential of the Management field to reinvent, as well as the symbolism associated with the SHV ideology.

Different institutional features have been found to affect capital structure decisions, but their connections to corporate finance theories are not always clear. This study aims to assess the predictive power of the agency and pecking order theories in two distinct information environments. The strategy is to compare two similar groups of property firms listed on the Mainland and Hong Kong stock exchanges respectively. Both groups operate in the Mainland property market and are subject to the same tax code, but the degrees of transparency and integrity of the stock markets are weaker for the Mainland-listed firms. We find that factors related to agency conflicts and information asymmetries exert a stronger influence on the capital structure decisions of Mainland-listed firms than on those of the Hong Kong-listed firms. This is confirmed by a test of the agency theory using such corporate governance factors as managerial shareholding and shareholding concentration and by a test of the pecking order theory using an error correction model. A further test on the increments of R-squared in the regression models shows that variables derived from the two theories better explain the variations of the capital structure of Mainland-listed firms than those of Hong Kong-listed firms.

In this study we have analysed the voluntary disclosure of intangible assets made by banks listed on the IBEX 35 index under the framework of the Property Costs Theory and Agency Theory. Using the content analysis' methodology, we review the information currently disseminated through six specific categories and the type of report and its evolution. Our results corroborate that these companies have published a small amount of information on intangibles within the period analysed, 2010-2012, as well as the existence of significant differences according to the type of report used to address such disclosure, which constitutes an important contribution in this field. On the other hand, through ANOVA we have set a model of five-predictors to address the explanation of intangibles disclosures based on the two theories used within our conceptual model: ROE, ROA, number of shareholders, number of shareholders representing 50% of the capital and number of independent directors. Only one of them, the number of shareholders representing 50% of the capital, has been empirically validated, which justifies the participation of the Agency Theory in the explanation of this type of practices and differentiates them from other types of voluntary disclosure where both theoretical frameworks have been corroborated.

Announcements of open market repurchase programmes have recently become common not only in the United States but also in many other, less developed countries. The aim of the paper is to examine the market reaction to share repurchase announcements and to investigate the reasons for the market reaction. There is a good deal of research referring to the share repurchases, even in Poland, the originality of our approach is that we conducted our research on an alternative system of trading to the Warsaw Stock of Exchange, namely NewConnect. NewConnect is dedicated to young, small and innovative companies. We found it extremely interesting that such companies in need of external financing take the decision to distribute cash and implement share repurchase. The data was collected for 64 share repurchase announcements over the period 2007-2016. In this study cumulative average abnormal returns are applied to identify the market reaction. To investigate the factors which drive investor behaviour we applied the regressions model. We employed some explanatory variables describing the agency theory and signalling hypotheses: relative payout, market to book ratio, operational cash fl ow, and debt ratio. We found that cumulative average abnormal returns around the share repurchase date are significant at standard levels of confidence in all the analysed event windows. The results of the multivariate and univariate regression analyses do not support the undervaluation hypothesis, as we expected. (c) 2018, Technical University of Liberec. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to enrich the finding by Aguinis et al. (2018) that there is little overlap between the extremes of firm performance and the extremes of CEO pay using a novel approach to characterize the distribution of pay and performance. The authors aim to shift the focus of compensation researchers from fruitlessly trying to link pay to performance to theory-rich accounts of pay that take into consideration the idiosyncratically motivated and socially embedded nature of CEO compensation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors' approach in this commentary is conceptual. They synthesize compensation literature from different fields such as economics, finance, sociology, strategic management and corporate law, as well as the empirical findings from the focal paper to support their characterization of the current state of the literature and future directions it should take. Findings: The authors synthesize discussion of CEO pay down to three dimensions of CEO responsibilities and motivations. They argue that a realistic pay design should take into account that CEOs have limited control over performance, they are accountable to multiple stakeholders and they are motivated by financial as well as nonfinancial incentives. Originality/value: The commentary presents researchers with high-order framing of CEO pay that goes beyond debating over methodology or narrowly focusing on limited behavioral drivers of pay setting. Instead, the authors encourage researchers to take advantage of their three-legged framework to theorize about CEO pay. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: While investment decisions may be financial decisions, there is a growing recognition that they are also often non-financially based decisions. The purpose of this study is to report findings focused on the project selection stage of capital budgeting, which has the objectives of exploring for: the relative degree of emphasis decision makers attach to a financial and non-financial orientation in capital budgeting; and the role, if any, that two agency theory variables have on the relative degree of emphasis: a personal incentive for project go-ahead and monitoring of project outcomes through a post-audit. Design/methodology/approach: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are used and framed in a between-subjects 2 (personal incentive) x 2 (monitoring) design. DCEs are well-suited to research questions which examine some tension between competing alternatives. For example, trade-offs involving the relative degree of emphasis decision makers attach to a financial and non-financial orientation in capital budgeting. Findings: In the absence of a personal incentive and monitoring, decision makers attach a significant degree of emphasis to cash inflows and cash outflows, both financial factors, and one strategic non-financial factor being improvement in the position of the firm vis-a-vis competitors in capital budgeting. However, when decision makers receive a personal incentive from project go-ahead, they attach a lower degree of emphasis to cash outflows. Alternatively, when there is monitoring through a post-audit and a personal incentive, decision makers attach a higher degree of emphasis to cash outflows. Practical implications: Decision makers attach a significant degree of emphasis to only a relatively narrow band of attributes in making a capital budgeting decision, which is true in both the absence of and in the presence of the agency conditions. There is also little support for the view that there is any higher degree of emphasis attached to a financial orientation vis-a-vis a non-financial orientation. A particularly important finding relates to the overarching goal of monitoring through a post-audit. One view is that it should foster more accurate forecasting by making forecasters aware that their efforts will be reviewed. However, the findings of this study appear to be more supportive of a view that post-audits might lead agents to become more conservative or even shy away from projects. Originality/value: The study makes contributions to the growing field of research which has the objective of exploring for the relative degree of emphasis decision makers attach to a financial and non-financial orientation in capital budgeting. In particular, it extends the prior research through its investigation of the role that two agency theory variables play in the relative degree of emphasis decision makers attach to a financial and non-financial orientation: a personal incentive for project go-ahead and monitoring of project outcomes through a post-audit.

Recent development in Myanmar shows a growing concern of the needs of corporate governance. With enormous economic and political transformations in Myanmar, corporate governance is really important to increase Myanmar's economic potential and foreign direct investment. With the hope and expectation of growing economic potential following the current transformation in Myanmar, the need of good corporate governance is inevitable. Similar to other Southeast Asian countries, the most severe problems in Myanmar arise between controlling and non-controlling shareholders instead of problems which arise from the separation of ownership and management. This type of problems is referred as type II agency problems. This paper, to my best knowledge, may be among the first paper which discusses corporate governance in Myanmar. Thus, it should encourage greater debates and discussions on Myanmar's corporate governance. Applying institutional theory and agency theory, this paper provides recommendations to combat type II agency problems and promote good corporate governance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the effect of French family control on the cash flow sensitivity of cash (CFSC). It also investigates the moderating effect of board of directors' features on this relation. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of French-listed companies from 2012 to 2014, the authors use GLS regression models on panel data estimated with robust standard errors, clustered at the firm level. Findings: The results show that family control is positively associated with the CFSC. This finding suggests that families are likely to hold more cash out of their cash flows for entrenchment and expropriation purposes. A further analysis shows that board size, independence and the two-tier board structure negatively affect the CFSC in family firms. Board efficiency is then a guarantee of minority shareholders' interests against family expropriation risks in France. Research limitations/implications: These findings suggest that French family firms are likely to expropriate minority interests by extracting rents through their cash holding behavior. However, in the presence of high-quality board features, the relation turns negative, suggesting that the quality of the board is an efficient corporate governance device that is likely to monitor family corporate decisions. Originality/value: This paper extends previous research by investigating the moderating effect of board features on the relation between family control and the CFSC. The research provides a metric for agency problems that is the sensitivity of cash to cash flows and offers theoretical support for the agency argument of hoarding cash.

Accountability is a pivotal concern of applied social science. This article asserts that in many situations a full explanation of the sources of accountability requires the application of concepts from sociology and management science, in addition to those from the market-based approaches inspired by economics. The article describes the market-based approach to accountability exemplified by agency theory, applies it to school reform and derives several predictions about the likely success of market-based approaches to school reform, and documents the lack of evidence supporting the contention that programs for school choice will markedly improve teacher work effort and performance (as measured by student test scores). The social actor approach, rooted in sociological and management theories, is introduced and used to describe the pressures and norms operating in the public schools that foster accountability even in the absence of competition between schools for students. The article concludes with some implications for practice and research on public sector accountability. (c) The Author(s) 2015.

Built upon the agency theory and the stewardship theory, this study examines the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activities among Chinese publicly listed firms. Using a founder-CEO indicator, we separate steward effects from agency effects, and find that Chinese firms' M&A activities are significantly influenced by the steward factors after controlling for the agency factors. Firms, of which CEO is a founder, enjoy relatively higher premium during M&A. Further investigation reveals that the steward effects vary in the power of CEO. The results show that steward effect is reinforced when founder-CEO is more powerful. Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The paper is written as an empirical test on the indirect effect of Commissioner Board Monitoring on firm performance through environmental performance as mediation variable. Research sample is non-financial firms that participate into Performance Assessment Program (PROPER) and that also list at Indonesian Stock Exchange. Commissioner Board Monitoring consists of few attributes such as: Commissioner Board Size, Independent Commissioner Board, and Commissioner Board's Frequency of Meeting. Environmental performance is measured with the use of PROPER by the Ministry of Life Environment and Forestry for Indonesian Republic. Firm performance is proxied with Return on Asset (ROA) and Tobin's Q. Research gains some results. Commissioner Board Monitoring has a positive effect on both environmental performance and firm performance. Environmental performance has a positive effect on firm performance. Commissioner Board Size has an indirect effect on firm performance through environmental performance. All these findings support agency theory and stakeholder theory. Any firms attempting to maximize performance shall balance the interest of shareholder (firm owner) and stakeholder. (c) 2018, ASERS Publishing. All rights reserved.

This paper examines the determinants of base pay and total incentive compensation packages of CEOs of biopharmaceutical firms that have recently gone public, and whether human capital and agency factors affect the market's response to the initial public offering. We find that in terms of net proceeds, the IPO market appears to reward the firms that have founder-CEOs and CEOs with higher incentive compensation. CEOs with prior venture capital experience are associated with receiving higher incentive compensation, while CEOs with a greater ownership interest in the firm receive lower incentive compensation but higher salaries. CEOs of firms with a greater percentage of insiders are associated with lower salaries. The results should add to our understanding related to human capital and agency theories, as well as help firms and investors better understand and structure CEO compensation.

This paper utilizes corporate governance concepts to assess the merit of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act). The paper first compares the information flows seen in a corporate context to those seen in a governmental reporting context. The paper then utilizes agency theory to establish a conceptual link between the two reporting processes. This conceptual link is used to identify common goals between the participants in the information flows. Following this, a corporate governance model is used to outline factors that contribute to effective corporate governance. This governance model is then used as a basis for assessing the merit of the DATA Act. After this, differences between the participants in the information flows are discussed and limitations of the paper are acknowledged. The paper suggests that the DATA Act has merit due to its potential to improve transparency and monitoring in the governmental reporting process. Increased data timeliness and usability will enhance transparency, while improvements in automation, data transfer, and data analytics will improve monitoring. The conclusions of this paper have implications for the participants in the governmental reporting process including government agencies, legislators, regulatory bodies, contractors, nonvoting taxpayers, and members of the voting public.

The aim of the present study was to understand, in Portugal, relationships between the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the organizational performance, on the one hand, and relationships between the shareholder value creation and the CEO total compensation, on the other hand. This research is divided into two parts. The first part was examined whether organizational performance based on accounting measures influences organizational performance based on market measures and whether organizational performance based on accounting measures and market measures influences the CEO total compensation. The second part of the study analyses whether organizational performance, based on accounting measures and market measures, and the CEO total compensation influence the shareholder value creation. This research was based on agency theory assumptions in order to build the analysis model. The sample was composed of companies listed on Euronext Lisbon. The data analysis was performed using the structural equation modelling method. The results showed that organizational performance based on accounting measures influences organizational performance based on market measures, the CEO total compensation and the shareholder value creation.

Despite the increasing number of studies on corporate governance, the study of what is understood as ''good'' corporate governance and how this ''quality'' is measured has not been extensively approached; thus, what constitutes good corporate governance remains unsolved. To examine the substance of corporate governance quality, we undertake an interpretative analysis of this concept. We conclude that the deep meaning of corporate governance quality is anchored to the theoretical lens adopted to approach it and that agency theory represents the mainstream method employed in this task. Our results question the validity of agency-based metrics of corporate governance for the two following reasons: the endogeneity problem they embed and the agency Universalist approach that does not capture the holistic complexity of corporate governance at a firm level. To tackle such limitations, we propose the behavioural approach to fully capture the substance of what makes 'good' corporate governance and to measure it.

This paper explores the adequacy of agency theory in explaining the venture capitalist (VC)-entrepreneur relationship through a firm life-cycle perspective. The findings indicate that advanced stage relationships suffer severely from agency risks while early stage relationships are less affected. The findings have important theoretical implications, as they propose boundary conditions along which agency theory can be applied to the VC-entrepreneur relationship. VCs and entrepreneurs can utilise the recommendations for better decision making, leading to an improved working relationship. Copyright (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Leveraged buyouts (LBOs) are corporate restructuring transactions involving the transfer of whole companies or company divisions to new owners. This chapter reviews the agency and entrepreneurship perspectives of LBOs and outlines arguments concerning their impact on jobs and wages. The seminal work of Jensen provides an agency theory perspective through which LBOs have traditionally been understood. The entrepreneurial perspective is the impact of the LBO governance structure and the role that private equity (PE) firms play in their interaction with portfolio firms. While the theoretical perspectives provide an academic framework for understanding the impact of LBOs on jobs and wages, the nature of the PE business model has also received attention for how it impacts on jobs and wages. Davis et al. conduct one of the most comprehensive studies to date by analyzing the employment effects of PE-backed LBOs at both establishment and firm levels.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine whether external monitors (auditors and analysts) constrain earnings strings, an indicator of earnings management, and whether this monitoring is more effective after the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), given the emphasis of SOX on improving auditing, financial reporting and the information environment. Design/methodology/approach - Agency theory establishes the premise between external monitoring and earnings strings. Auditor tenure and number of analysts following provide measures for external monitoring quality. Using prior research, empirical models explaining the presence of an earnings strings and earnings strings trend are developed to test the hypotheses. Findings - Pre-SOX, extreme auditor tenure, indicating lower quality external monitoring, is associated with greater earnings strings trend, and analyst coverage is associated with increased likelihood of earnings strings and greater earnings strings trend consistent with analyst pressure on management. More effective auditor and analyst monitoring occurs post-SOX in terms of reduced likelihood of earnings strings and earnings strings trend. Originality/value - The authors provide evidence on how elements of external monitoring are associated with increased earnings strings pre-SOX. Further, they contribute to the debate on the impact of SOX on external firm monitoring and the overall financial information environment. By focusing on earnings strings, the outcome of earnings management, the authors provide a unique understanding of external monitoring that also provides insight on the overvaluation of equity and ultimate destruction of firm value. The evidence demonstrates how regulation has contributed to an improved financial reporting environment and external monitoring. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited

This new book examines the relationship between agency theory and executive pay. It argues that while Jensen and Meckling (1976) were right in their analysis of the agency problem in public corporations they were wrong about the proposed solutions. Drawing on ideas from economics, psychology, sociology and the philosophy of science, the author explains how standard agency theory has contributed to the problem of executive pay rather than solved it. The book explores why companies should be regarded as real entities not legal fictions, how executive pay in public corporations can be conceptualised as a collective action problem and how behavioral science can help in the design of optimal incentive arrangements. An insightful and revolutionary read for those researching corporate governance, HRM and organisation theory, this useful book offers potential solutions to some of the problems with executive pay and the standard model of agency.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of minority shareholders' rights on client's demand for audit quality. Specially, this paper investigates the impact of shareholders' with at least 10% holdings on clients' demand for audit quality. The sample consists of the top 100 listed firms on the Borsa Istanbul (BIST) for 2014 and 2015. The result is aligned with the suggestions of the agency theory that shareholders with at least 10% holdings increase clients' involvement with audit quality. The results propose direction for future studies on the role of shareholders to monitor management behavior. This paper calls for future studies in the area of accounting and finance to operationalize a new measurement of Type II agency cost in order to better understand the agency conflicts and the state of the shareholders on the BIST.

Directors commonly "punish" CEOs for overly risky behavior by rebalancing their compensation to include more restricted stock and fewer stock options. This paper extends the behavioral-agency model to describe how CEOs will manage their holdings of stock and stock options in response to this form of compensation rebalancing. In doing so, it finds that CEOs respond by selling existing stock holdings and accumulating option holdings. This behavior achieves the opposite incentive structure that such rebalancing intends to create, raising questions about the effectiveness of compensation rebalancing in reducing risky decision making.

A returnee entrepreneur playing an important role in China market is a notable phenomenon. While their advanced knowledge and overseas networking in developed countries have advantages over local counterparts, their lack of local knowledge and connection may mitigate their advantages. This study explores the research questions how and why external management control of returnee entrepreneur is inferior to local counterpart. Based on the data collected in year 2002 from Chinese technology venture companies in Zhongguancun Science Park (ZSP), we find that the performance of returnee entrepreneur's firms is lower when they have more local subsidiaries and when they are owned by foreigners. It implies that returnee entrepreneurs may be less effective in management control over local subsidiaries which may indicate a low level of headquarters control. It also implies that foreign ownership gives rise to increase in agency conflicts between returnee entrepreneurs and foreign investors and thus has a negative impact on firms' innovation performance.

We study the role of corporate governance on the Intellectual Capital disclosure strategy of listings firms under different perspectives (agency and signaling theories). Previous literature has shown different competing arguments regarding how governance might affect the level of IC disclosure and also none of the contributions is focused on IPOs. Depending on the theoretical framework, governance and corporate disclosure may be complementary (agency theory) or substitutive (signaling theory) for accountability. If they are complementary, agency theory predicts that the adoption of better governance mechanisms will strengthen the internal control of companies so that a greater extent of discretionary disclosure is expected. If the relationship is substitutive, drawing on signaling theory, we expect that issuers use corporate governance as a signal and accordingly reduce the amount of burdensome IC information that is given to investors in the listing prospectus. Therefore, this study aims to better understand which theoretical framework is best at interpreting the observed IC disclosure policies of listing firms. To this end, we test a series of hypotheses on a sample of 70 Italian firms that went public between 2004 and 2014. A series of six IC disclosure indexes are employed in a multivariate analysis in order to disentangle the specific effect that each corporate governance variable might play over a variety of IC information that is disclosed into the listing prospectus. Our results reveal that, according to the signaling theory, good governance mechanisms are substitutive to the IC disclosure and the results are consistent across the different IC categories that are here considered. This study has practical implications which contribute to the understanding of managers' decision processes with respect to the choice of multiple signals, and it also suggests a possible interpretation of the low propensity of listing firms to disseminate longer than necessary discretionary information.

The family business is an economically relevant worldwide phenomenon. It is widespread in every industry and it takes diverse legal forms, ranging from micro, small and medium sized firms to large public companies. Its economic relevance frequently impacts more than half of the national GDP and it becomes an essential source of employment. After, presenting some facts and figures about the family business around the world, this chapter shows the two main approaches used to define a family firm, namely the essence and component approaches. We thus review more than 180 definitions of family firms and organise them within a table according to the following three main criteria: (1) Percentage of ownership held by the family, (2) Members of the family involved in management and control positions, and (3) Generational stages of the family firm. The intersection of these three criteria gives rise to other four groups of family firm definitions, theoretically proving the multidimensionality of the phenomenon. We then review the studies on family business and accounting and discuss the main theoretical framework used, with a specific focus on the transition from a mainly agency theory-based literature to the derived socioemotional wealth theory. Finally, this chapter pinpoints some early conclusions on the family business providing a bridge with the ensuing chapter stressing the relations between family firms and accounting choices.

This chapter begins the discussion about earnings quality in family firms. It examines whether family firms differently manage their earnings compared to non-family firms. We show that both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective, prior research documents show that family firms manage less their earnings relative to non-family firms. Nonetheless, we also look at deviations from these results, mainly due to the differences in the institutional environment, and/or in the management structure. Moreover, there has been a shift from the agency theory to the socioemotional wealth theory to explain family firms' decisions with regards to earnings management. We conclude this chapter by suggesting future avenues for research, in particular in terms of theoretical framework and research design. The discussion about earnings quality continues in Chap. 4, where we investigate accounting conservatism in family firms. (c) Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

Purpose: Country comparative studies especially in Africa on public procurement reforms toward financial control and accountability of public expenditure are limited. Meanwhile, these kinds of studies have potential for providing useful insights on how value for money through public procurement is being ensured across Africa. This paper attempts to provide this. The purpose of this paper is to highlight several policy recommendations for public management aimed at improving public procurement and public financial management (PFM) systems in Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a qualitative case study using secondary data drawn from Global Integrity Index (GII) of the Transparency International and the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessments databases to investigate variables that influence public procurement practices in three purposively selected African countries. The comparative approach for presenting some of the experiences of countries in public procurement methods is used in this paper. Findings: The findings suggest three main variables, namely, government structure and economic variables, complicated by socio-cultural values interact to influence public procurement and PFM systems in the case study countries. Research limitations/implications: Data for the GII indicators used were only available from 2013, which restricted the discussion of those indicators to a short span (2013-2015). Social implications: The socio-cultural milieu within which public procurement takes place has implications for how governance structures function to deliver value-for-money public procurement. Originality/value: This study adds value by comparing three countries within Africa to reveal common variables which influence public procurement and PFM systems.

Assurance is becoming increasingly popular as a way to enhance the confidence of sustainability reports. But what does assurance of sustainability reports mean? To answer this question, the chapter treats assurance as a word with a regulatory and etymological history, which prescribes a specific and particular interpretation of the term assurance. It is observed that sustainability assurance inherits a specific theory with a particular form of evaluating and making authoritative statements on sustainability practice from (financial) auditing. The theory it draws on is agency theory, and the form of evaluation is the indirect evaluation of statements of compliance with standards instead of a direct assessment of sustainability performance or quality. The chapter suggests that this may be problematic since, although assurance may add credibility and confidence to sustainability reporting it does not challenge the perspectives taken by the company, which, it is argued, was the problem in the first place, as suggested by the Brundtland report. This theory of the practice is, however, not the only interpretation of the word audit. Drawing on alternative historical and etymological meanings of the word audit, the possibilities of other forms of sustainability audit are advanced. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

Private equity (PE) leveraged buyouts (LBOs) are financial transactions through which an acquirer buys a controlling stake in a company using a substantial amount of debt, with the objective of selling it after a few years for a profit. This chapter discusses how the literature has focused mostly on technological innovation, paying relatively less attention to managerial innovation. It demonstrates the different theoretical frameworks to analyze LBOs and the extent to which the empirical literature supports their predictions. Two main theoretical frameworks link LBOs to the performance in general - and the innovation in particular - of target companies: agency theory and strategic entrepreneurship theory. The agency theory of LBOs stems from the seminal works on the relationship between shareholders and managers. The second theoretical framework that can be used to describe the impact of LBOs on innovative activity is strategic entrepreneurship theory.

Dividend Policy is one of the most re-searchable topics in the area of Corporate Finance. Numerous Hypotheses and empirical researches have been done to explain the dividend policy of firms. The most popular is Lintner model (1956), which suggests on previous year dividend and Earnings per share as significant determinants of dividend policy. The pertinent question arises is why some firms pay regular dividends when dividends can be sacrificed for growth and financial stability. The Agency theory highlights the conflict between promoters and managers for dividends over surplus utilization. The Life cycle theory suggests that mature firms tend to ensure regular dividend payout compared to younger firms. Under this context the present paper investigates the Managers Remuneration to ensure dividend stability while maintaining Investment and Financing decisions. The results show that mean of past dividend, managerial remuneration, firm size, return on net worth, firm maturity and debt to equity are the significant variables that influence the regular dividend paying behavior of the Indian firms. However the firm growth, quick ratio, promoter holding and cash earnings per share are not found to be significant determinants of regular dividend of Indian firms. This paper contributes to the literature on dividend policy for Indian firms who are maintaining stable dividend policy. (c) Allied Academies.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the interaction between the structure of the top management team, takeover defense mechanisms and firms rate of collective actions. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses elements of agency theory, prospect theory and competitive dynamics research to develop a model for examining heterogeneity in the rate of collective actions among firms in the technology sector. A sample of 299 firm-year observations arrayed into panel regression analyses is used. Findings: The findings from this study show a positive relationship between the size of the top management team and the count of collective actions when takeover defense mechanisms are present. Further this study finds a negative relationship between top management team ownership and collective actions when these same takeover defense mechanisms are present. Additionally, the female ratio of the top management team is negatively related to collective actions. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of technological firms. These relationships may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other elements of the firm's governance structure (i.e. board of directors or shareholders) may play an important role in the strategic decision-making process. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by linking several blocks of literature, top management team literature, competitive dynamics literature and corporate governance literature, into a model to examine firm structural characteristics on the heterogeneity in the propensity to formulate collective actions among firms.

The relation between firm performance and shareholding is a critical issue in corporate governance. In this paper, we examine if significant associations exist between firm performance and (1) directors' shareholdings or (2) directors' family shareholdings among Taiwanese listed firms. After addressing for possible endogeneity and controlling for firm specific variables, we find a positive association between executive director's shareholding and firm performance. Consistent with incentive effect in agency theory, this result indicates that executive directors have incentive to maximize firms' value. Also, we find that executive directors' family shareholding is positively related to firm performance, which implies that executive directors may be motivated by their family members to improve firm value. The results also imply that the majority-minority agency problem can be mitigated when director's family welfare is at stake. In addition, we divide research sample into subsets to accommodate the effect of mandatory independent director regulation in Taiwan since 2007. (c) 2018, International Journal of Financial Research.

This study aims to advance research on local market initiative, a form of subsidiary initiative that emanates from new opportunities in the local marketplace. Given that market-seeking MNCs in China face particular pressures stemming from local market conditions, China is particularly relevant research site to examine the concept. Drawing on agency theory, resource dependence theory and the resource based view of the firm and using survey data from 75 subsidiaries of German manufacturing companies in China, the effects of subsidiary autonomy and entrepreneurial culture on local market initiative are analyzed. The results provide evidence that both subsidiary autonomy and the presence of an entrepreneurial culture are associated with local market initiative. This research has major implications for MNCs and their market-seeking subsidiaries abroad and its designated focus on local market initiative constitutes a milestone in subsidiary initiative research.

This study aims to examine the relationship between gender diversity and real estate companies' performance in Malaysia, whereby in 1985, the Government of Malaysia formulated a National Policy on Women as a guide for women's participation. Panel data analysis was used to examine the gender diversity and real estates' performance in an unbalanced panel of 549 observations for the years 2012-2015. The authors utilised an agency theory to inform the discussion of this paper's findings. This study finds that the woman directors in the real estate companies are dominated by family-companies. The existence of block holders enhances the firm governance by monitoring the board activities which in turn increase their effectiveness and efficiency that lead to a higher firm performance. Both the managerial ownership and the institutional investors are significant in determining the firm's performance. The reason may be due to higher ownership controlled by managerial and investor which makes them have a say in a company and try to pursue their objectives rather than the stakeholders' interests. The findings have contributed to the body of knowledge especially on the women participation in Malaysia, and their contributions. Gender diversity does not destroy the firm performance; in fact, Malaysian companies should focus on the right combination of men and women on the board, rather than the presence of at least a woman on a board of directors. The findings outlay the scenario of women's involvement in the real estate companies in Malaysia. There is a positive direction for women's involvement in the board, but it is still a long way to go. Very limited studies delved on gender diversity and real estate companies in Malaysia, even though there is a policy by the Government on women involvement in Malaysia. (c) 2018.

We want an economy that generates stable and equitable growth - or what I call 'sustainable prosperity'. We want productivity growth that makes it possible for the population to have higher living standards over time. We want an equitable sharing of the gains from productivity growth among those whose work efforts and financial resources contribute to that growth. And we want sufficient job stability to enable workers to remain in productive employment for some four decades at work while providing them with enough savings to ensure adequate incomes over some two decades of retirement. We need innovative enterprise to achieve sustainable prosperity. Innovation, defined as a higher-quality product at a lower unit cost than had previously been available, generates the productivity that underpins stable and equitable growth. The innovative enterprise is the linchpin of investment in productive capabilities through the interaction of households, governments and businesses - or what I call 'the investment triad. In this essay, I outline the Theory of Innovative Enterprise (TIE) as a conceptual framework for analysing how an economy can achieve sustainable prosperity. TIE transforms our understanding of how the economy functions and performs. TIE exposes the absurdity of the neoclassical economics concept of 'perfect competition', taught to millions of students every year, which posits that the unproductive firm is the foundation of the most efficient economy. I put forward TIE as a relevant and rigorous replacement for neoclassical theory. TIE can explain how the US economy (as a foremost example among the rich nations of the world) displayed a tendency toward stable and equitable growth in the immediate post-World War II decades but then, from the last half of the 1970s, entered into an era of unstable employment, inequitable income, and sagging productivity. Driving this epochal change was the transformation of the dominant regime of corporate resource allocation from 'retain-and-reinvest' to 'downsize-and-distribute'. Under a retain-and-reinvest regime, companies retain corporate revenues and reinvest in productive capabilities, including those of the labour force, that can generate innovative products. Under a downsize-and-distribute regime, senior corporate executives - incentivised by stock-based pay and pressured by financial predators - focus on downsizing the labour force (laying off workers, cutting their pay, neglecting training) and distributing corporate revenues to shareholders in the forms of cash dividends and stock repurchases. The corporate proclivity to downsize-and-distribute has become so extreme in the United States that it can now be termed the (largely legal) looting of the business corporation. It bears prime responsibility for the extreme concentration of income among the very richest households and the ongoing erosion of middle-class employment opportunities. Legitimising this looting of the business corporation is the neoclassical theory of the market economy and its particular 'agency theory' application, with its mantra that, for the sake of economic efficiency, business enterprises should be run to 'maximise shareholder value' (MSV). In this essay, I explain why, far from being a theory of value creation, MSV is an ideology of predatory value extraction. I conclude by arguing that the eradication of MSV ideology is a necessary condition for enabling an economy's business enterprises to contribute to, rather than undermine, the achievement of sustainable prosperity. To provide us with a rational intellectual foundation for specific policy proposals to stop the looting of the business corporation - including a ban on stock buybacks, radical changes in incentives for senior corporate executives, representation of workers and taxpayers on corporate boards, and reform of the tax system to support the investment triad - I call for innovation theory to replace agency theory in our conceptualisation - and teaching - of how a successful economy operates and performs.

We develop a philosophical perspective on the moral obligations of managers, which we call agent morality, by examining the moral implications of agency theory. Our view is grounded in noninstrumental ethics, which we argue is logically superior to instrumental ethics. We show that the principal-agent model of the firm, once properly considered, requires that managers fashion business policies with reference first to certain moral duties and second to shareholder wealth.

This study was conducted with the aim to examine the relevance of different financing theories namely Agency Theory, Trade-Off Theory and Pecking Order Theory to explain capital structure choices among firms in "Access, Certainty, Efficiency" (ACE) Market of Bursa Malaysia. The ACE Market is the financing source for the high-growth and technology requirements of middle-sized firms. The literature on debt policy decision making in the ACE market have been scant, leading the scholars to realize the necessity of performing more studies in this field. To further explain this issue, this study performed a quantitative analysis on a panel data sample of 60 ACE firms from 2005 to 2016. Three proxies for leverage namely total, long-term and short-term debts were examined based on the total assets and equity in six regression models. From seven variables examined in this study, findings indicated a significant relationship between warrant and debt in all models. In addition, liquidity, firm size, profitability and leverage showed significant relationship in all the models except for long-term debt. However, reputation, non-debt tax shield and interest tax shield were seen significant in some models. Trade-off Theory and Pecking Order Theory can jointly clarify determinants of firms' capital structure in the ACE Market. (c) 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.

This chapter provides an overview of the variety and trends in Management buyouts (MBOs) types or organization. It outlines the theoretical perspectives that have been advanced to explain buyouts. From an academic perspective MBOs have been largely viewed through three theoretical perspectives: agency theory, behavioral theory, and an entrepreneurial perspective. Historically, agency theory has dominated our theoretical understanding of MBOs. Although founded in 1986, the germination of the seed that was to become Centre for Management Buyout Research started in 1979 in a conversation between colleagues about divestments between parent corporations. The chapter discusses some general comments regarding the future prospects for MBOs and private equity (PE). Critics argue that PE-backed buyouts are more likely to fail or enter financial distress as a result of the high amounts of leverage taken on at the time of the deal. The chapter also presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in this book. (c) 2019 selection and editorial matter, Mike Wright, Kevin Amess, Nick Bacon and Donald Siegel.

The role of private equity (PE) firms in buyouts has mainly been developed from the perspectives of agency theory and entrepreneurship theory. This chapter focuses on the part of this literature that has analyzed the effect of buyouts on capital expenditures, other types of investment, and financing constraints. Policy makers are often concerned that these leveraged buyouts make portfolio firms over-indebted. They are also concerned that PE investors have a short-term planning horizon and therefore cut investments, especially those with a long-term character. PE firms can contribute to reducing under- investment in firms with growth perspectives and reducing over-investment in firms with managers that tend to waste free cash flow. The chapter summarizes the effects of buyouts on investment from a theoretical point of view. It introduces the empirical methodology employed by empirical studies and related findings. The chapter discusses methodological problems in the existing literature and suggestions for future research, and the final section concludes.

Agency theory suggests that problems in terms of conflicting preferences, knowledge asymmetry and different attitudes towards risks can have a negative impact on work outcome from the agent to the principal. In private internal investigations, the client is the principal, while the fraud examiner is the agent. Based on a sample of 49 reports of investigation from Norway, this article presents empirical results testing agency theory. Results indicate that agency issues do have a significant influence on the contribution from internal investigations, but the influence is not necessarily negative. While different attitudes towards risk have a negative impact, knowledge asymmetry has a positive impact on the contribution from an investigation. A possible explanation for this surprising result is that examiners are experts in other areas than the client, which is the reason why examiners are hired by clients.

This paper provides new evidence on the impact of ownership structure on firm value through financial decisions of Vietnamese listed firm from 2009 to 2015. We deploy a variety of methodology to solve the potential endogeneity problem and to find the effect of ownership concentration and ownership types on the value of listed corporation on HOSE and HNX. We found that ownership concentration and ownership types affect the firm value mostly through capital structure. A reasonable ownership structure (highly concentrated and/or consists of investors that could well-monitor the company such as state, institutional investors) have positive influence on firm value as it negates the overinvestment and encourages firms to use debt more appropriately.

This paper focuses on the practical coexistence of agency and stewardship theories. By analysing the three dimensions of government structures, compensation schemes, and monitoring activities, we show that this coexistence is possible due to several situational factors. Using field research data, we examine the causes of this coexistence and the effects it has on the efficiency and effectiveness of corporate governance, and question the practical sustainability of this dualism. We conclude that coexistence is possible but is unsustainable, and it would be wrong to support such a situation for a long period of time. We discuss paths of potential action and their implications for key stakeholders. (c) 2018, University of Belgrade.

The business enterprise is the prime institution in economic development and growth; yet, until recently, mainstream economics has mostly treated firms as homogeneous black boxes managed by untrustworthy agents. Using economic principles, the field of strategic management has developed a nuanced approach to understanding how firms are created, organized, and grow; how they innovate and compete; and how managers manage. That approach has yielded a theoretical framework known as 'dynamic capabilities'. Contrasts are drawn between dynamic capabilities and other approaches to the theory of the firm, including transaction cost economics and agency theory. The application of capability theory allows intellectual blinders to be removed and an understanding of differential firm-level resource allocation and performance to emerge. This brings a richer conceptual understanding of the nature of the business enterprise and its management consistent with evolutionary and behavioural economics. Policy insights into governance, inequality, economic development, and the wealth of nations follow. (c) 2017, (c) 2017 New Zealand Association of Economists Incorporated.

Purpose: This study aims to reconcile some of the conflicting results in prior studies of the board structure-firm performance relationship and to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of agency theory in the specific context of Italian corporate governance practice. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a dynamic generalised method of moments on a sample of Italian listed companies over the period 2003-2015. Proxies for corporate governance mechanisms are the board size, the level of board independence, ownership structure, shareholder agreements and CEO-chairman leadership. Findings: While directors elected by minority shareholders are not able to impact performance, independent directors do have a non-linear effect on performance. Board size has a positive effect on firm performance for lower levels of board size. Ownership structure per se and shareholder agreements do not affect firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by reconciling some of the conflicting results inherent in the board structure-performance relationship. Firm performance is not necessarily improved by having a high number of independent directors on the board. Ownership structure and composition do not affect firm performance; therefore, greater monitoring provided by concentrated ownership does not necessarily lead to stronger firm performance. Practical implications: This paper suggests that Italian corporate governance law should improve the rules and effectiveness of minority directors by analysing whether they are able to impede the main shareholders to expropriate private benefits on the expenses of the minority. The legislator should not impose any restrictive regulations with regard to CEO duality, as the influence of CEO duality on performance may vary with respect to the unique characteristics of each company. Originality/value: The results enrich the understanding of the applicability of agency theory in listed companies, especially in Italy. Additionally, this paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of research evidence of agency theory studies. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Environmental research has usually highlighted that the existence of slack resources in an organization helps allocate investment to innovative initiatives. However, the existing literature has paid very limited attention to how slack resources can influence the effects of focused and diversified innovations in different ways. Agency theory scholars claim that a manager's first preference when confronted with discretionary resources will not generate positive investments for the firm, but their own opportunistic preferences. The differences between focused and diversified environmental innovations allow us to gain a better understanding of the financial impact of being focused and how slack resources matter in this context. We analyze a longitudinal sample of 5845 environmental patents from the 75 largest companies in the electrical components and equipment industry worldwide. Our results show that high levels of slack resources reduce the existing positive relationship between focused environmental innovations and a firm's financial performance. These results contribute to delineating the theoretical and empirical implications of focused versus diversified environmental innovations and extend the literature on ethical dilemmas concerning managers' use of slack resources in the firm.

The benefit of gender diversity on the board of directors is a subject of current debate. We contribute to the literature on diversity and its impact on businesses from an analytical framework that incorporates agency theory and the concept of socioemotional wealth (SEW). Our findings suggest that the inclusion of women on the board goes beyond ethical concerns being also relevant from a business perspective (i.e. increases risk-taking). The proportion of independent female directors on the board is shown to increase venturing risk (i.e. with the expectation of improving future performance), but does not interfere with performance hazard risk which conceptualizes the family desire to preserve SEW, especially in firms where these risks are low. By contrast, the proportion of non-independent female directors on the board increases significantly performance hazard risk, but only in family firms. In summary, we find with data from Latin America that the motivation for risk-taking differs depending on whether the appointment is as an independent female director, the type of risk and on whether the firm is controlled by a family.

In this article, we review recent literature (79 articles) on the impact of corporate governance on corporate tax avoidance. Applying a stakeholder-oriented view, we find that various aspects of corporate governance, such as incentive alignment between management and shareholders, board composition, ownership structure, capital market monitoring, audit, enforcement and government relations, and other stakeholders' pressure have a strong influence on corporate tax avoidance. Findings indicate that effective corporate governance mechanisms steer tax avoidance at its firm-specific optimal level. The classical principal-agent theory, however, fails to fully explain corporate tax avoidance as an outcome. Investigating the determinants of corporate tax avoidance requires a more comprehensive approach taking into account corporate governance institutions and all stakeholders relevant to the firm. We show that corporate governance institutions not only have the potential to increase tax avoidance, making firms more profitable, but also to limit tax avoidance to a level where the arising risks do not outweigh the benefits.

Purpose: This study aims to link environmental disclosure quality (EDQ) to firm performance and examine the moderating role of board independence in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on agency theory and stakeholder theory, the authors developed and tested hypotheses using original survey data from 720 firm-year observations collected from 120 Iranian companies over six years between 2011 and 2016. In this paper, they conducted static and dynamic panel data analysis. Findings: After correcting for endogeneity bias, the results showed that there is a significant positive relationship between EDQ and firm performance. The results also showed that board independence significantly reinforces the positive effect of EDQ on performance, and firms with more independent board members are involved environmental disclosure for improved performance. This is consistent with agency theory, which posits that a more independent board of directors can better monitor the CEO and reduce incentives for pursuing personal interests, which in turn improves performance. The results are robust after performing sensitivity tests. Research limitations/implications: This paper takes the perspective of corporate governance to empirically examine the effect of EDQ on firm performance. This study makes a contribution to the literature by showing that board independence moderates the effects of EDQ on firm performance. Practical implications: The evidence supports the emphasis that recent policy statements have put on increasing the number of independent directors on corporate boards. This study offers insights to policymakers interested in enhancing the monitoring role of corporate boards. Originality/value: The study adds value to the understanding of the effect of the EDQ on performance and how board independence influences this relationship, particularly in an emerging economy like Iran.

A number of earlier studies suggest that earnings quality improves when females are in senior management because of gender differences in risk-taking and ethical attitude. We extend this literature by using gender socialization theory and agency theory to examine the earnings management behavior of female Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) conditional on their equity incentives. We show that female CEOs do not necessarily reduce earnings management. At lower levels of equity-based compensation, female CEOs manipulate earnings to a lesser degree than their male counterparts. However, at higher levels of equity-based compensation, female and male CEOs exhibit very similar earnings management behaviors. Thus, given high equity incentives, all CEOs - regardless of gender - undertake a greater degree of earnings management activities. Consequently, there is little evidence that the gender of a CEO mitigates the propensity to increase the value of equity-based compensation by manipulating earnings. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Using a sample of 22,839 US firm-year observations over the 1991-2012 period, we find that high CSR firms pay more dividends than low CSR firms. The analysis of individual components of CSR provides strong support for this main finding: five of the six individual dimensions are also associated with high dividend payout. When analyzing the stability of dividend payout, our results show that socially irresponsible firms adjust dividends more rapidly than socially responsible firms do: dividend payout is more stable in high CSR firms. These findings are robust to alternative assumptions and model specifications, alternative measures of dividend, additional control, and several approaches to address endogeneity. Overall, our results are consistent with the expectation that high CSR firms may use dividend policy to manage the agency problems related to overinvestment in CSR. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates the role of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in restraining earnings management activities of firms under varying levels of investor protection. Firms manage their earnings less when independent FIIs are among their shareholders, especially for firms in which monitoring is more valuable - firms in weak investor protection countries and when firms have greater growth opportunities. These effects are robust to a quasi-exogenous shock to FIIs' shareholdings, unobserved firm heterogeneity, and alternative earning management measures. FIIs are associated with an increase in foreign director presence on corporate boards and audit committees. (c) 2018, Academy of International Business.

Stewardship theory is a popular alternative to agency theory for studying family firm governance. Despite its contributions to management and family business studies, stewardship theory's assumptions limit its realism and relevance. Using agency theory as a standard of comparison, I discuss stewardship theory's model of man and its assumptions concerning goal alignment and control systems. I also discuss stewardship theory's lack of assumptions about bounded rationality and pre-employment situations since the neglect of those issues reduce its realism and relevance. Based on this discussion, I argue that to increase its realism and relevance, stewardship theory's assumptions should be revised. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This study examines the impact of CEO duality on firms' internal capital allocation efficiency. We observe that when the CEO is also chair of the board, diversified firms make inefficient investments, as they allocate more capital to business segments with relatively low growth opportunities over segments with high growth opportunities. The adverse impact of CEO duality on investment efficiency prevails only among firms that face high agency problems, as captured by high free cash flows, staggered board structure and low board independence. Depending on the severity of the agency problem, CEO duality is associated with a decrease in industry-adjusted investment in high-growth segments of 1% to 2.1% over the following year, relative to that in low-growth segments. However, CEOs' equity-based compensation curbs the negative effect of CEO duality on internal capital allocation efficiency. Overall, the findings of this study offer strong support for the agency theory and postulate the internal capital allocation policy as an important channel through which CEO duality lowers firm value in diversified firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the deeply rooted relationships between corporate governance (CG) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure as two complementary mechanisms used by companies to reinforce the link with stakeholders and whether the extent of CSR disclosures made by Palestinian non-financial-listed companies during the period from 2013 to 2016 is associated with CG practices. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis technique was used to extract and measure CSR information from annual reports of 33 companies listed on the Palestine Stock Exchange (PEX). Therefore, CSR disclosure index was constructed using 32 items divided into four categories as a measure of the extent of CSR disclosure in the firm's annual reports. OLS regression was performed to test the association between CG and the extent of CSR disclosure in this longitudinal study. Findings: Panel data reveal that the level of CSR reporting has slightly increased over the study period. Further, the results also show that the level of CSR disclosure is positively and significantly affected by board size and independence, while gender diversity has a positive but statistically insignificant influence. Additionally, CEO duality is negatively and significantly correlated with CSR disclosures. Research limitations/implications: The study designs are limited to the Palestinian non-financial-listed firms. Furthermore, the generalisation of the findings might be restricted solely to the listed companies working in similar socioeconomic status. Practical implications: The findings of this study can draw policy-makers' attention in developing countries, particularly in the Arab world, to meet the increasing need for updating the regulatory and institutional framework in the vein of CG reform and the related regulatory policies to promote the efficiency of CSR practices. Social implications: More efforts should be made to strengthen the awareness of the Palestinian listed companies of the advantages of CSR reporting on social reality. Thus, from a management perspective, companies have to take equally into account the financial and social outcomes of CSR activities. Originality/value: Empirical evidence on the nexus between CG and CSR disclosure from countries affected by socio-political instability is extremely limited. This study bridges this research gap and contributes theoretically and practically to the CSR literature by providing empirical evidence from a developing country with a unique business environment.

Research Summary: We analyze power relationships in subsidiaries of multinational corporations. We explain how despite many advances in the literature, there is still an unresolved debate with respect to the critical question of whether subsidiary power is loaned or owned. We develop an overarching framework that encompasses both agency theory and resource dependence theory as the two pillars to understand decision-making by managers in subsidiaries. We propose that agency theory applies more when the subsidiary's decision rights are "loaned" by headquarters, while resource dependence theory applies more when the subsidiary "owns" its decision rights. We also explain how subsidiary evolution integrates the arguments of these two theories. Agency appears to apply earlier while resource dependence is more relevant at later stages. Managerial Summary: We provide a framework that helps address the challenges of managing power relationships in subsidiaries of multinational firms. Traditionally, studies have proposed to explain these relationships using either agency theory and the idea that subsidiary managers need to be controlled by headquarters or resource dependence and the idea that subsidiary managers can chart their own path. We solve this conflict by proposing that agency theory applies when the subsidiary's decision rights are "loaned" by headquarters, while resource dependence theory applies when the subsidiary "owns" its decision rights. We also explain how the analysis of subsidiary evolution integrates the arguments of these two theories as agency seems to apply earlier in the evolution of the subsidiary while resource dependence seems to apply at a later stage.

The internationalization of firms has led to boards becoming more international as well. In this study, we investigate the consequences of board internationalization. In particular, by drawing on research on language and board dynamics, we identify theory-based reasons why board internationalization could increase, or decrease, earnings management practices. We use agency theory, stressing how board internationalization may positively or negatively affect monitoring quality of boards. Next to agency theory, we use theories explaining how language differences in the boardroom complicates communication and how differences in language structures (referred to as linguistic relativity in the literature) affect directors' perception and detection of earnings management practices. Using a sample of 3249 firm-year observations representing 586 non-financial listed Nordic firms during 2001-2008, we find that the presence of non-Nordic foreign directors on the board is associated with significantly higher levels of earnings management. Our analysis indicates that this effect is driven by language-related factors, as well as by the level of foreign board members' accounting knowledge. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd

The present study unpacks the relationship between non-profit organizations' (NPOs) governance and organizational effectiveness by investigating the mediating role of volunteers' organizational identity (OI) and their organizational commitment. While management scholars have traditionally focused on for-profit organizations to investigate the mechanisms underlying governance related issues, noteworthy insights may be derived from the analysis of NPOs due to the emerging societal importance of the Third Sector. Stakeholders are progressively requiring a better definition and implementation of NPOs' governance, to ensure their effective and long-term sustainability at the service of the community. However, the extant literature has mainly focused on NPOs' board mechanisms, thus neglecting the critical stakeholders that play a crucial role in the governance of these organizations, such as volunteers. Building on an "enlightened" stakeholder theory perspective, this study proposes and empirically tests a conceptual model that explains the linkages between NPOs' governance effectiveness and organizational effectiveness. Specifically, volunteers' OI and commitment to the NPO are hypothesized as the underlying mechanisms explaining such a relationship. Bootstrapped multi-mediation analysis was used on a sample of 300 respondents who volunteered in NPOs located in 10 Italian provinces. Results confirmed the role of OI and volunteers' commitment as partially mediating variables on the relationship between NPOs' governance effectiveness and organizational effectiveness. Both theoretical and practical implications for NPOs' managers are provided, along with suggestions for future research by stressing the importance of the NPO governance phenomenon and the significant role played by volunteers.

Focal companies have to manage both first-tier suppliers and lower-tier suppliers in order to prevent reputational damage due to sustainability violations in their supply chains. However, the involvement of sub-suppliers in supplier management practices creates new challenges, which can be managed more effectively in collaboration with other firms. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore from an extended agency theory perspective how companies collaborate within assessment sharing strategic alliances (ASSAs) to manage suppliers with respect to sustainability and to reveal the resultant effects on the management of suppliers within multi-tier supply chains. Therefore, an embedded multiple case study with multiple units of analysis was conducted. Results show that, dependent on the experience in ASSAs, supplier assessment and optionally supplier collaboration practices are executed collaboratively among the members of those strategic alliances to improve suppliers' compliance with the focal company's corporate sustainability standards. However, the configuration of jointly executed activities as well as membership conditions vary between strategic alliances and consequently influence the effects on supplier management. Nevertheless, the observations revealed that the causes for agency risk, namely information asymmetry and goal conflicts, can be mitigated through collaboration within ASSAs and thus multi-tier suppliers' compliance with corporate sustainability standards is fostered.

Purpose: The aim of the paper is to examine the association of corporate governance (CG), the firms' characteristics and the financial performance of firms operating in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region after Arab Spring. The study focuses on CG, exemplified by boards' composition and ownership structure. It also explores the possible moderating effects of environmental social and governance characteristics (ESG), leverage and size on the relationship between CG and the company's performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using Thomson-Reuters database, a sample of 67 firms was extracted in the MENA region to measure CG and financial performance post Arab Spring from 2012 to 2016. Panel GLS regression random effects is used to quantify the relationship; robustness is checked by using several alternative regressions and specifications to the performance measure. Findings: The results reveal that board independence (BI) is negatively correlated with firm profitability but ownership concentration and board gender diversification contribute to profits. When firms that voluntarily form a governance committee are examined, ownership is less concentrated. We obtain a stronger impact of good governance on performance in these firms: board composition, in general, and workers' satisfaction generate more profits; and undertaking ESG activities become a more dispensable activity. The effect of board size (BS) and forming a governance committee are studied and ensuing recommendations are drawn. In addition, relevant internal control of firms' characteristics that strongly predict firms' market values are discussed in the context of agency and stewardship theories. Originality/value: Despite the fact that governance-performance nexus has been extensively discussed and examined, the focus of this volume of research is on western developed countries. The growing economies of the MENA countries, and the limited governance-performance literature in the MENA context have created a demand to understand the governance environment in these countries and its influence on firm's performance. In this region where firms' owners are mainly family members, governments and/or institutions, governance is typically weak; moreover, ownership concentration is expected to guarantee good performance, as the role of independent directors becomes ineffective. For firms where ownership is more diluted, a sound governance system should be established to replace ownership concentration, and to more efficiently monitor management, and consequently improve firm performance. Therefore, this study not only contributes a summary of the prevailing corporate structure in MENA. Moreover, it explains the settings where both the stewardship and agency theories apply in MENA firms. Some recommendation on the importance of changes to the existing governance rules are highlighted in terms of more rules requiring board independence, board gender diversity, limits on board size and establishing governance committees.

The purpose of this study consists in analyzing the existing literature on international business from all the research papers published in Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS) during the period of time comprised between 2000 and 2015. The authors apply bibliometric methods to that end -in particular, document citation and co-citation analyses (DCAs)- so that they can try and identify the main research lines within the aforementioned scientific field or domain; in other words, the 'intellectual structure' of the discipline examined. Social networks analysis was also used to carry out the representation or visualization of such structure or knowledge base. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the research undertaken, since the study field still keeps its characteristic diversity and interdisciplinarity or the need to integrate a variety of theoretical frameworks or approaches into the development of a widely-accepted theory about the field under study become evident. Amongst these theories would be the new institutional theory, the strategic theory or perspective or others such as the transaction cost theory or the agency theory, applied to the context of internationalization and to the field of international business, on whose integration the future development of this field may largely depend.

This study empirically investigates the interrelationship between pay and performance of CEOs/board of directors in an emerging market, Pakistan. The study uses GMM approach to account for the problem of potential endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity that arises due to the potential reverse causality (pay and performance)for a sample of non-financial firms listed in the KSE over the period of 2009-2016. This study provides evidence that the pay-performance framework supports the agency theory whereby CEOs/board of directors are compensated for their prior level of market-based performance. In addition, it weakly supports the notion of the steward/tournament theory. Thus, CEOs/board director's remuneration is highly persistent and takes time to adjust to long-run equilibrium.

Organizational studies have widely debated the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance. Some papers have dealt with managerial satisfaction and businesses' performance adopting agency theory to interpret the results. However, no studies have yet considered the relationship between the satisfaction levels of an environmental manager and corporate environmental performance. This paper thus analyses the role played by the environmental manager's satisfaction in enhancing corporate environmental performance and reputation. The paper uses data from a survey of 412 Eco Management and Audit Scheme registered organizations. The results show a positive relationship between managerial satisfaction and environmental performance, whereas no such positive relationship was found when considering eco-innovation performance. In addition, the environmental manager's satisfaction has a positive and indirect influence on the corporate environmental reputation. These results contribute to the literature on agency theory and aim to extend the debate between job satisfaction and job performance to the sustainable business field.

This article deals with environmentally-oriented crowdfunding projects. Drawing on agency-theory, it analyses the implementation of such projects, after they have been successfully financed via-crowdfunding. More specifically, this article firstly investigates whether environmental ventures implement the measures they have advertised during the crowdfunding campaign. Secondly, it examines in how far environmentally-oriented ventures disclose the environmental benefits that have been created based on the implementation of the measure financed via crowdfunding. It thereby uses data gained from a platform specialized in funding projects that serve combatting climate change. The results show that the measures advertised are commonly implemented. However, only few projects disclose information on the actual environmental benefits created. Thus, funders are unable to evaluate whether the environmental benefits advertised during the crowdfunding campaign are actually realized. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend the understanding and application of interactive ties creating value through board characteristics, ownership concentration and firms' performance by using a contingent theoretical-based framework based on the amalgamation of resource dependence theory, stakeholder theory, agency theory, stewardship theory and institutional theory in a country with weak political environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study includes a sample of an unbalanced panel of 309 non-financial sector firms listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) from 2005 to 2016. In order to address the issue of unobserved heterogeneity, simultaneous and dynamic endogeneity, the current study employed the technique Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data estimation under assumptions of GMM (Arellano-Bond, 1991). Findings: The empirical results suggest that the presence of concentrated ownership moderates and helps to overcome the agency problems through different governance mechanisms (such as board size, independent directors and CEO duality). The larger boards are found to be beneficial whereas the higher representation of independent directors in the board is found to be detrimental for Pakistani firms. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study are, first the current study has analyzed public-listed firms from the non-financial sector, and second the study has only focused on the financial aspect of the performance. The future research could include other proxies of corporate governance and ownership structure such as board diversity and meetings, audit committee and managerial ownership, etc. Practical implications: The research also helps Pakistani policy makers in numerous ways. First, the current study confirms the monitoring and expropriation effect of ownership concentration in corporate governance and performance mechanism. Thus, the Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) should make such policies which protect the corporate board against the influence of concentrated ownership so that the interests of the minority shareholders are protected. Second, SECP should ensure that all the listed firms declare a comprehensive profile of their directors (such as academic qualification, age and experience) in their annual reports for the better understanding of the governance-performance mechanism. Originality/value: The current study augments the emerging body of literature on corporate governance and firm performance mechanism through the amalgamation and testing of existing theories in an emerging economy like Pakistan by using wider and newer data set.

Prior research has advanced classical agency theory to account for various characteristics of headquarters (HQ)-subsidiary relations in the multinational corporation (MNC). In an attempt to contribute to this line of research, in this paper, we propose and test an agency model for HQ-subsidiary relations inside the MNC. Drawing on classical agency assumptions, we develop a baseline hypothesis that links informal controls (i.e., socialization), HQ-subsidiary goal conflicts, and the HQ's use of formal controls (i.e., behavioral controls). We subsequently introduce an important boundary condition, which reflects subsidiaries' internal agency relations with subsidiary CEOs as second principals. More specifically, we argue that the baseline relationship only holds under low levels of second principal power. To test our model, we employed a unique study design with three parallel surveys addressing the agents and the two principals involved in 131 agency relations within one MNC. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study explores a determinant of escalation of commitment when a personal relationship is present between managers of buying and supplying firms in the supply chain context from an agency theory perspective. As there is very limited research in this area, a qualitative, case study method, employing ten semi-structured interviews with senior managers of buying firms was undertaken. Findings from this study reveal that higher interpersonal trust which develops as a result of a personal relationship between managers of buying and supplying firms compels managers of buying firms to escalate their commitment. Results also unveil that escalation of commitment increases operational risk of buying firms. Buying firms can use this finding to understand how and why their managers engage in an escalation of commitment when they share a personal relationship with a manager from the supplying firm. The paper concludes by discussing research limitations and future research directions. Copyright (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Our paper draws attention to a neglected channel of corruption--the bribe payments by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). This is an important phenomenon as bribe payments by SOEs fruitlessly waste national resources, compromising public welfare and national prosperity. Using a large dataset of 30,249 firms from 50 countries, we show that, in general, SOEs are less likely to pay bribes for achieving organizational objectives owing to their political connectivity. However, in deteriorated institutional environments, SOEs may be subjected to potential managerial rent-seeking behaviors, which disproportionately increase SOE bribe propensity relative to privately owned enterprises. Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of fostering democracy and rule of law, reducing prevalence of corruption and shortening power distance in reducing the incidence of SOE bribery.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the moderating role of firm size on the relationship between corporate governance (CG) and intellectual capital (IC) efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology was a pooled data for three years (2012-2014) for 171 listed firms, resulting in 489 observations. Findings: The findings revealed that the inclusion of firm size as a moderating variable has influenced positively only the relationship between CG principles and capital employed efficiency (CEE). Further, the finding showed that the two IC components namely, human capital efficiency and structural capital efficiency, tend to be higher with firms that high level of CG adoption. However, CEE tends to be higher with firms that have lower level of CG adoption. Other finding shows that CG index was significant with the three IC components. Originality/value: Such information will help the stakeholders, investors, decision-makers, regulators, policymakers and scholars to improve their knowledge about IC. Furthermore, it will be useful for firms to place their priorities regarding the internal system and financial plans for effective and efficient use of CG and IC.

This article presents a literature review of 49 empirical studies on key audit matter (KAM) disclosure in audit reports. The study involves a structured literature review on KAM disclosure based on the reactions of stakeholders. The limitations of former studies and useful recommendations for research are stressed. Five major streams of empirical research that analyze the impact of KAM disclosure on stakeholders' reactions are focused: (1) shareholders (e.g. investors' perceptions of auditors' responsibility and litigation, value relevance and investors' decisions); (2) debtholders (e.g. loan contracting terms); (3) external auditors (e.g. audit processes and audit fees); (4) boards of directors (e.g. earnings management); and (5) other stakeholders (e.g. informational value for suppliers and customers). The authors stress that most of the included studies use experimental or archival data and analyze the impact of KAM disclosure on investor reactions in a US-American setting. As the international standard setters assume a positive impact of KAM on stakeholder reactions, mixed empirical results are found. Although there are some indications of decreased earnings management behavior, most studies find no significant changes in auditor behavior. Furthermore, there are many insignificant results with regard to shareholders' reaction in line with our stakeholder and behavioral agency framework. The literature review is especially useful for management decisions, because firm reputation May be positively or negatively influenced by KAM regulations. (c) Patrick Velte, Jakob Issa, 2019.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between earnings management and the efficiency of French firms' investments. It also investigates the moderating effect of board of directors' features on this relation. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a sample of French listed companies from 2011 to 2015, i.e. 435 firm-year observations. The authors use the instrumental variable method based on 2SLS models. Findings: The authors show that there is a negative relationship between earnings management and investment efficiency. This finding supports the theoretical perspective of the agency theory, as the propensity of firms to engage in earnings management practices is associated with high managerial opportunistic behavior and asymmetric information issues, leading to the problem of under and overinvestment. The findings also show that board size, independence and gender diversity are positively associated with investment efficiency. These board features moderate the relationship between earnings management and investment efficiency suggesting that earnings quality plays a more prominent role in guiding managers to choose the right investments when the corporate governance environment is strong. Research limitations/implications: The negative relationship between earnings management and investment efficiency suggests that firms with lower earnings quality are exposed to high information asymmetries. They are then more likely to deviate from their expected level of investments. In addition, the results highlight the importance of corporate financial transparency and board monitoring to reduce agency costs and ensure the efficiency of corporate investments, particularly in a setting where investors' interests are poorly protected. Originality/value: This paper is the first to the best of the authors' knowledge to examine the effect of earnings management, a metric for earnings quality, on the corporate investment efficiency in France. Besides, they extend previous literature by investigating how board features are able to monitor managerial actions and decisions and therefore to moderate the effect of earnings management on investment efficiency.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between the readability of annual reports and corporate performance in Qatari listed firms while controlling for a firm's competitive position, governance structure and specific features such as size, age and industry type. Design/methodology/approach: This study relies on both agency theory and legitimacy theory to develop testable hypotheses. It uses a sample of 126 firm-year listed companies in the Qatar Stock Exchange to test obfuscation in the annual reports through examining the association between the readability of Narrative Disclosures (NDs) and corporate profitability, financial risk and agency costs for the period from 2014-2016. Findings: The findings show that firms with higher annual report readability are more profitable and have lower agency costs, which is an indication of the existence of "obfuscation." Qatari firms may use narrative complexity as a disclosure strategy to enhance their image and consequently maintain their social legitimacy. Research limitations/implications: Although the study findings suffer from limited global generalization, they can be generalized across Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Thus, future cross-country research is encouraged. Practical implications: The findings encourage Qatari policymakers to instate a policy for "Plain English" writing to make NDs easy to read by international investors. Originality/value: This study is one of very few studies that examines the readability of annual reports in emerging market economies, i.e. Qatar. The study contributes to the paucity of research that examines English-written annual reports in non-English speaking countries. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Interlocking directorates, in which companies are linked by the directors that serve on their boards, exist globally. It is an expression of hegemonic power exercised by the elites of a society, and has been studied with great interest by organizational sociologists, management scholars and financial economists. The interest emanates from the effect that interlocks have on wealth creation and distribution, and from the perspective that interlocks can tell us how elites in a society are networked. Although diverse theoretical perspectives have informed the research on interlocking directorates, this review shows that the Anglo-American perspective dominates. This dominance is notable not only in the volume of Anglo-American studies, but also in theories employed by international studies. For example, most international studies use agency theory to investigate the welfare implications of interlocks, but many countries do not use the Anglo-American legal regime, which is the basis for agency theory. This paper expands the theoretical basis of the review to include class hegemony and resource dependence, to articulate better the causes and consequences of interlocks in the international context. The paper also extends theory by showing that institutions have an important influence on interlocks, so that the latter can be welfare-depleting in one institutional setting, while welfare-enhancing in another. The review concludes by discussing the implication for future research. (c) 2018 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The extant literature reports mixed and inconclusive findings concerning the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance. To provide incremental insight, this paper aims to investigate whether the bi-directional relationships among managerial ownership, board independence and firm performance are determined. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a data set consisting of 9,302 firm-year observations of Australian listed companies during 2005-2015 and a three-stage least squares simultaneous equation model to test the bi-directional relationships. Findings: The results indicate that both managerial ownership and board independence inversely affect firm performance and vice versa. In addition, board independence is negatively correlated with managerial ownership and vice versa. Practical implications: The convergence-of-interests hypothesis can be achieved by manipulating managerial ownership through making contingent payments. Board independence, as a voluntary regime in Australia, can provide additional flexibility to corporate decision makers. Originality/value: This study provides additional evidence by using the convergence-of-interests hypothesis vis-a-vis the entrenchment hypothesis to examine the relationship between managerial ownership and firm performance, and tests the association of board independence and firm performance using the explanation of agency theory vis-a-vis stewardship theory.

Purpose: This paper aims to demonstrate how financial leverage impacts firm investment and the extent to which this relationship is conditional on the level of information asymmetry as well as growth. Design/methodology/approach: The paper relies on data from 2,403 Indian firms during the period 1995-2014, generating a total of 19,544 firm-year observations. Analysis is conducted by using various panel econometric techniques. Findings: Drawing insights from agency theories, the paper uncovers that financial leverage is negatively and significantly related to firm investment. It is also observed that the impact of financial leverage on firm investment is significant for high information asymmetric firms. Finally, the paper shows that the relationship between leverage and firm investment is significant for low-growth firms. However, no significant relationship is found between leverage and investment for high-growth firms. Originality/value: This paper provides fresh evidence on the leverage-investment nexus and, to the authors' knowledge, it the first paper to examine the extent to which this leverage-investment relationship is driven by the level of information asymmetry.

Considering specific contextual differences (in laws, governance attributes, and CEO pay policies) found between the Anglo-American and the European corporate governance models and controlling for institutional attributes, ownership structures, and firm's features characterizing the two settings, we aim to explore if there is a link between CEO pay slice (CPS) and corporate social responsibility (CSR). We follow Bebchuk et al. () to measure CPS. We consider sustainability indicators as proxy to capture CSR. Sustainability indicators are gathered from Global Reporting Initiative of sustainability standards (GRI's) report. Data cover the period 2010-2017 and consist of 1,440 U.S.-Canadian and Spanish-French firm-year observations. American and Canadian (Spanish and French) firms are considered as to refer to the Anglo-American (European) corporate governance model. Durbin-Wu-Hausman test is ruled to address endogeneity problem of dual variables and supports consistent null hypotheses of fixed effects model. Under the agency theory's "bright side" paradigm, univariate and multivariate cross-country analysis supports that CPS is positively associated with firm's initiatives to engage in CSR and that sustainability is more pronounced under stronger investor protection, strict law enforcement, and higher corporate governance quality. Robustness checks reveal that (a) the deferred CPS-CSR causal effect seems higher for option-based compensation than that for stock-based compensation and (b) within the options (stocks) rewards, unvested options (restricted stocks) are the most effective to enhance firm's CSR practices.

The effectiveness of monitoring and incentive alignment as mechanisms for controlling agency costs have been explored separately and in combination, with monitoring substituting for weaknesses in incentive alignment and vice versa; this equates to positive substitution when describing how monitoring and incentive alignment interact to influence shareholder agency costs. We draw upon behavioral agency theory and findings from finance research to offer further theoretical insight into how these mechanisms interact to influence agency costs. Our results suggest that CEO earnings management aimed at preserving their equity wealth (an incentive alignment mechanism) is accentuated by higher levels of concentrated institutional ownership, thereby imposing agency costs on less informed investors. Thus, in addition to being substitutes in controlling agency costs, as previously suggested, monitoring may accentuate the perverse effects of incentive alignment, equating to negative reinforcement, rather than positive substitution. Yet this effect is negated in the absence of CEO power due to dual occupation of the board and CEO roles. We discuss implications of these findings for theory and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

The negative association between risk and return is paradoxical because risk-averse managers should only expose themselves to higher risk for higher returns. The paradox is resolved, however, if we recognize that risk-averse managers may be taking decisions that pose risk for shareholders and not for their own careers. We draw on the career concerns literature to explain why decisions that pose risk to shareholder returns can enhance managerial careers. We provide evidence that the risk-return paradox is exacerbated by agency problems that contribute to career concerns (i.e., CEO career horizon), and mitigated by various governance mechanisms that curb the agency problem by aligning managers with shareholders (such as monitoring by the market for corporate control, large block owners, institutional owners, vigilant board, and CEO incentive alignment). Our study sheds light on the role of career concerns and corporate governance in resolving the risk-return paradox. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study aims to empirically investigate the effect of financial reporting quality (FRQ) and audit quality (AQ) on the investment efficiency (IE) for the firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange during the period 2007-2014. Design/methodology: The authors use pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) regression which cluster at the firm and year level to test the hypotheses. For sensitivity check, the authors also account for reverse causality and cross-sectional dependence by using the GMM and FGLS regression methods. Furthermore, the authors built their theoretical arguments based on alignment hypothesis of the agency theory and resource-based view of the firm. Findings: The findings suggest that higher FRQ and AQ are associated with higher IE. The results for these particular estimates are robust when tested using alternative estimation techniques. Overall, the outcomes of this study are in line with the arguments presented by the alignment hypothesis of the agency theory and resource-based view of the firm. Practical implications: This study is fruitful for policymakers' and investors. This study finds that the audit done by the Big 4 also reduces the information gap and, thus, reduces the moral hazard and adverse selection problems, thereby enhancing the IE. Originality: The authors extend the debate on determinates of IE and highlight two monitoring mechanisms: FRQ and AQ. The authors further extend the literature on the economic consequences of AQ in terms of IE, as proposed by Francis (2011). For the first time, this study investigates the impact of AQ on IE in a setting where minority shareholder risk of exploitation is high relative to other markets in Asia.

Ownership structure has been identified as a critical governance component due to its effect on firm performance. Within ownership structure, issues of institutional shareholders, cash flow rights of controlling owners, and ownership discrepancy have not been examined in the tourism sector. The current study uses listed tourism firms in Taiwan to empirically examine how these three variables influence firm performance. Results show a positive effect on return on assets and Tobin's Q from the presence of institutional shareholders and cash flow rights of controlling owners. Ownership discrepancy has a negative effect on Tobin's Q. The present results can make contributions to agency theory and principles for good governance. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Sustainability-oriented CEO compensation is being widely discussed among policy makers, corporate practice, and academia. To date, management literature has yielded a growing body of empirical results on the determinants and effects of sustainable CEO compensation. Primarily, empirical studies analyze whether and to what extent sustainability-related issues determine the design of sustainable CEO compensation and how sustainability-oriented CEO compensation impacts corporate performance. However, the scattered nature of this research field has impeded an overarching empirical substantiation of the arguments in favor or against a sustainable CEO compensation. This structured literature review addresses this gap by analyzing 37 empirical studies on the key determinants and effects of sustainable CEO compensation. Using a multi-level analysis, we contribute to the discussion on sustainable CEO compensation by systematically identifying the central empirical insights and methodological and content-related foci within this research area. In summary, this review provides regulators, boards, management, investors, and other stakeholders with academic evidence on the determinants and effects of sustainability-oriented CEO compensation design. In addition to critically reflecting on the current state of research, we recommend paths for future research on sustainable CEO compensation. (c) 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Using the behavioral agency model, we analyze how two compensation design characteristics, pay-performance sensitivity and duration of CEO compensation (taking into account multiple vesting periods), affect corporate social performance. We find that the performance sensitivity of CEO pay is negatively associated with poor social performance but also negatively affects strong social performance. These results suggest that pay-performance sensitivity increases the relevance of potential negative consequences of poor social performance. However, the 'insurance' benefits of strong social performance may also become less relevant. With respect to the duration of CEO compensation, we find that it reduces poor social performance. This finding confirms arguments that a long-term compensation time horizon increases the perceived threat that the negative effects of poor social performance will become visible. With our findings, we integrate behavioral agency theory with the traditional stakeholder views. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The prime objective of this study is to investigate the legitimate role of corporate boards and corporate social responsibility on the performance of Malaysian listed companies during 2006-2017. Elements of corporate boards include board size, board independence and board diversity, whereas corporate social responsibility (CSR) dimensions constitute marketplace, environment, community and workplace. Both accounting-based (return on assets [ROA], return on equity [ROE]) and market-based (earnings per share [EPS]) performance measures have been employed for measuring performance. Pooled ordinary least squares method (OLS) and multiple regressions are used to estimate the dataset. Findings reveal larger board size and higher board independence positively affect firm performance and significantly legitimise the board role in firms. However, the presence of women on Malaysian corporate boards does not legitimate the performance due to their lower percentage on board, hence insignificantly affecting firm value. Additionally, out of four CSR dimensions, only marketplace is positively and significantly related to EPS and negatively and significantly related to ROA. Conversely, environment, community and workplace are insignificantly related to all performance measures, leaving firms in a questionable legitimate state. This study embraces support from agency theory, resource dependence theory, legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory. However, this research raises questionable insights for regulatory bodies and academicians in the form of corporate legitimacy. (c) 2019 Institute of Public Enterprise.

Much of the management compensation literature focuses either on the level and structure of executives' pay or the pay-for-performance sensitivity in a set of corporate governance structure in the Western economies. In this study, we examine the interactive effect of executive compensation, firm performance and corporate governance in different institutional and governance settings of an emerging market economy. Capturing monitoring and incentive alignment aspects as suggested in agency theory, we argue that in a markedly different executive compensation system in Thailand, the interrelationships between executive compensation, firm performance and corporate governance would exhibit some similarities to those found in developed economies. While there remains sparse research on how these relationships operate in Thailand, using data for 432 publicly listed Thai firms between 2000 and 2011, we find evidence of a reciprocal positive significant relationship between compensation and performance, as well as between corporate governance and performance. However, a reciprocal relationship is not found between corporate governance and compensation, which shows a mono-directional positive significant relationship running from corporate governance to compensation. These findings show similarities with those of developed economies and provide support for the need for an effective governance system to determine optimal executive compensation that will enhance firm performance and value. Our findings thus add some potentially noteworthy dimensions to the compensation literature that are especially important to policy makers and other stakeholders, and aiming to shape an optimal governance system in the emerging markets around the world.

Research Question/Issue: Although there is no unified theory that can explain the relationship between CEO power and corporate risk, the empirical evidence generally finds a positive association. This study argues that market competition and corporate governance play critical roles in influencing this relationship. Research Findings/Insights: Using a large panel of nonfinancial U.S. corporations for the period 1992-2015, I find that CEO power is positively associated with total and idiosyncratic measures of risk. However, this positive association remains significant only when market competition is high or corporate governance is strong. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The research design of this study combines the predictions of agency theory, the behavioral agency model, and prospect theory to further our understanding of the relationship between CEO power and corporate risk, including consideration of how competition and corporate governance influence this relationship. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The empirical evidence presented in this study can help boards to more accurately gauge when CEO power is most beneficial in terms of optimal levels of corporate risk and to better understand the relationship between power and risk. The results suggest that boards should grant more power to their CEOs when their firms operate in high-competition markets or have strong corporate governance in place. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Following the agency theory, this paper contributes to the literature on board independence as a mechanism to mitigate agency costs by investigating the impact of independent minority directors on firm value in a principal-principal setting. Independent minority directors might alleviate agency costs associated to the risk of self-dealing transactions and, in turn, increase firm value. However, since non-controlling shareholders are also self-interested, particularly for firms characterized by strong uncertainty about future financial results and high information asymmetry, independent minority directors might negatively impact firm value by creating frictions within the board, increasing the risks of potential hold-ups by minority shareholders and limiting the ex-ante incentives of the block-holder to undertake profitable idiosyncratic investments. By examining a sample of Italian listed companies, we find some evidence about a positive relationship between the proportion of independent minority directors and firm value. Although weaker, a positive relationship between the proportion of independent minority directors and firm value is also found for firms characterized by high information asymmetry and--therefore--exposed to the risk of opportunistic actions by minority shareholders against the dominant shareholder. Our results shed new light on the relationship between board composition and firm value in a concentrated ownership setting, revealing the role played by independent minority directors in mitigating agency costs.

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been subjected to considerable public debate. In particular, this debate has concerned PPP financing and its implications. Using insights from agency theory, this study aims to develop a theoretical understanding of PPP financing. The following research question is investigated: How does the privatization of financing decrease or increase agency costs in social infrastructure PPPs? A comparative case study consisting of four Norwegian PPP projects with different financial configurations is undertaken. The findings suggest that the private sector is risk averse, increasing the cost of capital. In addition, private financing does not seem to have the intended incentive effect.

This analysis considers the dimensions of financialisation of the international economy and how this has produced a more intensive and integrated mode of accumulation. With the increasing translation of Anglo-American listed corporations into financial entities, how the dominant shareholder primacy mode of corporate governance has served to compound inequality is examined. The damaging impact of maximising shareholder value is investigated, both in terms of the long term prospects of corporations, but also in aggressively producing increased inequality in the economy and society. Finally the ultimate paradoxical outcome of agency theory and shareholder value is highlighted as the explosion of executive reward in the last two decades in the Anglo-American countries. Finally the possibilities for reform and change towards more responsible and equitable approaches are considered. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: High ownership concentration makes controlling blockholders powerful enough to use private benefits of control and able to shape the corporate governance system to favor their own interests. This paper aims to examine the effect of the nature of the ultimate firm owner on the quality of corporate governance in Brazil. Design/methodology/approach: Econometric models are estimated to assess whether the nature of the ultimate controlling shareholder affects the quality of the corporate governance system. Models are estimated using panel data methodology with coefficients estimated by the generalized method of moments system estimator. Findings: The results show that the absence of a controlling shareholder has a positive effect on corporate governance, whereas the presence of a controlling blockholder, or a shareholder agreement among a few large shareholders, has a negative effect. This adverse effect holds when the controlling blockholder is a family or another firm. The findings are in line with the expropriation effect given that weaker corporate governance system facilitates controlling shareholders' ability to extract private benefits of control. The findings also give support to the substitution effect as powerful blockholders take on the management monitoring function by weakening the board. Originality value: Following important previous literature, the study investigates the effect of the nature of large controlling shareholders on the adoption of good corporate governance practices. The work provides additional evidence on the effect of the nature of large controlling shareholders on the quality of the corporate governance system in Brazil, taking into account the main kinds of controlling blockholders present in that market. The findings give support to both the expropriation and substitution hypotheses highlighting the presence of the principal-principal agency model in an important emerging market, Brazil.

The prime objective of the current study is to explore the relationship between supply chain operational performance and firm supply chain management in the reference of agency theory. To further explain the role of agency theory, in the supply chain management we have examined the direct and indirect impact of supply chain operational performance on firm supply chain management. The SMART-PLS is used to achieve the objective of the current stud. The data is collected from the operation managers, production managers and finance managers of manufacturing firms listed in Indonesian Stock Exchange. The results of the study have shown a great deal of agreement with our proposed hypothesis. The corporate governance index comprising of board characteristics appears as a moderator in the relationship between supply chain operational performance and firm supply chain management. The results of the current study are also providing support to agency theory and resource base theory. The study which is among pioneering studies on the issue will be helpful for policy makers and managers in understanding the role of agency theory in supply chain management.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the impact of two monitoring mechanisms: family ownership (FO) and financial reporting quality (FRQ) on investment efficiency (IE) over the period of 2007-2014 for listed firms on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ two-dimensional pooled OLS cluster at the firm and year level, two-stage least square regression and feasible generalized lease square regression regression methods. Findings: The findings suggest that higher FRQ and FO are associated with higher IE. Further, the authors report that higher FRQ and FO mitigate over- and under-investment. The impact of FRQ on IE is stronger (weaker) for family-controlled businesses. The results for these particular estimates are robust for alternative estimation techniques and measures of FRQ and FO. Originality/value: The study draws on both agency and behavioral agency theories and therefore contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, the authors examine a relationship between FRQ and IE. Second, the authors test the impact of FO on IE. Third, the authors test the moderating impact of FO on the relationship between FRQ and the IE of family and non-family firms in relatively less regulated emerging market.

This article presents a partial survey of the literature of the burgeoning area of cultural finance with a view of how respective investigations and results are explicitly or implicitly framed in relation to either normative institutionalism or intended rationality. Studies are examined by comparing national culture as influencing financial systems either by shaping the norms of behavior and concomitant logic of appropriateness, or, alternatively, shaping environments so as to impact the incentives for differing actors to maximize their utilities. For the cultural dimensions of the Hofstede framework, suggestions are made regarding deploying future studies within an intended rationality or normative institutionalism framework. This taxonomy also highlights the role of national culture with respect to transaction costs and agency costs, and is relevant to many cultural finance studies. The developing area of cultural finance can benefit from examining investigations, results, and discussions with regard to the contrasting perspectives of normative institutionalism and intended rationality.

Corporate boards are responsible for ensuring that managers enact policies that are in shareholders' best interests, and managers are responsible for implementing strategies that are not only profitable but also responsive to changing legal and societal demands and the resource needs of the firm. In this paper, we use the theoretical lenses of corporate social responsibility (CSR), the resource-based view, and agency theory to investigate the relationship between corporate governance structure and the implementation of supportive lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) policies. We analyze 10,233 firm-year observations and 1,594 unique firms, and our results demonstrate that LGBT-supportive policies are positively associated with firm performance. We also offer new insight into why not all firms adopt such policies. We exploit the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as an exogenous shock that increased board independence, and our difference-in-difference estimation shows that firms forced to raise board independence in 2002 were less likely to invest in LGBT-supportive policies. Results suggest that human resource management (HRM) policies can be guided by CSR and resource-based views in the pursuit of wealth maximization, but agency conflict may also be a concern for external majority boards. We discuss implications for HRM research practice and corporate governance regarding LGBT policies in organizations. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Purpose: The issue that revolves around corporate governance and corporate environmental reporting (CER) has always been an essential element deliberated upon globally. A good corporate governance mechanism instills an investor's confidence and ensures a transparent process that facilitates more disclosures and quality reporting. Precisely, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between corporate governance variables, namely, board size, board independence, board meeting (BM), risk management committee composition and CER in Nigeria. This study utilized the data obtained from the annual reports of 24 non-financial public listed companies in the Nigeria Stock Exchange comprising three sectors, namely, industrial goods, natural resources and oil & gas for the period of 2011-2015. The model of this study is theoretically based on agency theory. In analyzing data, this study utilized panel data analysis. Based on the Hausman test, the random effect model was used to examine the effect of predictors on CER. The result indicates a positive significant relationship between board independence and CER. Similarly, a positive significant relationship between BM and CER is revealed in the study. However, there is no significant relationship between other hypothesis variables and CER. Finally, the study provides suggestions for future research and several recommendations for regulators, government and accounting professional bodies. Design/methodology/approach: The data was analysed using statistics. Findings: The result indicates a positive significant relationship between board independence and CER. Similarly, a positive significant relationship between BM and CER is revealed in the study. However, there is no significant relationship between other hypothesis variables and CER. Originality/value: There are no prior studies linking risk management committee with CER. (c) 2018, Usman Shehu Aliyu.

Behavioral ethics research has focused predominantly on how the attributes of individuals influence their ethicality. Relatively neglected has been how macro-level factors such as the behavior of firms influence members' ethicality. Researchers have noted specifically that we know little about how a firm's CSR influences members' behaviors. We seek to better merge these literatures and gain a deeper understanding of the role macro-level influences have on manager's ethicality. Based on agency theory and social identity theory, we hypothesize that a company's commitment to CSR shifts managers' focus away from self-interests toward the interests of the firm, bolstering resistance to temptation. We propose this occurs through self-categorization and collective identification processes. We conduct a 2 x 2 factorial experiment in which managers make expense decisions for a company with commitment to CSR either present or absent, and temptation either present or absent. Results indicate that under temptation, managers make decisions consistent with self-interest. More importantly, we find when commitment to CSR is present, managers are more likely to make ethical decisions in the presence of temptation. Overall, this research highlights the interactive role of two key contextual factors--temptation and firm CSR commitment--in influencing managers' ethical decisions. While limited research has highlighted the positive effects that a firm's CSR has on its employees' attitudes, the current results demonstrate CSR's effects on ethical behavior and imply that through conducting and communicating its CSR efforts internally, firms can in part limit the deleterious effects of temptation on managers' decisions.

The internal audit function (IAF) is an important component of high-quality corporate governance. We study how the head of internal audit perceives the executive management team and the audit committee to rely on the IAF's work. It is not obvious from prior work or professional anecdotes whether the IAF satisfies the needs of both groups. If multiple factors influence the IAF's work, chief audit executives (CAEs) may find themselves in a situation with competing demands, which could then compromise quality for all stakeholders. Based on a unique dataset from CAEs, two logistic regression models identify factors that influence the degree to which IAF's results are perceived as being used by both executive management and the audit committee. The results show the existence of various factors that are relevant either to both groups (e.g., strategic project reports and IAF quality) or to only one (e.g., only audit committees are interested in risk management reports while only executive management teams are interested in internal control reports), depending on whether the IAF focuses on assurance or consulting work.

Past research has shown mixed results regarding the role CEO compensation plays in influencing firm financial performance in the hospitality industry. To explore this relationship further, we concomitantly examine the role of compensation and CEO attributes like education, age, tenure, functional background, and gender on firm financial performance. Our analyses are based on secondary and hand-collected data from a large and comprehensive sample of U.S. publicly traded hospitality firms. The results from panel data analyses show that CEO cash compensation is positively related to return on assets, while equity compensation is unrelated to firm performance. We further find that when CEO compensation and attributes are jointly examined, CEO compensation has a relatively lower impact on firm performance than CEO attributes do. The results imply that the hospitality industry may want to reconsider its compensation practices in order to better align the interests of managers and shareholders and motivate managers to maximize firm value.

Purpose: In order to deepen our knowledge of governance of family firms, the purpose of this paper is to focus our attention on the relation between family owners who are members of the board of directors and firm performance. Also, this study sheds more light on how the generation in charge of the family firm affects that relationship, as generational involvement may be a unique predictor of governance behavior in these firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors applied a cross-sectional ordinary least squares regression model to test the hypotheses on a sample of 313 non-listed Spanish family SMEs. The authors suggest the possibility of a non-linear relationship between the percentage of ownership by family members of the board of directors and firm performance, and specifically, the authors propose an S-shaped effect that implies two breakpoints. Findings: The authors find not only that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists, but also an S-shaped relationship between family board members' ownership and firm performance in family SMEs. Nevertheless, the results are different in comparing first-, second- and later-generation family firms. Originality/value: This is one of the few empirical studies that examine the relationship between family board ownership and firm performance in the context of non-listed family SMEs. The authors consider that the influences of family directors on the board of directors as well as the concentration of family ownership on the board of directors are worth studying in non-listed family SMEs. Moreover, previous studies have focused mainly on large listed family firms but not on unlisted ones. (c) 2019, Amaia Maseda, Txomin Iturralde, Gloria Aparicio, Lotfi Boulkeroua and Sarah Cooper.

Franchising is a growth vehicle that helps firms scale their operations. Yet, the performance implications of franchising remain inconclusive. To solve this conundrum, we contend that firm-specific attributes lead to an optimal level of franchising and that the deviation from that optimal level has important firm-level consequences. Using a sample of 64 publicly listed restaurant firms that franchise in the United States, our study integrates the risk sharing perspective with resource scarcity and agency theories to show that a failure to adhere to these theoretical prescriptions can be a financially risky proposition. For restaurant firms that franchise, our results highlight the importance of maintaining an optimal mix of franchised and firm-owned outlets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd

This research aims to show that the non-financial reporting tool collides with nexus of constraints which we will qualify as a "trilemma": (1) the constraint linked to the complexity, the irreducibility and the scalability of corporate social responsibility (2) the constraint linked to inherent stakes of non-financial reporting (3) the constraint linked to company expectations. The inscription of the tool within the nexus of constraints can be more or less effective, depending on how the points of convergence or friction are managed between the different constraints. In this way, three categories of possible pitfalls appear. Idealistic reporting, lay reporting or technical reporting. To conclude we discuss the possibility that Integrated Reporting < IR> can be an "optimal" solution between these pitfalls and the limits of this possibility.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Based on both institutionalized agency theory and meso-level theory, this study examines corporate governance disclosure in an audit firm's transparency report (TR) and whether more disclosure is associated with (a) the audit function of the country in which it is disclosed; (b) high levels of investor confidence in public interest entities (PIEs) shown in the portfolio of the audit firm; and (c) increased competition within the audit market. Research Findings/Insights: On the basis of content analysis, different measures of a corporate governance disclosure index (CGDI) are calculated for a sample of 122 auditing firms from 10 European countries over the period 2010-2012. Despite attempts at harmonizing audit practice across the EU, results confirm the role of institutional context in explaining differences among European countries. Moreover, while the CGDI reveals that the TR does improve investor confidence, no evidence was found that the new disclosure requirement unsettled audit market concentration. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Results support arguments of the institutionalized agency theory that audit firms' corporate governance disclosures depend on both firm- and country-level factors. Moreover, the interplay between these macro and meso factors explains the information asymmetry reduction that exists between auditors and shareholders, thus improving micro-level investor confidence. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The study provides an analysis of audit firm transparency based on the information disclosed in mandatory TRs. Policymakers and practitioners may benefit from the knowledge of items included in the TRs expected to impact on investor confidence. It also proposes the use of the TR for achieving market competition strategies, although it may be inefficient. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: Based on the agency theory and risk management perspective, this study aims to examine the relationship between CEOs' pay schemes and corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities in the restaurant industry. Specifically, the authors propose that CEOs with a higher proportion of equity-based compensation (EBC), which induces a greater propensity for risk-taking, are prone to indulge less in CSR. In addition, the authors investigate how institutional ownership moderates the proposed main relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study performs two-way fixed-effects models and clustered standard errors to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results of the panel analysis show a significant negative effect of CEOs' EBC on CSR. Also, the authors found a significant positive moderating effect of institutional ownership between CEOs' EBC and CSR. Originality/value: Given the lack of empirical studies that incorporate both agency theory and the risk management perspective, and given the importance of understanding the determinants of restaurant firms' CSR activities, this study expands upon the existing literature by showing the relationship between CEOs' compensation schemes and restaurant firms' CSR activities.

In the context of austerity-inspired reforms to public audit in England we investigate the extent to which audit firms mitigate management bias in public sector financial reports. A substantial body of literature finds that both public and not-for-profit managers manage 'earnings' to report small surpluses close to zero by managing deficits upwards and surpluses downwards. Under agency theory, auditors acting in the interests of their principal(s) would tend to reverse this bias. We exploit privileged access to pre-audit financial statements in the setting of the English National Health Service (NHS) to investigate the impact of audit adjustments on the pre-audit financial statements of English NHS Foundation Trusts over the period 2010-2011 to 2014-2015. We find evidence that auditors act to reverse management bias in the case of Trusts with a pre-audit deficit, but find no evidence that this is the case for Trusts with a pre-audit surplus. In the case of Trusts in surplus, these findings are consistent with auditors' interests being aligned with management, rather than principals. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize corporate entrepreneurial strategy using collaborative dynamics of contingency and agency theories, and to demonstrate how some constructs of these two theories are integrated to support long-term strategies of entrepreneurial firms in sustaining their competitive advantages and enhancing their performance. Design/methodology/approach: Review of literature on strategic entrepreneurship, firm growth, contingency and agency theories were explored to support the conceptualized framework of the entrepreneurial strategy developed in this paper. The authors adopt a vignette approach to problematize theoretical gaps identified. The vignette was also used to embody the entrepreneurial strategy matrix developed. Findings: This paper suggests that the effectiveness of corporate entrepreneurial strategies is influenced by the impacts of contingent environment and agency problem of goal conflicts. It provides some propositions for qualitative and empirical research that will extend the rigours of strategic entrepreneurship literature. Practical implications: This paper highlights the implications of understanding and adopting diverse competitive and sustenance strategies. It provides avenues for entrepreneurial firms to take cognizance and use of the contingency and agency approaches to influence their long-term strategic directions to stay competitive. Institutional authorities will also benefit from having a conceptual reference and guide to further improve their entrepreneurship policies. Originality/value: The authors took three novel steps to address the existing gap in the literature. First, the theories of entrepreneurship, contingency and agency were bound together and unified as a single framework to conceptualize entrepreneurial strategy. Second, the identified gaps were embodied in a vignette to problematize the theoretical issues and lastly, some testable propositions were put forward to explain different forms of entrepreneurial strategy. The authors also developed a corporate entrepreneurial strategy matrix based on the Covin and Miles (1999) forms of corporate entrepreneurship. It forms the basis for the propositions.

By investigating the effect of earnings quality (EQ) on corporate social disclosure (CSD) in the context of Vietnam, this study tests whether firms uphold managerial opportunism based on the agency theory or social responsibility based on stakeholder theory. It also tests the moderating effect of state and foreign ownership on the relationship between EQ and CSD. This study finds that the long-term perspective argument dominates in the relationship between EQ and CSD, indicating that EQ is positively and significantly associated with CSD. The study also finds that the increasing proportion of shares held by the government in firms weakens the relationship between EQ and CSD. (c), Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Despite the extensive body of literature that aims to explain the phenomenon of consumer scams, the structure of information in scam relationships remains relatively understudied. The purpose of this article is to develop an agency-theoretic approach to the study of information in perpetrator-victim interactions. Drawing a distinction between failures of observation and failures of judgment in the pre-contract phase, we introduce a typology and a set of propositions that explain the severity of adverse selection problems in three classes of scam relationships. Our analysis provides a novel, systematic explanation of the structure of information that facilitates scam victimization, while also enabling critical scrutiny of a core assumption in agency theory regarding contract design. We highlight the role of scam perpetrators as agents who have access to private information and exercise considerable control over the terms and design of scam relationships. Focusing on the consumer scam context, we question a theoretical assumption, largely taken for granted in the agency literature, that contact design is necessarily in the purview of the uninformed principal.

Purpose: Corporate governance is a crucial factor when considering excessive corporate risk-taking. Since corporate boards play such an important role in corporate governance, the purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the impact of board composition and further board characteristics on excessive corporate risk-taking. Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates listed firms from Germany and the USA from 2004 to 2015 based on data from Thomson Reuters Data Stream. The authors apply the fixed effect and random effect estimation method to demonstrate the impact of board composition on corporate risk-taking. Findings: This study provides empirical evidence that an increase in the proportion of independent directors is associated with less corporate risk-taking. These effects are stronger among German firms. Lastly, the effects of board size and audit committee effectiveness (AUCE) on risk-taking have mixed results. Research limitations/implications: The results favor continued efforts to strengthen the composition of corporate boards and improve the effectiveness of audit committees to curb unhealthy corporate risk-taking. The recommendations from the research will provide regulators and corporate management with the necessary information needed to design an appropriate independent board structure, and board size (BOSI). The research will, furthermore, fortify the indispensability of financial experts on audit committees. Originality/value: This study contributes to the agency theory debate with these findings. Stronger board independence enables a better monitoring of the CEO, which leads to decision making based on a more appropriate level of risk. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Effective use of human resources is important for the profitability and governance of family firms. In a study of the human resource management (HRM) practices of US Hispanic family firms, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the implications of agency and stewardship governance. Design/methodology/approach: To better understand HRM practices in US Hispanic family firms, the authors present findings from 169 US firms to hypothesize the extent of HRM development in Hispanic family firms (n=70) vs non-Hispanic family firms (n=99). Findings: Results indicated that HRM practices in Hispanic family firms are less structured than those of non-Hispanic family firms; however, when Hispanic family firms effectively use HRM practices, they will have greater financial success. Originality/value: Therefore, the results suggest that Hispanic family firm leaders display relatively low agency governance and high stewardship governance. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We examine whether compensation committee existence (CCX) and compensation committee effectiveness (CCE) are associated with CEO pay-performance alignment, using data drawn from a sample of Australian listed companies. We find that compensation committee existence and effectiveness are positively associated with CEO pay-performance alignment. Further, our results show that the relationships hold for the pre- and post-GFC (Global Financial Crisis) periods but not for the crisis period. This evidence supports the prospect theory argument that in times of macroeconomic crisis, uncontrollable factors external to the firm constitute a firm's reference point for making executive remuneration decisions. These results are robust to alternative measures of firm performance and CEO cash compensation as well as tests of endogeneity. Overall, our evidence suggests that compensation committees contribute to addressing agency problems pertinent to contemporary corporate governance practices. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the impact of board-CEO friendship ties on firm value and explores potential channels through which changes in firm value may be conveyed, based on a sample of 1696 publicly listed firms in U.S. over the period of 2000-2014. The study reveals that board-CEO friendship ties have a negative and economically meaningful impact on firm value, as measured by Tobin's Q and Total Q. Regarding potential channels of firm value, we show that the negative influence of board-CEO friendship ties on firm value is reduced in firms with greater board advising requirements but intensified in firms with higher board monitoring needs. We also find social ties tend to destroy firm value whereas professional ties do not. Our results are robust to endogeneity concerns, and after controlling for board-CEO professional ties.

Purpose: Prior studies suggest that most expropriation of firm's resources is conducted through related party transactions (RPTs). Based on the conflict of interest view, related parties opportunistically use their authorities to expropriate firms' resources for their own benefits via RPTs subsequently increasing agency costs and reduce firm value. One important monitoring system suggested by agency theory to reduce the agency problem is corporate governance (CG). CG monitors firm's performance to align the interests of those who control and those who own the residual claims in a firm. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the moderating effect of CG characteristics on the relationship between RPTs and firm value. Design/methodology/approach: In order to clarify the distinct effect of RPTs, this study categorises RPTs into two groups including beneficial and detrimental RPTs (DRPTs). Applying "proportionate stratified random sampling", this study covers a panel of 271 firms listed on Bursa Malaysia over the period of 2009-2011, using a moderated multiple regression model. Findings: This study documents that firm value is positively associated with beneficial RPTs (BRPTs) and negatively related to detrimental RPTs (DRPTs). In addition, results show that divergence can intensify the negative relationship between DRPTs and firm value. Findings support the necessity for more scrutiny by regulators, policy makers and standard setters to monitor the conflict of interests in RPTs and restrain the power of related parties to protect the firm's wealth by introducing stricter regulations for RPTs and improve CG practices especially to monitor RPTs in order to limit the opportunistic behaviour of related parties. Research limitations/implications: Research implications have been presented in Section 10. It has also been summarised in practical implications and social implications sections. Practical implications: The findings of this study indicate that investors, creditors and policy makers should not consider all RPTs as harmful transactions and it seems necessary to categorise RPTs into different groups including transactions which are detrimental and transactions which are beneficial to the firm. Social implications: The findings of this study support the necessity for more scrutiny by regulators, policy makers and standard setters to monitor the conflict of interests in RPTs. They should restrain the power of related parties to protect the firm's wealth by introducing stricter regulations for RPTs and improving CG practices especially to monitor RPTs in order to limit the opportunistic behaviour of related parties. Originality/value: This study contributes to the RPTs literature by showing that the effect of RPTs on firm value depends on the types of RPTs, and market participants allocate different values to different types of RPTs. Therefore, to fill the gap and clarify the distinct effect of RPTs, this study categorizes RPTs into two groups including beneficial and detrimental RPTs. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether, in emerging economies, the relationship between a firm's corporate governance (CG) and its performance is associated with firm's affiliation to a business group. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 209 publicly listed firms in India during a 10-year period from 2007 to 2016 were studied, and the random effects model was employed for analysis. Findings: Empirical evidence showed that board size and institutional shareholding positively impacted firm performance, whereas the proportion of independent directors negatively impacted performance. In group-affiliated firms in emerging economies, chief executive officer duality negatively impacted, whereas institutional shareholding positively impacted performance. These results are consistent with the principal-principal agency theory. The study found no discernible impact of proportion of independent directors on firm performance in group-affiliated firms. Originality/value: In analyzing the governance-performance relationship and its association with business groups, this study extends current understanding by connecting business group research in emerging economies with CG and firm performance research. In examining firms from several industries over a long period of time after controlling for firm size, capital structure and spends on research and development and marketing, the results of this study offer rich empirical evidence that contributes to the extant literature on the nature of the governance-performance relationship.

We examine the effects of a franchisee's size, distance from headquarters, and local competition on voluntary compliance with corporate brand-building initiatives at the outlet level. Specifically, we consider compliance with a corporate social responsibility effort to solicit charitable donations at the time of retail checkout, measuring compliance performance as the amount of donations received at each outlet. Our analysis utilizes an objective, longitudinal sample of 777 franchised outlets in a national quick-service restaurant chain. Surprisingly, we find that distance from headquarters is positively related to compliance; we relate this finding to recent, extant research on geographic distances and franchisee behaviors. We find the beneficial effects of larger, multiunit franchisees are mitigated as franchisees' geographic distances from headquarters increase; we relate these findings to horizontal agency within franchising systems. We further find that franchised outlets in more competitive markets comply less with brand-building initiatives, even less so when part of a larger franchisee network. Our results underscore the important moderating role franchisee size plays in outlets' compliance, which we link back to extant perspectives on agency theory. Supplemental analyses consider tensions between compliance and operational efficiency, as well as effects of hypothesized factors on another mandatory form of compliance.

We advance behavioral agency theory by exploring the influence of mood or "affect" on the behavioral consequences of stock option incentives. Drawing on insights from psychology and behavioral decision theory, we describe how affect influences agent risk behavior. We argue that positive affect amplifies both the extent to which executives reduce strategic risk taking in response to risk bearing and engage in strategic risk taking in response to incentives for further enrichment. Building again on the psychology literature, we describe how CEO accountability attenuates the influence of affect on CEO risk behavior in response to stock option incentives. We test our expectations in a longitudinal data set of CEO stock option incentives, affect, and strategic risk taking by U.S. firms. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Why do we use the term 'corporate governance' rather than 'corporate direction'? Early British joint stock companies were normally managed by a single 'governor'. The 'court of governors' or 'board of directors' emerged slowly as the ruling body for companies. By the nineteenth century, however, companies were typically run by directors while not-for-profit entities such as hospitals, schools and charitable bodies had governors. The nineteenth century saw steady refinement of the roles of company directors, often in response to corporate scandals, with a gradual change from the notion of the director as a 'representative shareholder' to the directors being seen collectively as 'representatives of the shareholders'. Governors in not-for-profit entities, however, were regarded as having broader responsibilities. The term 'governance' itself suggests that corporate boards should be studied as 'political' entities rather than merely through economic lenses such as agency theory. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

The so called "dividend puzzle" has prompted many researchers to examine industry-specific factors in order to explain the dividend behaviors of various industries. However, due to the unique differences in characteristics between franchise and non-franchise restaurants, it may not be appropriate to view the restaurant industry as one entity displaying homogenous dividend behaviors. In this regard, this study investigated the role of franchising in explaining the dividend behaviors of the restaurant industry. The results of this study demonstrate that the dividend behaviors of franchise restaurants are a function of the size of institutional holdings and prior dividend payments, while those of non-franchise restaurants depend on the degree of growth opportunity and financial leverage. The findings further imply that franchise restaurants with higher free cash flows and the resulting information asymmetry closely follow agency theory and signaling theory, whereas non-franchise restaurants with insufficient internal cash strictly follow the pecking order theory.

This paper aims to examine the moderating effect of Shariah Supervisory Boards (SSBs) on the relationship between board size, Chief Risk Officer (CRO), and risk-taking of 24 Islamic banks (IBs) in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei from 2010 to 2015. This approach integrates the arguments of agency theory and resource dependence theory. The results of panel regression indicate that the appointment of a CRO as an executive board member reduces credit risk, implying that the appointment of a CRO as a risk expert in IBs enhances the management of risk and monitoring of risk-taking activities. Further, larger board is likely to reduce insolvency risk when an SSB has higher percentage of members with supervisory Shariah experience. Next, this study observes that larger SSB size and a higher percentage of members with Shariah supervision experience moderate the relationship between the CRO and insolvency risk. Overall, this study highlights the important role of board size, CRO and SSB in the risk-taking of Islamic banks, which have received little attention in the extant literature.

Incentive alignment is discussed as one of the key factors for successful implementation of supply chain management. However, there is a lack of empirical research regarding implementation as well as evaluation of the effects of alignment mechanisms in practice. The purpose of this study is therefore to explore and describe the current practice and to identify gaps of Supply chain incentive alignment. The study is an explorative and descriptive survey study based on forty-eight responses from members, supply chain officers, of the Swedish Supply chain panel. The theoretical lenses are based on literature discussing incentive alignment in supply chains, e.g. principal-agency theory and supply chain contracting, but also on literature discussing internal process based management and rewards for goal congruence. The study shows a clear gap between perceived importance and realized practice of both external (inter-organizational) and internal (cross-functional) incentive alignment. Very few of the existing sophisticated coordinating mechanisms proposed in theory were used to any significant extent. In fact, the internal incentive structures seem to counter act, and not support, supply chain orientation. This finding relates not only to non-logistics departments but also to functions in "the logistics family". The major challenge, both externally and internally, is to be able to define incentives that drives behavior in the right direction. The study clearly shows gaps between practitioners' intent and current practice, and it provides a broad range of more sophisticated and coordinating mechanisms than the ones mainly used today.

This paper investigates how foreign ownership shapes bank information environments. Using a sample of listed banks from 60 countries over 1997-2012, we show that foreign ownership is significantly associated with greater (lower) informativeness (synchronicity) in bank stock prices. We also find that stock returns of foreign-owned banks reflect more information about future earnings. In addition, the positive association between price informativeness and foreign ownership is stronger for foreign-owned banks in countries with stronger governance, stronger banking supervision, and lower monitoring costs. Overall, our evidence suggests that foreign ownership reduces bank opacity by exporting governance, yielding important implications for regulators and governments.

Research Question/Issue: Concentrated ownership is more the rule than the exception in weak institutional environments, and the absence of external control mechanisms, leading to ineffective legal enforcement, intensifies principal-principal agency issues. Our study examines how the structuring of the corporate board plays a vital role in informing foreign investors about the risk of being expropriated, which affects their decisions to make equity investments in firms in weak institutional regimes. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of large listed Indian firms in the period 2010-2014, we hypothesize that the presence of affiliate directors on the board has a negative impact on foreign investments. Likewise, the presence of controlling owners-directors on the board together with chief executive officers' additional directorial positions has an inverted U-shaped impact on foreign investments. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By making use of agency theory and focusing on the importance of foreign financing, our study highlighted the factors that deter foreign investors from providing capital to firms in weak institutional regimes. The use of this theoretical perspective, by emphasizing the differences in agency problems prevalent in strong versus weak institutional regimes, further suggested that examination of the structure of corporate boards is an important way to detect and gauge the potential for expropriation in countries suffering from weaknesses in investor protection. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our study has important implications for corporations operating in markets suffering from a legal environment that offers little investor protection. Investors are less prone to invest in these countries, as the risk of expropriation by dominant shareholders means they cannot be sure of actually getting the putative return. Our work shows how corporations can structure their boards effectively to convince investors that they face less danger of expropriation and so attract foreign capital. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Governance theories impact how corporations are run, which in turn impacts societal well-being. This dynamic is commonly accepted, as evidenced by the flood of articles exploring the links between corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (e.g., Hong et al. in J Bus Ethics 136:199-213, 2016). This article supplements current corporate governance theories with Catholic social thought (CST) to address burgeoning societal issues such as the increasing trust gap, income inequality (the compensation gap), and an overemphasis on financial compensation as the primary way to motivate senior managers. The authors propose a shift away from agency theory and stakeholder theory, both of which, with their limited depictions of the motivations of managers, have contributed to excessive executive compensation. Instead, the authors develop an alternative--justice stewardship theory--which integrates organizational justice theory, the principles of stewardship theory, and the insights of 150 years of CST.

Agency theory argues that pay for performance alleviates the conflict of interest between managers and shareholders. Furthermore, the literature finds that institutional monitoring tends to promote the performance-pay linkage, thus aligning the two parties' incentives. We find that executive compensation rigidity is negatively and significantly associated with firm value. Moreover, ownership by long-term institutional investors reduces the pay rigidity of top managers in underperforming firms, thus decreasing the value-destroying effect of the rigidity. Overall, these results reaffirm the role of institutional monitoring in mitigating managerial rent extraction. (c) 2019 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association

The study is concerned with the usefulness of using audit data analytics of unregulated voluntary disclosures in reducing the auditing expectations gap. It argues that the lack of credibility and assurance of the unstructured voluntary disclosures and other big data will impact the level of public users' expectations towards the quality of these unregulated voluntary disclosures. Therefore, we argue that non-financial, as well as financial data require assurance by an independent auditor. Consequently, this would expand the auditors' role and responsibilities which will lead to raising the degree of stakeholders' satisfaction and approaching their expectations potentially reducing the auditing expectations gap. Auditors will need to rely more heavily on big data analytics and technological techniques to perform this new role efficiently and effectively. Therefore, we provide empirical evidence that the perceptions of auditors, bankers, investors and academics, support the use of audit data analytics when providing assurance of unregulated voluntary disclosures in reducing auditing expectations gap. To do so, we categorized unregulated voluntary into eight different categories that auditing data analytics is required to capture from various sources and analyse in an informative and useful fashion.

This study aims to examine the direct and moderating effects of the chief executive officer's (CEO) decision horizon and the board governance on a firm's entry into new technological fields, respectively. In a sample of 1727 firm-year observations for 156 Taiwanese firms in the semiconductor and optoelectronics industries for the period of 2003-2014, we found that the longer the CEO decision horizon, the more eager the focal firm is to enter new technological fields. Such a relationship is also strengthened by board power characterized by boards dominated by more outside directors, but weakened by board homogeneity of industry background. The configurational analysis further reveals that board homogeneity outweighs board power in reducing the positive influence of the CEO decision horizon on technological entry. This study not only contributes to the behavioral agency theory by infusing and testing CEO decision horizon to enhance predictions of the incidence of entering into new technological fields, but also reveals the contextual influences of board governance on executive risk taking. In addition, this study cautions against drawing a simple governance solution in support of a firm's technological entry. We point out different governance arrangements in which the CEO decision horizon will encourage more active technological entries in an environment of incessant changes. (c) 1988-2012 IEEE.

In this paper we investigate the under-researched topic of the use of executive share-based compensation in Poland, and we analyse empirically whether theoretical explanations developed and applied mainly in the context of developed countries also hold in this specific context. Building on agency and institutional theories we study the determinants of using executive share-based pay in 362 companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. As a result, we highlight the role of the state in Polish firms and the need to consider specifically principal-principal conflicts typical of emerging economies in post-state-socialist organisational research. Our findings not only reflect particularities of the institutional environment in the country studied but also highlight the limits of the traditional principal-agent lens applied in emerging economies.

We examine the relationship between disproportionate insider control, enabled through dual-class share structures, and the demand for audit quality. Using a comprehensive hand-collected sample of U.S. dual-class firms, we find that, consistent with outside shareholders' increased demand for external monitoring, as well as selfbonding by entrenched insiders, disproportionate insider control is positively associated with the propensity to hire a Big 4 or industry specialist auditor, auditor independence, and audit fees. Corroborating a self-bonding explanation, additional analyses show that audit quality mitigates the negative association of disproportionate insider control and firm value. In expanded analyses, we also investigate the separate effects of insider voting and cash flow rights on the demand for audit quality in dual-class firms. Consistent with general agency theory, we find a decreased (increased) demand for audit quality from incentive-alignment (entrenchment) effects of ownership.

This chapter provides a critical narrative literature review with the aim of answering the following research question: What are the main theoretical perspectives in the academic literature on integrated reporting? We analysed the academic papers published on international accounting and finance journals from January 2000 to September 2017, focusing on 62 articles that explicitly refer to one or more theories. We found that 28 different theories are mentioned and the most used are stakeholder theory, institutional theory, legitimacy theory, impression management theory, and agency theory. We also presented an embryonic draft of a conceptual model, structured in four components: theories of the firm, purposes and users, types of integrated reporting, and value creation and distribution. We deem that this draft should be developed in future research to achieve a comprehensive conceptual model, inclusive of all explored theories and able to support future academic research, practice, and policies.

Microfinance co-operatives (MFCs) are increasingly accessing loans from other financial institutions to finance their lending activities. However, knowledge about the association between loans from other institutions and MFCs' performance is limited. Therefore this paper contributes to the body of knowledge by extending the application of agency theory to investigate the effe of financial leverage on MFCs' labor productivity. The paper applies fixed effect regression models on panel data of 442 observations established from a sample of 115 MFCs operating in five regions in Tanzania. The results show that financial leverage has a negative effect on labor productivity. The findings revealed that an increase in financial leverage results in lower labor productivity, which could be due to underinvestment because of the debt overhang problem, higher financing costs (which reduce future investments), high labor costs resulting from the high monitoring of lending, and loan collection activities.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the relationship between board interlocks and monitoring effectiveness for listed German companies in a context of risk governance. While agency-theory and resource-dependence-theory suggest a positive association between board interlocks and monitoring effectiveness, reasons such as limited temporal resources of busy board members may suggest a negative association. Design/methodology/approach: By using panel data regression, the authors examined the association between board interlocks and monitoring effectiveness, which was approximated by excessive management compensation, pay-for-performance-sensitivity and CEO turnover-performance-sensitivity. The data set comprises 3,998 directorships for 132 listed German companies covering the period 2015-2017. Findings: The authors find that board interlocks are associated with not only a more excessive management pay and less performance-sensitive turnover but also a higher pay-for-performance-sensitivity. Originality/value: The study examines the impact of multiple directorships based on a German panel data set that includes both multiple appointments of members to national supervisory boards and all other appointments to national and international executive and supervisory bodies. The authors compile three measures to operationalize monitoring effectiveness. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the possible influence of financial health of local governments (LGs) on the re-election of politicians. Design/methodology/approach: The study investigates a sample of 129 Italian LGs with more than 50,000 inhabitants for the period 2008-2014, resulting in 903 observations. A regression model has been implemented, where the dependent variable refers to the probability of re-election, and different dimensions of financial health are the independent variables. Findings: Budgetary and service-level solvency influence positively the probability of re-election of the major, while the ability of the government to generate liquidity to pay its short-term debts is not statistically relevant. Moreover, the sustainability dimension of budgetary solvency is more relevant than the flexibility and vulnerability dimensions. Practical implications: To be re-elected, local politicians are advised to pay attention to and preserve the social welfare of citizens with the available resources. Originality/value: This study adds fresh insight to the literature on financial health, emphasising the relevance of public financial management in the re-election of local politicians.

Prior research in agency theory views outside directors as being mostly extrinsically motivated by the potential for financial rewards, and as such stresses the value of using director stock options and equity to incentivize outside directors to pursue strategic risks. We draw on and extend agency-theory by arguing that outside directors are primarily intrinsically motivated, and therefore excessive emphasis on pecuniary rewards and punishments can ironically subvert a director's motives away from strategic risk-taking. In particular, we claim that more important than extrinsic rewards and government regulations is creating a secure environment for directors so that they may exercise their fiduciary duties without fear of litigation. We test our theory on a sample of 196 S&P 500 firms from 2005 to 2015 and find that the pressures imposed on the board through external regulations and controls can often backfire and result in outside directors signing off on less risky expenditure. A strong implication of these findings is no real substitute exists to creating a safe environment for directors, where they have the freedom to pursue the long-term interests of the principals, even if this goes against the short-termism of capital markets.

Agency theory is the dominant theory of shareholder activism and argues that activist investors function as external governance monitors. Agency theory predicts that activist investors will tend to target firms who exhibit governance and performance problems. However, given limited resources and time, activist investors must often decide between selecting targets with particularly strong agency and performance problems and those where their activism efforts are most likely to succeed. Social movement scholars point out that, in social movement contexts, the corporate opportunity structure affects when and where activism is likely to arise. We draw on insights from social movement scholarship and agency theory to advance a theory of heterogeneity in shareholder activism. We argue that an activist's access to power and resources shapes its target selection, particularly the activist's preference for targeting firms with greater agency problems or where contextual factors favor chances of success. Whereas more powerful activists are able to wield their power as effective governance monitors against firms with substantial agency problems, less powerful activists must strategically select targets of opportunity by choosing firms where contextual factors improve their odds of success. We test these propositions using an innovative relational approach that can simultaneously incorporate firm traits, activist identities, and endogenous dynamics. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

To create transparency on the rising plethora of Shadow IT (SIT) and Business-managed IT (BMIT) research, this paper reviews how existing research in the field uses reference theories. A review of 107 SIT and BMIT literature items shows that 52 (49%) of the literature items drew on 37 reference theories for theory testing and theory building. The remaining 55 (51%) literature items did not base their research on reference theories. To guide theorizing in future SIT and BMIT research, this paper argues in favor of 'category-spanning' reference theories, i.e., reference theories already used across the SIT and BMIT research categories 'causing factors,' 'outcomes,' and 'governance of SIT and BMIT.' The paper identifies four category-spanning theories: (1) transaction cost theory, (2) agency theory, (3) loose coupling theory, and (4) technological frames. Analyzing the prior use of these reference theories in SIT and BMIT, the paper at hand suggests and discusses extensions for their application in future SIT and BMIT research. In addition to the category-spanning reference theories, the theory of workarounds seems to be highly applicable. Due to the novelty of the research field and the explorative character of most existing studies, the paper calls for enhanced theorizing in the field of SIT and BMIT since currently most of the literature items do not build on reference theories.

We investigate private firms' ability to identify and replace poorly performing managers across countries. We document three main findings. First, private firms are more likely to retain poorly performing managers in countries where legal institutions that protect minority investors are weak. Second, private firms are more likely to retain poorly performing managers than public firms only in countries where governance mechanisms inherent in public equity markets limit managerial entrenchment in public firms. Third, private firm managers are less likely to be replaced even when poor performance continues for relatively long horizons. Overall, our findings provide new evidence on the potential vulnerability of minority shareholders in private firms. (c) 2019, Academy of International Business.

This paper examines the relationship between leverage, debt maturity and firm performance, employing a large panel of Chinese non-financial listed firms. The corporate finance literature widely recognizes that the debt and maturity structures are important mechanisms for addressing agency problems in modern corporations. We applied the system GMM estimator to control for endogeneity concerns in the study. We found positive associations between leverage and the proportion of long term debt, and between leverage and firm performance. Our results indicate that leverage and its maturity structure are important determinants of the profitability of Chinese listed firms. Our research has significant policy implications as it suggests that, since China's financial system is dominated by a large banking system, lenders (mainly banks) may extend more long term credit to the more productive private sector, which helps to improve performance of these firms. The findings of this study imply that the Chinese government's efforts to improve the governance of its banking system have been successful in enhancing efficiency and prudence in banks' lending and monitoring behavior.

Agency Theory deliberates the relationship between principals and agents, and the agency problems that originate in information asymmetries and goal conflicts. Through the lens of Agency Theory, with mixed methods, I investigate the decisions about funding of theatre organizations by governments, based on assessments by third parties. In two settings "artistic quality" is the major determinant of public support, to the detriment of criteria as participation, social objectives, efficiency and entrepreneurship. I argue that, next to previously recognized principal-agent relationships between governments and theatres, and governments and panels, a third relationship is very influential: between an arts field and panels.

This article develops and empirically tests a predictive model for audit of fraud detection with practical applications for audit operations. By analyzing real-life accounting data, the proposed model can identify anomalous transactions and directly focus on exceptions for further investigation in real time, thus offering a significant reduction in manual intervention and processing time in audit operations. Our approach is a highly desirable supplement to the existing rule-based models, given the growing use of information technology for analytics in auditing. The proposed approach is based on classification. Following the tenets of the principal agency theory, we discuss how our approach can help to reduce monitoring and contracting costs, disincentivize fraud, improve auditor efficiency and independence, and increase audit quality. We contribute to the current literature by discussing the implications of data-driven audit on the moderating role of auditors in principal-agent relationships and providing practical insights into the operational aspects of financial reporting and auditing, modeling of fraud-detection classification models, and benefits, barriers, and enablers of implementing data driven audit in companies.

Although the link between managerial ownership and firm performance is often explained in relation to a firm's risk-taking behavior, little is known about how managerial ownership affects corporate risk-taking in industries characterized by high financial and operational risks, like the restaurant industry. To understand this important and understudied link, our study draws upon agency theory to examine the relationship between managerial ownership and franchising, typically a risk-reduction strategy of restaurant firms. Our results from panel data analyses using a sample of 962 firm-year observations show that managerial ownership is negatively associated with degree of franchising. Further, we find that after considering the scope of managerial discretion, there is a U-shaped relationship between managerial ownership and degree of franchising such that the degree of franchising decreases as managerial ownership increases up to a certain level, but then increases in tandem as managerial ownership increases to higher levels. Our results indicate that there is an optimal level of franchising associated with managerial ownership, implying that owners can influence their firms' risk-taking behavior by setting target managerial ownership goals and designing effective incentive contracts.

We argue that vertical interlocks in Chinese state-owned business groups are important mechanisms for coordination and information exchange between the apex firm and affiliated firms, and that they are also mechanisms for government owners of the business groups to exercise control. By combining resource dependence theory with elements from transaction cost economics and agency theory, we propose that the need for interlocks increases the higher the level of government ownership. The central government is therefore more likely to use vertical interlocks than the provincial governments, which again are more likely to use vertical interlocks than the municipal governments. We develop three hypotheses based on these arguments. A regression analysis of a hand-collected data set finds strong support for our hypotheses. Our results shed light on coordination and governance issues within the state-owned sector in China and on an important means for mitigating these issues used by the government owners and firms affiliated with state-owned groups.

This paper offers a fresh perspective on executive compensation by offering a new paradigm for choosing executive compensation structure based on environmental factors and firm size. This new perspective uses agency theory as a theoretical foundation. The availability of information, primarily information related to the agent, has typically been of utmost concern in the compensation selection process. However, a predominant focus on cognitive or behavioral information of the agent neglects the relative importance and impact of environmental forces in this process. This study evaluates the composition of the compensation contract using fluctuating environmental dimensions as the primary determinant. Specifically, we examine environmental munificence, dynamism, and complexity and the influence of varying levels of each of these variables and their interaction on the optimal choice of compensation contract utilized for both large firms and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This externally focused view of compensation contract creation underscores the significance of environmental factors in determining contract selection while also acknowledging the necessity of principals utilizing information related to both the agent and the environment. Furthermore, we argue that top executive compensation structures for large organizations and non-adaptive SMEs should differ from those of adaptive SMEs.

This study examined the performance of selected quoted deposit banks of Nigeria and liquidity management. Secondary data used was extracted from the financial statements of 15 money deposit banks out of population of 17 deposit money banks on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for 2012-2017 (six years). The descriptive research design was used. The data collected was analyzed using ordinary least square method (OLS). Liquidity management was measured using capital ratio (CTR), current ratio (CR) and cash ratio (CSR), while performance was measured using return on assets (ROA). Based on the results of the study, liquidity management proxied by capital ratio, current ratio and cash ratio and performance of the firm proxied by return on assets are positively related. The result shows that liquidity management is an essential factor in business operations and consequently leads to business profitability. Hence proper liquidity management helps solve the agency theory problem of agency costs that arise when control of companies is separated from the ownership, whereby managers are able to employ the firm's resources for personal gains instead of maximizing the value of the firm or the shareholders' wealth. The value of the firm and the shareholders' wealth can be maximized through the firm's profitability via effective and efficient liquidity management. (c) 2019 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

In order to ensure profitability for shareholders, optimal contracting recommends the alignment between executive compensation and company performance. Large organizations have therefore adopted executives remuneration systems in order to induce positive market reaction and motivate executives. Complex compensation schemes are designed by Boards of Directors using strong pay-performance incentives that explain high levels of executive pay along with company size, demand for management skills and executive influence. However, the literature remains inconclusive on the pay-performance relationship owing to the various empirical methods used by researchers. Additionally, there has been little effort in the literature to compare methodologies on the pay-performance relationship. Using the dominant agency theory framework, the purpose of this study is to establish and examine the relationship between firm performance and executive pay. In addition, it intends to assess the characteristic of model specifications commonly adopted. To this aim, a quantitative analysis consisting of three complementary methods was performed on panel data from South African listed companies. The results of the main unrestricted first difference model indicate a strong non-linear relationship where the impact of current and previous firm performance on executive pay can be observed over 2 to 4-year period providing support to the optimal contracting theoretical perspective in the South African business context. In addition, CEO pay is more sensitive to firm performance as compared to Director pay. Lastly, although it affects executive pay levels, company size is not found to improve the pay-performance relationship. (c) 2019 The author(s). This publication is an open access article.

Purpose: This study aims to determine the fraud risk factors perceived by employees to have the greatest influence on individuals committing fraud as an unethical conduct, as well as to analyze employees' opinions on fraud prevention program. Design/methodology/approach: The fraud risk factors in this study are based on the concept of the fraud triangle as developed by Donald Cressey, as well as examples of situations set out in SAS No. 99. The samples used in this study are company employees who have been selected using the convenience sampling method. Findings: A survey of 109 employees reports that none of the three factors (pressure, opportunity and rationalization) has a significant influence on fraud. However, when comparing the factors, the pressure is considered to have the highest impact. In terms of fraud prevention, the employees suggest that it is extremely important to implement all prevention tools, especially with regard to the adequate segregation of duties. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of this study in terms of method and small samples are expected to inform future studies to overcome the limitations by using other methods such as interview and by collecting more respondents to gather their perceptions and opinions. Originality/value: This study contributed to the literature in confirming the pressure as the dominant factor and in confirming the importance of anti-fraud programs as suggested by the agency theory.

The Problem: Agency theory has been empirically studied in other fields of study such as economics, political science, sociology, and management. Although a proposal for inclusion of agency theory to test training and development outcomes was made in human resource development (HRD)-related publications, little research has been conducted and published in HRD-related literature. The Solution: This review of agency theory offers a description of the elements and factors associated with the principal-agent relationship that have been theorized and empirically tested in other fields of study. Much of the theoretical implications are transferable to HRD. The principal-agent relationship should be empirically tested in HRD situations and interpreted through an HRD lens. The Stakeholders: The review of the principal-agent relationship in other fields is expected to benefit HRD researchers, practitioners, principals, and agents in organizations by providing insight into the orientation, elements, and influence of principal-agent relationships.

Purpose: This study aims to develop a conceptual model and assess the extent to which pre-, during- and post-employment HR security controls are applied in organizations to manage information security risks. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual model is developed based on the agency theory and the review of theoretical, empirical and practitioner literature. Following, empirical data are collected through a survey from 134 IT professionals, internal audit personnel and HR managers working within five major industry sectors in a developing country to test the organizational differences in pre-, during- and post-employment HR security measures. Findings: Using analysis of variance, the findings reveal significant differences among the organizations. Financial institutions perform better in employee background checks, terms and conditions of employment, management responsibilities, security education, training and awareness and disciplinary process. Conversely, healthcare institutions outperform other organizations in post-employment security management. The government public institutions perform the worst among all the organizations. Originality/value: An integration of a conceptual model with HR security controls is an area that is under-researched and under-reported in information security and human resource management literature. Accordingly, this research on HR security management contributes to reducing such a gap and adds to the existing HR security risk management literature. It, thereby, provides an opportunity for researchers to conduct comparative studies between developed and developing nations or to benchmark a specific organization's HR security management.

The paper aims to evaluate the combination of strategies that influence the success of New Technology Based Firms (NTBFs) located in isolated areas with resource constraints. We utilize the Kauffman Firm Survey to construct a subset of 224 firms operating in primary metal manufacturing industries and who are located in non-thriving areas. We focus on the impact of technological strategy, in the form of Inward Technology Licensing (ITL), combined with financial strategy, in the form of increased financial slack. Using a negative binomial-specification technique to model these relations, we find that ITL positively impacts internal innovation in the firm and this relation is strengthened by the presence of greater financial slack. This positive impact of financial slack supports the behavioral theory of the firm rather than agency theory in that financial slack enables further innovation rather than stifling it. This research confirms the importance of resource acquisition, suggesting that entrepreneurs may utilize external sources of knowledge in an effort to build a favorable situation when facing the challenges of location. Finally, by presenting evidence showing the compatibility of a financial strategy with a knowledge strategy (ITL), this study emphasizes the importance to entrepreneurs of choosing the proper combination of varying strategies.

This study aimed to determine whether executive remuneration levels at poorly performing state-owned entities (SOE)s in South Africa are justified. The study was motivated by the weak economic growth, fiscal consolidation, increased debt levels and poor financial performance of these entities. Dynamic panel data models were employed and estimated using the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimator. The data set comprised an unbalanced panel data of 33 commercial SOEs in South Africa that are listed under the Public Financial Management Act. The study found an inverse relationship between executive remuneration and financial performance. This is of concern as executive remuneration is high despite the SOEs' declining performance. The misalignment between pay and performance undermines the core principles of the agency theory, resulting in poor performance. These findings provide empirical support for public and media perceptions that executive remuneration is excessive and unmerited when measured against SOEs' performance. The findings will be of interest to observers of the economy, as they measure SOEs' capacity to play a leading role in investment and in improving the efficiency of the economy. They could also inform decision making and policy development on SOEs. (c) 2019, Allied Business Academies.

The aim of the paper is to identify factors that affect the financing structure of Polish companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in the period 1998-2012. In the first part of the paper the modern theories of capital structure are reviewed and main determinants of this structure are identified. The second part provides empirical verification of the relationship between debt and found factors using panel models. The capital structure of studied enterprises measured by the total debt ratio is most adequately explained by the pecking order theory. The increase in the share of fixed assets in total assets, profitability, liquidity and company size influences the reduction of its debt. The non-debt tax shield affected the debt level differently from the pecking order theory. The positive relationship between non-debt tax shield and debt corresponds to the agency theory. While a large number of studies conducted in other countries confirm the significance of the impact regarding the above factors on the long-term debt ratio, in Poland a similar relationship is not noticeable. Long-term debt is determined only by the share of fixed assets in total assets. It indicates the importance of short-term debt in the financing of Polish enterprises.

Moral hazard can hinder both the realization and the effectiveness of research and development (R&D) supply relations. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no empirical studies investigating the determinants of moral hazard under the specific circumstances of R&D supply relations. Based on a study on 104 cases, this article will help to fill that gap. The results not only confirm information asymmetries as determinants, as predicted by principal-agent theory, but also reveal surprising effects of additional factors. Thus, we show that the general explanation of moral hazard needs to be adapted to the specifics of a concrete exchange situation. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Scholars have long studied drivers of entrepreneurial behavior among established firms. Yet little is known about how individual factors shape a firm's choice to pursue entrepreneurship. We draw on behavioral agency theory to explore the role of equity incentives in driving corporate entrepreneurship. Our findings suggest CEOs avoid corporate entrepreneurial behaviors as their option wealth increases. However industry dynamics also prove to be an important contingency when predicting the effects of both restricted stock and stock options on the likelihood that the CEO engages in corporate entrepreneurship. Our findings provide a theoretical platform for predicting dimensions of entrepreneurial behavior and highlight effects of CEO equity ownership.

This study confirms that a firm's size in the previous year significantly increases board of director compensation in the current year, while the number of directors and the firm's capital expenditure significantly decrease it. On average, 31.2% of restaurant firms overcompensate their board of directors, while 33.8% pay less than the expected amount of compensation to their board of directors. However, contrary to public concern, this study argues that the amounts of over- and under-compensation are negligible in proportion to the directors' total compensation, and thus the issue of over- and under-compensation may not pose a serious problem in the restaurant industry. In particular, the amount of overcompensation has a positive effect on firm growth and capital investment, but does not substantially decrease firms' operational and financial performance. The amount of overcompensation can even have a positive influence on financial performance, although the effect is not statistically significant. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine CEO compensation in immigrant-founder firms vs CEO compensation in non-immigrant-founder firms. Design/methodology/approach: Univariate and multi-variate tests are implemented. CEO compensation is designed as a function of the origin of a firm's founder (immigrant or native), executive characteristics and firm characteristics with firm and year fixed effect regressions. CEO compensation is measured with cash pay, equity-based pay and total compensation. Findings: CEOs of immigrant-founder firms receive higher equity-based compensation and higher total pay than CEOs of non-immigrant-founder firms and the levels of their equity-based and total compensation are contingent upon their stock ownership. CEOs in high-growth immigrant-founder firms receive higher stock-based pay than their counterparts in non-immigrant-founder firms. Immigrant-founder family firms compensate their CEOs with higher equity-based pay than immigrant-founder non-family firms. Practical implications: The paper provides some explanations on the success of immigrant-founder firms. CEO compensation designs in immigrant-founder firms can be adopted in other firms. Social implications: The paper provides some rationale for immigration legislation to encourage the talented to come to the USA and start their business in the USA. Originality/value: This paper is the first to study executive compensation practice in immigrant-founder firms. The findings provide some practical and policy implications on immigration reform.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the voluntary disclosure practices of family and non-family listed firms and whether family firms have improved their disclosure practices following the introduction of the Principles of Good Corporate Governance and Best Practice Recommendations in 2003 in Australia. Design/methodology/approach: Voluntary disclosures are measured by constructing an index specifically for this study. Such indexes consist of corporate governance disclosure, strategic disclosure and future disclosures. They are then regressed on firm-specific variables while controlling for family and non-family firms. A total of 60 family firms and 60 non-family firms in Australia are randomly chosen from 2001 to 2006 for examining their disclosure practices. Findings: The research findings show that family firms disclose information voluntarily to signal to the market regarding their growth potentials and abide by government regulations to improve their reputation. Despite the fact that compliance with the Principles of Good Corporate Governance and Best Practice Recommendations was not compulsory, this paper finds that the recommendation encouraged family and non-family firms to disclose more corporate governance information. Practical implications: The findings from this research will help investors and regulators make more strategic decisions on investments and regulations respectively in family firms. Originality/value: There has been limited empirical evidence on the disclosure practices and their determinants of family firms in Australia. The study will thus significantly contribute to the current knowledge in this regard. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Why has responsible management been so difficult and why is the chorus of stakeholders demanding responsibility getting louder? We argue that management has been framed within the structural confines of corporate governance. Corporate governance in turn has been developed within the frame of agency theory (Blair, 1995; Eisenhardt, 1989). Agency theory in turn is based on ontological assumptions that do not provide for responsible actions on behalf of management (Jensen, 2001; Jensen & Meckling, 1976; Jensen & Meckling, 1994). As such, we argue that managers need to be aware of the paradigmatic frame of the dominant economistic ontology and learn to transcend it in order to become truly response-able.

Studies in developed economies show that family-owned non-financial firms outperform others, explained by agency theory and protection of family capital. Findings in emerging economies are equivocal, while studies of family domination and banks' performance are scant. This paper examines the profit-performance of family-dominated banks in Bangladesh under competing hypotheses of bank-market structure. Using panel estimation, we model the profit-performance of banks and show that the principal drivers are costs, efficiency and non-performing loans. Family-dominated banks are less efficient and less profitable. The sources of weaker performance are higher non-performing loans and higher costs, with indirect evidence of poor corporate governance.

Worldwide governance organizations and regulators have recently called for more enhanced disclosures about how organizations manage risks. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is recognized as a value-contributing best practice even when legal standards do not require it (Whitman in Risk Manag Insur Rev 18(2):161-197, 2015), but public disclosure on such a process is not generally mandatory. In Italy emphasis on risk disclosure started in 2008 but it was the 2011 revision of the Corporate Governance (CG) code for listed companies to ask for the board commitment in disclosing, within the CG report, about the main internal control and risk management system's characteristics (Borsa Italiana in Codice di Autodisciplina, 2011). Given the proprietary nature of risk information in addition to the Italian capital market characteristics (small capitalization and presence of a dominant shareholder) and the lack of any mandate for what specific aspects board should disclose, the study aims at investigating a potential variation between private and public disclosure on ERM. Relying on the ERM concepts provided by the COSO framework (2004) the author submitted a survey seeking information about ERM practices within Italian listed companies. Such a private information is compared to public CG reports released by the same companies. The comparison shows companies tend to privately reveal a more effective ERM process than the one they publicly disclose. An examination of CG and firm's risk variables potentially determining higher variation--i.e. information inconsistency--supports proprietary costs theory rather than agency theory expectations. Thus showing the limits of voluntary disclosure dealing with risk management systems. The study might have international policy implications. (c) 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Agency banking is a relatively new banking concept introduced in Kenya in 2010 by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), the main objective being to increase financial services outreach and promote financial inclusion of the unbanked and under-banked population. The current study, based on agency theory, sought to assess the effect of banking services on the business performance of bank agents in Kenya from an entrepreneurial perspective. A quantitative research survey design was adopted for the study, and questionnaires were used for data collection. A sample of 384 respondents from three constituencies in Nairobi (Roysambu, Kasarani and Kamukunji) participated in the study. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse data. Findings revealed that while there was growth in business turnover per month for agents after signing up for agency banking, this was only true for those with a turnover of above Kshs. 150,000. The study recommends that other entrepreneurs should consider being banks agents, while the existing ones should increase their capital to reap the most from agency banking.

Scholars argue that the agency theory has some limitations as the sustaining theory of governance. It is its inability to distinguish the wider stakeholder influencing forces effecting on organisations. This paper delivers a concise picture incorporating other management-based theories to supplement agency theory in distinguishing the wider stakeholder influencing forces as well as the consequential extended governance standard it creates. Yet, for developing the theory building approach it has reviewed and critically examined the existing literatures. Furthermore, a circumstance is built to assimilate four existing theories that supplement each other to distinguish the wider stakeholder influencing forces. Finally, further studies have been recommended to certify the approach with wide-ranging real life institutional settings.

Our study is performed on a database of all French firms that adopted a corporate venture capital (CVC) strategy between 1995 and 2015. This specifically collected dataset includes 58 large groups listed on the SBF 120 index, with 29 groups that launched or joined CVC funds and the other 29 groups are our control sample. The results provide evidence that a firm's CVC strategy is an increasing function of the strength of its specific resources, its performance, the availability of resources, and its low level of indebtedness.

This study investigates firm characteristics that may affect the IAF's quality characteristics: size, independence, methodology, and competence. Its motivation is that a firm's agency and economic costs can affect its way to invest in the IAF quality. In this study, a postal questionnaire survey was sent to the head of internal audit (HIA) in 213 UK non-financial companies with in-source IAF, and archival data were collected from the respondent companies' annual reports. The study found that a firm's size and the proportion of cash flows from its operations are positively associated with the IAF's quality characteristics, a suggestion that a high quality IAF is an important way of compensating for the direct loss of control and of managing internal agency risks. In addition, it found evidence that having a high quality IAF is a costly process; the level of debt had a significant negative association with the IAF's quality characteristics. Furthermore, the supporting OLS regression revealed a positive significant association between the effectiveness of the audit committee and the quality characteristics of the IAF. This study has important implications for both practice and future internal auditing research and provides a composite measure that can be used to assess IAF quality.

The dividend puzzle remains an interesting subject especially in emerging markets where agency problem is severe. This study examines the issues by assessing the large shareholders controlling interest in manager owned firms and corporation owned firms. A sample data of 762 Malaysian public listed firms covering the period from 2008 to 2014 are examined. The results show a statistically significant non-linear relationship between the largest shareholder (LO) and dividend payout for manager owned (MO) firms. MO firms reduce dividend distribution according to assets and revenue when the largest shareholder's controlling stake is low. However, at a higher level of controlling stake, MO firms increase dividend distribution, irrespective of firms share prices, assets and revenues. The study shows that corporation owned (CO) firms do not associate significantly with the dividend payout, but MO firms pursue different types of dividend distribution policies. Lastly, there is a need to improve the role of the second largest shareholder as a governance mechanism. (c) 2019, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. All rights reserved.

This study investigates the perceptions of firm executives with respect to the extent of the influence of corporate governance (CG) practices on the non-financial performance (NFP) of medium-sized firms in Nigeria. The theoretical support for the research is from the stakeholder and agency theories. The cross-sectional survey and the cluster and stratified probability proportionate sampling methods are adopted, while the data collection is through a structured questionnaire that covers four CG indicators of board size, director's qualification, ownership structure and board audit committee. The co-variance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) technique ensures the analysis of the data collected. The result indicates that CG has significant positive effect on firms' NFP. This outcome supports the urgent need for the development and execution of CG code of ethics for the non-listed firms alongside a regulatory agency for ensuring monitoring and compliance. The drawbacks are inclusive of the measure of variables on linear relationship basis and non-adoption of the longitudinal approach for the study. Future studies need to look at the usage of the intervening variables which, can further aid in evaluating the relationships of the research variables and their indirect and total effects.

The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a bandwagon effect of special dividends in United States industries. Specifically, we investigate whether the predictions of the information-signalling hypothesis or the agency theory account for the special dividend behaviour at the industry-level. Out of a broad sample of publicly listed firms in the US market, our results show that rival firms in concentrated industries follow other firms' special dividend announcements. The intra-industry effects of special dividend events indicate positive contagion effects on a rival firm's abnormal returns. Our findings lend credence to the information-signalling hypothesis, rather than to agency theory. This is because special dividends act as signals to convey information to the market on the sustainability of growing industry-wide earnings. The propensity to follow occurs because of industry homogeneity: comparable firms aim to validate the industry signal. (c) 2019

Purpose: Motivated by agency theory, this paper aims to explore the impact of bank diversification and bank independency on the likelihood of bank failure. The effects of corporate governance (ownership and board structures) are also examined. Design/methodology/approach: Logistic regressions are used to explore the role of corporate governance on bank failure risk. This sample covers 608 banks from eight European countries. Findings: The results suggest that the well-documented finding that diversification and bank independency may increase bank failure risk does not persist under strong corporate governance mechanism. Thus, to reduce the bank failure risk, diversification should be strongly monitored by the management to avoid excessive risk-taking by shareholders. Originality/value: The approach used in this study differs from that used in previous studies from certain perspectives. First, unlike most previous studies that focused on the relationship between bank performance and bank diversification, the impact of income and asset diversification on bank failure is tested. Also, the impact of a combined effect of diversification and corporate governance variables on bank failure is tested. This allows the control for different ownership and board variables as factors that would potentially affect the likelihood of bank failure. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study explores new evidence considering the global debate regarding board leadership structure and its effects on the dual performance of microfinance by observing 80 microfinance institutions in Bangladesh from 2010 to 2015. Random (GLS) and fixed (LSDV) effects models were applied in identifying the insignificant positive effects of CEO duality into microfinance sustainability and the negative effects on outreach of the poor. Results indicate that the structure of board leadership, have positive effects on the sustainability performance of microfinance but have negative effects on outreach performance. The findings contribute to the microfinance governance literature on board leadership and its effects on the dual performance of microfinance.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between internal corporate governance attributes and capital structure in a supply chain process of Malaysian listed firms. Most of prior works were based on agency theory, and the results are mixed. This study endeavored to examine the complementary relationship between multiple factors of governance to avoid providing repeated evidences and or to enrich the existing literature with different perspective, which can be achieved by supply chain strategy. The study was conducted in Malaysian listed firm of period 2014-2015. Regression analysis is used in this study as statistical tool of analysis. Based on statistical analysis, the results of this study reveal that only board size, board meeting, and audit committee size are correlated to capital structure. Other variables have no effect on capital structure. The analysis also showed that attributes of governance are complements to each other, in turn; this may lead to perfection of monitoring and management of the board decision making. This study contributes to protect beneficiary parties from manager's manipulation in a supply chain strategy. Also, the results of this study can be used as a support to develop Malaysian code of governance. (c) 2019, ExcelingTech Pub, UK.

This paper examines some accounting and legal aspects of the charge and discharge system and the relationship between it and the Agency Theory. This type of accounting was used when the economic activity was entrusted to an agent; it suggests that the Agency Theory is an excellent framework to analyze the accounts. Traditionally the Charge and Discharge has been linked to the decision making and control of the agent's management, on which there is a wide bibliography, however, until now, it has not been considered as an instrument to cancel conflicts that arise in the relationship between principal and agent and getting the equilibrium of the relationship between them. We analyzed the documents and that allowed us to show different aspects as identify all characteristic elements of the agency relationship, infer the interests of principal and agents, deduct the incentives used by the principal to align the behavior of the agents and conclude that this model of registration was able to neutralize the imbalances of interests and the asymmetric information between both.

Increasing pressure from stakeholders that demands for a holistic corporate report both in terms of financial and non-financial information, has resulted in a move towards a more integrated approach in corporate reporting. The aim of this study is to examine the presence of the elements of integrated reporting and the drivers for the adoption of such reports. The influence of internal and external pressure from the perspective of agency and stakeholder theories forms the focus of this study. Content analyses of the annual reports of the top 100 companies in Malaysia for the year 2014 are examined. The results show positive relationships for the independent variables mission and vision, and risk and opportunities with the presence of the elements of integrated reporting in the annual reports. The positive relationships reveal that companies that align key strategies with the mission and vision statement and take measures to address risk and opportunities of the organization, will be more proactive in implementing integrated reporting. The findings provide empirical evidence on the progress of integrated reporting in a developing country where research to examine the effects of specific determinants on the likelihood of companies in a developing country providing integrated reports is almost non-existent.

The use of corporate websites as communication medium may contribute to good governance and specifically transparency as one of the basic principles of governance, mitigating the effect of the agency problem. The primary objective of this study was to ascertain the link between voluntary corporate website disclosure and information asymmetry for the smallest JSE-listed companies. Rule 26, as issued by the LSE for its AIM-listed companies, was used as proxy for disclosure while the bid-ask spread stood as a proxy for information asymmetry. The results of a content analysis showed that the majority of smaller listed JSE companies are not on par with their UK counterparts. Using agency theory, it was argued that if information voluntarily disclosed by companies on their corporate websites is useful to investors, it should theoretically decrease information asymmetry. Although empirical evidence of a negative relationship between disclosure and the bid-ask spread was found, the relationship changed to not significant once controlled for market capitalisation. Besides the bid-ask spread, the association between disclosure and both share price volatility and share turnover (both as alternative proxies for information asymmetry) was tested, and both were found non-significantly related to disclosure. The results reported do suggest that the Rule 26 minimum corporate website disclosures may not be sufficient in persuading investors to change their trading behaviour. Although there has been no research on the voluntary compliance and effect of Rule 26 website disclosure on information asymmetry using JSE small-cap data, a major limitation of this study is that generalisation of results is limited to small listed companies.

Using Continental European data on Indonesia, this research investigates the effect of Board of Commissioners involvement which is measured by responsibility, seniority, women participation and independency on shareholder's wealth. This paper is the first research that examines the association between Board of Commissioners involvement and shareholder's wealth based on 249 Indonesia listed companies. Panel data analysis was used to assess whether the Board of Commissioners responsibility and independency have positive effect on shareholder's wealth. Based on the finding, seniority and women involvement have a negative relationship with shareholder's wealth. These findings have practical implication, i.e. the shareholders should consider the Board of Commissioners involvement in appointing and dismissing them. Theoretically, these findings contributed to the agency theory in the way that the Board of Commissioners involvement could reduce the agency cost and increase the wealth of shareholders. (c) BEIESP.

When a firm is facing default, equity holders have incentives to engage in asset substitution, underinvest, or directly transfer wealth. Few papers document investment distortions on account of debt-equity agency conflicts, only that the threat of distortions influence ex ante financing costs. A nonagency residential mortgage-backed security deal represents an entity that is highly leveraged where, ex ante, equity holders know they will face default. This provides an ideal laboratory for testing whether the threat of default creates any of the distortions predicted in theory. We estimate a lower bound on agency costs associated with direct wealth transfers to be in the range of $.018 per dollar. (c) 2017 INFORMS.

Emerging from the agency theory, corporate governance is the practice of ensuring a corporation conducts itself accountably, fairly and openly in all its dealings. The achievement of corporate performance relies on the mechanism efficiency of Corporate Governance both internally and externally. This study is intended to review the Canadian legal and practical landscape related to corporate governance and its external and internal mechanisms. One of the main goals of corporate governance is to ensure a company's executives are managing the finances effectively and that they always act in the best interest of stakeholders. Canada passed a law in 2003 to strengthen corporate governance. Based on the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), this Canadian law aims to create confidence in the Canadian market and protect investors from corporate scandals. Corporate governance mechanisms can be divided into internal and external mechanisms. The internal mechanism is essentially derived from the board of directors and its committees whereas the external mechanism is derived from laws and regulation, capital market, corporate control market, stock holders (ownership structure), and investor activities. The balance and effectiveness of the corporate governance mechanisms can create a better corporate financial performance. (c) 2019 The Authors.

We empirically investigate the largely unexplored relationship between corporate top management teams (TMT) and CVC unit managers. Doing so, we provide new insights into the interplay between TMT decisions and CVC managers' behaviour and how agency conflicts between them influence the survival of CVC units. Using a proprietary dataset of 64 CVC units we apply fsQCA in order to identify the interrelatedness, causal asymmetry and equifinality of agency-related conditions leading to survival. We relativise former literature by demonstrating that financial incentivisation of CVC managers need to be complemented by additional factors to impact the survival of CVC units. Further, we conclude that the decision-making autonomy of CVC managers seem to work as a form of non-financial incentive. Finally, we demonstrate that the configuration of providing strategic support, investing with high strategic proximity, and non-autonomously acting CVC managers is related to non-survival of the CVC unit.

Our population is manufacturing companies listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2003 to 2016. Data analysis use Multi Discriminant analysis. Based on indicators, we model corporate failure using agency theory and pecking order theory. The research results show that information based on cash flows have accuracy level higher than information based on profit. The study also evidence that factors of funding, investment, and asset management is indicators that can be used in investigation the possibility of corporate failure. When company experience negative profit, the risk assets more funding by debt, so it can be agency problem. This finding support agency theory. Similarly when companies experienced negative cash flow, funding with equity becomes a main funding. (c) 2019, Allied Academies.

Financial statements of central government entities play a pivotal role as an instrument of accountability to the public in the management of state budget. However, the numbers of previous studies which analyze determinants or efforts to improve the financial statements quality of central government entities are still limited. This research aims to analyze factors hypothesized will affect the quality of central government entities' financial statements. The development of research hypotheses is mainly based on agency and institutional theories. Data were gathered through questionnaire survey method to 171 respondents of financial management officials from 41 Indonesia ministry/central government entities. Structural equation modeling partial least squares (SEM-PLS) was used as instrument to test the hypotheses. The results show that compliance with state financial management regulations, quality of human resources, reliability of internal control systems, and utilization of information technology provide positive effects on the financial statements quality of central government entities. This finding indicates the importance of those determinant factors to improve the accountability in managing the state finances. (c) 2019, Allied Academies.

Ownership structure proves to be one of the major factors affecting company accounting and market-based performance. The current study explored the direct ownership structure characteristics-performance relationship, with the former including government ownership, foreign ownership, and institutional ownership. The target sample of the study comprised of Omani non-financial firms examined in a three-year period. In addition, the study explored the moderating role of audit quality on the relationship between ownership structure and ROA, while considering the role of leverage as a control variable. The OLS regression was adopted to examine the direct government, ownership, foreign ownership and institutional ownership relationship with ROA, whereas the Hierarchical Multiple Regression was adopted to examine audit quality role as a moderating variable on the direct relationships. The obtained results revealed a significant and positive relationship between government ownership and foreign ownership and ROA, but an insignificant one between ROA and institutional ownership. The results also did not support the examined moderating role of audit quality on the above direct relationships. Towards the end, the study enumerated recommendations for future work. (c) 2019 KIIE

The effectiveness of corporate governance provides a promising value creation to firm even during implementation of new policy for example during Goods & Services Tax (GST) implementation in year 2015. By embracing agency theory, this paper investigates five corporate governance variables relationship with operating performance (sales growth and current ratio) during and after GST implementation. This study examines 265 Malaysian listed firms for year 2015 (during) and 2016 (after) GST implementation period. The OLS regression results report that there is significant relationship of corporate governance in firm operating performance particularly during and after GST implementation. Board independent, CEO age and family CEO have positively contribute to sales growth during and after GST implementation. For working capital effectiveness during and after GST implementation, the CEO age and family CEO delineate significant positive association with operating performance (current ratio). This displays on the governance effectives in discharging their roles to strengthen operating performance particularly during a new financial or tax policy implementation that requires necessary changes in business processes. It uncovers the transparency of Malaysian corporate governance commitment and acceptance to GST for firm and country sustainable development. In sum, an effective governance system that supports the firm operating performance makes GST as a business friendly tax system. (c) ExcelingTech Pub, UK.

This study investigates the impact of insider-ownership of publicly traded firms on their performance, cost of debt (COD) and cost of equity. We use a sample of 104 non-finance listed companies of Pakistan for the period from 2006 to 2016. Our study is conducted in Pakistan as a developing country in which insider-ownership is dominant, and a weak external corporate governance mechanism increases the payoffs from insider-ownership. We use feasible generalized least square (FGLS) regression methods to examine these hypotheses. Based on agency theory, we find that insider-ownership enhances firm performance. Furthermore, our results show that insider-ownership reduced the COD and equity. Higher ownership decreases the opportunistic behavior of insiders. It also reduces the creditor's perception of the likelihood of default on loan payments and reduces agency issues among shareholders. The insider will invest in positive NPV projects which will help maximize shareholders' wealth and minimize the COD. Similarly, the relationship between insider-ownership and cost of equity is significant but negative. Supporting the convergence of interest increase in ownership helps in aligning the goals of managers and stakeholders whereby the insider will focus on value creation by minimizing equity cost.

The financing decision among technology-based firms has become a significant issue around the globe, with the core concern to be that such firms may encounter financing limitations that could bar their growth ability. Using 92 technology-based firms observations from 2009-2012 and employing ordinary least square (OLS) regression, this study finds that there is a significant and positive relationship between board of directors' effectiveness and capital structure, and there is an inverse significant relationship between information asymmetry and capital structure. This indicates that technology-based firms having a robust board of directors minimise agency conflicts by mandating that managers, use more debts to be consistent with the interest of the shareholders. This is consistent with the agency theory where the obligation of interest payments that stem from the debt use assists in resolving the free cash flow issue. Further, the inverse relationship with information asymmetry shows that technology-based firms go through financing limitations owing to the asymmetric information that prevent their growth and development ability.

This chapter illustrates the main issues with respect to innovation process within family firms. In the first part, it describes the main theories underlying the innovation process of family firms (agency theory, altruism, portfolio theory, stewardship theory, socioemotional wealth perspective). In the second part, it exposes the R&D underinvestment problem in large companies with a focus on the effect of the family ownership on the R&D investments. In the third part, it describes the effect of family ownership on the innovation output with a focus on the kind of innovation (radical vs. incremental). In the fourth section, studies exploring the innovation strategies of family firms (prospectors, analysers, defenders, reactors) are examined. In the fifth section, it sheds light on the innovation management process of family firms. In this part, it explores the issues of internal innovation process (functional vs. cross-functional structure) and of the partnerships with external actors aimed to generate innovation.

This chapter analyses the relationship between ownership structure and leverage, providing an integrated theoretical approach that combines traditional financial theories, agency theory, and recently developed theories relating to non-financial preferences. The results show that, after controlling for endogeneity, being a family firm has a positive effect on the propensity to incur debt. These findings add to the existing body of literature and underline the need for a multi-theoretical approach when explaining the capital structure of family firms. The authors apply panel data methodology to control for individual heterogeneity of family firms. The chapter uses a sample of Spanish firms operating in the tourism industry. (c) 2020, IGI Global.

Research Question: This is an investigation of board independence to determine whether management shares information with the board, or withholds information to retain autonomy. A key contribution is to examine the interaction of institutional ownership with the main test variables to determine whether institutional governance influences the information environment as board independence is increased. Research Findings: The results show that information asymmetry decreases internally and increases externally as board independence increases, yet institutional ownership appears to moderate or reverse this relationship. The following variables are used to explain why managers of firms are likely to have more information than outsiders: sticky SG&A costs, bid-ask spread, and forecast error. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The desired oversight from independent board members appears to be associated with reduced transparency between the firm and investors. Information sharing is lower for increased board independence when the firm's ownership is less sophisticated. Practitioner/Policy Implications: These findings suggest that requiring increased board independence may reflect reduced transparency for firms with less institutional ownership. Further research should be conducted on the influence of institutional ownership on board member selection, and the relationship between management and board members appointed with institutional support.

This study aims to investigate the impact of the ownership hierarchy on the retention of cash. Ownership structure has dissimilar from each organization as some firms have surplus cash holdings and some firms have fewer cash holdings. This study examines the pattern of shareholding in Pakistan and its consequences on holding of cash. Trade-off theory, peaking-order theory, and agency theory have already hashed out the sensation between cash holding and ownership structure. Fixed Redundant likelihood test, Hausman Test and Panel Data Regression model are used to compute the final results. This study involves 74 non-financial firms to investigate the prime effects. The data have been taken from the biggest database of Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100 index Pakistan and company financial reports from the period 2006 to 2017. Significant findings of this paper are based on two different research questions. First, how the pattern of shareholding has an impact on the decision of cash holding? Second, how the boundaries of the firm affect cash holding? These findings imply that cash holding and ownership structure are a vital element of the firm's financial policy. This paper concludes that there is a negative and substantial relationship between cash holding and the pattern of shareholdings and the boundaries of the firm have an imperative effect on the holding of cash.

Agency theory contends that shareholder interests require protection by separation of the roles of board chair and chief executive officer (CEO). Duality (CEO also chairman of the board) increases the likelihood of the CEO entrenchment by reducing board monitoring effectiveness. Stewardship theory argues that shareholder interests are maximized by having the dual CEOs. According to stewardship theory, firms with dual CEOs have some major advantages over their counterparts. Such CEOs establish strong leadership and provide better strategic directions for the firm. Consequently, shareholders benefit form dual CEOs. Evidence on the relationship between dual CEO and firm performance is mixed. While some studies found that there is a positive relationship between two variables, others found an inverse relationship between two. This study attempts to shed some light on this issue. Results from the study indicate that there is a statistically significantly positive relationship between dual CEO and the firm's size, the number of insider director, and the percentage of shares held by the control shareholders. Results from this study indicated that there is no significant relationship between the CEO duality and financial performance in the short run. However, the firms with dual CEO, on average, perform better than their counterparts in the long run. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Preference for appearance over substance (AOS) refers to people's desire to look better than their actual appearance. In this paper, we explore the economic implications of AOS on corporate investment. Using novel country-level proxies for AOS based on the prevalence of plastic surgery and cosmetic industry concentration, we first document that AOS is negatively (positively) associated with investment sensitivity to growth opportunities (cash flows). Second, external financing is less (more) affected by growth opportunities (cash flows) in stronger AOS countries than in weaker AOS countries. We conclude that people's preference for AOS leads firms to suboptimal investment. (c) 2019 Korean Securities Association

Organizational control is used to coordinate the activities and align the interests of independently managed marketing channel firms, which should result in better performance (i.e., disciplining effects of control). Yet, some research suggests that control may have unintended, crowding out effects, such as increased opportunism. Using meta-analytic techniques, the authors attempt to reconcile these contradictory findings and provide some empirical generalizations about control in marketing channels. Based on transaction cost economics and agency theory, hypotheses regarding the antecedents and consequences of control in marketing channels are developed and tested. The results show that environmental uncertainty and transaction specific investments are related positively to both outcome and process control. Performance ambiguity, in contrast, is related negatively to output control. In general, the results support the disciplining effects of organizational control in marketing channels through reduced opportunism and enhanced performance. One exception is the positive, crowding out relationship between process control and opportunism. (c) Charles A. Ingene, James R. Brown and Rajiv P. Dant 2019.

This research highlights the special problems facing the corporate governance of financial intermediaries and combines this theoretical perspective with bank observations in order to offer policy recommendations for their industry. The standard agency theory defines the corporate governance problem in terms of how equity and debt holders influence managers to act in the best interests of those providers of capital to firms. The results show that the relationship between directors' collateralized shares, loan concentration and a bank's non-performing loans has a significant positive, indicating that bad corporate governance and loan concentration are important warning signs for banks.

Decentralisation has been attributed to fruitful outcomes for public services. However, by employing agency theory in this paper we argue that full decentralisation of all dimensions may not help, at least in the public bus service. Instead, better quality and satisfaction can only be achieved in a more fiscal but less administrative and political decentralisation. Data from two municipalities in the emerging economy of Vietnam is used to provide the empirical evidence. This paper thus is contributed to the literature of decentralisation and the emerging one of quality and satisfaction in public services. Limitations of the study are also discussed.

Mudharabah is a profit-sharing partnership agreement of a business venture to carry out economic activities. Despite its potential socioeconomic benefits to the parties involved and to the society, the application of mudharabah is limited to engineered Islamic finance products which transform the conventional financial products into Shari'ah-compliant ones. We argue that, in order to realise the mudharabah true potentials, among others, the mudharabah contract needs to be revived. The purpose of this study is to propose a framework in reviving the mudharabah contract between the sahibul mal (capital provider/investor) and the mudharib (entrepreneur). The research methods used in this study are library research and content analysis. As a result, agency theory is recognised to be very relevant to the mudharabah contract. To revive the mudharabah contract, tahaluf concept (Islamic treaty with compliance with Shari'ah) is identified as the most suitable concept to be adopted. This proposed framework serves as guidance in formulating the data collection strategy from different perspectives i.e. from sahibul mal, mudharib, Shari'ah advisors and academicians.

The supply chain management has emerged as a key competitive tool, however, little or no attention has been given to explore the link between supply chain governance, external corporate governance mechanism such as board characteristics and supply chain performance. Therefore, the current study is being carried out explore the relationship among three interlinked phenomena such as external corporate governance, supply chain governance and firm supply performance. It is argued in this study that the supply chain governance mediates the relationship between corporate governance firm supply performance. The SMART-PLS is used to achieve the objective of the current stud. The data is collected from the operation managers, production managers and finance managers of manufacturing firms listed in Indonesian Stock Exchange. The results of the study have shown a great deal of agreement with our proposed hypothesis. Meanwhile the findings have provided support to the predictions of agency theory and resource based theory.

Integrated reporting is the latest novelty in the corporate reporting field. It is a tool capable of better representing the capacity of companies to create value over time. In recent years, attention to this new reporting tool has grown in both professional and academic fields. However, despite past research that has analysed many aspects of integrated reporting, the integrated reporting quality and its determinants are still little explored. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing the effect of board characteristics on integrated reporting quality according to an agency theory approach. The findings, based on a sample of 134 international firms, show a positive relationship between the size, independence, diversity, and activity of a board with integrated reporting quality. This study contributes to enriching literature in this area in various ways. First, it broadens the scope of application of agency theory; second, it identifies further internal determinants of integrated reporting quality. This is the first study that analyses the impact of the characteristics of a board as a determining factor of integrated reporting quality. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

While prior work has investigated the impact of (a) ownership structure and (b) board gender diversity separately on corporate environmental performance, researchers have not studied the potentially important relationship between ownership control and female board diversity in influencing corporate environmental performance jointly. We do so in the context of majority ownership in family-controlled and dual-class firms whose motives and influence are theoretically different from that of the firm's minority shareholders. Drawing on resource dependency, socioemotional wealth theory, and secondary agency theory, we hypothesize that majority family owners and dual-class owners likely choose women directors to help advance their personal preferences for environmental corporate social responsibility. Our empirical tests utilizing 2,755 U.S. firm years over the 2010-2015 show that, as hypothesized, these two majority ownership types interact with board gender diversity to positively influence corporate environmental performance.

Drawing on the agency theory perspective and following the recent calls to contemplate multiple dimensions of diversity simultaneously, this study intends to empirically investigate the effects of board diversity as a multifaceted phenomenon, specifically nationality and gender diversity on the extent of corporate sustainability performance in a developing country, namely, Palestine over the period 2013 to 2018. Empirical evidence on the connection between board diversity and corporate sustainability performance from countries influenced by cultural and traditional terms is remarkably limited. This study handled this research gap and went beyond the narrow and pre-conceived perspectives. Thereby, contributes theoretically and practically to the corporate sustainability literature by providing in-depth insights about board diversity and corporate sustainability-related activities as paradigmatic evidence from a developing country with an exceptional cultural environment of business. The ambiguous findings are often deemed a consequence of endogeneity problem. Therefore, to provide a thorough and profound analysis, two-step system GMM are performed. Additionally, our findings are robust since four proxies for nationality and gender diversity are employed. The results unveiled that corporate sustainability-related actions are positively and insignificantly affected by nationality and gender diversity. This weak nexus between the two mechanisms is widely attributed to so-called geographically proximate cultures and gender discrimination in the workplace. These empirical results provide a useful and multidimensional insights for regulatory parties, companies, and different groups of stakeholders to promote the link between board diversity and corporate sustainability beyond the current boundaries.

Integrated reporting (IR) is used to demonstrate a firm's capacity to create value in the short, medium, and long term. It can better represent existing relationships between the company and its stakeholders, with a particular focus on investors. Attention to IR has grown considerably in recent years. However, studies on the determinants of IR quality are still limited. This study aims to bridge this literature gap by being the first study to analyse the role of ownership structure in IR context. To this end, it uses agency theory and is based on a sample of 152 international companies that have adopted IR. The results indicate a positive effect of institutional ownership and a negative effect of ownership concentration, managerial ownership and state ownership on the quality of integrated reports. These results are also consistent with the level of alignment of integrated reports with the <IR> framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study that analyses the role of ownership structure in the IR policies. (c) 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Research question/issue: Using a multitheoretic view of boards, this study examines the impact of boardroom gender diversity (BGD) on voluntary intellectual capital (IC) disclosure in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses in China--the world's second-biggest economy, which is moving from a planned economy to a market-oriented one. Furthermore, this study also investigates the impact of family ownership on the relationship between BGD and IC disclosure in the Chinese environment, which is characterized by less-developed corporate governance mechanisms. Research findings/insights: Based on a comprehensive content analysis of Chinese IPO prospectuses between 2009 and 2017 and measuring disclosure index at 78 dimensions under six broad categories of IC, the empirical results document (a) a significant positive relation between BGD and IC disclosure--in line with resource dependence theory, (b) a significant negative impact of female independent directors on IC disclosure--opposite to agency theory predictions, and that (c) the BGD-IC disclosure relationship is generally stronger for firms with two or more women on boards--in line with critical mass theory in China. Finally, this study also reveals that family ownership has adverse impacts on the BGD-IC disclosure relationship. These results are robust to a battery of sensitivity analyses. Practitioner/policy implications: This study provides positive capital market implications of BGD through enhanced IC disclosure in IPO prospectuses. In doing so, the study has important implications for regulators and top management teams in devising policies concerning female representation on boards and voluntary disclosure of IC to inform the market participants of the true value of the company.

Capital structure is the outcome of market conditions, financial decisions taken by the firm, and credit rationing of fund providers. Research on the capital structure of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has gained momentum in recent years. The present study aims to identify key contributors, key areas, current dynamics, and suggests future research directions in the field of the capital structure of SMEs. This paper adopts a systematic literature review methodology along with bibliometric, network, and content analysis on a sample of 262 studies taken from the Web of Science database to examine the research activities that have taken place on this topic. Most influential papers are identified based on citations and PageRank, along with the most influential authors. The co-citation network is developed to see the intellectual structure of this research area. Applying bibliometric tools, four research clusters have been identified and content analysis performed on the papers identified in the clusters. It is found that the major research focus in this area is around theory testing--mainly, pecking order theory, trade-off theory, and agency theory. Determinants of capital structure, trade credit, corporate governance, and bankruptcy are also the prominent research topics in this field. Also, this study has identified the research gaps and has proposed five actionable research directions for the future. (c) 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Purpose: This study aims to analyse the role that the chief executive officer (CEO) has on integrated reporting (IR) adoption and whether this role is moderated by incentives to promote corporate transparency, including information asymmetry problems and financial constraints. IR represents the last frontier of corporate disclosure and aims to represent, through the annual integrated report, the ability of an organization to create value over time. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on 10,819 observations (an unbalanced data panel of 1,588 firms for the period 2009-2017). A logistic regression model is used to examine the association between CEO power and disclosure of an integrated report. Findings: The results show that CEOs with greater power oppose the disclosure of integrated information, and this behaviour is not modified by firms' incentives. Furthermore, greater growth opportunities increase CEO opposition to disclosing integrated information on the creation of value, perhaps as a consequence of the possible use of it by competitors. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature. First, it expands the scientific debate on the topic of IR. Second, it extends the application field of agency theory, which is seldom used to explain the phenomena related to IR. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Intellectual capital is an important tool for strengthening a firm's competitive advantage and helping it achieve its medium- and long-term financial objectives. Currently accepted accounting principles do not outline strict rules and regulations for intellectual capital disclosure. However, the advent of integrated reporting offer firms an innovative tool to disseminate this information. Although previous research has analysed the intellectual capital found in integrated reports, no studies have analysed the board of directors' role in intellectual capital disclosure policies. This study uses agency theory to analyse the effect of board characteristics on intellectual capital disclosure quality (ICDQ) in the context of integrated reporting. To this end, it develops a new scoring system to measure ICDQ. The results, based on a sample of 130 international firms operating in different sectors, show a positive relationship between board size, independence, diversity and activity with ICDQ.

Purpose: Motivated by the agency theory, this study aims to empirically examine the nexus between board attributes and a firm's financing decisions of non-financial listed firms in Palestine and how the previous relationship is moderated and shaped by the level of gender diversity. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis on a panel data was used. Further, we applied three different approaches of static panel data "pooled OLS, fixed effect and random effect." Fixed-effects estimator was selected as the optimal and most appropriate model. In addition, to control for the potential endogeneity problem and to profoundly analyze the study data, the authors perform the one-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. Dynamic panel GMM specification was superior in generating robust findings. Findings: The findings clearly unveil that all explanatory variables in the study model have a significant influence on the firm's financing decisions. Moreover, the results report that the impact of board size and board independence are more positive under conditions of a high level of gender diversity, whereas the influence of CEO duality on the firm's leverage level turned from negative to positive. In a nutshell, gender diversity moderates the effect of board structure on a firm's financing decisions. Research limitations/implications: This study was restricted to one institutional context (Palestine); therefore, the results reflect the attributes of the Palestinian business environment. In this vein, it is possible to generate different findings in other countries, particularly in developed markets. Practical implications: The findings of this study can draw responsible parties and policymakers' attention in developing countries to introduce and contextualize new mechanisms that can lead to better monitoring process and help firms in attracting better resources and establishing an optimal capital structure. For instance, entities should mandate a minimum quota for the proportion of women incorporation in boardrooms. Originality/value: This study provides empirical evidence on the moderating role of gender diversity on the effect of board structure on firm's financing decisions, something that was predominantly neglected by the earlier studies and has not yet examined by ancestors. Thereby, to protrude nuanced understanding of this novel and unprecedented idea, this study thoroughly bridges this research gap and contributes practically and theoretically to the existing corporate governance-capital structure literature.

Corporate social performance (CSP) is one of the main drivers of corporate reputation. The main aim of this study is to analyze the moderating effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting quality on the relation of CSP and corporate reputation through two effects. First, it may enhance the firm's credibility because CSR reporting favors CSP consistency by reducing managers' CSR discretion and easing CSP comparability along the time. Second, it may increase the visibility of CSR actions beyond direct stakeholders involved in them. Analyzing an international sample of 132 companies from nine countries for the period 2011-2016, we show that all of the CSP dimensions (social, environmental, and economic) positively affect corporate reputation. We also find that good CSR reporting quality increases the intensity of the environmental and social performance effects on corporate reputation. Results provide a new perspective of the role CSR reporting quality that managers have to deal to get better impacts of CSP on corporate reputation.

Purpose: The purpose of this research is to examine whether board gender diversity reduces the agency costs of firms in the context of Chinese listed firms. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a large sample of 23,340 firm-year observations of Chinese listed companies during 2004-2017. The authors use ordinary least squares regressions as the primary methodology with a wide range of methods to control for endogeneity and to check robustness, including the fixed-effect method, instrumental variable approach, lagged gender diversity measures, propensity score matching, Blau index, Shannon index and industry-adjusted measures of agency costs. Findings: The evidence reveals that the participation of female directors in corporate board reduces agency costs, which correlates with conflicts of interest. Moreover, gender-diverse boards are more effective in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), in which agency issues are more severe. Female directors also provide better monitoring roles in more-developed areas. Finally, corporate boards that have a critical mass of female directors have a greater tendency to reduce agency costs as compared to their token participation. Overall, all findings support the validity of agency theory. Practical implications: This study shows the economic benefit of female directors in the boardroom by reducing agency costs and by improving firms' governance structure. Regarding the government, which is gradually introducing board gender diversity policies, this study provides valuable pragmatic information for Chinese regulators on this issue. Originality/value: This study extends the literature by providing evidence that gender diversity in boardroom matters for shareholders' wealth maximization. It provides novel evidence that a critical mass of female directors is more effective in reducing agency costs compared to a single female on the board, and that the effect of gender diversity varies in relation to ownership structure and region.

Top management teams (TMTs) and boards of directors (boards) face increasingly turbulent environments as they strategically lead firms toward superior firm performance. The dominant theoretical lens about these two groups is agency theory, which focuses on the need for independence. We suggest that the environment in which the TMT and board govern is broader than conceptualized by agency theory, and thus theories regarding strategic leadership also require expansion. Drawing from the multiteam systems literature and broader systems theory, we offer a new consideration of the TMT and board as part of a strategic-oriented multiteam system, which we refer to as a strategic leadership system. The core premise of our theorizing is that TMTs and boards that strongly emphasize attention to both working independently and interdependently enhance their group and shared task performance, and in turn, firm performance. We further nuance this theorizing by describing how external environmental characteristics (i.e., munificence, complexity, dynamism) strengthen or weaken the influence of attention to working independently or interdependently, thereby shifting the zones of system effectiveness. Based on this theorizing, we offer a 2 3 2 framework combined with practical recommendations for strategic leaders. Additional implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed. (c) 2020 Academy of Management Review.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it aims to investigate the dynamic impact of board composition (board size, board independence and board diversity) on independent corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices (marketplace, environment, community and workplace). Second, it tends to examine the mutual effect of board composition and CSR practices on organizational returns (return on assets and Tobin's Q) of 631 Malaysian PLCs listed on Bursa Malaysia during 2006-2017. Design/methodology/approach: The dynamic model (system GMM) provided by Arellano and Bond (1991) and Arellano and Bover (1995) is used for estimations that control for potential dynamic endogeneity, reverse causality, unobserved heterogeneity and simultaneity problems. Findings: Findings reveal weak linkage between board composition and CSR practices where only board diversity is found to be positively linked to marketplace practices of CSR. Further, the mutual impact of board composition and CSR practices on organizational returns suggests board size be positive and board independence to be negative with Tobin's Q. Board diversity is negative with ROA and positive with Tobin's Q. Conversely, CSR practices indicate marketplace practices are positive and community practices are negative with Tobin's Q, environment practices are insignificant with performance, whereas workplace practices are positive with ROA and negative with Tobin's Q. Practical implications: This research is practically considerable for Bursa Malaysia, Securities Commission Malaysia, policymakers, stakeholders, investors and managers. For academia, the theoretical linkages between agency theory, resource dependence theory, resource-based view and stakeholder theory are highlighted. Moreover, methodological underpinnings are also novel for academicians as well as for practitioners. Originality/value: The paper uncovers multiple aspects: first, it elaborates the dynamic relationship between board composition and CSR practices; second, it examines the combined effect of board composition and CSR practices on company's accounting and market gains; finally, the study controls for dynamic endogeneity that is the main econometric problem for CG-CSR-performance relationships.

Many government services are delivered by (partially) autonomous agencies. Governments need effective measures for contracting, steering, and monitoring agencies and to balance control and trust. In the literature, control-based agency theory and trust-based stewardship theory have often been portrayed as alternative and competing approaches. In empirical studies in public administration, however, these approaches often find mixed and contradictory results. Against this background, this article analyzes how a combination of trust- and control-based approaches, explicitly founded on agency and stewardship theory, can help explain when participants find a given governance regime to be most satisfactory. A survey instrument is developed which, for the first time, fully measures the rich concept of stewardship theory in conjunction with agency theory. The analysis of the governance of Dutch agencies shows that government indeed combines governance solutions from both theoretical camps and illuminates under which conditions this combination is most satisfactory.

Directive 2014/95/EU (the EU Directive) requires large companies to disclose information on the way they operate and manage social and environmental challenges, thus shifting the disclosure of non-financial information (NFI) from the voluntary to the mandatory realm. Building on the idea that regulatory changes can shape stakeholder expectations, we hypothesized that legitimacy (agency) theory's ability to predict NFI disclosure after the implementation of the EU Directive, and hence after NFI disclosure became mandatory, would decrease (increase). By relying on a hand-collected data set measuring NFI disclosure, we have found that legitimacy theory maintains its predictive ability in the new mandatory setting, while agency theory's predictive ability partially increases.

Previous literature has found that listed family firms underperform their nonfamily counterparts in terms of environmental performance, but has not explained why this occurs. We address this research gap by hypothesizing that training and development practices (i.e., managerial practices devoted to providing training and development for the workforce) mediate the relationship between family blockholders and environmental performance. Using a sample of 33,901 firm-year observations from 2002 to 2016 distributed across 56 countries and employing the structural equation model technique, we find that investment in training and development practices explains almost half of the negative relationship between family blockholders and environmental performance. Our study contributes to the agency theory debate on principal-principal problems by explaining why family blockholders could damage other blockholders and minority shareholders.

Many studies have examined the direct relationship between the two corporate practices: corporate social responsibility (CSR) and earnings management (EM); however, the results remain heterogeneous. To achieve the consensus, this study builds upon the classical agency theory and examines the role of managerial entrenchment in creating organizational facades related to CSR and EM. More specifically, it examines the relationship between CSR performance and EM in the presence of managerial entrenchment and the direct effect of managerial entrenchment on CSR decoupling. In doing so, this article provides evidence of a previously underappreciated yet fundamentally important aspect, that is, managerial entrenchment, that may significantly affect the quality of earnings as well as the level of alignment between CSR disclosure and performance. Our analyses of longitudinal data of an international sample for the period of 2007-2016 supports that managerial entrenchment significantly moderates the relationship between CSR performance and EM. Furthermore, our study reveals that entrenched managers decouple CSR disclosure and performance. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the relationship between the corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance and the readability of annual report. The shareholder theory suggests that CSR firms will provide more transparent disclosures because this reflects a socially and environmentally responsible behavior and a firm's commitment to high ethical standards. In the same time, the agency theory offers an opposite view. It predicts that opportunistic managers use CSR as an entrenchment strategy and hide their maneuvers through complex textual financial disclosures. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 100 listed firms on the French CACAll-shares index over the period from 2013 to 2016, the authors use a panel regression analysis and run other estimation methods (IV-2SLS) and simultaneous equation model to address the endogeneity issues. They assess the readability of annual reports using the Gunning-Fog Index and the Flesch Index derived from the computational linguistics literature. Findings: The results show a significant positive relationship between CSR performance and the readability of annual report. Firms engaging in CSR practices are more likely to provide transparent disclosures with higher readability because this reflects a socially responsible behavior and a firm's commitment to high ethical standards. This result supports the stakeholder theory and the corporate reputational view. The finding is also robust to alternative readability measurements and to endogeneity bias. Practical implications: This study helps all market participants to more comprehensively evaluate the CSR performance disclosed on annual report. It encourages managers to consider CSR as a means to prevent the opacity risk through improved information quality. It also drives French authorities to better regulate the narrative disclosure of CSR firms and change the way companies design their reporting practices. Moreover, it encourages CSR rating agencies to become the dominant definition of CSR evaluation by granting more importance to the quality of disclosed information. Originality/value: This study extends previous research on the potential impact of CSR on information quality measured by annual report readability in the French context. Unlike prior studies on the impact of CSR on information quality, that focus exclusively on earnings management and adopt qualitative approaches to assess the SCR score, the authors use simultaneously the Gunning-Fog Index and the Flesch Index to assess the information quality and extract the CSR score from the CSRHub database of companies' social, environmental and governance performance.

The discourse of corporate sustainability performance (CSP) has created an increasing motivation for companies to improve their competitive advantage. This study examines the drivers leading to a high level of CSP within non-financial Turkish companies listed in the Borsa Istanbul Sustainability Index. Drawing on both stakeholder and agency theories, we formulate a set of hypotheses that link CSP with ownership structure, board diversity, and firm-specific characteristics. Based on logit and probit models, the empirical results tend to confirm the positive influence of foreign and institutional ownerships in shaping CSP and indicate that CSP is positively linked with board size and the proportion of independent board members. Further, the findings show that companies with a leading level of CSP have a lower return than companies with mediocre CSP based on a market-based measure, Tobin's Q. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

With supply chain finance gaining more prominence in practice and drawing increasing attention from researchers, the question arises how this emerging discipline can build on existing theoretical conceptualisations. However, few studies have incorporated theoretical frameworks and there remains therefore a gap in literature. To fill this gap, the study reviews five theories on their suitability for supply chain finance: transaction cost economics, agency theory, network theory, collaborative networks and social exchange theory. A Scottish focus group consisting of practitioners involved in supply chain finance provided empirical data for the evaluation. The findings suggest that there is supporting evidence for using agency theory, network theory, transaction cost economics and social exchange theory as theoretical frameworks for studying phenomena of supply chain finance. Furthermore, the results indicate that the conceptualisations based on agency theory should be extended with 'reverse principal-agent theory' to fit with the contingencies of supply chain finance. The frameworks of collaborative networks are found less suitable. In addition to these theoretical considerations, the focus group discussion also points out that the financial department's collaboration with other departments involved in the primary supply chain process in firms needs to be improved. To achieve this training and supplier development, particularly for smaller firms, is seen as key. These outcomes have informed a research agenda for research groups, early career researchers and doctoral students. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to the existing capital structure and board structure literature by examining the relationship among corporate governance, ownership structure and capital structure. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a panel data of 595 firm-year observations from a unique and comprehensive data set of 119 Chinese real estate listed firms from 2014 to 2018. It uses fixed effect and random effect regression analysis techniques to examine the hypotheses. Findings: The results show that the board size, ownership concentration and firm size have positive influences on capital structure. State ownership and firm profitability have inverse influences on capital structure. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that better-governed companies in the real estate sector tend to have better capital structure. These findings highlight the unique Chinese context and also offer regulators a strong incentive to pursue corporate governance reforms formally and jointly with the ownership structure. Finally, the results suggest investors the chance to shape detailed expectations about capital structure behavior in China. Future research could investigate capital structure using different arrangement, conducting face-to-face meetings with the firm's directors and shareholders. Practical implications: The findings offer support to corporate managers and investors in forming or/and expecting an optimal capital structure and to policymakers and regulators for ratifying laws and developing institutional support to improve the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms. Originality/value: This paper extends, as well as contributes to the current capital structure and corporate governance literature, by proposing new evidence on the effect of board structure and ownership structure on capital structure. The results will help policymakers in different countries in estimating the sufficiency of the available corporate governance reforms to improve capital structure management.

Purpose: Although proponents of integrated reporting (IR) advocate that this emerging practice has the potential to transform corporate reporting, the eventuation of this expectation would depend on the incentive IR provides to firms. This study aims to examine whether IR is associated with cost of debt and whether IR moderates the relationship between financial reporting quality and cost of debt. Design/methodology/approach: Based on insights drawn from information asymmetry and agency theories, the authors develop models that link IR and financial reporting quality with a firm's cost of debt. The authors analyze 847 firm-year observations drawn from non-financial firms traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, for the period between 2009 and 2015. Findings: The authors find that firms that provide integrated reports tend to have a lower cost of debt than those do not provide IR. The authors also find an inverse association between financial reporting quality and cost of debt, and that integrated reports accentuate this association. The findings suggest that the debt market perceives value in the information presented in integrated reports beyond what is furnished in financial reports. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to document evidence suggesting that the debt market perceives value in the information presented in integrated reports, beyond what is furnished in financial reports.

Integrating expatriate staffing and leadership succession literature, this study investigates the influence of expatriate top manager replacement on foreign subsidiary performance and the moderating effects of subsidiary context. Building on a refined understanding of agency theory and evidence from 2113 firm-year observations, including 260 expatriate successions, this study shows that when expatriates are replaced, regardless by whom (either host-country national or expatriate manager), the performance of the subsidiaries declines, suggesting that the departure of expatriate top managers often see subsidiaries being left in a less than favorable condition. If the subsidiary's prior performance has been unsatisfactory, the newly appointed expatriate might not be able to prevent further deterioration of its performance. Replacing expatriates with host-country national managers can help improve subsidiary performance, but this usually happens in older, more established subsidiaries. These findings framed in a refined agency theory provide us a more in-depth understanding of expatriate staffing failure. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate governance of Oman's financial sector companies. Intellectual capital has been found to successfully contribute to the economic wealth creation of firms in germane literature. Unfortunately, financial statements do not necessarily capture and reflect the contributions of intellectual capital, thereby leading to an information asymmetry between companies and users of financial statements. The research also investigates the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital efficiency across various financial subsectors. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports available on Muscat Securities Market for 31 listed financial sector companies for the period 2012 to 2016 and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Intellectual capital is measured using Pulic's efficiency measure of value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). Corporate governance individual components such as board characteristics, audit committee characteristics and ownership structure are presented as independent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that board size and frequency of audit committee meetings have a significant association with the intellectual capital efficiency of Oman's financial sector. VAIC and human capital efficiency of banks are also significantly influenced by most of the corporate governance mechanisms; however, other subsectors do not report such findings. Corporate governance of banks in comparison to other subsectors effectively engages in utilizing the potential of intellectual capital efficiency. Agency theory and resource dependency theory find limited support as a result of this study. The GMM results are not robust to the alternative instruments. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small as the study is limited to the listed financial sector of Oman. Future studies can be extended to include all of Oman's or GCC's listed companies. Additionally, the intellectual capital is measured using the construct of VAIC which suffers some limitations and can be overcome using other tools such as content analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that Oman's regulators can create an awareness strategy on highlighting the importance of intellectual capital for companies (board of directors and managers), investors, debtors and creditors. Further, Oman's Capital Market Authority and Muscat Securities Market need to strengthen the regulations related to intellectual capital. Originality/value: This study extends intellectual capital and corporate governance literature by presenting the research outcome for Oman's financial sector. It is useful for Oman's financial sector companies to direct corporate governance measures for driving value creation of firms through the management of intellectual capital efficiency.

Research Question/Issue: We review the literature on the relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the theoretical lenses that researchers apply when studying strategic leadership and innovation, most notably agency theory and upper echelons theory. We review the innovation constructs and measures that scholars employ, and we survey the links among strategic leaders' characteristics and technological innovation. Ultimately, we organize the literature into an integrative framework that provides a concise overview of the extant knowledge, and we outline an agenda for future research. Theoretical/Academic Implications: First, we offer scholars a discipline-spanning overview of the extant knowledge on the topic. Second, by integrating important aspects of corporate governance, such as the role of the board of directors, incentives for the chief executive officer or the top management team, and firm ownership, into the context of technological innovation, we highlight the vital role it plays in the realm of technological innovation. Third, we provide a useful guide for scholars and direct their work towards fruitful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer insights for practitioners interested in better understanding the bidirectional relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. In particular, our framework and our detailed analysis of the impact of strategic leaders on technological innovation can guide shareholders and board members in matters related to board composition as well as top executive selection and compensation.

This article re-examines the shareholder value revolution of the 1980s to challenge the dominant conception of the financialization of the firm. This transformation is widely interpreted as a re-alignment of corporate management in response to growing shareholder power and neoliberal managerial norms associated notably with agency theory. By contrast, we demonstrate how the financialization of the firm has its roots in the innovations made in 1960s America by a small group of outsider firms, the conglomerates, that challenged the corporate establishment. As we show, these firms pioneered financial techniques that profoundly transformed the nature of corporate strategy and launched a process of financialization as firms began to exploit the leverage financial markets could provide in various corporate contests. Taking stock of this historical lineage leads us to re-interpret the shareholder revolution of the 1980s. We demonstrate how the key features of this era: the orientation of firms towards capital market, the increase in shareholder activism, and the rise of agency theory, should be read as unintended outcomes of the success of financialized management and its destabilizing effects on corporate governance.

In this paper, we argue that corruption is likely to increase agency costs of equity, hence shareholders have higher incentives to control managers. When corruption is higher, firm managers need to use firm resources to make unofficial payments and they tend to take this opportunity to expropriate shareholders. Consequently, shareholders recognizing this risk need to force managers to pay more dividends in order to mitigate the agency problem. This paper examines the effects of corruption on dividend decisions in the light of agency theory. With a sample of 205,316 observations from 47 countries, we find that corruption is positively related to both the decision to pay dividends and payout ratio. Moreover, this relationship is stronger under strong creditor protection. (c) 2019 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationship between remuneration packages [chief executive officer (CEO) and director] and independent corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices (marketplace, environment, community, workplace and money spent on CSR) of 588 Malaysian listed firms during 2006-2017. Further, the study explored the moderating effect of board gender diversity on the remuneration-CSR nexus. Design/methodology/approach: The dynamic estimator; namely, the system generalized method of moments given by Arellano and Bover (1995) has been used on the data set to control dynamic endogeneity, unobserved heterogeneity and simultaneity problems. Findings: Findings indicate a weak relationship between remuneration and CSR where prior CEO remuneration negatively influences marketplace activities, environment-related activities and workplace practices. However, directors' remuneration leaves no effect on socially responsible activities. Moreover, board gender diversity negatively moderates the CEO remuneration-CSR relationship and an insignificant moderating effect has been observed for directors' remuneration-CSR nexus. Practical implications: This study is particularly significant for regulatory bodies of Malaysia e.g. Securities Commission Malaysia, Bursa Malaysia, policymakers, investors and managers. For academia, this study fetches support from agency theory and overinvestment hypothesis to explain the relationships. Originality/value: This paper is novel in providing empirical evidence on the moderating effect of board gender diversity on the relationship between remuneration and independent CSR activities for the first time. Moreover, this study has sourced several theoretical and practical implications. Then, the study uses a dynamic estimator that caters to the problems of endogeneity, simultaneity and heterogeneity.

This study examines the relationship between corporate non-financial disclosure ratings, the Italian Legislative Decrees 231/2001 and 254/2016, and three outcomes of Italian listed firms: performance, risk and agency cost. Based on stakeholder-agency theory, this study conceptualizes the role of firms' non-financial disclosures in reducing asymmetric information and agency costs between managers and broad stakeholders. Utilizing the Standard Ethics Rating (SER) as a measure of firms' non-financial disclosure rating, this study finds that SER ratings are positively related to firm value and are negatively related to firms' risk and agency costs. This study also provides evidence that the adoption of Italian Legislative Decrees 231/2001 and 254/2016, along with external verifications from the SER of firms' non-financial disclosure, has a positive impact on firm outcomes. Corporate managers and investors should recognize the value added from regulations that foster non-financial disclosures and ratings issued by an independent rating agency (e.g., Standard Ethics) as they both enhance firm performance and reduce risk and agency costs.

Whereas the corporate life cycle hypothesis says firms follow structured goals along their life cycle, others argue that corporate governance objectives vary independently of predetermined life cycle stages. This study examines the impact of the corporate life cycle on corporate governance in emerging markets, where firms can self-select into stricter rules by adopting an exchange listing level that fits the governance needs of the organization independently of life cycle requirements. We find the listing-level decision is a better predictor of corporate governance quality than corporate life cycle. Firms signal improvements in corporate governance by bonding to more stringent regulation; they determine the corporate governance quality that matches their needs at any point during their life-cycle.

Purpose: This study aims to draw on the resource dependence theory to synthesize the conflicting arguments as well as commonalities of the agency and stewardship perspectives on the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 212 large-scale publicly listed companies representing 20 sectors in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings: The research results based on all of 212 publicly listed companies in Sri Lanka show, in support of the agency theory, that CEO duality exerts a negative effect on firm performance when the CEO is equipped with additional informal power. Conversely, CEO duality exhibits a positive effect on firm performance when board involvements are high, a finding that supports the commonalities of the agency and stewardship theoretical perspectives. Practical implications: By examining the governance practices and concepts in an Asian developing economy, this study provides insight into the power dynamics between the CEO and the board of directors in managerial contexts that are largely different from those in western countries. Originality/value: This study expands the theoretical underpinning of corporate governance research by identifying the performance implications of CEO duality within the broad context of the resource provision of the board of directors and the informal power of CEOs.

This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the relationship between corporate governance mechanism and firm performance among Shariah-compliant firms using an integrated theoretical framework. This study is carried out on the top 200 Shariah-compliant firms listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2017. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the researchers employ generalized least squares and random effect with robust and clustering standard error models to estimate the impact of ownership structure, board independence, board competence, firms' characteristics, and debt structure on firm performance as measured by the firm's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The findings show that ownership concentration has a statistically positive effect on firm performance. Having an external Chair and independent board members with an educational level beyond a bachelor's degree also have a positive effect on firm performance while CEO duality has a statistically negative impact instead. Insider representation has a positive impact on firm performance but when these inside board members are also the owners, the impact turns negative. Furthermore, the statistical significance of holding a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and other type of qualifications imply the need for board members to have greater knowledge in order to positively influence ROA and ROE. This is the first study to examine the influence of corporate governance mechanism on firm performance using a multi-theoretical approach in the context of Shariah-compliant firms. The interaction terms of elements in agency theory, stakeholder/resource-based theory, and stewardship theory are used as pre-conditions to the direct effect of these regressors on firm performance.

This article reviews and integrates the empirical literature on the measurement of investment efficiency in the areas of accounting and finance. We identify the theories behind the measures and provide a framework which organises the measures of investment efficiency into three groups: those based on neoclassical theories, agency theory and real options theory. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of each type of measure are discussed, allowing researchers to compare and then ascertain the most appropriate measure for their research purpose and research context.

Firms have increasingly adopted environmental governance mechanisms in the form of environmental compensation and environmental board committees. The current study examines the argument that such environmental governance mechanisms contribute to lower toxic emissions in high-polluting industries. The sample comprises firms that were part of the S&P 500 from the years 2006 to 2011 and were mandated to report toxic emissions to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Release Inventory program. A panel regression model with propensity score matching was employed to minimize endogeneity bias. The results indicate that environmental compensation is a compelling incentive to motivate managers to invest in long-term and highly uncertain environmental projects. Likewise, the presence of an environmental board committee appears to be significant, suggesting that directors contribute to a firm's strategy with their expertise and political influence. This research also found evidence supporting the cumulative adoption of both environmental governance mechanisms in enhancing environmental performance and the firm's legitimacy.

The effectiveness of the well-known corporate governance practices may not be universal due to fundamental differences in the environments under which firms operate. By using hand-collected data from all the non-financial firms listed on the unexplored East African frontier markets (i.e., Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda), we examine the effect of board characteristics on the performance of firms. Our results show that board size has a negative and significant effect on firm performance. The presences of foreigners and civil servants on the board play positive roles on financial performance, where the agency and resource dependence theories apply. Further, we find that board members with higher education also contribute to firm performance. These findings still hold when we consider the 2008-2009 financial crisis period. Overall, we show that in a business climate where ownership is largely dominated by few shareholders, the conventional governance mechanisms do not work effectively. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the impact of chief executive officer (CEO) duality (a chief executive operating chair of board and leader of a firm) of newly privatized Vietnamese firms on the level of corporate entrepreneurship; this understanding is used to throw light on the extent to which a position of strategic agility is achieved. Specifically, does CEO duality enable firms to keep consistent with their vision, while remaining flexible in their business model? Data from a survey of 114 CEOs of board and top management team members in privatized firms in Vietnam were collected and examined through a combination of agency theory and stewardship theory. The research finds that CEO duality does not necessarily lead to a higher degree of entrepreneurial activity in privatized Vietnamese firms. The results have policy implications for shaping corporate governance and management implications for firms striving to be competitive, in ways that advance corporate entrepreneurship in economies such as Vietnam that are both emerging and pursuing privatization.

This study investigates the direct and indirect effects, mediated by audit committee quality, of managerial ownership, institutional ownership, and profitability on intellectual capital (IC) disclosure. The object observed of this study is companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in the 2014-2018 period that are classified as high intellectual capital-intensive industries. Based on the sampling method, purposive sampling, 51 companies were selected as samples. This study used path analysis techniques with IBM SPSS version 25 to study the direct and indirect influences of managerial ownership, institutional ownership, and profitability toward IC disclosure. The results of this study show that managerial ownership, profitability and audit committee quality have a significant positive effect on IC disclosure whereas institutional ownership has significant negative effect on IC disclosure. This study also provides empirical evidence, supported by the sobel test, that the audit committee quality is able to mediate the effect of institutional ownership and profitability on IC disclosure. However, the audit committee quality is not able to mediate the effect of managerial ownership on IC disclosure. These findings develop and strengthen the results of prior studies related to the implementation of signaling theory and agency theory in devoting more understanding about IC disclosure.

Innovation contributes to a firm's long-term competitive advantages but also involves significant risk and uncertainty. As agency theory predicts, CEOs are self-interested and risk-averse, and thus are reluctant to engage in innovation investments. However, the extent to which CEOs are self-interested and the mechanisms through which self-interested CEOs affect firm innovation have not been empirically tested. To fill this gap, we propose that CEOs possess a mix of both self-preserving and other-regarding motives, and build a mediation model in which CEO values affect firm innovation via firms' long-term orientation. Based on a three-phase (from 2014 to 2016) survey of 436 Chinese manufacturing firms, we find that CEOs with high self-regarding values reduce innovation efforts and performance by damaging a firm's long-term orientation. Moreover, CEO tenure, CEO duality, and environmental uncertainty weaken the relationship between CEO values and firm innovation via long-term orientation. Our study enriches the innovation literature by extending the basic assumptions of agency theory and by providing empirical evidence to determine whether and how self-regarded CEOs affect firm innovation.

We investigate the role of accounting quality as an antecedent of dividend payout decision of firms, for both dividend levels and dividend event, in an emerging market context. Using the data for Indian firms through the years 2006-2016, we evaluate the impact of discretionary accruals on payout decision employing Tobit and Logit regression models amid set of idiosyncratic controls. We report that better earnings quality, on average, is associated with large dividend payments for Indian firms. Moreover, the likelihood of dividend payment reduces with poor earnings quality and more so when earnings manipulation is done to increase earnings. Nonetheless, we show that higher earnings quality reduces dividends during the crisis period and also for group-affiliated firms. However, the same doesn't hold true for dividend likelihood. The relationship is robust to the idiosyncratic controls and the causality test confirms that results are not susceptible to endogeneity issue. Overall, we conclude that better earnings quality takes care of free cash flow problems and alleviates the agency and information asymmetry related costs, thereby stimulating payout policy.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of corporate governance index on the cost of equity in companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange. This study collects data from 975 observations during the period 2012 to 2018 to test the hypotheses using multiple linear regression model for the panel data. In this research, the independent variable of corporate governance index comprises of 27 specific corporate governance attributes. The results of hypothesis testing showed that corporate governance has a negative and significant effect on the rate of capital cost. In other words, the quality of corporate governance can lower the rate of capital cost. This result suggests that, by using a powerful corporate governance system and by declining the information asymmetry (increasing transparency) and agency conflict, we would be able to enhance the quality of financial reports. It would strengthen the capital market, attract financial suppliers and investors, and absorb the required financial resources of the firm by a lower rate. The findings of the study suggest that companies are able to reduce the cost of equity by establishing strong corporate governance. This conclusion suggests the importance and effectiveness of corporate governance in the cost of equity. (c) The Author(s).

We examine the relationship between corporate cash holdings and promoter ownership for a sample of Indian non-financial firms. Consistent with the arguments of the 'efficient monitoring hypothesis', our results broadly suggest that promoter ownership is negatively associated with cash holdings, thereby highlighting the role of large owners in preventing cash accretion in an emerging market context. Indicating prominent influence of corporate ownership on cash management, we find that corporate non-promoter ownership is also negatively related with cash holdings. With regard to promoter ownership of foreign entities, our results suggest that cash holdings share a U-shaped relationship with ownership of foreign promoter corporations. In addition, our findings provide weak evidence to support a more pronounced negative association between cash holdings and promoter ownership for group-affiliated firms as compared to non-affiliated firms since the former faces lower financial constraints on account of access to internal capital markets. Finally, we perform long-term effect analysis in order to reinforce robustness of our results. (c) 2020

In recognition of the significance of external business environments for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), this study examines the relationship between macroenvironments and financing decisions of SMEs in the restaurant industry. With a focus on formal and informal credits, the study is grounded in agency theory, which explains how information asymmetry between SMEs and lenders might influence SMEs' financing decisions. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to analyze the data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and the World Bank. The results indicated that the financial infrastructure and tax regulation can significantly increase the odds of choosing formal credits and decrease the odds of choosing informal credits. This study contributes to the literature by assessing the role of information asymmetry and agency theory on restaurant SMEs' financing decisions. The study also has implications for industry practitioners and policymakers for the financial sustainability and success of SMEs.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effects of board characteristics, audit committee and risk management on corporate performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 31 Palestinian non-financial listed companies from 2010 to 2016, this study uses a generalized least square method. Findings: The results show that the effects of board ownership, board independence, audit committee meeting, audit committee size, audit committee financial expertise and risk management are positive and significant on corporate performance while the effects of chief executive officer duality and audit committee size are negative and significant on corporate performance. Practical implications: The results of this paper are important to policymakers, shareholders and directors of companies to make appropriate choices about the board, audit committee characteristics and risk management to protect the interest of different stakeholders, increase the flow of capital and foreign investment into non-financial companies. Social implications: This paper fills a gap in the corporate governance literature by investigating the effects of board characteristics, audit committee and risk management on corporate performance in Palestine as one of the youngest stock exchanges in a region that assists in testing the validity of agency theory in a young and small emerging market context. Originality/value: This paper is the first to investigate the effects of board characteristics, audit committee and risk management collectively on corporate performance in Palestine as prior research on these topics has been investigated separately.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption and corporate governance attributes increase the management earnings forecasts' accuracy disclosed in prospectuses for French Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on cross-sectional regression explaining the absolute forecast errors by using 45 French firms that made IPOs between 2005 and 2016 in two French financial markets: Euronext and Alternext. Findings: In agreement with the agency theory and the signaling theory, the authors find that the IFRS adoption and the effective corporate governance, proxied by the board characteristics, increase the accuracy of management forecasts. As a result, this latter gives a credible signal in constructing and sustaining shareholders' trust on the transparency and the reliability of such financial information. Research limitations/implications: It is plausible that the limited size of the sample represents a limitation of this study. Another limitation is that no other corporate governance attributes such as board meeting frequency, audit committee measures and ownership structure are used. Practical implications: Shareholders can take benefit from management forecasts accuracy to structure their investment portfolios efficiently to allocate their funds more effectively and mitigate the costs of adverse selection that they have to face. Furthermore, the authors expect the findings to be interesting to IPO firms, as this study highlights the efficiency of larger and independent boards in decreasing managerial discretion, increasing disclosure quality and supervising management. The results could encourage GAAP-adopters countries to move toward IFRS, as this research reinforces the role of IFRS in enhancing the quality of financial disclosure by offering the required information for shareholders. Originality/value: This study is important because the potential investors should assess management earnings forecasts accuracy before they consider it when evaluating IPO firms. Also, this paper has some implications for the financial market. It is recommended that future investors pay more attention, when assessing the accuracy of management earnings forecasts, to the accounting regulations of the financial reporting along with the corporate governance mechanisms. Moreover, this study could incite French regulators to revise the AFEP-MEDEF code. Under this code, it could insist that larger and independent boards are more effective in performing their governing roles than smaller boards. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Stakeholders expect focal firms to improve their environmental performance. While firms may be able to accumulate the environmental expertise needed to achieve this goal internally, doing so may require significant time and resource commitments. Alternatively, buyer firms can leverage their suppliers' existing environmental expertise and gain access to such expertise when they purchase products and services from these suppliers. The purpose of this study was to develop and test theory regarding under what conditions suppliers' environmental expertise influences a buying firms' procurement spend with these suppliers. We ground our study in transaction cost economics and agency theories and empirically test our hypotheses using a unique buyer-supplier dyadic data set. We find that buyer firms are willing to increase their overall business spend with suppliers that have strong environmental expertise, particularly when the buyer firms are more profitable and have higher levels of absorptive capacity. However, we find the opposite effect when the buyer firm's executive compensation is linked to the firm's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Likewise, we also find that the buyer firm's environmental concern ratings negatively moderate the relationship between the supplier's environmental expertise and the buyer's procurement spend with the supplier.

The study addresses the signs of earnings management in unlisted companies, comparing the situation in family firms and non-family firms. We adopt arguments from agency theory, and stewardship theory, which are supplemented with the assumptions of socio-emotional wealth literature, to justify our research model. The sample is composed of 263 audited Spanish companies with a turnover of more than 200 million euros, which were analysed in the period from 2011 to 2015. Results indicate that family firms are less prone to the practices of earnings management than non-family firms, and that the association between family firm status and earnings management is moderated by the firm generation.

This study seeks to determine the effect of the application of accounting information system (AIS), internal control system, and human resource (HR) competency on the quality of local government financial statements (FS). This study uses agency theory and compliance theory. Agency theory is used to explain that there is a link between the society as the principal and the government as the agent. Compliance theory is a theory, which states that every agency is obliged to comply with regulations because the law-drafting authority has the right to dictate behavior. The population in this study were employees of the financial division of local government organizations in one of the districts in Central Java, Indonesia. The total samples in this study was 106 respondents. The data used are primary data taken from distributing questionnaires to respondents. The method of analysis used to test the hypothesis was multiple linear regression analysis. The results of hypothesis testing indicate that HR competency has an effect on the quality of FS; however, the application of AIS and internal control system has no effect on the quality of FS. The implication of this research underlines the importance of HR competency to improve the quality of local government FS. (c) 2020. All Rights Reserved.

We examine the impact of CEO duality on firm performance using the life-cycle theory approach. The data is balanced and covers over the period 2012-2018 for 442 publicly listed firms in Vietnam. The findings from system generalized method of moments (GMM) method indicate that CEO duality had a positive effect on firm performance in growth stage and had a negative effect on the mature stage of the firm's life-cycle. These results are supported by stewardship theory which argues that CEO duality may be good for firm performance in the growth stage due to the unity of presented command. In contrast, agency theory shows CEO duality is bad for firm performance in the maturing stage since it compromises the monitoring and controls the behavior of the CEO. Also, this study shows that there was a difference between state shareholders and director from outside of the company affecting the firm performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of royal family members on firm performance of publicly listed companies in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: Using 491 firm-year observations of non-financial publicly listed firms in Saudi Arabia's stock market between 2009 and 2013, the study employs, besides others, the advanced econometric technique GMM-system estimator. This allows the dynamic nature and control of the endogeneity problem to be accounted for in corporate governance and firm performance. Findings: The main result is that the attendance of royal family members at board meetings negatively influences firm performance but does not have an influence on firm value. The results also show that firms with many independent royal family members on the board of directors have better firm performance and firm value. In addition, firms with a high number of royal family members presenting on the board have better firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study offers guidance to assist the further investigation of the SA Royal Family's BoD membership either in SA or in other monarchy countries. It is interesting to compare these results in order to further understand the different effects that the Royal Family's BoD membership have in such countries. This study's results suggest that independent members of SA's Royal Family on the BoD have some influence on firm performance in both the short and long term. Thus, policymakers should encourage the members of SA's Royal Family to become more involved in firms' BoDs. Practical implications: This study offers guidance for further investigation of royal family members in the region or in other monarchy countries. It will be interesting to compare these results. The study suggests that royal family members on the board have a partial influence on firm performance, especially the independent ones. Thus, the policymakers should encourage more involvement of independent royal family members on the board. Social implications: Foreign and minority investors, who invest in SA's publicly listed firms, should note that when independent members of SA's Royal Family are on the BoD their investment will benefit from the reduced risks and uncertainty. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study undertaken to investigate empirically the influence a royal family's presence on the board of directors has on firm performance.

Corporate political activity (CPA) is an important area of research due to the high level of CPA in which many firms engage. Prior research has focused on the demand side of the political market. In this paper, we consider how choices made by CEOs regarding their interaction with the supply side of the political market can have performance implications for the firm. In particular, we argue that where CPA focuses less on supporting extreme ideologies, these investments in CPA will be positively associated with higher performance, and thus are more effective. Next, relying on agency theory, we argue that firms in which top managers are less likely to behave opportunistically will engage in such effective CPA. We test our theory on a panel of archival data generated by combining business data with political records, and we find strong support for our arguments. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study is to explore the quality of financial information of Spanish firms, by comparing family firms with non-family firms, and relating this quality with corporate governance practices. For this purpose, a sample of 650 Spanish firms was analysed during the period 2011-2016. Based on agency theory and socioemotional wealth literature, the results show a higher quality of financial information in family firms, a relationship which is reinforced by corporate governance factors. Our results are consistent with the scant previous research, and with the premises of agency theory, which indicate lower asymmetry of information between owners and managers in the singular context of family firms. Additionally, our work provides evidence that the participation of women on the board boosts the quality of financial information in family firms, contributing to the justification of family firm heterogeneity in terms of earnings management. This study contributes to reducing the gap in the literature on the influence of the family business context and the influence of women on the board on the quality of financial reporting.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore to what extent risk disclosure is associated with banks' governance characteristics. The research also focuses on how the business environment and culture may create a bank's awareness of risk management and its disclosure. This study is conducted in a setting where banks are not mandated to follow international standards for their risk disclosures. Design/methodology/approach: Using 300 bank-year observations comprising hand-collected private commercial bank data, the study uses regression analysis to investigate the influence of risk governance characteristics on risk disclosure. Findings: This paper reports a positive relationship between risk disclosure and banks' governance characteristics, such as the presence of various risk committees and a risk management unit. Practical implications: Because studies are lacking on risk disclosure and risk governance conducted in developing countries, it is expected that this research will make a significant contribution to the literature and provide a foundation for further research in this field. Social implications: This study complements the corporate governance literature, more specifically the risk governance literature, by incorporating agency theory, institutional theory and proprietary cost theory to provide robust evidence of the impact of risk governance practices in the context of a developing economy. Originality/value: Previous studies on risk disclosure and governance determinants primarily involve developed countries. This paper's contribution is to examine risk disclosure and risk governance characteristics in a developing country in which reporting according to international standards is effectively voluntary.

This study aims to investigate the relationship of board quality, audit quality and audit report lag on firm performance of manufactured Saudi's listed companies. The framework of the study is developed based on the predictions of agency theory and resource dependence theory that board quality, audit quality and audit report lag are associated with the firm performance. This study used 180 observations for the periods ranging from 2015 to 2017. The board quality is measured by two independent variables; board size and board meetings, audit quality is measured by the auditor brand name, the audit report lag is measured by the year-end to the date of the auditor's report, and firm performance is measured by the ROA and ROE. Using the pooled OLS Regression, the results show that out of four hypothesized independent variables, only audit quality has a significant and positive association with firm performance and audit report lag has a negative and significant association with firm performance. Importantly, the study suggests that regulators, especially Saudi stock exchange, should mandate companies to disclose all relevant information related to board and audit in a transparent and timely manner, and increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance practices. For companies, this study proposes that they should emphasize more on enhancing the role and the quality of their board of directors and the audit quality issues, as this enhancement may positively influence their performance.

We examine how Japanese corporate governance characteristics affect IPO underpricing. The results show that parent ownership does not affect underpricing in IPO firms. We also find that greater CEO ownership is expected to cause principal-principal conflicts and to exacerbate underpricing in IPO firms. Our empirical results also reveal that bank ties mitigate underpricing and function as effective monitoring mechanisms. Furthermore, the positive correlation between CEO ownership and IPO firm underpricing is moderated by the parent-subsidiary relationship. Finally, independent venture capital firms do not mitigate underpricing of IPO firms with parent-subsidiary relationships. (c) 2019, Springer Nature Limited.

Michael Jensen made a name for himself in the 1970s-1990 s with his 'agency theory' and its application to questions of corporate governance and economic policy. The effects of his theory were acutely felt in the pedagogics of business studies, as Jensen lent his authority to combat all attempts to integrate social considerations and moral values into business education. Lately, however, Michael Jensen has come to defend quite a different approach, promoting an 'integrity theory' of management learning. Jensen now rather aspires to empower students to give authentic expression to their personal values in their professional lives, and he sees the main function of management studies in assisting them in this effort. This article reconstructs the transformation of Jensen's outlook, drawing on Jensen's theories as an exemplar of wider trends in the current literature on management learning, away from a decidedly 'mechanistic' and towards a more 'humanistic' pedagogy of management. Jensen's case serves to highlight developments that might make for better preconditions for the appreciation of business ethics on part of business students. On closer inspection, though, it appears that his remaining within a positivistic framework ultimately impedes the kind of progress Michael Jensen envisions for business studies.

Global apparel brands that source production from less developed countries are increasingly exposed to risks that arise from human rights violations. Despite widely publicized factory safety failures, reactionary regulatory efforts remain inadequate. This situation is commonly attributed to unyielding downward price pressure imposed on factories by Western brands. To address this problem, this research develops a comprehensive cost model for low-cost apparel production following a total cost of ownership approach. Comprehensive production data for cotton T-shirts from nine Bangladeshi factories provide the basis for model construction. The model reveals that materials generate the bulk of production costs (77%) for a T-shirt, in contrast to worker wages which generate only 2 percent of the total production cost per unit (e.g., 16 cents out of a $8USD retail price). The TCO provides fundamental insights, grounded in real data, to guide policy and regulation among stakeholders in high-risk, low-cost supply chains. Based on the research context, results are considered through the lens of agency theory to provide managerial implications for relevant stakeholders. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Corporate environmental performance has become a key focus of business leaders, policy makers, and scholars alike. Today, scholarship on environmental practice increasingly highlights how various aspects of corporate governance can influence environmental performance. However, the prior literature is inconclusive as to whether ownership by insiders (officers and directors) will have positive or negative environmental effects and whether insider voting control or equity control is more salient to environmental outcomes. This article leverages a unique empirical data set of dual-class firms, where insiders have voting rights disproportionate to their equity rights, to shed light on this question. We find that, on average, dual-class firms underperform their single-class peers on environmental measures and that the discrepancy comes from dual-class firms where insiders have more voting control, relative to their equity stake. While small increases in voting control are associated with improved environmental performance, too much (relative to insiders' equity stake) worsens firms' environmental performance. Insider equity control alone has no impact on environmental outcomes. Our findings have important implications for agency theory and environmental scholarship by identifying contingencies on the impact of voting and equity-based incentives. This research casts doubt on the idea that providing insiders with significant voting control will aid environmental performance. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Corporate voluntary disclosure becomes a burning issue in the literature of accounting throughout the last two decades. The study aims to explore the most crucial determinants that influence corporate voluntary disclosure in a transition economy. A cross-sectional study based on the pharmaceutical and chemical companies listed in the Dhaka Stock Exchange is conducted to reconnoiter the crucial determinants affecting the voluntary disclosure. Based on the agency theory, stakeholder theory, and previous literature, the determinants are selected. An unweighted disclosure index is used to measure the extent of voluntary disclosure; after that, a multivariate analysis is steered to reconnoiter the key determinants of voluntary disclosure. It is found that firm leverage and firm liquidity are the key determinants that significantly influence the corporate voluntary disclosure in a transition economy. In contrast, no significant positive association is found between voluntary disclosure and board size. In additon, it is also found that market category significantly influences voluntary disclosure with an inverse direction. This study has important implications for both the corporate people and the regulatory bodies of the transition economy. The study also helps various stakeholders of the transition economy - Bangladesh, in designing their strategies regarding the most significant determinants of voluntary disclosure.

Based on the theoretical underpinnings of the agency theory and liquidity theory, the purpose of this study is to show how managers who want to enhance the performance of Pakistan's non-financial sector can use liquidity policy in relation to corporate governance. Nowadays, Pakistan is facing a severe liquidity crisis; this study contributes by examining the mediating role of liquidity on the link of corporate governance-performance. We use data from 63 firms from 2010 to 2018, excluding 17 outliers. To analyze the data, we use the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SURE) model and nlcom-Stata test. Our findings support the mediating role of liquidity on the link between corporate governance and performance. In addition, the results show that corporate governance improves performance. Furthermore, the study supports a significant positive association of liquidity and performance. For robustness, we use two performance variables-return on assets (ROA) and Tobin's q (TQ)-where ROA represents full mediation and TQ indicates partial mediation. This study helps to use liquidity policy to strengthen the inside and outside dimensions of corporate governance mechanisms that improve the performance of firms. Overall, these findings suggest better disclosure, transparency, and solutions to auditing issues that add value to the firms. (c) The Author(s).

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of Chinese listed family firms on lean innovation strategies. Additionally, the authors also examined the moderating role of CEO compensation on the family ownership and lean innovation strategies relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Data is obtained from CSMAR database about Chinese family firms listed at Shenzhen Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange. Panel data comprising of firm year observations from 2007 to 2016 is analyzed using STATA. Findings: Family firms are proactive towards research and development investment (innovation input) as well as towards patent applications (innovation output). Moreover, family firms show propensity towards patent applications and towards converting their R&D investment into granted patent applications. CEO compensation negatively moderates the nexus between family firms and lean innovation which seriously needs to be addressed to reduce agency costs. Research limitations/implications: The study has focused on Chinese market only. The study is useful for policy makers to address the serious concerns identified in the conclusion section, i.e. effectiveness of CEO compensation in addressing the lean innovation strategies in emerging economy like that of China. Originality/value: Given the usually considered conservative approach of family firms towards innovation, this is the first study which has tested the moderating role of CEO compensation on family firms and lean innovation relationship in an emerging economy. This study is unique because it provides a detailed analysis of lean innovation process by splitting the process into different stages. The negative moderating impact of CEO compensation raises new concerns to resolve agency conflicts. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines whether auditor-client economic bonding and corporate governance moderate the adverse effects of principal-principal agency problems on earnings quality in U.K.-listed family firms. We find that although earnings management is lower in family firms, there is a higher tendency of earnings management for those firms with economic bonding. However, such an impact may be moderated by good governance mechanisms where the latter may alleviate the adverse effects of the lack of auditor independence on the association between earnings management and family firms.

This meta-analysis takes stock of 121 C.E.O. pay studies published between 1998 and 2018 with the objective of identifying the main drivers of C.E.O. pay from a global perspective and contributing to the agency vs managerial debate on this ground. The meta-results disclose a positive C.E.O. pay-performance correlation (the highest correlation coefficient corresponds to Earnings per share with a 34%) as the agency theory prescribes and the governance policies promote. However, firm size still predominates as the main driver of C.E.O. pay (correlation coefficient is around 44%) according to managerial premises. Moreover, our results reconcile both approaches because results of the meta-regressions suggest that larger companies and more independent boards strengthen the pay-performance association. Additional analyses of moderating factors on C.E.O. pay forces do not provide robust conclusions, though, they suggest: (1) weak impact, if any, of both the Cadbury Report and the S.O.X.; and (2) lack of homogeneity in the banking industry despite its specific regulation.

Research Question/Issues: Most extant literature implicitly equates obtaining information through board interlocks to acting on the information. We investigate triggers that help to translate the information into action. In addition to exposure to the information by board interlocks, we suggest that the self-interest of the individuals who create these ties and hierarchical power of interlinked firms determines the likelihood of taking actions of adopting new practices. Research Findings/Insights: Using the action of adopting two distinctive governance practices, stock option pays or board reform, we find that sent ties and received ties affect the adoption decisions differently. Whereas sent ties reflect managerial interests, received ties derive power from a hierarchical relationship between the focal firm and the interlinked firm. Such differential nature of sent and received ties drives a differential result in terms of adopting two distinctive governance practices. We also find support for different moderating effects of firm performance on the impact of sent and received ties. Theoretical/Academic Implications: In this study, we incorporated the self-interest of executives with sent ties to prior adopters and the power of directors who establish ties with prior adopters that are hierarchically positioned. By doing so, this study paints a more fine-grained picture regarding underlying mechanisms by which information gained through ties is translated into action. This provides important insights for both agency theory and resource-dependency theory. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Hierarchical board ties are not a unique phenomenon in Japan. We often find such ties in business groups in China, India, Korea, and some European countries. Establishing board interlocks among subsidiaries in a business group is an important governance resolution for controlling the whole business group. Hence, our findings that the ties carry not only information but also agent's interest and hierarchical power should be taken into account when a business group designs board interlocks.

It is now 50 years since Milton Friedman set out his doctrine that "The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits."This paper seeks to add fresh and compelling new evidence of why Lynn Stout was correct in her resolute critique of the thesis of shareholder primacy at the heart of the Friedman doctrine, and how this doctrine remains profoundly damaging to the corporations that continue to uphold this belief. It is argued that the Friedman doctrine has had a catastrophic impact upon American business and society beginning with General Motors failure to respond to investor calls for increased concern for safety and pollution at the time of Friedman's intervention in 1970, stretching all the way to the recent fatal errors of Boeing in placing a higher priority in getting the new Boeing 737 MAX into the market than ensuring the soundness of software controls on the flight deck which led to two horrific plane crashes in 2018 and 2019 with the loss of 346 lives. These tragic errors in corporate judgement are ultimately related to the constricted sense of corporate purpose imposed by Milton Friedman and taken up with enthusiasm by agency theorists focused upon maximising shareholder value. This reckless single-mindedness has privileged the pursuit of the narrowest of financial measures of performance above fundamentals including passenger safety and environmental emissions controls. As a result, innocent lives have been lost, brands have been tarnished, and ultimately the strategic future of significant corporations endangered, and the ecology of the planet imperilled. There is now emerging a new sense of the purpose of the corporation that defines a rationale for corporate social and environmental responsibility in a way similar to Lynn Stout's more inclusive stakeholder approach. The question remains open whether this will lead to the development of fiduciary duties, governance, strategies, targets, measures, transparency and disclosure that might deliver the sustainable corporation.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose an enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation model based on the agency theory and the Delone and McLean information systems (IS) success model. This paper answers two major research questions: (i) how does client-consultant interaction affect the outcome of ERP implementation projects; and (ii) how can this interaction be managed effectively to ensure successful project outcomes? Design/methodology/approach: An electronic banking institution in Africa was used to conduct a case study research and examine the validity of the proposed conceptual framework. Findings: Based on the constructs of the conceptual framework, the study found that client-consultant relationships/interactions mediate the effect of human, organizational, and technological critical success factors (CSFs) on information quality, service quality, and information quality. Agency conflicts in client-consultant relationships can be managed using outcome incentive-based contracts and a conflict management committee. Research limitations/implications: This is a single case study research. Thus, despite its analytical validity and generalizability, there is a need for more studies on the statistical validity of the model in other contexts. Practical implications: This paper provides practical information needed to manage conflicts between clients and consultants, as well as factors that must be considered in order to keep the interest of both parties aligned. Originality/value: No research has been conducted on how to manage client-consultant interactions and related conflicts in ERP implementation projects. This study fills this gap using a well-established theoretical foundation to propose a conceptual framework that would guide and drive further discussions on the topic. This is also one of the few studies in the context of developing countries. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We investigate the association between controlling shareholders' ownership (CS_Own) and firms' leverage decisions in the Singaporean context. We examine whether the impact of ownership concentration on leverage differs across excess and lower control. We report that shareholders with excess control prefer leverage financing for an optimal capital structure and focus on value maximisation rather using leverage as a tool of minority shareholders' expropriation. Our analysis shows that firms capital structure significantly influences by the coalition of shareholders particularly decisions about leverage financing in addition to the firms' specific characteristics and institutional arrangements. Our empirical evidence shows that controlling shareholders with a lower fraction of equity are more concerned about limited holding thus prefer leverage over equity financing to inflate their equity stake to protect them from the potential takeovers and mergers. We report that capital structure decisions in Singapore are linked with the trade-off between the controlling shareholders' target of mitigating firm risk and their non-dilution entrenchment needs. Further, we found an inverted U-shaped association between control ownership and leverage financing. In terms of moderating effect of family-controlled ownership, our findings exhibit that leverage financing is less pronounced for family firms in Singapore due to the under-diversified investment portfolio.

Using a sample of 15,818 firm year observations over the 1996-2015 period, we provide the first evidence on the impact of CEOs cultural background on dividend policy. We find that individualistic CEOs are more likely to pay dividends. Consistent with the private benefits of control and signaling hypotheses, we find that this result is more pronounced in firms with severe agency problems and information asymmetry. This study points to a promising direction for future research to gain a deeper understanding of how the cultural background of managers affect corporate policies and behavior. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: Drawing upon agency theory, this study aims to assess the value relevance (VR) of accounting information released by non-financial firms listed on the Kuwait stock exchange for the period of 2015-2018. Also, the influence of institutional ownership level and other explanatory variables, namely, book value per share, earnings per share, growth in assets and changes in financial leverage on share prices is examined. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, the Ohlson (1995) model is extended. This study uses panel data analysis and applies appropriate statistical techniques to measure empirical relationships. Findings: The results show that the VR of accounting information released by the Kuwaiti non-financial listed firms varies over the period of 2015-2018. Book value and earnings have significant and positive effects on share prices. In recent years, the VR of book value information has been growing, while that of earnings information has been declining. Institutional ownership level has a significant and positive influence on the VR of accounting information released by the Kuwaiti non-financial listed firms. The findings confirm a positive power, signalling growth in assets regarding the share prices. However, no significant relationship between changes in financial leverage and share prices is found. Practical implications: The findings of the study provide evidence of the linkage between VR and institutional ownership level, which promotes the understanding of the influence of institutional investors on a firm's market value. Empirical evidence from Kuwait will have international implications and can serve as a guide for accounting researchers studying other emerging markets. Capital market regulators can provide guidelines in the form of information characteristics and elements of financial statements that need improvement. Finally, the findings assist non-financial listed firms to enhance the quality of accounting information by identifying the strengths and weaknesses in their financial reports. Originality/value: This study extends the previous literature by investigating a relatively new set of data in more depth than that has been examined by prior research, which focusses on the relationship between accounting information and the firm's market value.

This paper explores the development and articulation of the agency and stakeholder theories of the firm and their corresponding logics of shareholder wealth maximisation and stakeholder interest optimisation. We note how these two perspectives have been viewed as diametrically opposite normative, instrumental and descriptive theories, despite efforts by some authors to find common ground. Each has served as a basis for firm governance. We explore the relationship of the agency and stakeholder theories to the conceptualisations of the roles of boards of directors, and how both theories hold value in understanding two board functions/roles: control/monitoring roles and service roles (which covers both resources and strategy).

After the emergence of financial scams like Enron, WorldCom and Toshiba, the researchers have emphasized the significance of the audit committee (AC) in curtailing the earnings management (EM). The role of the AC in financial reporting has received significant attention in accounting research because it offers information to shareholders for investment decision making. Researchers have examined whether AC characteristics mitigate managers' EM practices. Whereas there is a scarcity of research that investigates the association among ACs and impression management (IM). The objective of this research is to examine the relationship between the AC characteristics and IM practices in the chairman statement of the Malaysian companies We used IM as the measure for financial reporting quality (FRQ). Secondary data is utilized that is obtained from the annual report and Thomson Reuters Database. The sample of this study comprises companies listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia in 2017-2018. Interestingly, this research findings identify that AC independence has a significantly negative relationship with the level of IM measured on the basis of qualitative scores (IMSC1) and quantitative scores (IMSC2). The findings of this research supported the agency theory because it argues that strong internal governance monitoring mechanisms improve the FRQ and decrease the IM. AC meeting has a significant positive association with the level of IM based on qualitative scores (IMSC1). This result does not support the argument that increasing number of ACs meetings results in reduced IM and enhanced FRQ. Also, the AC meeting has no relationship with the level of IM in the quantitative scores (IMSC2), whereas IM and AC size has no association with AC financial experts. This result may not support the argument of the agency theory that AC size, meeting and financial experts significantly enhances the FRQ. Findings of the study may enable regulatory bodies and policymakers to devise policies and strategies to improve the credibility of financial statements in Malaysia. Future studies may consider the effect of other AC characteristics, like AC quality, AC members' ownership and AC members' remuneration on IM. (c) 2020, (c) 2020 The Author(s).

We examine whether the proportion of CEO inside debt holdings (pension and deferred compensation) to stock holdings benefit both shareholders and debtholders by relating CEO inside debt to a firm's dividend payout policies. Based on the positive association of CEO inside debt and the propensity and the size of the dividend payout, we find that firms paying their CEOs with large inside debt present the lower cost of debt and default risk, and these benefits transfer to better firm performance and valuation. Moreover, we find that CEO inside debt is related to superior firm performance only in dividend-paying firms. Dividends tend to increase when firms with high agency costs of equity use inside debt. We conclude that dividends serve as a channel through which CEO inside debt compensation mitigates both agency costs of debt and agency costs of equity.

This study investigates the impact of the asset-light strategy on dividend policy using a sample of large international publicly-listed companies (399 firm-year observations) operating in the hotel and restaurant industry over the 2006-2018 period. Taking the perspective of agency theory, we posit that the asset-light strategy in conjunction with significant growth is a context in which high agency conflicts arise. Using Tobit and OLS models, our results indicate that adopting an asset-light strategy only impacts dividend policy for firms with high growth. More interestingly, the positive impact of the asset-light strategy on dividend payouts occurs for firms with substantial growth if institutional ownership is low. In such situations, significant potential agency conflicts (due to high free cash flows) coupled with the lack of monitoring from institutional investors lead firms to use dividends as a monitoring tool. Finally, a change analysis supports our main findings. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: In a time where stakeholders increasingly demand social, environmental, and economic sustainability, mismanaging suppliers can impose substantial sustainability risks for a company and harm its reputation and business severely. This research explores the implementation of a corporate sustainable supplier strategy designed to cope with such risks from an agency theory perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A case study of a multinational enterprise, a provider of leading mobility solutions in the realm of escalators, moving walkways and elevators, is conducted. Data is collected from multiple sources of evidence, including strategy documents, a focus group and semi-structured interviews. Findings: The study identifies several implementation challenges and coping mechanisms in firstly, the agency relationships between the headquarter and the regional subsidiary units and secondly, the relationships between the regional subsidiary units and their suppliers. Research limitations/implications: A framework conceptualising the implementation of sustainable supplier strategies is proposed. The framework positions the topic at the interface between supply chain sustainability risk, supplier quality management as well as agency relationships and identifies avenues for further research. The key limitations refer to the single case study methodology and the exclusion of suppliers in the data collection approach. Practical implications: The proposed framework can support multinational enterprises in developing corporate sustainability strategies and in implementing them in the supplier network. Originality/value: The originality of the framework lies in the integrated approach combining supply chain sustainability risk, supplier quality management and triadic agency relationships.

How should managers deliberate, and how do we teach them to do so? How one evaluates managerial decision making will partly depend on what conception of the corporate function one endorses. Agency Theory and its accompanying shareholder conception of the corporate function has long dominated management. Voices in management learning have called for a change, but we argue that such change has been hampered by the lack of a theory of managerial deliberation, which is compatible with the alternative stakeholder conception of the corporate function. Here, we develop a novel theory of managerial deliberation: one that is suited to stakeholder theory. We argue that if genuine ethical deliberation is to become prevalent within management, then we must conceive of managerial deliberation as a creative, yet rational, learning process, while we assure that this process is adequately constrained to allow for managerial accountability. By taking inspiration from modern philosophical theories of deliberation, we provide such a theory of rational managerial deliberation. Copyright of the Academy of Management, All Rights Reserved.

This study tests the catering theory and explores the main determinants of dividend payments across a sample of eleven emerging countries. There is evidence of catering to investor sentiment for dividends in Middle Eastern and North African countries. Dividend payers are mature, profitable, large firms with lower growth opportunities, and high dividend premiums, which supports the catering, lifecycle, and agency theories. Catering behavior persists even after controlling for the effect of Arab Spring. Difference-in-difference analysis shows that countries highly affected by the political transition period are less likely to pay dividends in the post-Arab Spring period than less affected countries. Catering decreases significantly in the post-Arab Spring period as compared with during- and pre-Arab Spring periods, suggesting that investors prefer that managers retain earnings to reinvest and grow during unstable economic conditions. Furthermore, catering persists in countries with high corruption levels and poor legal quality to reduce agency cost, and substitute for weak legal systems with poor enforcement of laws.

The global financial crisis evidenced weaknesses in companies' risk management systems and sparked interest on how corporate risk management should be practiced. Following the tenets of the stakeholder-agency theory, this research analyzes whether external pressures are the major driving force behind ERM implementation. Survey data were used to test the influence of five variables (quotation on the NYSE, industry membership, firm size, belonging to the IBEX-35 index and risk level) that may be associated with the extent to which Spanish listed firms face external pressures to implement ERM. Empirical evidence seems to suggest that external pressures, from stakeholders, could exert some influence on ERM implementation, but other factors may play a part in the firms' decision to implement ERM. Opposed to previous research's results, this study found a remarkable absence of evidence about the influence of firm size on ERM implementation. This study's findings contribute to the understanding on the determinants of ERM implementation across different institutional contexts and could serve as a starting point for future research into this field focusing on other countries with economic or cultural characteristics similar to Spain. This study enriches the current knowledge about the drivers of ERM implementation by providing data from a context with characteristics distinct from most previously analyzed countries.

Agency theory considers information the most decisive element in investor-entrepreneur relations. Building on the notion of better-than-average (BTA) beliefs, we investigate the extent to which information asymmetries between investors and entrepreneurs may also emerge on paths other than the self-interest or opportunistic behaviour of rational actors. Based on a data set of 176 investors from 23 different German financial institutions, we conduct a conditional process analysis that indicates approximately 30% of all professional investors hold unjustified BTA beliefs regarding their abilities to identify flaws in new venture ideas, which leads to inaccurate financing decisions. We further find evidence that investors generally tend to underfund start-up projects if they perceive little similarity with the founders, but overfund projects if interpersonal similarities are high. Moreover, we demonstrate that high BTA beliefs facilitate engagement in competition with peers for the best investment option. (c) 2019 European Academy of Management

The governance of non-profit organisations is complex, as these organisations are not only intended to create value for third parties but also dependent on their donors. When the donor is a for-profit firm, it may be challenging to align and balance the firm's for-profit interests and the non-profit organisation's social aims. The board of directors has the main responsibility for supporting and monitoring managers' decisions so that all perspectives are considered, but doing so requires appropriate information about stakeholders' expectations. Adopting the agency theory perspective, this study focuses on corporate governance in corporate foundations (CFs), a type of non-profit organisation with a private firm as its founder and main donor. We hypothesise that bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between CFs and their founder firms, which are the main donors and consequently the main stakeholders, can increase the involvement of the board of directors, thereby leading to higher organisational effectiveness. We argue that the implementation of bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm can strengthen corporate governance and provide the board of directors with the information needed to be more involved; such implementation fosters organisational effectiveness because it aligns the profit-oriented objectives of the founder firm and the social-oriented objectives of the CF. By analysing data from interviews of 188 CFs from six European countries, we aim to contribute to the debate on the role of corporate governance in non-profit organisations under the agency theory perspective. We provide evidence that the implementation of coordination and bureaucratic control mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm gives the board more information and leads to higher board involvement, thereby minimising agency issues and fostering organisational effectiveness.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to verify the relations of the board of directors with the code of business ethics (CBE) of Brazilian publicly traded companies. Design/methodology/approach: As for the methodology, data were collected from companies that traded shares in Brasil, Bolsa e Balcao (B3) through the Comdinheiro database and codes of ethics or business conduct. For this, in relation to the dependent variable, indexes were elaborated to represent the CBE (CBEI). To represent the independent variables of the board of directors, the following variables were selected: size of board, gender of the president, independence, chairman/CEO, age and number of meetings. Findings: With that said, the results show that the size of the board, the independence and the number of meetings explain the informative content of the CBE. Also, the accumulation of positions of president and CEO negatively influences CBEI, so the research suggests that non-accumulation of positions reduces agency conflicts, generating transparency of CBEI, according to Agency Theory. Research limitations/implications: Considering the analysis of this research, it is important to highlight that the results should not be generalized because of the limitation of the sample period and because it was only for the Brazilian companies. However, they cannot be invalidated, given that, because of the robustness of the econometric models, it was possible to make inferences about the relations of the board of directors and the CBE of companies that trade in Brasil, Bolsa e Balcao (B3). Practical implications: The relations identified in this study between the board of directors and the CBE imply the involvement of top executives, so that the CBE be closer to the characteristics of the business, while the values must be transmitted with clear language, avoiding misunderstandings and conflicts that may be used by individuals in bad faith, with the purpose of apologizing for illegal acts of company. Social implications: The board's characteristics seek to support corporate responsibilities, fulfilling a diversity of issues in the operational scenario, including influencing the information content of the CBE. Besides being an expression of the organizational culture, because it evidences the rules of behavior and values of the company. Originality/value: The business ethics, which in this research is represented by the CBE, is a factor in which there is evidence in international studies that there are relations with the board of directors. In this context, the present study seeks to verify the relationship between the board of directors and the CBE of Brazilian publicly traded companies.

Purpose: This study aims to find the determinants of the capital structure of Islamic banks in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC). The uniqueness of the case of Islamic banks stems from the fact that they are not only subject to the supervision of financial regulatory bodies that organize the banking sector (e.g. central banks) but also subject to the guidelines of Shari'ah law governing their financial transactions, products and contracts. Such characteristics are expected to have an impact on the capital structure decisions of Islamic banks compared to their conventional counterparts. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the research purpose, an empirical model was constructed to describe the relationship between leverage and the independent variables. The empirical model was tested through multivariate regression analysis using a panel data approach of 12 Islamic banks in the GCC for the period 2005-2014. Three types of regression analysis were used as follows: ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed-effect and random-effect regressions on panel data. Findings: The research findings show that the leverage of Islamic banks in the GCC is positively related to size of the firm (SIZE) and growth opportunity (GROWTH); and it is negatively related to profitability of the firm (ROA), tangibility of the firm's assets (TANG) and financial market development (MRKT). The results indicate that larger Islamic banks tend to be relatively more diversified with higher credit ratings, which lower their cost of funding and relatively increase its profitability and the bank's customer/depositor base. The results also show that higher profitability ratios indicate relatively more internal funds to cover future investments, which leads to less reliance on external funds in the form of debt and/or equity. However, the higher the growth opportunities of Islamic banks, the faster the depletion rate of internal funding, and the more external debt financing is acquired to cover the expansion plans. In addition, the results show that in developed financial markets, savers tend to purchase less traditional depository products, and they prefer to invest directly in the financial markets to avoid higher commissions. The results are in line with the pecking order theory, which states that Islamic banks in the GCC tend to prefer sources of funds that have the least transaction cost and reveal minimal information to competitors. Hence, bank management resort to internally generated funds by its operations rather than acquiring external funds. Furthermore, the results are weakly explained by the agency theory, which states that as the firm assets become more tangible, the required monitoring cost is reduced; and hence, shareholders will have less tendency to raise more debt for the purpose of sharing the monitoring cost with debt holders. Research limitations/implications: This research study contributes to the theory of capital structure in re-validating the findings of a previous theoretical and empirical study on capital structure in the GCC and abroad. It helps understand the capital structure of Islamic banks in comparison with financial and non-financial firms. Future research is recommended in several areas. In terms of the methodology, it is recommended to conduct the research topic surveying management and financial executives of Islamic banks in the GCC; this will validate the results using a triangular approach supported by the findings of this paper. It is also recommended to apply the research methodology in other parts of the world where Islamic banking exists. Finally, as studies on the capital structure of financial institutions and other regulated sectors are rare, it is recommended to intensify research effort in these sectors to strengthen our knowledge of capital structure. Practical implications: From a practical perspective, this research bridges the gap between theory and practice in many aspects. The findings can serve Islamic bank executives as guidelines to understand the market and competitive reaction in response to capital structure decisions. On the other hand, research analysts and equity holders can use the findings in their debt and equity research valuations, assessment of the size of dividends and profit distributions, and to make more informed decisions to buy/sell financial securities. Furthermore, the findings help regulatory bodies to issue informed regulations in relation to capital adequacy ratios, reserve requirements, provisions and payout decisions to achieve policy intended purpose. In addition, organizations that are responsible for setting accounting and audit standards for Islamic banks will learn more about the industry practice; and hence, be able to pass practical standards. Moreover, the findings realize the recommendations of international financial regulatory bodies, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) and other concerned organizations that emphasize the importance of further understanding of financial institution practices, to enable more effective formulation of risk management techniques, which may prevent future financial crisis. Originality/value: This paper was amongst the few research studies conducted on determinants of capital structure in the GCC and specifically on the Islamic banking sector.

In this study we examine the effect of boardroom social capital, defined as the aggregate benefits from the social networks of outside directors, on director compensation. Using a large panel of nine thousand firm-year observations for the period 2007-2013, we find that boardroom social capital is positively priced. Further analysis shows that firms pay a premium for networked directors. Firms that have suffered adverse events such as a bad merger, performance declines, or dividend cuts, pay a higher connection premium. We determine that well-connected directors perform important board roles and hold multiple directorships. Overall, our results are consistent with an efficient contracting explanation for boardroom pay. (c) 2019

Purpose: This paper aims to gauge the quality of risk disclosure in 3,872 annual reports of Indian corporates, using a risk disclosure index (RDI) developed to capture both quality and quantity of risk disclosures. Design/methodology/approach: Focussing on 69 risk items, the paper uses manual textual analysis and scores risk items using an ordinal scale, as opposed to the general practice of using a dichotomous scale. Findings: The average risk index is low, but greater in the post-recession period than in the pre-recession period. Most disclosures are qualitative, both backward and forward-looking, and exhibit a negative tone. In addition, company age and industry sector have a significant impact on disclosure levels. Research limitations/implications: The choice and weighting of semantic qualities used to construct RDIs used in disclosure studies are inherently subjective. This exploratory study uses univariate analysis and does not explore the reasons for poor disclosure. Practical implications: In addition to its usefulness for investors and companies' management, the findings of non-compliance with certain mandatory provisions and a low average RDI is particularly relevant for policymakers and regulatory bodies. Originality/value: Development of a summary measure/RDI that is novel in its differential weighting of the semantic qualities pertaining to quantification, time-orientation and tone. Further, it serves as an exploratory study about risk disclosure practices in the Indian context that reveals notable differences from findings of previous risk disclosure research. Moreover, the study examines the relationship between firms' age and risk disclosure levels, a largely ignored aspect in disclosure research. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Corporate governance plays a decisive role in the financial performance a firm. While the majority of the firms in China and India are owned a managed by its promoters, the present study attempts to examine the impact of ownership structure and board characteristics on firm value for these two economies. The study employs panel data methodology with industry and time fixed effects on a sample of 1,042 firms listed in National Stock Exchange India and 450 firms listed in Shanghai Stock Exchange of China. The study finds promoter ownerships to positively impact a firm's value creation process, while institutional investors exert a negative influence. Although CEO duality enhances firm value in China, the results show otherwise for Indian firm Additionally, while board independence is positively correlated to firm value India, it has a negative effect on firms in China. Finally, the study finds that larger board size contributes favorably toward better decision making. (c) 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited

Purpose: From the agency theory's point of view, this paper aims to analyze corporate governance mechanisms about the characteristics of the companies quoted in the segments Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais 2 and their influence on the creation of value in preparation for the opening of the initial public offering (IPO). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was adopted to achieve the proposed objective using the panel data with fixed effects and secondary data collected on the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios website, using statistical software Stata(r) 13.0 for statistical tests. The population comprises non-financial companies belonging to the Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais Level 2 groups, as the survey sample took into account the period of adhesion of the companies, totaled in 15 companies, which cover the period from 2008 to 2019. The selected variables correspond to the ownership structure's characteristics, then the board's composition and the fiscal council as the body responsible for supervising the administrators' acts. Findings: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. However, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Research limitations/implications: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. Despite this, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Practical implications: This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. This paper finds that internal governance characteristics (founder-chief executive officer, executive incentives and board independence) and external network characteristics (prestigious underwriters, degree of venture capitalist syndication and board interlocks) are significant predictors of foreign capital market choice by foreign IPO firms. Social implications: While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally crucial strategic decision. This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. Originality/value: This situation generates value to shareholders and is perceived by the market and, ultimately, generates a direct relationship with the market performance of companies. While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally major strategic decision.

The number of unicorns, startups valued over $1 billion, has steadily risen over the past decade. The abnormally high valua-tion of a unicorn from investors is based on their potential to disrupt a market and create a new paradigm. With this as the back-drop, this piece asks the question, what theoretical tools do we have to understand unicorns? Specifically, we explore agency theory. We argue that if principals and agents agree on the goal of disruption, then perhaps the agency problem that does occur in unicorns is beneficial, not a cost. Further, we argue that the principals of unicorns do want agents to take higher than normal risks with their investment to disrupt a given market. From this phenomenon, we introduce the concept of agreeable moral hazard and its use in the unicorn setting. Not only does the concept of agreeable moral hazard provide theoretical implications for future research, but it also highlights the need for more research to test existing theory on the unicorn population.

This systematic literature review of 54 articles investigates quantitative and qualitative studies published between 1974 and 2017 in terms of differences in investment criteria between venture capitalists (VCs) and business angels (BAs). Research has shown a persistent interest in examining VCs' and BAs' investment criteria; however, inconsistent findings demonstrate the need for a review of the aggregate extant knowledge. We clarify what is known about the controversial debate on VCs' and BAs' investment criteria and shed light on key issues that can lead to a better understanding of why VCs and BAs focus on certain investment criteria. To achieve these objectives, we develop a conceptual framework grounded on agency theory for investment criteria that VCs and BAs use for funding decisions. Our review reveals that VCs in the first instance focus on the business and financial traction, whereas BAs initially employ investment criteria related to the management team. These differences between VCs' and BAs' investment decision policies support the agency view. In addition, we propose a detailed path for future research and provide entrepreneurs with practical implications. (c) Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

Family business literature shows that family and nonfamily firms differ with respect to their financial reporting decisions. However, although the literature on financial reporting in family firms has developed over the last ten years, it is mostly oriented towards earnings management and management control issues. Given the specific characteristics of family firms in financing and governance, do their published accounting data have less value relevance for public investors than in the case of non-family firms? How do family firms differ from one another on this issue? While different theoretical perspectives have been used to tackle this problem, two main theses based on agency theory were the most frequently called upon. In fact, the views of interests' alignment and entrenchment are competing in explaining the differential quality of family and non-family firms accounting numbers. This paper draws on this theoretical lens and contributes to filling this research gap by conducting a comparative analysis of earnings' value relevance for a sample of quoted French family and non-family firms. First, it examines whether family firms show more or less relevant accounting earnings than non-family firms. Second, it seeks to study the heterogeneity of family firms in terms of earnings figures' relevance by considering the extent of family control and the involvement of a family CEO as mechanisms leading to alignment or entrenchment. The findings show that family firms exhibit better earnings' value relevance than non-family firms. In addition, when owning families' control becomes high, earnings' value relevance worsens, which suggests a possible entrenchment effect on behalf of controlling families.

Many "High-Tech" firms enjoy high market valuations despite negative earnings and low cash flows due in part to what many see as future bountiful earnings and cash flows, which is a cause for concern. How can corporate governance help? Do well-informed boards assist corporate success through better governance through their influence on financial policy: Capital Structure and Cash Holdings? We test these effects in "High-Tech firms" by segmenting firms into four levels based on technology intensity. We examine differences in board composition and the resultant influence on capital structure. Our fourteen-year sample period includes post-dotcom bubble years and post-Sarbanes-Oxley, which mandated the inclusion of financial experts on corporate boards. We defined two types of firm designated well-informed boards as a result of this analysis. We contribute to the literature in many ways. Using regression analysis and graph theory techniques, we found the educational makeup of high-tech firms to be significantly different from low-tech firms and that they approached capital structure with caution. Low-tech firms rely on board member network connectivity and agency theory's explicative powers. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Using insights from academic and practitioners' perspectives and recent data, this paper extends the literature by using pay variables that are typically used by practitioners, including those not studied in previous academic research. Consistent with previous findings, firm size, measured by three-year average revenues, has strong effects on CEO pay. However, the relationship is not the same for firms of different sizes. Revenue elasticity is strong among small companies and disappears for medium and large companies. Firm performance, measured by accounting-based measures (return on assets and return on equity), and market-based measures (total shareholder return and shareholder value), have little effects on CEO cash compensation, but strong positive effects on equity compensation. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2019 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between cooperative practices of accountability, cooperative ownership, advanced communication and non-financial performance in savings and credit cooperative societies. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a cross-sectional research design and adopted a mixed methodological approach were hypotheses were statistically tested using structural equation modeling based on survey data (n = 220) and narratives from qualitative findings supported the quantitative findings from savings and credit cooperative societies. Findings: The findings reveal that cooperative practices of accountability, cooperative ownership and advanced communication are significantly and positively associated with non-financial performance of savings and credit cooperative societies. Originality/value: This study provides empirical evidence on the relationship between cooperative practices of accountability, cooperative ownership and advanced communication and non-financial performance in savings and credit cooperative societies in emerging economies like Uganda. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is limited or no study that has used the construct of agency theory in explaining the relationship between cooperative practices and non-financial performance in savings and credit cooperative societies.

We investigate whether diversification affects bank risk taking in the U.S. banking industry, and whether this relation is partially explained by agency theory. Our results show that U.S. banks with a relatively high share of noninterest income become riskier when moving toward non-interest-income-generating activities, especially activities from investment banking, proprietary trading, and so on. Diversification not only affects conditional average risk, but also the dispersion of risk. Moreover, diversified banks that received assistance from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) become riskier than diversified nonrecipients after TARP capital injections. Our main findings are robust to a battery of robustness tests. The results are partially explained under agency frameworks related to poor corporate governance.

How do public procurement practices influence effective public financial management (PFM) in Africa? Notwithstanding the several public procurement reforms to improve PFM in Africa, outcomes have not been sustainable. Prior studies have failed to explain this phenomenon. With a descriptive case study design based on comprehensive datasets, this paper explains this situation with three key factors underlying the public procurement environment in three African countries: Ethiopia, Central African Republic, and Ghana. From the agency theory lenses, these factors affect the agency cost in public administrative systems necessary for addressing the agency problems in public procurement management towards desired PFM outcomes.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of ownership structure on merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions of Brazilian listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is an applied and explanatory research based on secondary data. The sample is comprises non-financial companies listed on the BM&FBovespa between 1998 and 2007. Considering that the dependent variable is binary, the authors estimate panel data logistic regression models. Considering the existence of conflicts of interest among those who have the decision-making power and the supplier of capital for M&A transactions, they draw upon the Agency Theory to develop the theoretical hypotheses. Findings: The results show that, for a sample of Brazilian non-financial companies listed on the BM&FBovespa (B3), from 1998 to 2007, Brazilian firms present, on average, a highly concentrated ownership structure and the major controlling shareholders are families or the State. These characteristics are negatively related to the likelihood of M&A transactions, as most of these controlling shareholders are reluctant to adopt mechanisms that reduce their control. Research limitations/implications: With regard to the limitations, this study considered only the M&A definitions as stated by the Bureau van Dijk database. In this sense, future studies may analyze the effects of ownership structure based on other M&A definitions and typologies. In addition, the study is limited to the period from 1998 to 2007, which is prior to the international financial crisis. Future studies may extend the analysis period to include the post-crisis period (2008) to check if there are differences in M&A strategies before and after the crisis. Practical implications: From a managerial perspective, the results show that minority shareholders have little or no influence over an M&A decision, so they cannot decide on the use of resources for fast growth and access to new markets through M&A. Thus, the investment decision must take into account the nature and the quality of the controlling shareholder. Social implications: This study shows a significant and negative effect of ownership concentration on the likelihood of M&A transactions. In part, this result demonstrates the importance of understanding the behavior of controlling shareholders before inferring on other key aspects that the M&A literature tends to make fundamental in explaining M&A decisions in publicly traded companies, particularly, in an environment of low minority shareholder protection. Originality/value: Previous studies have partly found that the M&A decision is motivated by individual advantages obtained from increasing the size of the firm, or from managerial hubris. The results show that these hypotheses do not hold in the Brazilian context. Moreover, the results indicate that M&A decisions are associated with the characteristics of the controlling shareholder, their level of ownership concentration and their typology, contributing to the agency debate on whether the incentive or the entrenchment effect prevails in the context of the agency problem between controlling and minority shareholders, particularly, in an institutional environment of low shareholder protection.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether foreign directors' influence on opportunistic behavior among managers varies between Islamic banks (IBs) and conventional banks (CBs). It also examines how religious ethics and morals guide foreign directors to be better monitors. Design/methodology/approach: A panel fixed effects regression is used to analyze the effect of foreign directors on opportunistic behavior among managers in IBs and CBs. The authors use different proxies such as loss avoidance, discretionary loan loss provision and expense preference behavior to measure management opportunistic behavior. Findings: Based on sample of 3,758 bank-year observations for 164 banks over the period 1993-2015, the authors show that the presence of foreign directors in IBs increases boards' effectiveness in impeding management opportunistic behavior, whereas the presence of foreign directors in CBs reduces boards' effectiveness in curbing management's unethical acts. The authors also document that IBs (CBs) with foreign directors demonstrate less (more) earnings management and expense-preference behavior among managers. In addition, the authors' evidence indicates that the existence of the Shari'ah supervisory boards helps foreign directors be more effective monitors. Research limitations/implications: The current study focuses on banks only which makes its results subject to sample bias; there are many other forms of financial institutions (e.g. investments, real-estates and mutual funds) complying to the Shari'ah law. Second, owing to the lack of foreign board directors characteristics, the authors cannot investigate the intensity of the specific characteristics that could have specific directions in affecting managerial behavior. Practical implications: The findings in this paper may help standards-setters, auditors, investors and regulators take appropriate measures and create better policies that reduce managers' discretion. This could in turn improve information transparency decision-making, monitoring, advising and accounting quality. Originality/value: The authors' theoretical framework combines the agency, contingency, resource-dependence, stewardship and stakeholders' theories and applies them to Shari'ah as an alternative ethical and internal governance mechanism. The authors find that the impact of foreign directors on management opportunistic behavior depends on the corporate religious norms within boards of directors, in particular, suggesting that religious values affect how foreign directors influence bank managers' behavior.

Purpose: This paper contributes to the capital structure literature by examining the impact of financial leverage on firm performance and also the extent to which firm size and crisis matter in the leverage -performance relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 2403 Indian firms during the period 1995-2014, generating a total of 19,544 firm-year observations, panel econometric methods are employed to test the leverage-performance relationship. Findings: Drawing insights from agency theory and using Tobin's Q (TQ) as our main measure of performance, the authors uncover that financial leverage is negatively and significantly related to firm performance. The authors also observe that the impact of financial leverage on firm performance is lower for smaller firms than larger ones. Finally, the authors show that the 2007/08 financial crisis had no significant impact on the relationship between financial leverage and firm performance. Originality/value: The paper provides fresh evidence on the impact of leverage on performance, particularly from the Indian context. This study is also among the first studies to examine the role of firm size and financial crisis in the leverage-performance relationship. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Earnings management behavior is the use of accounting procedures, through accounting policies, to intentionally purposeful control in the provision of information to users. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between ownership structure factors and earnings management behavior of 30 Vietnamese commercial banks. The paper uses the ordinary least square method to examine this relationship and employs time series data of 15 years from 2005 to 2019. The study also uses agency theory an asymmetric information theory. The authors examined six independent variables related to the ownership structure and these variables are typical of Vietnamese commercial banks. The results of the study show that the foreign ownership ratio is an opposite effect, while the ownership concentration variable has a positive effect on earnings management behavior of Vietnamese commercial banks. Based on that, the article proposes a number of policy suggestions for the State bank of Vietnam and Board of directors of commercial banks as well as investors to identify and to limit the earnings management behaviors of Vietnamese commercial banks. This contributes to ensuring information transparency as well as improving the quality of accounting information of Vietnamese commercial banks in the coming years. (c) Copyright: The Author(s).

Computer abuse by employees has increased the potential for security vulnerabilities for organizations. Organizations have established various security countermeasures to prevent computer abuse and protect organizational information. However, these policies are only effective if followed. Thus, it is important for organizations to understand the factors that motivate employees to follow computer usage polices. We investigate the impact of different countermeasures, such as perceived sanctions, and awareness of being monitored on compliance with computer usage policies by drawing upon agency theory and general deterrence theory. After testing the hypothesized relationships using survey data, the results indicate that perceived sanction severity and certainty significantly influence intention to comply with computer usage policies. Furthermore, awareness of being monitored is found to significantly impact penalties. Study results further indicate that penalties may be effective only to the extent that organizations can detect employees' deviant behavior through managerial controls, such as computer monitoring.

Based on the agency theory, this paper analyzes whether family firms pay more dividends compared to no-family firms and identifies whether the board composition affects the dividend policy. Brazil and Chile have established mandatory dividends, retain lower cash holdings, pay higher dividends compared with other markets in the region. The sample of study is composed by 853 observations from 49 Brazilian and 32 Chilean top publicly listed firms in terms of market capitalization over the 11-year period from 2004 to 2014. Using an unbalanced panel data, results indicate that family controlled firms distribute more dividends and board composition namely; board size and the proportion of women on the board have a significant and positive impact on the dividend policy of the firm. By contrast, Chairman of Board - Chief Executive Office (COB-CEO) duality signficantly. Thus, dividend policy constitutes an effective corporate governance mechanism in mitigating the family' expropriation of minority shareholders' wealth. (c) 2021 European Journal of Family Business.

There is a broad call to integrate planetary boundaries and life-cycle based reporting into accounting theory and reporting standards. Although many practitioners back this call, including insurers, shareholders with a long-term orientation, and company law specialists who suggest that the inclusion of long-term stakeholder interests is necessary to counter both corporate and systemic risks, it remains unanswered. We argue that dominant assumptions about the status and architecture of corporations in corporate governance theory stand at the centre of this unanswered call in accounting theory and practice. As the status of the public corporation is interpreted as a nexus of contracts and its architecture as a restricted dyadic relation between 'principals' and 'agents', the object and audience for corporate reports are restricted to a very specific set of actors, interests and time-horizons. We argue that this conceptual setup unduly restricts notions of accountability and is connected to a specific notion of political economy. A broadening of reporting standards needs, therefore, to be accompanied by a critical assessment of the assumed object and audience of reporting in corporate governance theory.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to answer the research question: How do cooperative organizations perform when created by government fiat in an emerging market? Through the use of institutional and agency theory, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the efficiency of the cooperative form of organization and investor-owned firms-investigating how the social-political structures in a community affect the efficiency of cooperatives vis-a-vis investor-owned firms. This paper also attempts to offer a better understanding of how government quality and organizational size influence performance outcomes between different organizational forms specifically in the Philippines. Design Methodology Approach: The empirical analysis of this study was conducted among electric distribution utilities in the Philippines. Firm-level data was generated for 133 distributors, consisting of 119 electric cooperatives and 14 investor-owned companies. Panel data regressions were ran to test all hypotheses. Findings: Cooperative organizations operate at a less efficient rate than investor-owned firms in the Philippines, even when controlling for firm-specific factors such as size, customer density and profitability. In addition, the efficiency of these cooperative organizations is more strongly influenced by the quality of the local government than investor-owned firms. Originality Value: Positive externalities generated by the propagation of cooperatives on local communities may be based primarily on our understanding of how cooperatives have functioned largely in western contexts. Within the context of Southeast Asia, where national socio-political structures may be more dysfunctional, this paper observes that there is an equivalent negative externality caused by the tendency of cooperatives to replicate the political mismanagement of the community around it.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to verify the theoretical assumption about a weaker role of internal governance structures (namely, board and CEO) in determining sporting and financial performances in highly concentrated club ownership environment. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from the Italian and English football clubs playing in their national top divisions, over the period 2006-2015, the authors apply agency theory, property rights theory and win maximization logic to test the absence of a significant impact of internal governance structures on financial performances and clubs' sporting performance. Ownership structure's variables are used as control variable. Findings: Empirical findings document an overall poor impact of board structure and CEO features on financial performances, in comparison with the influence of ownership structure; the consolidation of win maximization logic of clubs' owners has been demonstrated in this specific context. However, the authors found that some internal governance elements have also an impact on performance even if their contribute is limited: board size results negatively associated to club profitability, board independence and CEO tenure are positively related to sporting performance; in addition, CEO tenure also increases profitability. Originality/value: The originality of the paper lies on the contribution arising from this empirical research, since a scarcity of empirical studies analyzing the correlation between internal governance and performance in European football sector is noticed.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the effect of setting up a separate risk management committee (RMC) on the performance of listed companies in Malaysia's consumer goods sector. The study considers several firm characteristics as control variables to influence the establishment of the RMC, such as firm size and leverage. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises 169 observations throughout a nine-year time frame starting from 2010 to 2018. The current study used a dichotomous variable of "1" to represent a listed company that establishes a separate RMC and "0" as otherwise. The data analysis is based on a static panel data technique, which utilised the fixed effects model (FEM) and random effects model (REM). Findings: There is a significant positive relationship between a separate RMC and Tobin's Q which suggests that the establishment of a separate RMC that consists of a majority of independent non-executive directors would significantly improve the firm's performance. The current work supports agency theory which suggests that independent non-executive directors can enhance the transparency of corporate boards as they improved the firm's compliance with the disclosure requirements. Originality/value: Proper risk management and internal control are critical aspects of a company's governance, management and operations that can influence a firm's performance. The empirical evidence contributes to the knowledge of corporate governance within the context of a RMC's role in monitoring a company's risk management framework, policies and its implementation. The formation of a separate RMC as a board committee will help to enhance the effectiveness of the risk oversight role of the BOD. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper examines the impact of the board of directors' characteristics on bank performance in an Egyptian context. Board of directors' size and composition diversity in terms of gender, nationality, and independence are used as proxies for the board of directors' characteristics. Bank performance is measured using the return on assets as an accounting-based profitability indicator besides stock return volatility as a market-based performance indicator while controlling for the bank, regulatory and countryspecific characteristics. Regression analysis is performed for a sample of 21 Egyptian banks covering the period from 2012 till 2018. The results show that banks with large boards including a high proportion of female and foreign directors achieve higher performance. Also, the higher is the proportion of independent directors, the lower is the performance, which contradicts with the agency theory proponents. Most importantly, the findings provide empirical evidence that market-based performance indicators react negatively to females' directorship, while the opposite is found with independent directors as reflected in the positive market reaction. The findings are highly relevant since improved financial performance is one of the key objectives of bank supervisors and regulators to sustain economic growth. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Considering that principal-principal conflicts in companies under mixed public-private ownership are substantially different from the typical agency conflict model, this paper's objective is to analyze principal-principal conflicts in mixed ownership companies in the Brazilian electric power industry. In order to expand understanding of the phenomenon which we are studying, we have integrated the assumptions that underlie agency theory and institutional theory, using a qualitative approach and collecting data during semi structured interviews with companies' board members. Data was analyzed and interpreted as per Bardin (2006), with the aid of ATLAS(r)ti software. Our main findings suggest that while a government stake in a firm's ownership structure can provide a useful channel for the government to seek support and resources, in counterpoint, it can also create distortions and uncertainties, and exacerbate principal-principal conflicts. The development of stronger institutions and corporate governance could bring about useful options for providing checks and balances and, in the final analysis, mitigate principal-principal conflict. The article contributes to the literature by providing additional elements that are not available in public reports. Analysis of the conflict between principal and principal, together with theoretical integration, seek to broaden the understanding of this theme. (c) 2020 FUCAPE Business School. All rights reserved.

Organizational transparency has become a prominent concern for the nonprofit sector as it expands globally. Transparency is important to organizational accountability, which may be indicated by how nonprofits allocate their resources. In this study, we examine the relationship between nonprofits' transparency and their resource allocation to programs, administration, and fundraising. Our study focuses on China, where a nascent nonprofit sector is playing increasingly significant roles in social development while facing public trust challenges. Based on Agency Theory and Resource Dependence Theory, we propose two hypothesized frameworks that link transparency to resource allocation, and use the 2013-2015 China Grassroots Organizations' Transparency Survey data (n = 370) to test this relationship. Our results suggest that nonprofits with higher transparency allocate more resources to programs rather than administration, a possible result of the current public scrutiny of nonprofit accountability in China. Our findings provide implications for nonprofit practitioners and future research about the significance of organizational transparency, particularly in emerging nonprofit sectors.

This study examined the strategic planning process used in U.S. public company boardrooms, with a particular focus on companies that used board-level Strategic Planning Committees (SPCs) as opposed to those that engaged the full board in strategic planning oversight (which we call "strategic planning overall" or "SPO" firms). Based on interviews with 8 SPC members and 12 directors from SPO firms, we found a number of similarities in SPC and SPO processes, as well as a number of key differences. Overall, it is clear that there often can be a fundamental tension between management and directors with respect to the responsibility for strategic planning. There also can be significant information asymmetries arising from agency theoretic assumptions requiring board independence and arms-length interactions. Organizational scope may, within limits, constrain these assumptions. Such conditions increase both resource and information processing demands on the board, creating a need for greater formality in the board's strategic planning processes. These demands increase the need for paradoxical approaches that can accommodate greater flexibility in board-management interactions. The paradox lies in the board's ability to simultaneously meet and balance agency theoretic, resource dependence based and information processing demands. The contrasting organizational logics that are in play result in paradoxes that influence whether and in what form a board-level SPC should be constituted. The evidence suggests that constituting and structuring SPCs to embrace more collaborative interactions between the board and management could be helpful in dealing with the contrasting requirements and tensions that arise in certain firms. Embracing paradoxes and modifying governance approaches to include collaborative interactions with management may also help in ensuring that the board's strategic planning processes are equipped to deal with the challenges that confront the organization. Ultimately, individual company directors will need to determine whether and in what form a board-level SPC would add value to their governance structure and processes. Our interview-based evidence suggests that firm size and director experience are important considerations in the choice of how the board should oversee strategy. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Although acquisitions rarely deliver the anticipated value acquiring firms estimate, it remains a popular strategy for growth. We draw upon agency theory to investigate two types of stakes acquiring firms can obtain during an acquisition to ensure greater post-acquisition value - voting rights and cash flow rights. Using domestic acquisition data in Japan over 12 years to test our hypotheses, we find that greater voting rights directly improve value creation and positively moderate the effect of cash flow rights to improve acquiring firm value. This study sheds light on the strategic mechanisms crucial for post-acquisition integration value creation, and highlights acquisition strategies.

I examine the influence of large and small institutional investors on different components of chief executive officer (CEO) compensation, using US data for 2006-2015. An increase in large institutional ownership reduces total pay and current incentive compensation (i.e., options, stocks, bonus pay), whereas small institutional investors lower long-term incentive pay (i.e., pension, deferred pay, stock incentive pay). These findings are consistent with managerial agency theory and the substitution of incentive pay by institutional monitoring. The effects are stronger for higher ownership levels and firms with weak governance, less financial distress, long-tenured CEOs, multiple segments, and more free cash flow.

This paper investigates the link between financial leverage and corporate investment for a group of five sub-Saharan African countries. Using firm-level data from 2004 to 2014, we postulate a linear and nonlinear corporate leverage-investment relationship. The results obtained by the system GMM estimation and quadratic methods are aligned with the predictions of the agency theory. We find a non-linear relationship between long-term debt and corporate investment. This translates into the fact that there is an optimal leverage threshold, below which sub-Saharan firms do not face an overinvestment risk. Nevertheless, beyond this threshold, they bear overinvestment risk. Firm-specific (in particular, IFRS and corporate tax) and macroeconomic determinants also play a powerful role in determining the optimal investment strategy.

This study examines the effects of a dual-class structure on investment efficiency. Agency theory suggests that a dual-class structure exacerbates agency problems, leading to under- or overinvestment, but another view posits that the dual-class structure insulates managers from the pressure of the marketplace or activist investors seeking short-term profits. We find that dual-class firms invest more efficiently than single-class peers. This effect is more pronounced among firms with less transparent investments such as R&D. Our findings are robust to a propensity score matching approach and a setting where single-class firms recapitalize with dual-class shares. Furthermore, we find that among firms most at risk of overinvestment, dual-class firms have higher future accounting profitability and less volatile future returns. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract: This article argues that the notion of authority involves key theoretical and institutional issues. Drawing on McMahon, I define authority as a collective and normative device whose justification is to facilitate mutually beneficial cooperation among people with divergent aims. I then show that agency theory, the economic theory of the firm that normatively influenced the shareholder governance model, denies that authority is a core attribute of firms. By contrast, an authority-based theory of the firm normatively demands that firms are governed by reflexive authority, a kind of workplace democracy in which the authoritative directives guiding workers' behavior are collectively determined. I end by suggesting co-determination as a possible form of reflexive authority. (c) 2020, Journal of Economic Issues / Association for Evolutionary Economics.

Purpose: This study investigates the relationship between IFRS adoption and earnings management (EM) i.e. discretionary accruals (DA) and real earnings management (REM) in developing economy like Bangladesh. Moreover, the study examine the relationship between corporate governance (CG) strength and EM as well as moderating role of CG strength on the relationship between IFRS adoption and EM. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs 94 firms listed in Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) for 6 years i.e. 564 firm years observation, over two time period as pre (2004-06) and post (2013/14-15/16) adoption of IFRS. Underpinning theory of the study is agency theory which explained the relationship among variables. Based on earlier literature a CG index is developed to measure the strength of CG. The study uses random effect GLS with robust regression in a balanced panel data. Findings: The results show that IFRS and CGI both have significant negative relationship with EM. Moreover, it is documented that the CG strength significantly moderates the relationship between IFRS and REM. It implies that the presence of good CG may help to attain the objectives of IFRS adoption Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is one of the first empirical attempts at providing evidence about the role of CG on the relationship between IFRS adoption and EM in Bangladesh. The findings of this study can be beneficial for the member of the regulatory bodies and researchers to formulate new policy and enhance corporate governance practices in Bangladeshi companies as well as develop a better framework for all stakeholders involved in financial reporting. Future studies may also investigate the interacting effect of corporate governance strength on other related variables which may influence the level of earnings management. (c) 2020, Sciedu Press.

Drawing on the agency theory and the stakeholder theory, this study assesses strategies for corporate support to the arts and analyzes their organizational and contextual determinants. Based on an original dataset of Italian companies benefitting from a tax incentive program, we observe the following findings: smaller companies are more likely to contribute to the maintenance of the artistic heritage of the local area where they are located, with the aim of sustaining the cultural capital of their community (local legacy strategy); larger companies are more likely to support arts and culture as part of their social responsibility strategy (rich patronage strategy); medium-sized service companies are more likely to contribute a small amount of money to cultural and artistic events with a national appeal, with the aim of enhancing their reputation (Market-oriented strategy). Our research provides useful insights to artistic and cultural organizations for designing their fundraising activities and to policymakers interested in stimulating private donations for the preservation of a country's cultural heritage.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the strength of corporate governance influences the firm's ability to retain their key knowledge workers or inventors. Design/methodology/approach: This paper links agency and innovation theory to develop the hypotheses. Agency theory predicts that the interests of employees are counter to those of firm owners. The authors predict that as shareholder power grows as corporate governance strengthens, inventors who are highly productive, and those who pursue risky but valuable exploratory innovation will leave the firm. Given prior scholarship in innovation theory establishing the critical contributions that new knowledge creation and exploratory innovation make to firms' competitive advantage, the authors consider whether stronger firm-level corporate governance leads to the erosion of the firm's competitive advantage. The hypotheses are empirically tested using generalized least squares estimation on a data set that combines data on firms, their patents and the governance provisions these firms adopt. Findings: Using a 10-year sample of publicly traded US firms, the authors find that stronger corporate governance erodes the very foundation of a firm's innovation capabilities. Stronger corporate governance reduces management job security, which makes managers more risk-averse. This heightened "managerial myopia" results in increased departures of highly valuable inventors employed by the firm. The authors show that these departing inventors are more productive inventors than those who remain and engage in more exploratory R&D than the remaining inventors at the firm. Originality/value: The findings raise questions on the appropriateness of the adoption of governance provisions strengthening shareholder rights in firms pursuing innovation.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of behaviour-based and buffer-based management mechanisms on enterprise agility using the lens of the agency theory. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on data collected from 185 manufacturing enterprises using a survey instrument. The authors employ structural equation modelling for data analysis. Findings: The results of this study show that buffer-based mechanisms used for dealing with agency uncertainty of supplier/buyer not only have a positive impact on agility of enterprises, but are also contingent on the behavioural interventions used in the relationship with a supplier/buyer. Behaviour-based mechanisms also positively impact enterprise agility through mitigating the likelihood of supplier/buyer opportunism. Practical implications: This study demonstrates that buffer- and behaviour-based management mechanisms can be used as complementary approaches against agency uncertainties for enhancing enterprise agility. Therefore, for enterprises to boost their agility, it is vital that their resources and capabilities are fairly distributed across entities responsible for creating buffers through functional flexibility, as well as individuals and teams dealing with stakeholder engagement, in particular, suppliers and buyers. Originality/value: The authors use the lens of the agency theory to assimilate and model characteristic agency uncertainties and management mechanisms that enhance enterprise agility.

We examine the impact of corporate governance on cash holdings and the interplay of family ownership on this relationship through static and dynamic panel estimation models. Composite indicator for the corporate governance based on several proxies related to corporate board structure and ownership is constructed using principal component analysis (PCA). Our evidence is based on a sample of 120 publicly listed non-financial firms from Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) over the period 2013-2017. The selected sample is further divided into family and non-family firms based on 10% or more ownership. We document the negative impact of corporate governance on cash holdings. The findings reveal that family ownership as a moderator weakens the impact of corporate governance mechanism on cash holdings. The analysis of individual proxies of corporate governance and cash holdings in the whole sample, as well as sub-sample, provides some new insights that family firms with more board size, board independence, and institutional shareholdings hold more cash as compared to non-family firms. The study theoretically supports the agency theory. The study suggests that individual market participants may make investment decisions thereby keeping in view the role of family ownership. The study also provides better insights to regulatory authorities to design policies in such a way that ensure the protection of minority shareholders as corporate cash holdings decisions are different in family and non-family firms.

This research examines the impact of three types of agency problems (agency problem Type I, II and III) on corporate performance. This study uses 1.760 observations of nonfinancial companies from Indonesia during 2013-2017. The results show that agency problems Type I (manager vs. shareholder) and Type II (majority vs. minority shareholder) in general positively affect performance, whereas agency problems Type III (shareholder vs. creditor) negatively affect performance. This study contributes to agency theory literature and to local and international investors that invest in the Indonesian capital market by showing that not all types of agency problems negatively affect performance.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the role assumed by corporate governance mechanisms in guiding a corporate organization to take on benefit company (BC) model using the theoretical models of agency theory and stakeholder theory applied to the corporate social responsibility activities of the firm. In detail, it has been hypothesized that the phenomenon of chief executive officer (CEO) duality, independent directors and female directors has a positive effect on the likelihood of a firm taking the model of a BC. Design/methodology/approach: A panel sample of 354 Italian firms taking the institutional model of BC and a control group of 600 firms extracted from the Aida BvD database were analysed. Data covers a period from 2009 to 2018. To empirically validate the advanced research hypotheses, four non-linear probit regression models were estimated. Findings: The results show that CEO duality seems to have a positive influence on the company's likelihood of taking the model of a BC. Similarly, the independence of the board of directors and the gender diversity within the board of directors have a positive impact on the company's likelihood of assuming the model of a BC. Originality/value: The research work contributes at integrating the emerging debates into the literature about the relationship between corporate governance and corporate responsibilities by expanding them into new and emerging business context of the hybrid organizational model. Further, the systematic use of the theoretical models of agency theory and stakeholder theory applied to socially responsible activities will improve the understanding of the heterogeneous relationships between corporate governance and choice for the institutional model of BC.

In this chapter, we discuss the agency theory. The agency theory is a principle utilized in an attempt to explain the complicated relationship that exists between the owners (principal) and managers (agents) of the business. Based on this, we propose that the agency theory is an attempt to explain the complexity of human behaviour in the principal-agent relationship. We are of the view that when the desires or goals of the principal and agent conflict, it is difficult or expensive for the principal to verify what the agent is doing. Since the theory is an attempt to explain the complexity of human behaviour in the principal-agent relationship, we pose the question: what happens to the theory in the era dominated by intelligent machines? We conclude that with AI, there will be new frontiers. These new frontiers include, among other things, the certainty of sharing of intelligent information that would, in the context of the agency theory, be available to both the agent and the principal. Further, we observe that the advantages of intelligent systems are updateability and connectivity. Using these strengths, we think intelligent agents will be swift in picking up the information discrepancies. Intelligent systems have the capability of harvesting information from different sources. Once gathered, this information will be updated in the principal's system, given that the systems will be integrated. Finally, we think it conceivable that perhaps the agent, knowing that intelligent agents are deployed widely and that these intelligent systems have the capability of harvesting data from different repositories, will moderate his or her behaviour to be closely aligned to that of the principal.

Board gender diversity is a keenly debated topic in both management practice and academic discourse. This study examines the influence of board gender diversity on firm financial performance in four ASEAN countries. Adopting agency and resource dependence approaches, board gender diversity's interactions with three mediating organizational variables are evaluated against four organisational performance measures. Partially supporting agency theory and resource dependence theory, the results suggest that board gender diversity are only positively associated with sales to fixed asset ratio and sales per employee ratio. The BGD's effects at the organisational level are mediated distinctly by firm size, ownership structure, and industry nature respectively, and by the multivariate interaction among these variables. The results of this paper support the findings of other studies that found a partially significant link between the board gender diversity and the firm's performance. Decision-makers in society and politics, therefore, need to be aware of the empirical evidence indicating that stimulating organisational environment may need to be configured before the valuable outcomes of gender diversity can be achieved.

This study tests the implications of agency theory, signal theory and information asymmetry on the relationship between institutional ownership and a firm's value supported by the new concept of Productive Sustainable Investment based on Financial Constraints. Sample of this study is sharia companies in the Indonesia Stock Exchange on the period of 2011 to 2016 with a population of 412 firms; purposive sampling was used and obtained a sample of 131 companies with 786 observations. Data analysis used a path analysis utilizing the Warp PLS analysis tool. The result of this study shows that institutional ownership has a significant negative effect on the firm's value, which means there is a non-linear relationship between institutional ownership and the firm's value. The findings do not support the agency theory. However, productive sustainable investment based on financial constraints is able to mediate the influence of institutional ownership on firm value. It means that this finding supports the signal theory. Thus, productive sustainable investment based on financial constraints significantly has a positive influence on the firm's value. In other words, this finding supports the theory of information asymmetry. (c) 2020.

Numerous studies have investigated whether regulation substitutes for or complements internal governance. The results have been inconclusive due to their over reliance on agency theory and extensive use of demographic proxy variables to real board activities. We empirically investigate the relationship between government performance evaluation (GPEs) and internal monitoring by SOE boards in the context of Korean state-owned enterprises (SOEs), overcoming the limitations of existing empirical studies. This analysis is enabled by data collected from the 1,525 board minutes of 170 Korean SOEs. Our prior expectation is a substitutive relationship. First, the similarity of GPE and internal monitoring by the board makes the relative cost of internal monitoring more expensive. Second, GPEs only reward managers, leaving outside directors unpaid. The empirical results are consistent with our expectation, and indicate that even in heavily regulated SOEs, internal imperatives outweigh institutional pressure. Hence, policy makers should carefully design GPEs so as not to crowd-out the potential benefit of internal monitoring by SOE boards. (c), Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This paper aimed to empirically examine the extent to which capital structure impacts the profitability of Nigerian Deposit Money Banks considering the profitability of eight Nigerian Deposit Money Banks from 2003 to 2018 (16 years). A descriptive research design was adopted for this study, and data were analyzed using regression. The study used secondary data obtained from published annual reports of selected Nigerian Deposit Money Banks on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for four years (2003-2018). The study concluded that the indicators used to measure capital structure (debt-equity ratio and leverage ratio) and profitability (returns on equity) had a negative relationship. This means that the use of debts mixed with equity (debt-equity ratio and leverage ratio) in improper proportion as financing methods can negatively affect profitability. Hence, there is a need to identify the optimal mix of capital structure (debts mixed with equity) that maximizes profitability, as well as firm and shareholder value with minimum agency costs as suggested by the trade-off theory and agency theory, respectively. The alternative is to give preference to retained earnings (internal source of finance) as funding source.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore why different directors feel different levels of accountability toward board tasks. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a reflexive three wave data and analysis process culminating in a rich data set of 49 interviews with Australian directors and 15 h of boardroom observations. Findings: Differences in role identification lead directors to perceive their accountability differently resulting in wide variation in levels of firm specific knowledge, eventually affecting their breadth of contribution to board tasks. Research limitations/implications: Researchers should question the application of traditional governance theory (such as agency theory) if it fails to account for individual differences in intrinsic self-interest. Practical implications: Selecting board members for their functional knowledge alone may not always produce optimal outcomes for the board and firm. Board induction processes and ongoing director training are important tools to inform and remind directors of their role and accountabilities on a board. Originality/value: This paper establishes that the strength of directors' identification with either the director role or expert role affects what they feel accountable for, the development of firm specific knowledge and long-term efficacy as a director.

This study evaluates the franchising intensity of Mexican franchise chains. Supported by the theory of agency and the theory of signals, the influence of the brand recognition and the pricing strategy on the franchising intensity of the chain was evaluated. The brand recognition was evaluated using four indicators: experience, size, MFA (Mexican Franchise Association) affiliation, and origin. The pricing strategy was evaluated with three indicators: initial investment, entry fee, and royalties. On a sample of the 397 franchise systems operating in Mexico in 2016, the multiple linear regression technique was used to evaluate the influence of the brand recognition and the pricing strategy of the chain on the franchising intensity of the chain. This research confirms that the factors associated with brand recognition and initial investment influence the franchising intensity of the Mexican chains. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

We examine the effect of international acquisitions on CEO compensation for US firms from 1995 to 2016 using both domestic acquisition and no acquisition firms as benchmarks. We find that acquisitions lead to a greater increase in CEO compensation (especially incentive-based compensation), which is consistent with agency theory and inconsistent with stewardship or reputation theory. We also find that international acquisitions lead to a greater increase in CEO incentive-based compensation than domestic acquisitions, supporting matching theory given that international acquisitions are larger and more complex to manage. Additionally, we document that CEO tenure has a positive effect on CEO compensation, whereas firm relatedness has a negative effect on post-acquisition CEO compensation. This is the first study of its type based on comprehensive data, and it contributes to our understanding of the role of international and domestic acquisitions in CEO compensation.

Purpose: As widely known and well established, strategic decision-making at family firms is an interface between business interests and family considerations. The purpose of this paper is to understand the underlying basis of decision-making in setting corporate strategy and designing chief executive officer (CEO) compensation at founder- vis-a-vis descendant-led family firms in the Indian pharmaceutical sector. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 106 BSE-listed pharmaceutical companies have been studied over the period 2012-2017 resulting in a total of 636 firm-year observations. Impact of family involvement in business (FIB) on corporate strategy and CEO compensation has been analysed by constructing multivariate panel data regression models. To deal with the problem of endogeneity, Arellano-Bond (1991) dynamic panel data estimation procedure has moreover been conducted. Findings: Supporting stewardship theory, founder-owned and governed firms have been found to favour "growth" strategy and distribute "conservative" executive pay, thereby exerting a positive moderating impact on the strategy-compensation linkage. On the contrary, descendants/second-generation entrepreneurs have put forth a "conservative" stance for growth and innovation, and have rather been observed to favour a "liberal" compensation policy, thereby showcasing the application of behavioural agency theory. Originality/value: The research is a novel attempt to unravel the interaction between corporate strategy and CEO compensation in a family firm backdrop carried out in the context of an emerging economy. The study, moreover, adopted an all-encompassing definition of FIB (ownership, management and governance). (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Against the background of legal amendments and society's call for more gender-specific equality, this article examines the relationship between gender diversity in the supervisory board and its monitoring effectiveness. We test the aforementioned relationship based on agency theory and resource dependence theory and on the basis of several company-fixed panel regressions. The underlying panel data comprises 1500 supervisory boards of 132 companies listed in HDAX and SDAX between 2015 and 2017 (396 company years). Gender diversity is operationalized through different diversity metrics, and monitoring effectiveness is measured by excessive board compensation. The results indicate that a higher representation of women on the supervisory board (shareholder representatives and all members) is accompanied by lower excessive compensation and thus better monitoring effectiveness. In contrary, we cannot find a relationship between gender diversity of employee representatives or all members of the compensation committee and monitoring effectiveness. After international research has already dealt occasionally with this context, it is now being tested for the first time in the context of the dualistic corporate governance-system to what extent gender diversity in the supervisory board and the remuneration-related monitoring effectiveness are linked. Our paper argues that greater gender diversity, regardless of socio-political considerations, can be beneficial for companies' corporate governance and thus contributes to the discussion about the impact of the statutory gender quota.

Purpose: Microfinance institutions (MFIs) provide credit to low-income beneficiaries, enabling them to gain access to financial assistance. To ensure that clients are protected, all MFIs should adhere to basic corporate governance principles to guarantee uniform standards, transparency and good corporate governance practices in their institutions. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to explore the client protection practices and sustainable performance of Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM), a leading MFI in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: Closed-ended questionnaires were distributed to managers and assistant managers at 76 AIM branches across the peninsular Malaysia. A response rate of 68 per cent was achieved from the total questionnaires distributed. Findings: The result shows that the level of client protection in AIM is high. It shows that accountability and debt collection process have a significant influence on the level of sustainable performance of AIM, whereas transparency and transaction costs have an insignificant impact on the level of sustainability of AIM. Consistent with the agency theory and institutional theory, the result also implies that having better debt collection process policy and structure, and accountability among management will enhance the level of sustainability of AIM. Originality/value: Previous studies focused on the single issue of sustainability in microfinance, such as on repayment performance among the poorest people whom AIM served as clients. However, studies on the accountability towards clients are still underdeveloped by researchers. Hence, the current study fills the gap by examining whether client protection affects the sustainability of AIM. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Below-cost tours (BCTs) have long been considered a serious issue in the travel industry, yet they have rarely been discussed from a tour guides' perspective. Today's tour guides are mostly freelancers, hired by tour operators to lead tour groups. While previous studies cover the management and behaviors of tour guides, there is little insight into personal perceptions of their work. To better understand BCTs, this study provides an intimate look at the phenomenon through the use of semi-structured interviews from tour guides and employment of nonparticipant observation on their experiences. The structural problems of the travel industry and impacts of BCTs on tour guide performance are explored and highlighted. Framed in the agency theory, the managerial implications and solutions to the BCT problems are discussed and recommended. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether the stock price crash affects the dividend policy. The divided policy is measured by the amount of dividend paid, compared with the size of the firm. Firms that experience stock price crash have strong incentives to reduce agency costs. Specifically, we examine whether firms with stock price crash use dividend policy to reduce agency costs between the management and the outside investors and to inform an information about firm's future profitability to the market. In particular, we analyze whether this relationship would be different depend on the level of agency problem. In addition, we investigate the dividend paying firm's future value. The sample of this study is 7,736 Korea listed firm-year observations from 2001 to 2016. Empirical findings are summarized as follows. First, we find that firms with stock price crash are more likely to pay dividend to reduce the agent cost and provide additional an information to outside investors, and this relationship is more pronounced with higher agent costs. In addition, we find that firm's value increase after the dividend payment. This paper contributes to extant literature by showing the empirical results for the signaling effect of the dividend, and provides an additional information for the firm with stock price crash.

The purpose of this study is to validate the relationship between earnings management and financial distress. Further, it will explore the moderating role of ownership structure for the relationship between earnings management and financial distress which is missing in the current literature. Agency theory and the iron law of earnings management are utilized to develop the framework for this study. Data have been collected from 156 companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for the period of 2004 to 2017. All the reported results are on a log-odds matric because our dependent variable is binary. The results of the study proved that there exists a positive relationship between earnings management and financial distress and this relationship is negatively moderated by ownership structure. The results of this study are beneficial for investors as well as regulators regarding control mechanisms of ownership structure. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

This study examines the impacts of corporate governance attributes on Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) listed companies' voluntary disclosures. Year-ending 2012 annual report disclosures of 100 IDX listed companies are analysed using a disclosure index. The results show a low level of voluntary disclosures (25.97%). The regression analysis shows that board size is a positive and significant predictor of voluntary disclosure practices. Agency theory thus partially explains the variability of these disclosure practices. Older companies also provide more disclosures. It is implied that the number of commissioners determines the strength of the board of commissioners in pushing the board of directors to be more transparent. Thus, to be more informed, international investors should invest their money in older companies having a greater number of commissioners. Copyright (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the impact of financial structure-the balance between a firm's liabilities and equities-on profitability, based on a sample of listed construction companies in Vietnam. Following a literature review, the hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between financial structure and profitability was formulated and tested through pooled ordinary least square, fixed effects, and random effects models. The empirical results revealed that the total, short-term, and long-term debt ratios exert a negative impact on profitability, while asset tangibility, inventory ratios, and growth rate, as well as size and age of firm all positively affect profitability; however, short-term receivable ratios had no effect. These findings contribute empirical evidence, in the context of emerging economies, to the existing body of literature. (c) 2020 Asian Economic and Social Society. All rights reserved.

The independent variables include board size, directors' remuneration, CEO duality, tenure of CEO, and institutional ownership. The control variable is represented by firm's size, whereas the dependent variable is financial structure decision. The results indicate that directors' remuneration and firm's size have a positive significant relationship with the financial structure decision. The corporate governance is developed to reduce the agency costs and ensuring the separation of ownership and management to protect the shareholder's rights. This aligns with corporate finance theories, which suggest that financial structure is one of the elements that contribute to the agency cost, while corporate governance is a tool that can mitigate the agency issues.

This study argues that corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm innovation have long-term orientation and CSR is positively related to innovation. It explicitly recognises the endogeneity of CSR and innovation and uses 2SLS instrumental variable regressions to estimate the impact of CSR on innovation. Using a sample of 841 large US companies and 3,246 firm year observations for the period 1995-2006, it finds that CSR is positively associated with firm performance in innovation measured by patents and citations. Results also show that CSR strengths (concerns) have positive (negative) impact on innovation. Additional tests indicate that firm performance in innovation is positively related to industry adjusted Tobin's Q, suggesting that innovation is one of the channels through which CSR increases firm value. Overall, the empirical results indicate that CSR is a long-term strategic investment and its impact on firm value should be measured through its impact on firm innovation which is a good indicator of long-term value.

Purpose: One aspect of agency theory suggests that dominant shareholders use the firm's assets for their personal benefits and 1thus expropriate minority shareholders (tunneling). Accordingly, this paper aims to examine the effect of capital structure and cash holding decisions on minority shareholders' expropriation for short and long periods. Design/methodology/approach: Data of 16 years (2000-2015) has been obtained from 200 non-financial firms registered at Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The study used fixed effect and autoregressive distributed lagged to obtain the results. Findings: The results suggest that the presence of more debts in capital structure is positively associated with minority shareholders' expropriation, whereas a negative association has been found between the level of cash holding and minority shareholders expropriation. These results have been observed as significant both for the short and long run. Research limitations/implications: This study also suggests some important measures to control minority shareholders' expropriation by the dominant shareholders and thus to protect their rights. Originality/value: There is a lack of literature for this severe issue in the developing countries especially Pakistan, so this study narrates the potential measures to the regulatory authority of the market to curb tunneling and to protect minority shareholders.

The relationship between an agent (supply management) and a principal (client functional user) can be studied by using agency theory as a theoretical background. In this study, perceptions of conflict, information asymmetry and risk were examined in relation to perceptions of internal outcomes of supply management's involvement in services contracting in an intra-organizational dyadic context. Structural equation modeling and regression analysis were used to analyze the nature of the relationships. The contribution is integrating a structured view of internal outcomes with three concepts from agency theory to help build a more comprehensive theory of intra-organizational relationships in the context of services contracting.

This paper investigates the role of firm-level and country-level governance on corporate diversification behaviour in emerging markets. The results show that firms with combined leadership structure are more diversified while firms with more independent directors are less diversified. There is a U-shaped relationship between ownership concentration and diversification. No significant association between country-level shareholder protection and diversification is demonstrated.

This paper examined the association between financial leverage and financial performance of Nigerian manufacturing firms. Performance is the ability of management to control firms' resources to gain competitive advantage. Among the internal organisational factors that affect firms' profitability is financial leverage which is the firms' capital structure framework. From agency theory perspective, it is hypothesised that profitability increases with debt financing to a certain optimal level of debts. A five-year data covering a period between 2011 to 2015, sourced from the financial statements of 66 Nigerian manufacturing firms were collected. This study found that financial leverage is positively and significantly associated with the financial performance of Nigerian manufacturing firms, measured as return on equity (ROE). Further, the firms with moderate level of debt ratio are found positively associated with ROE. In contrast, all equity-financed firms and those firms with excessive debts financing are negatively associated with ROE. A positive association is also found between firm size and revenue growth rate with ROE. Nigerian manufacturing firms are recommended to apply agency theory of optimal debts financing to address their financial constraint and poor performance issues. (c) ExcelingTech Pub, UK.

This study investigates the determinants of board of director compensation from the view of strategic management. Specifically, this study examines the association between product market competition and directors' compensation for a sample of 524 listed firms in Malaysia from 2010 to 2014. We find that there is a positive relationship between a competitive firm and its compensation to its directors. Our research indicates that managerial incentives reflect more of talent appreciation, rather than purely for acknowledging better performance or a bigger size firm. This research contests the use of agency theory and managerialism in explaining directors' compensation, especially for the developing country context of Malaysia. Our findings also imply that firms may pay higher compensation in a competitive market. (c) 2019 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

This study investigates the role of board capital on bank's efficiency for a sample of 45 banks in Vietnam over 2011-2015. Using robust panel regression, we find board capital is important in making Vietnamese bank efficient even after controlling its endogeneity issue. This study further documents that networking capital and experience capital are the important factors, but not education for bank efficiency. The findings of this research contribute to the entrenchment hypothesis in agency theory, where networking and experience can be the bargaining power for manager (agent) in securing their compensation. It also contributes to human capital theory and resource base view theory where it shows networking and experience are stratetic human capital resources for bank efficiency. The findings imply that shareholders should consider the networking and experience of board members during board elections. Future research may engage with the intervention of corporate governance monitoring or test it in other developing countries context. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by VGTU Press.

Purpose: Although principal-agent theory has gained a prominent place in research, its negative image of self-serving managers is frequently criticized. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine how existing theories of agency and stewardship can be combined by using behavioral characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: This study reviewed articles on the behavior of agents and stewards from the domains of finance, economics, management, corporate governance and organizational research. Additional theoretical and meta-analytical empirical literature from the fields of psychology and sociology was used to account for general patterns of human behavior. Findings: The results indicate that goal congruency and the perception of fairness can serve as moderators distinguishing agency theory and stewardship theory. Goal congruency can be achieved by stipulating psychological ownership. The perception of distributive and procedural fairness is demonstrated by two major corporate governance mechanisms: performance-based compensation and board monitoring. The results are summarized in six hypotheses that allow a situational, customized corporate governance. These hypotheses can be tested in future research. Originality/value: Prior work either focused on the merits of principal-agent theory or advocates the utilization of positive management theories, such as stewardship theory. However, little work has been done on bridging the gap between both constructs and develop a more extensive view of management theory. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Economic challenges in Zimbabwe have resulted in firms being pushed out of their optimal leverage. Firms are faced with the need to move back to the optimal level of financing to improve their value. They tend to adjust quickly to the optimal level whenever failing to do so is costlier. This study employs a dynamic capital structure model to examine the determinants of optimal leverage and the speed of adjustment under a hyperinflation and dollarization period (2000-2016). The study shows that firms have an optimal leverage and there are costs of adjusting to this level of capital. Findings are consistent with theoretical predictions of the static trade-off theory (STT) and agency theory. The adjustment factors for all the models were found to be at least 0.475 and are higher under hyperinflation than under dollarization. Both firm and macroeconomic factors explain the optimal capital structure while the former also explains the speed of adjustment. Policies focusing on improving access to and reducing costs for finance will assist firms to maximize value as they adjust to the desired financing mix. The policies adopted may vary in response to the economic environment. (c) 2020 Emerging Markets Forum, Washington DC.

The current research aims at providing evidence concerning the influence of surplus free cash flow (SFCF) and stock market segmentations (SMS) on income-increasing earnings management practices in Jordan. The results, based on a sample of all non-financial companies that were listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) from 2013 to 2017, confirm the research hypotheses. The Huber-White's sandwich standard errors for random-effects regression was used as the primary statistical tool for this study. The findings revealed a significant and positive association between SFCF and income-boosting discretionary accruals (DAC). As well, the results found that SMS was significantly and positively associated with the positive DAC. This research adds value to scholarship by investigating the impact of SMS variable on earnings management. To the best available knowledge, this relationship has not been examined either in Jordan or elsewhere in the world. Further, this is the first empirical attempt to investigate the effect of SFCF on earnings management in Jordan, which provides meaningful information for companies seeking to understand and reduce agency problems within the Jordanian context.

We investigate if CEO characteristics determine the choice of Political Action Committee (PAC) contributions by firms and if such participation leads to better firm performance. Using a unique, hand-collected database, we also focus on the identity of the politicians receiving PAC contributions to examine the impact of the value-relevance of such contributions. Examining data on corporate contributions made to candidates seeking federal office during the 2002, 2004, and 2006 election cycles, we find that CEO dominance and interest alignment influence strategic choices of firms with regards to establishing PACs. Our analysis of value-relevant contributions shows that firms prefer to donate to politicians representing the state of a firm's headquarters, validating the truth to the adage that all politics is local. However, these targeted political contributions do not have a discernible impact on firm performance. (c) 2019 University of New Orleans

The wave of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) is a phenomenon in which one or more technologies are replaced by another technology in a short amount of time. In small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), some internal and external problem are occurring that suggest change from classical to technological approach. Thus, this chapter aims to establish the relationship between the employees' satisfaction toward their employer's role performance. Based on the power-dependence and agency theories, this study contributes to the SMEs industry in Malaysia and will involve IR4.0 by offering a much more comprehensive theoretical perspective to aid understanding and prepare for the revolution internally. The sample of this study comprises of employees who are working in various sectors of the SMEs industry. G-power technique was employed to find the minimum sample size in this study. Meanwhile, the SPSS and PLS will be used to analyse the data. The practical implication of this research concerns the factors that can enhance employee satisfaction if their company jumps into the IR4.0. Thus, the employer should play the right role to make sure the employees are ready and well prepared for the revolution despite there being environmental uncertainty happening in the process.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the strength of corporate governance and the value of firm-level investment policies following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002 and the associated changes to the listing requirements of major stock exchanges. In particular the authors seek to examine potential changes in the market's assessed value of capital expenditures after the passage of the SOX Act relative to before. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ a difference-in-difference methodology, centred on the year of the passage of the SOX Act to test for the role of governance on the marginal value of capital expenditures. Excess stock returns are calculated by subtracting Fama and French (1993) size and book-to-market portfolio value-weighted returns from the firms' annual stock returns. Each firm is grouped into one of 25 size and book-to-market portfolios for each year in the sample, with size and the book-to-market ratio proxying for sensitivity to common risk factors in stock returns (Fama and French, 1993). Findings: The authors find that markets responded to the change in governance brought about by the new regulation by altering the value of firm-level capital expenditures in a way that is generally consistent with predictions of agency theory. While the overall findings imply a reduction in agency conflicts post-SOX, there is some evidence that certain firms may have suffered excessive costs of compliance, while still others saw managers become excessively risk averse. Research limitations/implications: The study has implications related to the efficacy of legislation. Cross-sectional variation in the effect of SOX on the marginal value of capital expenditures suggests that one-size-fits-all legislative approach can have both expected as well as unintended consequences. The study limits its analysis to examining the impact of three significant provisions of the Act. While, the value implications of the Act are largely captured by the selected three, a more comprehensive study could expand on the set of provisions studies to obtain a more granular level impact. Practical implications: This research should add to the growing body of the literature examining the effect of SOX on firms' real activities and decisions, as well as contribute to the debate on whether the Act was beneficial or costly to firms. With particular reference to the impact of capital expenditure on firm value, the research contributes to the sparse literature examining the contribution of capital expenditures to firm value and the role that agency conflicts play in this relationship. Additionally, this research adds to the growing body of the literature that examines the costs and benefits of the sweeping new regulations brought on by the adoption of SOX. Social implications: Given the importance of investment policy for economic productivity and growth, the insights provided by findings in this research should benefit lawmakers both within the USA as well as in countries where corporate misconduct and fraud is a concern. Originality/value: This is the first study that examines the impact of the SOX Act on the way capital markets value firm-level investment in capital expenditures. Since use of corporate resources by managers is fraught with agency conflicts, the role of SOX in potentially alleviating this conflict as revealed by the tests in this study are very valuable.

Two divergent theories emerge from the literature on CEO duality. The agency theory advocates that a dual CEO negatively affects corporate performance, because it compromises the monitoring and control of the CEO, whilst the stewardship theory suggests the contrary effect due to the unity of command it presents. For a sample of 26 non-financial listed Portuguese firms from 2002 to 2016, this study draws on agency and stewardship theories to evaluate the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance, proxied by Tobin's Q. Using ordinary least square (OLS) and two stage least squares (2SLS) techniques to control potential problems simultaneity between CEO duality and firm performance, the author finds a negative relationship between CEO duality and Tobin's Q. This suggests that investors perceive no value in having a concentration of power with a dual leadership structure. Therefore, this study recommends that the positions of chairman and CEO should be separated for listed Portuguese firms. (c) 2020 by IGI Global.

For sustainable development, the extent to which state-owned enterprises adhere to the fundamental values of good corporate governance is an important factor necessary to attract investment capital, encourage growth and economic stability. Zimbabwe has been saddled with the challenges of fashioning an environment which is investor-friendly, hence the need for public entities to be exemplary in good corporate governance. Highly publicized scandals that have shaken state-owned enterprises have been ascribed to deficits in corporate governance this study employs a qualitative approach through a descriptive-document philosophical analysis to examine the challenges in Zimbabwe's strategic management for sustainable development. The corporate governance theories informing the study are the agency theory, stewardship theory, stakeholder theory and the transaction cost economics theory. The analysis is subdivided into themes which focus on the need for a human resources paradigm shift, management finesse and the continuum of culpability. The study reveals that the current corporate governance practice has not effectively improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the public entities. This is a result of corruption, inconsistencies, lack of commitment and absence of the rule of law and above all, excessive political interference. The study interrogates the ethical matters stemming out from such challenges to establish if the malpractices have been some form of complicity or an underestimation of the effect of good corporate governance in the public sector. Corruption has been institutionalized with cases of impunity on the rise. Issues of governance that countervail the sustainability and risk nexus are depicted. It is commendable that efforts are being made to entrench corporate governance in the public sector although positive results are yet to be realized. It is recommended that a rules-based approached should be adopted and that political interventions should be minimized. Human resources departments in state-owned entities and parastatals are encouraged to provide expert advice on good corporate governance and shy away from being complicit to bad governance.

This book examines tax transparency as part of multinational enterprises' corporate social responsibility (CSR). It considers revelations like the Panama and Paradise Papers that shed light on corporations' tax practices and the growing public dissatisfaction, resulting in legislative projects, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) base erosion and profit shifting. Tax transparency is defined as companies' voluntary disclosure of numerical tax data (e.g. taxes paid by country) and other tax-related information (e.g. tax policies). It is set apart from tax avoidance and tax evasion to clarify the often-blurred concepts. In this book, tax transparency is placed in a historical context and possible drivers and hindering factors to tax transparency are investigated. Tax transparency is discussed in the light of socio-economic theories (stakeholder, legitimacy, institutional theory and reputation risk management), as well as economic theories (agency theory, signalling, proprietary costs) and information overload theory. The book provides examples of tax transparency development of the largest multinational enterprises in five countries (France, Germany, UK, Finland and USA) in six years, 2012-2017, a period featuring increased media coverage of tax matters and legislative movement in the OECD and the European Union. The future of tax transparency is discussed in light of quality characteristics, assurance of information and potential use of artificial intelligence. Companies' managers and tax and CSR specialists benefit from the book by gaining insight into how to design transparent, high-quality tax reporting. Assurance professionals can use information about the quality criteria of tax transparency. Regulators can track historical development and see examples of voluntary tax transparency in companies' reporting. Scholars and students obtain theoretical framework for analysing the tax transparency phenomenon and the ability to distinguish between the concepts of tax transparency, planning, avoidance and evasion.

Entrepreneurs are vital for the success of any country, especially that of emerging and newly emerging economies. In this article, we look at how financial information sharing by entrepreneurs impacts access to capital. We model the relationship between entrepreneurs and lenders as that of a principal-agent and show how this agency theory perspective combined with culture of the country can present a richer understanding of the relationship between information sharing and access to capital. Implications of our findings are discussed in detail. (c) 2019, (c) 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Orientation: Agency theory predicts that agency relationships are subject to the principal-agent problem. Other theories also suggest that executives may tend to maximise sales revenues, or expand their spans of influence through growth, at the expense of the net value of the firm or its profitability. Research purpose: The purpose of this study is to test which forms of company performance are associated with higher executive variable pay ratios or determine the proportion of variable director remuneration to total remuneration. Motivation for the study: The extent to which variable remuneration is associated with different types of firm performance is unclear. Research design, approach and method: This study applies a simple panel regression model to test the extent to which the variable ratio of total director remuneration contributes differently to increases in firm revenue, total assets, return on assets, or measures of Tobin's Q. These relationships are tested for listed companies on South Africa's Johannesburg Stock Exchange, South Africa, for the years 2011-2014. Main findings: Variable remuneration is found to be negatively and strongly related to total revenue and negatively and weakly related to total assets (the gross measures of performance). In contrast, variable remuneration is weakly and positively related to Tobin's Q, a measure which better reflects the interests of shareholders than gross measures. Practical/managerial implications: Firms in this context should seek to strengthen the linkages between variable remuneration and forms of performance that reflect the interests of stakeholders. Contribution/value-add: In the wake of global and local governance failures, this study suggests that the use of the variable component of executive remuneration might be helpful in aligning stakeholder interests. Further research might seek to better understand the causal mechanisms that underlie these findings. (c) AOSIS (pty) Ltd. All rights reserved.

The field of corporate governance can to a large extent be traced back the aftermath of the Great Depression 1929. The problem which led to the crash of the stock market was described as a division between control and ownership. The problem was described as managerialism. The thesis of managerialism inspired agency theory which has been synonymous with corporate governance theory. The theory focuses on the shareholder perspective and the importance of maximizing profits. Although corporate legitimacy has become a more important concept within institutional theory, it has had limited influence on the corporate governance discourse. That is, however, likely to change as the importance of the stakeholder perspective is growing. To align corporate governance with stakeholder perspective and strive for corporate legitimacy will have profound effects on the role of boards and corporate governance.

Despite the importance of the franchise system in Latin American countries, few academic studies address the issue of internationalization. To contribute to filling this knowledge gap, this study evaluates the factors that differentiate Mexican franchisor with international orientation from those that only operate in the domestic market. This research was carried out on a sample of 249 franchises operating in the Mexican market in 2016. The research hypotheses are supported in the theoretical approaches of the Agency Theory and the Resource-based Theory. The results reveal that the experience, the size, the monitoring capacity, and the franchise fee significantly predict the adoption of internationalization.

Larger companies cannot escape from facing financial distress, which eventually leads to insolvency and unsustainability. In this regard, this study examined the relationship between ownership concentration and firm sustainability of top 200 Malaysian public listed companies for the period between the years 2009 and 2015. The two-stage least squares regression results of this study showed that ownership concentration was significantly and negatively related to firm sustainability. This finding remained the same when different proxies of ownership concentration and firm sustainability were used. Generally, this finding indicated that excessive concentrated ownership may lead to decisions that did not satisfy all key shareholders, and may reduce the level of firm sustainability.

Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: This paper aims to examine the decision usefulness of net income (NI) which includes predictive power and value relevance by comparing it with comprehensive income (CI), for financial firms in Malaysia. Design/Methodology/Approach: This study uses panel data analysis techniques which focus on unbalanced panel dataset of 2012 to 2017, obtained from 29 financial firms listed in Malaysia. Research findings: Results show that in the case of predictive power tests, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that one accounting metric has better predictive power than the other. In the case of value relevance, results show that NI is better than CI when using the price and return models. This indicates that NI is more decision useful to investors than CI for financial firms in Malaysia. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study expands on the literature of decision usefulness of NI (in comparison to CI) for financial firms within an emerging economy, such as Malaysia, which has a smaller and less efficient market. The findings support the agency theory, particularly the Type II agency problem, which show that there is a conflict between controlling and non-controlling shareholders. This outcome may reduce the demand for quality reporting for external shareholders. This study is related to fair value accounting (FVA) which is still underexplored in the Malaysian setting. The outcome may provide some insights into the financial statements used by investors for understanding the effect of FVA on reported earnings in Malaysia. Such evidence is currently lacking. Practitioner/Policy implications: The findings may be helpful to investors in making better investment decisions in the Malaysian market. This study may benefit academicians by expanding the literature on decision usefulness of FVA in an emerging economy. The outcome derived offers a body of knowledge to academia as a reference for future research. This paper may also be relevant to the standard setters, regulators, and policymakers as it offers empirical evidence on the decision usefulness of accounting information disclosures in the context of an emerging country such as Malaysia. Research limitation/Implications: The limitation of this study lies in the small sample size used, thereby reducing the generalisability of the findings. Larger sample size may add robustness to the results. (c) 2020, University of Malaya. All rights reserved.

The study investigates the effect of executive compensation on earnings management of Nigerian listed non-financial institutions. A longitudinal research design was adopted for the study. A sample of 40 listed firms was selected using a purposive sampling technique. The study covers a period of 2010-2018, resulting in 360 firm-year observations. The data collected was analysed using the Ordinary Least Square Method (OLS). The results show that executive compensation and statutory audit have a significant negative association with earnings management. The results suggest that executives with lower compensation engage in opportunistic behaviour, which is consistent with the positive accounting theory, while highly compensated executives engage in income-decreasing earnings consistent with the agency theory. Also, statutory audit plays a significant role in mitigating against the executive in engaging in income smoothing. (c) 2020. All Rights Reserved.

This study aims to observe the relationship between managerial efficiency (ME) and corporate leverage policy. We use data from Pakistani listed firms from 1999 to 2018. In our stepwise methodology, initially, we used data envelopment analysis (DEA) to acquire firm total efficiency (FTE) scores and then Tobit regression to acquire residual values. These residual values are used as a proxy of ME. After employing various definitions of leverage and fixed effect regression technique, the study observes that ME has a positive and significant relationship with leverage. It indicates that efficient managers are more inclined towards debt financing. It also implies that restraining managerial discretion through debt financing may also make them efficient. Therefore, finding partially approves the agency perspective in the case of Pakistan. Overall, this study offers theoretical contributions to better understand the role of ME and leverage, and the use of DEA approach. Further, this study is fundamental to observe the ME and leverage concerning agency theory in general, and specifically in the context of Pakistan.

We update and review the current literature on IPO underpricing and performance, stressing the link with corporate governance at the country and firm-level. We focus on the separation between ownership and control and the signaling that firms' governance structure could send to the IPO market. It is clear from this review that improvements in governance institutions tend to reduce underpricing and affect IPO performance positively, but it is not entirely clear how governance at the firm level could impact IPOs' underpricing and performance. As shown, there are many interesting avenues for further research in this area. (c) 2020, AfricaGrowth Institute. All rights reserved.

This paper looks at managerial diversion and agency theory and how both arguments may be applied to describe the governance practices and performance of state-owned enterprise companies in Indonesia. Managers are the main focus of the approaches, on the assumption that managers tend to expropriate the firms' and shareholders' value for their own benefit instead of looking for ways to maximize shareholders' value and fulfill their stakeholders' needs. Indonesia is selected because it has the highest number of State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) companies among the ASEAN countries. The government holds more than 51 percent of the shares and has a unique governance structure with two-tier boards to manage and run the companies. Besides, most of Indonesia's SOE companies have a tight connection with Indonesia's political party. With these characteristics, the agency problem in Indonesia's SOE companies is more prevalent compared to other listed SOE companies. The managerial diversion, which is linked to corruption, might be the principal critical factor that hinders SOE companies from performing well. Thus, even with the introduction of a good corporate governance score by the Indonesian government, which is imposed on SOE companies, it may not be able to improve the overall financial performance of SOEs as well as governance practice in the companies. This paper's objective is to review and examine prior literature on corporate governance and managerial diversion from the perspective of state-owned enterprise companies in Indonesia.

This study examined how research and development (R&D) spending affects stock returns. Three strands of research make different predictions about how R&D affects stock prices. The agency theory, presented by Jensen (1986) argues that managers do not make a corporate decision on behalf of shareholders and rather pursue their personal benefits by undertaking value-reducing projects such as R&Ds. The overconfidence theory suggests that overconfident managers tend to invest more in R&D because they overvalue their ability and they are excessively optimistic about future success of the R&D investment. These two theories predict that firms that invest more in R&D earn lower returns than those that invest less. In contrast, the signaling theory predicts that high-quality firms use R&D spending as a means of communicating with the stock market to mitigate information asymmetry problem, resulting in higher returns of the firms. Using data from Korean firms listed from January 1992 to December 2015 we showed that portfolios that invested heavily in R&D earn consistently high abnormal returns and that, consequently, spending on R&D is an effective explanatory factor for stock returns. We also found that the impact R&D expenditures has on stock value was long-term, as well as short-term. Overall, these results are consistent with the signaling theory in that R&D spending is an important channel through which firms improve their values by communicating with the stock market.

In this chapter, we discuss the moral hazard. We make a point that it is a concept that cannot be separated from the adverse selection, which is a problem that stems from information asymmetry. Further, we looked at the two ways in which management literature has suggested to manage asymmetric information, adverse selection and moral hazard. These are the accounting framework and the agency theory. In looking at the agency theory as a mitigating factor to the question of asymmetric information, adverse selection and moral hazard, we make a point that the accounting framework and the theory do not resolve the question of asymmetric information, adverse selection and, subsequently, the question of the moral hazard. In our view, the reason this solution would have difficulties in mitigating asymmetric information, adverse selection, and subsequently, the question of the moral hazard lies in the fact that the decision whether to disclose material facts or not is dependent on one economic agent. If this agent is of the view that they could gain some advantage over their counterparties, in our view, it will be unlikely that there will be a disclosure of such information. In examining the conceptual framework of accounting, we note that the IAS is asking that the economic agent should work against maximizing what he/she could potentially gain. Our view in this regard is that the IAS appears to be appealing to the conscience or ethics that economic agents should do what is morally correct. This is clear from the use of the word "fair". We are of the view that AI will outperform the mitigation actions put forward by the finance and accounting literature, the agency theory and the conceptual framework. With AI, there is no need to rely on economic agents to be "fair" by disclosing material information. There is also no need to persuade economic agents by incentives of disclosing material information or coercing them with threats of penalties. (c) 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

In this chapter, we discuss the concept of adverse selection, which is a problem that stems from the information asymmetry where a strategic behaviour by the more informed counterparty in a contract works against the interest of the less informed counterparties. We looked at the two ways in which management literature has suggested that it is used to manage this, both the accounting framework and the agency theory. We observe that in the agency theory, certain scholars have suggested that there should be penalties or incentives so that transparent behaviour is promoted to limit the agency problem. Our conclusion in this regard, is that the action whether to disclose material facts or not is still dependent on one economic agent expected to be unlikely in a situation where the disclosure of such information has a potential to reduce economic benefits to that particular economic agent. On the IAS Conceptual Framework, we observe that it appears to be appealing to the conscience or ethics that economic agents should do what is morally correct, which is clear from the use of the word "fair". The challenge of this approach is whether the economic agent could be persuaded to do what is fair in the face of potential economic losses should they cede certain strategic advantages associated with having certain information that counterparties in the transaction do not have. The era of intense automation and digitization is likely going to push economic agents to some new forms of relationships. This could include sharing certain information that opens the opportunity for harvesting and storing big data that could be useful to economic agents. AI brings the possibility of building, linking and analysing this new big data sets that would otherwise be impossible for a human being, thus reducing the extent of adverse selection.

Orientation: Executive pay has been increasing; however, company performance has not been increasing proportionally. This could be due to an agency problem, resulting in executive pay not aligning with the shareholders' desired company performance. Research purpose: The purpose of this research was to establish if there was a relationship between the total pay of the chief executive officer and their company's financial performance in South African Schedule 2 state-owned entities (SOEs). Motivation for the study: A review of literature revealed conflicting views regarding the relationship between executive pay and company financial performance. There were limited studies conducted in South Africa, especially considering SOEs. Research approach/design and method: This research was a quantitative, archival study using 8 years of secondary data from South African Schedule 2 SOEs. Spearman's rank-order correlation was used to evaluate the relationship. Main findings: One significant weak positive relationship was observed when considering the net profit or loss metric of financial performance. Hence, there was no conclusive relationship between executive pay and company financial performance, which supported the proposition that there is an agency problem in South African SOEs. Practical/managerial implications: There is a distinct need for an all-encompassing SOE legislation framework to standardise pay structure and reporting requirements. Additionally, accurate measures of performance are necessary to overcome the agency problem. Contribution/value-add: This research adds to the limited knowledge base regarding the relationship between executive pay and company financial performance in South African SOEs. It also identified the need to incorporate non-financial metrics to influence executive pay. (c) 2020. The Authors.

Motivated by the agency theory and the need to examine the effect of separation of ownership and management, this study examines the determinants of profitability in different firm ownership structures and how different ownership structures impact the profitability of listed firms between 2003 and 2013, using pooled annual data of 23 Ghanaian listed firms. Employing a number of static models (OLS, Random Effects and 3 Stage Least Squares), we find evidence that while profit determinants vary for listed firms given their ownership structures, ownership structures also affected profitability differently. Specifically, for listed firms, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, financial risk, age and GDP; for non-family owned listed firms, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, market share and age; for foreign-owned firms, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, age and GDP; and for non-foreign ownership, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, financial risk, growth, age and GDP. When we examine the impact of ownership structure on profitability and find that family-owned listed firms make 30% less profits compared to non-family owned ones, whilst foreign-owned firms make 13% more profits than non-foreign owned ones. These findings confirm the agency theory which posits that separation of ownership and management, though may lead to agency problems, can positively affect profits. The study recommends that family-owned listed firms should consider diluting ownership in order to grow more profits. (c) 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

Part-time and temporary employees and contractors become a major cybersecurity threat for organizations due to the ephemeral nature of their engagement. Compared with full-time employees, they may be less commited to the welfare of the organization and, therefore, less willing to engage in security recommendations to protect it. Perceived psychological ownership is an important factor that shapes employees' security behaviors. The endowment effect also explains employees' tendencies to overvalue information that belongs to them, and conversely, extend fewer protections to information that they view as belonging to others. Thus, employees may be more motivated to safeguard their own information than organizational information. From a principle-agent perspective, this study investigates how three types of employees perceive organizational and personal information, and how different employees make decisions about protecting their own versus organizational information.

Some leading economists maintain that corporate managers have no social responsibilities other than to maximize profits and obey the law. To support that thesis, they rely, in part, on the agency theory of the firm. The theory provides that managers are agents of shareholders and must do what shareholders want, which is generally to make as much money as possible. For purposes of this article, I accept that managers are agents of shareholders, but I reject the conclusion that the relationship dilutes their moral obligations. Managers, as agents, cannot justify immoral decisions on the grounds that their shareholders direct their actions. Similarly, shareholders, as principals, lack moral bases to authorize managers to take actions the shareholders could not justify taking themselves. I apply this thesis to the ethical challenges managers of government contracting businesses face when they consider whether to make independent political expenditures. I argue that where it is in the interests of government contractors to publicly disclose, limit, or forego making independent political expenditures, they can legally do so, and that in the absence of financial advantage or legal obligation, agency theory highlights the ethical obligations of shareholders and their managers agents. It does not grant them an ethical free pass. (c) 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review and systematize previous studies on boards of directors in Brazil and propose an agenda to guide future studies. Originality/value: A conceptual model is developed to provide an integrated view for research on the board of directors, incorporating variables from different levels that connect governance mechanisms, best practices, board dynamics and company performance; we identified gaps for the research agenda. Design/methodology/approach: This review analyzed 95 articles on boards of directors in Brazil between 2000 and 2019. The review was conducted in three major steps: 1. planning; 2. conducting; and 3. organizing the data and reporting the findings. Findings: There is a growing interest in studying boards of directors in Brazil, with a wide range of topics. The most studied are board composition, best practices, diversity and gender. Despite the diversity, the previous studies are homogeneous in theoretical and methodological terms. Based on the agency theory, most articles sought to relate board demography to financial performance, and the findings are not convergent. This scenario opens up some research avenues to address topics that have not yet been explored, such as board processes, board tasks, and differentiation between board performance and company performance.

Internationalization of companies challenges management accounting. Agency Theory and Contingency Theory are employed as theoretical lenses to explore responsibilities of management accountants and requirements linked to internationalization. 247 job advertisements are analyzed and document the impact of internationalization, country specifics and cultural distance. Increasing management support and collaboration in internal control systems complement the tasks of management accountants in multinational companies (MNCs). Management accountants in MNCs should have international experience, a university degree and communication skills. Implications for research and practice conclude the paper.

This chapter aims to set the ground, providing a brief definition of the corporate governance according to worldwide practices and focusing on the role and the functions of the board of directors. To reach this goal, a punctual review of the different theoretical frameworks coping with this topic is provided, putting in evidence the main differences as well as the principal points in common. Specifically, the agency theory, the stakeholder theory, the stewardship theory, the resource dependence theory, and the institutional theory are analysed. Moreover, the role of BoDs is analysed together with the features and the overview of "good" corporate governance practices according to existing literature and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

In Australia, initial public offering (IPO) firms not satisfying profit or asset tests are permitted to list on the securities exchange with mandatory lockups (MLs) imposed on insiders' shares. We investigate whether such lockups, and the lockup periods, are associated with underpricing. We find that the incremental effect of the association between longer ML periods and higher underpricing is stronger for firms with higher insiders' equity ownership subject to MLs relative to firms with lower insiders' equity ownership subject to MLs. This suggests that the extent and length of insiders' equity ownership subject to MLs convey information regarding IPO firms' risk. We also find that good corporate governance reduces IPO underpricing for firms with MLs. It moderates the IPO underpricing for firms with higher and longer insiders' equity ownership subject to MLs. Our findings are informative for regulators in understanding how MLs can assist in allowing smaller and younger firms with inadequate financial strength and performance to publicly raise equity capital, while morally protecting investors and preserving market integrity.

If board-level controls matter, the introduction of the 2008 Companies Act with its enhanced legislative requirements, should have a positive impact on firm performance. To assess board-level controls this study developed two unique control indexes to assess the boards of 84 companies over three years. The study focuses on companies on the SRI index as they have a greater focus on sustainability and transparent disclosure of board-level controls including separation of duties, monitoring, goal-aligned remuneration and oversight. The first index uses 23 board-level control indicators (CI) and the second 19 board-level direction indicators (DI). The two indexes were assessed using fixed effects estimation methods against current and negatively lagged firm performance proxies. Results show that board-level controls matter as both indexes were positively related to return on assets (RoA), however, only DI was highly significant. Both indexes changed to a negative relationship to next year's return on assets (NYRoA), again highly significant for DI. The change to a negative relationship suggests a timing and information asymmetry problem. CI was positively related to the natural log of enterprise value per share (LEV) with a low level of significance while the positive relation continues to the next year's natural log of enterprise value per share (LNYEV) that was highly significant. The latter suggests that the controlling role of the board are continued to be valued by the market. (c) 2019 South African Journal of Accounting Research.

The study aimed to investigate the extent and level of risk management disclosures of listed companies in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), and to examine the relationship between risk management disclosures and financial performance. Using quota sampling, 160 firms were used as the samples. Content analysis by word counting was used to quantify risk management disclosures in corporate annual reports during 2017 to 2019, while financial performance and corporate characteristics were collected from samples' websites. Descriptive analysis, correlation matrix, and panel data analysis by pooled OLS regression were used to analyze data. As the results, the study found that the average level of risk management disclosures in annual reports of Thai listed companies during 2017 to 2019 were 2226.11 words. In more details, operational risk management disclosure was the most common disclosure following by following by financial risk, legal and regulatory risk, contingency risk, and major shareholder risk. Moreover, the study found the positive relationship between major shareholder risk management disclosure and financial performance, while financial risk management disclosure had negative influenced on financial performance. The study demonstrated agency theory that can be used to explain risk management disclosures in Thailand where the disclosures were not mandatory reporting yet. (c) 2020. All Rights Reserved.

The executive compensation issue continues to cause protest due to the increasing number of cases of an unjustifiably high level of pay. The main conflict arises from the misalignment of interests between the short-term expectations of the manager and long-term needs of the shareholders. Since there are no universal rules on how to price the executive performance companies reach for different means of establishing the CEO's compensation and ascertaining manager's commitment towards maintaining a company's value. The issue becomes more complex once the compensation rules are not a direct effect of the market power game but are additionally restricted by government. The aim of the paper is to discuss corporate government policies introduced in Israel and their impact on executive compensation level and structure. Israel is amongst those countries that partially regulate CEO compensation and thus the Israeli experience can add to the understanding of the effectiveness of modern corporate governance.

From the traditional agency theory perspective, managers may hide rent extraction through tax aggressiveness and social responsibility activities. Existing theories propose that greater managerial ownership generates greater alignment of the interests of managers and shareholders and thus reduces the agency costs. On the other hand, increasing managerial ownership may entrench managers, causing agency conflicts between the controlling owner who is also the manager and minority shareholders. Using a sample of Taiwanese listed companies from 2010 to 2016, this study investigates whether socially responsible firms are less or more tax aggressive, and whether this relationship will be impacted by managerial ownership. This study finds that firms with high CSR have higher effective tax rates, supporting the stakeholder theory. In addition, this study finds that firms with higher managerial ownership are less tax aggressive, consistent with the alignment effect argument. This study finds only limited evidence that managerial ownership has a moderating effect on the negative relation between CSR and tax aggressiveness. However, when managers own a significant equity ownership, this study finds no evidence that managerial ownership moderates the negative relationship between CSR and tax aggressiveness. This suggests that owner-managers might increase CSR activities to mask their rent extraction through tax aggressive activities. Copyright (c) 2020 Journal of Accounting Review. All rights reserved.

Purpose-This study aims to explore the main factors that could be used to determine the financing structure for companies listed in Amman Stock Exchange in Jordan. The hypotheses were developed in light of three theories relating financing structure, trade-off theory (TOT), agency theory and pecking order theory (POT). Design/methodology/approach-The study using unbalanced panel data sample applying regression models for two-dimensions combines cross-sectional and time series for non-financial Jordanian companies listed in ASE over the period 2014-2018. Using standard models include entering a fixed effect, random effect, or not using any effect. Findings-The findings showed that company size, growth opportunities, and tax-deductible items other than interest have a positive effect on the borrowing, but profitability affects negatively on borrowing. These results are consistent with the arrangement theories (trade-off theory (TOT) and pecking order theory (POT). indicating the factors associated with trade-off theory were stronger than what is usually found in developed countries, and this is an indication of deep problem resulted from asymmetry information in the Jordanian market. which require to focus efforts on how to building the confidence with investors by providing the data that serve them in decision making. This needs to develop the accounting profession which will open the future for an active market for bonds and stocks that serve companies to financing their projects, and not only for speculation. Practical implications-The results detected how to constitute the suitable financial structure and how making a balance between sources of finance. Also detected weakens role of companies managers and ASE regulators, which require to focusing efforts to improving information deloused to users. Originality/value-limited number researches which have been discuss this issue. Therefore, this study extensively contributes to the shortage literature on the perceived the main factors that may effect on financial structure.

I investigate bank loans to takeover targets considering the simultaneous decision of pricing, maturity, collateral, and covenants applying Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Results are largely in line with the Agency Theory of Covenants (ATC) as pricing for new bank debt is lower given greater collateral and covenant protection, consistent with existing literature on public debt. However, poor performing targets demonstrate a positive relationship between pricing and covenants while bank loans to high performers are consistent with ATC predictions. Finally, loan terms tied to ex post observations of merger outcomes suggest banks possess some knowledge of merger outcomes in advance. (c) 2019 University of New Orleans

This study provides evidence about how stockholders control insiders using dividend policy to prevent overinvestment. This study observes the dividend yield, market risk, profitability, and growth opportunities of 155 public firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2010 to 2017. The dividend yield data were split into quartiles and categorized into the following areas: 1) firms with the lowest dividend yields, 2) firms with lower dividend yields, 3) firms with higher dividend yields, and 4) firms with the highest dividend yields. This study conducts multinomial regression for testing the hypotheses. The results confirm that systematic risk has an insignificant relationship with dividend policy, and profitability has a significant relationship with dividend policy. Consistent with agency theory in supporting free cash flow theory, this study finds that the agency problem exists for firms with high dividend yields relative to firms with low dividend yields in the context of Indonesian public firms. The systematic risk has an insignificant relationship with dividend policy, of which the study sample is limited. The findings also imply that stockholders tend to control insiders in case of overinvestment. Besides, this study also finds that market risk as a systematic risk is insignificant both for firms with high and low dividend yields. (c) The author(s) 2020.

The goal of this secondary literature review was to explore two questions through the frame of the Technology Acceptance Model, Technology Innovation and Diffusion Model, Agency Theory, and additional background literature. First, while there are several obvious reasons to adopt a medical implant for quality of life purposes, could the election to implant a non-medically necessary spread through the Technology Innovation and Diffusion model?

This study aims to examine determinants of intellectual capital disclosures of financial institutions in an emerging economy. The study constructs an intellectual capital disclosure index (ICDI) based on the disclosure of intellectual capital information in the annual reports of 53 listed financial institutions in Bangladesh. The study applies both parametric and non-parametric tests to examine the relationship of different company characteristics with ICDI. Results suggest that profitability and riskiness of firms are important determinants of intellectual capital disclosures. These findings support regulators and policy makers for deepening their understanding about the intellectual capital disclosure strategy of financial institutions. This study also contributes to the theoretical understanding of intellectual capital reporting by highlighting limitations of agency theory in explaining the relationship between different company characteristics and intellectual capital disclosure in the context of financial institutions of Bangladesh.

This study takes advantage of a natural experiment to detect the existence of earnings management and identify some of the regulatory and institutional factors that might contribute to it. A panel dataset of 1322 firm-year observations of non-financial firms listed at the Amman Stock Exchange is investigated. The results suggest that the capital market regulations of Jordanian firms have spurred managers to use adjusted earnings to remain trading in the first market, as well as convert from the second to the first market. It also finds that the level of discretionary accruals is reduced significantly with the passage of the corporate governance code. This study supports positive accounting theory by adding new evidence to the ongoing debate about how governmental regulations may create an incentive for firms to manipulate their earnings. It also corroborates the assumptions of agency theory and extends its application to some developing capital markets. Copyright (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The main objective of this research paper is to examine the impact of board size and ownership concentration, representing corporate governance mechanisms, on agency costs in large Croatian companies. Furthermore, debt financing and firm growth are examined because those variables also have impact on agency costs. Agency theory defines a framework for the potential issue of the separation of ownership and management as well as for the conflict between stakeholders (principals) and managers (agents). The most significant principal-agent problems are agency costs, but they do not have a directly quantifiable value; hence, in this research paper, the asset turnover ratio is used as the approximation. Therefore, this research will empirically test the significance of the impact of board size, ownership concentration, debt financing and firm growth on agency cost in the observed period from 2014 to 2018 using panel data analysis. This research was conducted with large Croatian companies using data and information from official annual accounts primarily to ensure objectivity, standardization and comparability. Specifically, the analysis was conducted on 219 companies operating in two main categories of economic activity: Manufacturing (C) and Wholesale and retail trade (G). The results indicate that board size has a significant but negative impact on agency costs. The results also indicate that debt and growth have a significant and negative impact on agency costs. Ownership concentration was not found to have significant impact. (c) 2020, University of Rijeka. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This study proposes a qualitative analysis to identify takeover target criteria according to French Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: A principal component factor analysis, applied to responses from 42 French M&A practitioners, highlighted four factors that summarize information about predictive variables and which explain the occurrence of takeover. Findings: According to the surveyed practitioners, four main axes explain 83% of the occurrence of takeover. These axes reflect motivations related to the undervalued target theory, synergy theory and agency theory. The first factor defined by the size of the company, its rate of return and turbulence in the sector. A second factor opposed market value and dividend payout ratio to the liquidity variable. The last two factors are called the debt factor, structured by the debt variable and the value creation factor, which opposed the value creation variable and transaction volume to the growth opportunities variable. The results therefore confirmed the importance of some predictor variables tested in previous studies and showed different results. Research limitations/implications: This study was limited in terms of sample size. The low number of responses obtained reflects the sensitivity of the subject, insofar as it highlights the predictive model used by M&A practitioners (professional secrecy). Future investigations will involve in extending the questionnaire approach to a larger sample of continental European M&A practitioners. Originality/value: Predicting takeover targets has been the subject of abundant literature. The results do not converge and are sometimes contradictory. This paper undertakes a field study conducted using a questionnaire survey to detect predictive variables used by M&A practitioners in their identification of a target firm. The authors aim to identify a relevant indicators favorable to the occurrence of a takeover bid and which are/or not handled by the literature. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the relevance of board independence to stock return volatility for a sample of 160 companies listed on the Vietnamese stock market over ten years (2008-2017). After controlling for potential endogeneity, we find that the presence of non-executive directors on the board tends to increase firm risk. The results indicate that non-executive directors do not play a supervisory role under the agency theory. Our findings remain robust when we apply alternative measures of the dependent variable.

The Asian financial crisis in 1997 has gained a public attention on the importance of corporate governance. Several reforms have been undertaken, especially in strengthening the boards of director's composition to ensure the board of director's function is delivered efficiently. Thus, the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG) codified the best practices that could enhance the corporate performance. Using the agency theory as a theoretical lens, this study examines the relationship between board independence, CEO duality, board size and directors' remuneration on firm performance, based on two measurements, namely Return on Assets (ROA) and Tobin's Q following MCCG 2012. The 100 samples of annual reports were randomly selected from the Bursa Malaysia website for the year end 2013. Results from the multiple regression analysis reveal that CEO duality and directors' remuneration were found to have a significant relationship with firm performance when measured using Tobin's Q. None of the independent variables have a significant relationship with firm performance using Return on Assets as the proxy for accounting measure. The result reveals that there is a negatively significant relationship between firm size and firm performance. Findings would assist the committee of MCCG2012 and other authorities to reinforce on the corporate governance compliance and good practice. (c) 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

This review has conceptualised the integration of corporate governance (CG) and intellectual capital (IC) as strategic tools for enhancing sustainability initiative (SI) locally and internationally by scholars and practitioners. Since, CG tools are institutional factors required to prolong the life span of corporate organisations, then IC can further play a boundless role in ensuring the resourceful and effective transformation of the firms at large. The resource-based view, institutional, agency and stakeholder theories or a mix of them can be adopted for empirical study purposes. This study opines that there might be a direct relationship between CG and SI and IC and SI on one hand, and the mediating role of IC in the relationship between CG and SI on the other hand to examine the indirect and total effects which are suggested be tested using the covariance based-structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) technique.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to test various hypotheses regarding if managers' voluntarily prefer honesty in self-reported managerial performance (HPR). Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an experimental approach with a data set of 300 Ghanaian employees. Findings: The results confirm that the current trend where employee contracts are underpinned by the classical agency theory (CAT) is problematic, ineffective and costly because it does not appropriately explain the observed behaviour of honesty and partial honesty in self-reported performance or the dishonesty in reporting performance when there is no financial reward to be gained by employees. Therefore MNCs may benefit from a consideration of wider and alternative perspectives. Additionally, stakeholders must consider a strategy of delaying performance-related bonuses (pay-offs) to improve HPR and avoid capping performance-related pay off with an arbitrary threshold. This is because the setting of arbitrary thresholds reduces the established relationship between effort and reward and introduces gaming into the managerial performance reporting process. Originality/value: Unlike other prior studies that rely on students as surrogates for employees, this study uses actual employees to test the experimental constructs. Aside from the comparatively large data set, this study is the first exploration of the differential effects of national characteristics on HPR in Ghana. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Within the realm of corporate finance, IPO (refers to the process of offering shares of corporation to the public for the first time) companies in Malaysia received little attention from the academic scholarly works. An important area of inquiry for IPO companies is to investigate the board characteristics impact on dividend initiation. With use of the agency theory principles, four argumentative hypotheses were proposed. The current study used a pooled cross-sectional data with a total sample size of 372 companies listed in the Malaysian Stock Market. The results of this study revealed that the independence of board and the size of board were found to have a positive and significant impact on the decision to initiate dividend for IPO companies. However, multi-seats were found to have a negative and significant impact on the decision to initiate dividend. But, CEO duality were found to be irrelevant to the decision of initiating dividend.

In accordance with agency theory, effective board of directors plays a key role in establishing good corporate governance and enhancing firm performance by mitigating earnings management. Based on panel data set drawn from Tunisian listed firms over the period 2011 - 2017 and while using dynamic panel GMM estimator to alleviate endogeneity problems, a U-shaped relationship was found between board size, board independence and firm performance. Indeed, results show that a higher firm performance is confirmed if the board size is composed of at least 6 members and 15% of independent board members. For a robustness check, this study measures a composite score of the effectiveness of board of directors to capture the aggregate impact of board's effectiveness on firm performance. The findings of regression analysis find a significant positive relationship between the board effectiveness score and firm performance. Indeed, there is a synergy between mechanisms that act together to enhance firm performance in the Tunisian context. Copyright (c) 2020. Mejda DAKHLAOUI And Imen FREDJ.

There is a growing interest in assessing environmental performance, social responsibility, and corporate governance (ESG) in the banking sector. Also, significant relationships are expected between ESG dimensions and corporate financial performance. The purpose of this research is to analyze the relationships between ten dimensions of the environmental, social, and governance pillars and bank financial performance, for the decade after the 2008 financial crisis. Data was collected from the Refinitiv database for 39 European banks, for the period 2010-2019. Our results show a positive relationship between emission reductions and financial performance. However, a bank's accounting and market performance may be at odds with its product quality and social responsibility policies. Moreover, an increase in the quality of a bank's corporate governance system was found to negatively affect company financial performance. Our results have multiple theoretical implications. The predictions related to stakeholder theory and the resource-based view were confirmed, as banks show interest in resource efficiency, environment-aware products and services, and process digitization. On the other hand, the prediction of stakeholder theory regarding the positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance was rejected. Also, corporate governance quality has a negative contribution to accounting performance and market valuation, going against the hypotheses of agency theory. This could mean that market investors do not value a bank's involvement in social responsibility initiatives and do not endorse the adoption of best governance practices that could reduce the riskiness of a bank's portfolio. These findings have practical implications for bank managers and company boards in selecting and disclosing ESG policies and initiatives. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

The limits of financial disclosure in meeting the investors' needs have led to the request for reporting frameworks capable of incorporating information of different nature. Integrated reporting (IR), which is the latest novelty in organisational reporting practice, promises to bring together material financial and non-financial information. IR has received considerable academic attention in recent years. However, little attention has been paid to the role of the audit committee in IR processes, despite the influence that this body has on disclosure, thanks to its supervisory and monitoring functions. This study bridges this gap by analysing the effect of the audit committee attributes on integrated reporting quality (IRQ) from an agency theory perspective. The regression analysis, conducted on a sample of 125 international firms, demonstrated a positive effect of size, independence and meeting frequency of the audit committee on IRQ and a non-significant effect of financial expertise.

The objective of this study is to examine empirically the impact of good corporate governance on financial performance of United Kingdom non-financial listed firms. Agency theory and stewardship theory serve as the bases of a conceptual model. Five corporate governance mechanisms are examined on two financial performance indicators, return on assets and Tobin's Q, employing cross-sectional regression methodology. The conclusion drawn from empirical test so performed on 252 firms listed on London Stock Exchange for the year 2014 indicates a positive or a negative relationship, but also sometimes no effect, of corporate governance mechanisms impact on financial performance. The implications are discussed. Thereby, so distinguishing effects due to causes, we present a proof that, when the right corporate governance mechanisms are chosen, the finances of a firm can be improved. The results of this research should have some implication on academia and policy makers thoughts. (c) 2020 The Authors.

We critically review the literature on state-owned multinationals to clarify previous arguments and guide future studies. The content analysis of prior research reveals that state-owned firms differ from private firms in their internationalization: they are motivated by national strategic objectives, select more challenging countries, and use acquisitions more intensively despite adverse market reactions. The analysis also reveals conflicting predictions on the level of internationalization; some studies find that state-owned multinationals internationalize more while others find the contrary. We introduce one solution to these conflicts by classifying theories into two camps based on the balance between the costs and benefits of state ownership. One camp suggests a disadvantage of stateness (agency theory, resource dependence theory, and neo-institutional theory). Another camp promotes an advantage of stateness (economic development, resource-based view, and institutional economics). We conclude by outlining three promising relationships in the study of these firms: (1) relationships internal to state-owned multinationals and the balancing of stakeholder demands; (2)relationships between state-owned multinationals and government and the influence of the political system; and (3) relationships between home and host country governments and the impact of their dynamics on state-owned multinationals.

At present, many economies are suffering from environmental problems that have significant effects on the climate and life of human beings, thus, the governments and institutions work to reduce the industrial negative effects on the environment. Based on the Porter Hypothesis, agency theory, and management and organization theory, this study examines the connection between environmental regulations, corporate social responsibility and firm innovation with the moderating role of CEO power and ownership concentration. Importantly, this study divided CEOs into male and female CEO. This study classifies firm innovation into two kinds, such as firm input innovation and firm output innovation. This study selects the sample of Pakistani manufacturing firms and uses the panel data for the period 2008 to 2018. For the analysis purpose, this study employs ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed-effect (FE) model, generalized method of moments (GMM). For more robust results, this study employs the feasible generalized least square (FGLS) model. Based on the findings from the empirical analysis, this study concludes that environmental regulations and corporate social responsibility have a positive relationship with firm innovation (Input and Output). Moreover, a powerful CEO and ownership concentration are valuable for firm innovation (Input and Output), because these factors are positively connected with firm innovation (Input and Output). Majorly, this study contends that environmental regulations and corporate social responsibility are positively connected with firm innovation (Input and Output) because of the interactive role of CEO power. This study supported the role of both male and female CEOs for firm innovative practices. Therefore, firms of developing economies should also consider the female CEO. Besides, environmental regulations and corporate social responsibility also positively connected with firm innovation (Input and Output) because of the interactive role of ownership concentration. Moreover, this study offers various policy implications for governments and policymakers. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

We examine the relative merits of state (SOE) and private (POE) ownership on firm invention output in emerging as well as developed economies. Firm SOE affords a vehicle by which governments throughout the world encourage risky investment in new technological paths. Yet, from a traditional agency-theoretical standpoint, SOEs are plagued by low-powered incentives and dysfunctional involvement (e.g., wasteful budgets and political meddling), which reduces SOE performance, relative to POEs. To examine this paradox, we build an extended agency model which, rather than overlooking agency cost drivers, entertains a more balanced view, in which these so-called agency "liabilities" in fact benefit SOEs, particularly in the sphere of inventions. We argue that, given relatively higher levels of managerial autonomy, SOEs may outperform POEs in some types of inventive output. We further propose that key boundary conditions operate to modify this base effect, in that contexts lacking political constraints - a condition found in most emerging economies - increase the risk of political meddling, reducing managerial autonomy so that any SOE inventive advantages wane significantly. We also hypothesize that this negative effect of weak institutions is attenuated in high invention productivity sectors. Empirically, we track the frequency, pioneerism, and impact of patent inventions of 521 SOEs and matched POEs for 16 years, across 43 countries and 22 industries. We find empirical support for our hypotheses based on a robust set of fixed-effects regression analyses, aided by a battery of checks to assess self-selection and omitted variable bias.

Corporate governance is being acknowledged by almost all kinds of business communities and firms as an ultimate driver to improve the firm financial performance. This study examined the association between corporate board structure and corporate financial performance using a dynamic panel model. Principles of corporate governance deliver an explicit board structure for the purpose to facilitate the board members, which helps in making good decisions. The board of directors consists of the CEO, the chairman, the internal directors, and the external non-executive directors to work for the shareholders. This study undertakes different corporate governance attributes including non-executive directors, board size, and CEO duality and examines its effect on firm performance. The dynamic panel model is used, and preestimation and postestimation tests were conducted for the validity of the model. This study found a significant effect of board size, CEO duality, and non-executive directors on firm performance. The findings show that most of the governance variables are endogenous by nature. Results are consistent with agency theory. This study provides the theoretical and empirical evidence and applies a superior model (dynamic panel model) to better explain the association between corporate board structure and corporate firm performance in listed firms.

The study aimed to (1) investigate the extent, level and pattern of environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure in annual report of listed companies in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), (2) to examine the different level of ESG disclosure between groups of interest in terms of board composition and corporate characteristic, and (3) to test the influence of board composition on ESG disclosure of Thai listed companies. Population was all listed companies in the SET. Using annual reports during 2015-2019, content analysis by word counting was used to quantify the extent, level and pattern of ESG disclosure, while board composition was measured by board size, board meeting, female board committee, audit committee, nomination committee, compensation committee, CSR committee, remuneration, CEO compensation, and board compensation. Descriptive analysis, independent sample t test, correlation matrix, and multiple regression were used to analyze the data of this study. The most common ESG disclosure was governance information disclosure following by social and environmental information disclosures. There was an increase of ESG disclosure in annual reporting during 2015-2019 by listed companies in the SET. Moreover, there was a significantly different level of ESG disclosure between groups of audit committee, nomination committee, compensation committee, CSR committee, and firm size. Finally, there was a significantly positive influence of board size, female board, compensation committee, CSR committee, and remuneration on ESG disclosure, while there was a negative influence of audit committee and CEO compensation on ESG disclosure. Finding of possible influence of board composition on ESG disclosure can demonstrate that agency theory can be used to explain the reason of ESG disclosure by Thai listed companies, although the disclosure is still voluntary reporting in Thailand.

Purpose: This study explores the levels of and trends in corporate environmental disclosure (CED) among a sample of Sri Lankan listed companies from 2015 to 2019. Furthermore, this article examines the firm-level determinants of CED, including corporate governance (CG) mechanisms, in Sri Lanka from a multi-theoretical perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 205 firm-year observations, this paper distinctively applies a panel quantile regression (PQR) model to examine the determinants of CED in Sri Lanka. This method was supported by estimating a two-step generalized method of moment (GMM) model to tackle any possible existence of endogeneity concerns. Findings: The authors' findings indicate an increasing trend in CED practice among the sampled companies (i.e. 41 firms, the only adopters of the GRI framework) in Sri Lanka from 2015 to 2019. However, it is still considered at an early stage compared with other developed counterparts. Furthermore, this study suggests that board size, board independence, board meetings, industry type, profitability and firm size are positively associated with CED level. In contrast, and consistent with our expectation, CEO duality is negatively attributed to the disclosed amount of environmental information in the Sri Lankan context. Research limitations/implications: The authors' empirical evidence reiterates the crucial need to propagate and promote further substantive CG reforms, mandating CED in Sri Lanka. Originality/value: The authors' findings provide much-needed insights for indigenous companies, operating across similar emerging economies, to understand how CED can be incorporated into their reporting process based on the GRI framework in order to enhance their firm value, reduce legitimacy gaps and mitigate other operational risks.

Purpose: The prime objective of this study is to investigate the moderating influence of executive and independent female directors on the relationship between remuneration packages (CEO and executive director) and socially responsible practices (marketplace, environment, community, workplace and money spent on CSR) of 483 Malaysian listed firms during 2006-2017. Design/methodology/approach: The dynamic estimator, namely, system generalized method of moments (GMM) given by Blundell and Bond (1998) has been employed on the dataset to control dynamic endogeneity, unobserved heterogeneity and simultaneity problems. Findings: Findings indicate that there is a significant relationship between remuneration patterns of CEOs and executive directors and socially responsible activities. In the same way, executive board gender diversity significantly, whereas independent board gender diversity insignificantly moderates the remuneration and CSR nexus. Practical implications: This study is particularly significant for regulatory bodies of Malaysia, e.g. Securities Commission Malaysia, Bursa Malaysia, policy makers, investors and managers. For academia, this study fetches support from agency theory, stakeholder theory and upper echelons theory and presents integrated theoretical approach to be considered for future research. Originality/value: This paper is unique in providing empirical evidence on the moderating effect of both executive and independent women directors on the relationship between remuneration patterns of CEOs and executive directors and independent CSR activities for the first time. Moreover, this study has sourced several theoretical and practical implications. And, the study employs dynamic estimator for precise and concrete results. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study investigates the impact of ownership structure on the dividend policy in Jordan. In particular, it aims to uncover the effects of family ownership, institutional ownership, foreign ownership, and state ownership on dividend decisions for a sample of 66 Jordanian industrial and service firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) for the period 2014-2017. Tobit Panel Regression is used to test the hypotheses of the study. The results show a significant positive association between institutional ownership and dividend yield, while foreign ownership is associated with a less likelihood of paying dividends. No evidence is found to support that family ownership and state ownership have an impact on dividend yield. Hence, the study provides a clear evidence that high institutional ownership as an external control mechanism increases the need to pay dividends. The results also indicate that Jordanian listed firms have highly concentrated ownership structures and are mainly dominated by families followed by financial institutions, then foreign investors while the state shows relatively lower ownership. The study recommends that investors should take into account ownership structure when making investment decisions to help them choose the best investment opportunities. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

This study examines the extent of and determinants for sustainability assurance quality. Data comprise sustainability assurance statements published by the top 100 listed companies in Australia and New Zealand from 2017 to 2019. The findings indicate that Australian companies lead their New Zealand counterparts in sustainability assurance. Although sustainability reporting has risen, assurance rates remain significantly low. Accountants dominate the market, and companies prefer to use their own auditors for sustainability assurance work. Sustainability assurance quality is poor and does not vary significantly among Australian and New Zealand companies. Low-quality sustainability assurance plays a limited role in mitigating potential stakeholder-agency conflicts. The regression analysis indicates that audit committee characteristics such as members' independence, industry/market expertise, and attending meetings enhance sustainability assurance quality, whereas audit committee size has no affect. These findings suggest that audit committee characteristics such as independence, industry expertise, and regular meeting attendance have the potential to reduce stakeholder-agency conflicts by improving the quality of sustainability statement assurance. Our findings build on the sustainability assurance literature by exploring current trends in sustainability assurance practices in Australia and New Zealand where corporate governance codes have been recently revised. Further, these findings are timely given recent changes in standards (International Standard on Assurance Engagements [ISAE] 3000 and Global Reporting Initiative [GRI]). Our study contributes to the audit committee literature and sheds light on the role played by audit committee characteristics on sustainability assurance statement quality. The study findings potentially offer useful insights for practitioners, standard setters, and regulators. (c) 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Growing evidence suggests that gender diversity on boards of directors is important for corporate governance and overall organizational effectiveness. Yet, progress in increasing female board representation has been slow. Prior studies have focused primarily on either the role of organizational characteristics in board gender composition or the role of national institutions as predictors of female board representation across countries. In this study, we integrate psychological theory related to implicit biases and agency theory, with institutional theory, to propose that the national context for gender equality moderates the extent to which characteristics of organizational leadership relate to female board representation. We conduct a meta-analysis of 158 samples encompassing 60,648 organizations across 36 countries to test our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the importance of the national context for gender equality as a boundary condition for understanding the relationship between organizational leadership characteristics and female board representation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for increasing the representation of female directors across countries. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Corporate governance disclosures form a key part of a company's non-financial reporting. Several studies consider the determinants of corporate governance reporting, including external factors such as country-specific legislation and scandals, and internal factors such as financial performance, size and culture. Others consider the consequences of corporate governance reporting, using simple proxies for corporate governance mechanisms such as board composition characteristics to analyse the impact on financial reporting quality and company valuation. Yet the determinants and consequences of corporate governance reporting may be interlinked, and many quantitative studies fail to consider these links and their multiple effects adequately. Poor financial performance, for example, can be both a determinant and a consequence of the underlying governance mechanisms that corporate governance reporting aims to capture. The framework provided in this paper considers both the determinants and consequences of corporate governance and likely links between them, and also considers internal corporate governance mechanisms and the measures that are used as their proxies. In combining these three aspects of corporate governance and showing potential links, the framework offers insights into future research opportunities. The framework can be adapted to any country or organisational setting and also offers the opportunity to consider theories other than agency theory when studying corporate governance disclosures.

Purpose: This study examines the impact of intellectual capital efficiency and corporate governance mechanisms on the annual report readability of Oman's financial sector companies. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a sample of 150 firm-year observations of listed financial sector companies in the Muscat Securities Market, Oman, from 2014 to 2018. Flesch Reading ease and Flesch Kinkaid Index are used as proxies for annual report readability. As part of sensitivity analysis, the study also uses the natural logarithm of annual report pages as alternative readability measures. The investigation is conducted using random effects regression analysis and supported with system GMM estimation for robustness. Findings: The findings of this study demonstrate a decrease in intellectual capital efficiency associated with better readability of annual reports for the financial sector firms. Alternatively, banks report a positive association of intellectual capital efficiency with the Flesch Reading ease score of the annual report. The structural capital and capital employed efficiency are also found to be negatively associated with annual report readability. Corporate governance mechanisms such as dispersed ownership and audit committee size also result in easy-to-read annual reports that support agency theory. Research limitations/implications: The research was conducted for financial firms of Oman, and thereby the findings can be generalized to the financial sector of countries with similar settings, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Practical implications: The policy implications arising from this study suggest a strengthening of the intellectual capital efficiency and corporate governance mechanisms to improve the readability of the firms and thereby increase investor confidence. Originality/value: This paper's uniqueness is in the model used to investigate the impact of intellectual capital efficiency and corporate governance mechanisms on the annual report readability of an emerging market.

Research Summary: Using a principal-principal agency theory lens, we examine corporate governance and compensation design in family-owned businesses. We conceptualize how CEO pay and pay-performance sensitivity is influenced by whether the CEO is a professional or drawn from the controlling family (family CEO). Data from a sample of 277 publicly listed Indian family firms during 2004-2013 support our argument that family CEOs get paid more than professional CEOs. This pattern is stronger in superior-performing firms that are named after the controlling family (eponymous firms). Furthermore, family CEOs of superior-performing firms have higher pay-performance sensitivity compared to professional CEOs of other superior-performing firms. Our findings reveal nuanced heterogeneity in nepotism in emerging economy family firms--CEO compensation is a mechanism for some controlling families to tunnel corporate resources. Managerial Summary: We examine whether CEO compensation and its responsiveness to realized firm performance in Indian family firms in influenced by whether the CEO is a professional or drawn from the controlling family (family CEO). Data from a sample of 277 publicly listed Indian family firms during 2004-2013 suggests family CEOs get paid more than professional CEOs. This pattern is stronger in superior-performing firms that are named after the controlling family (eponymous firms). Furthermore, family CEOs' high compensation is unaffected by poor firm performance and is disproportionately boosted by superior firm performance. These results suggest that poor corporate governance allows some family controlled Indian firms to use CEO compensation as a mechanism to tunnel corporate resources in ways that hurt minority shareholders.

Agency theory predicts that institutional ownership plays an important role in monitoring corporate risk-taking. This study examines this ownership-risk taking linkage in Japan over the period 2007 and 2019. We proxy risk through measures of idiosyncratic risk, total risk, and market beta. We show that (relational) foreign institutional shareholdings (do not) induce corporate risk-taking, thereby mitigating (preserving) the managerial 'quiet life' in Japanese corporations. Using 2SLS analysis, the roles of institutional shareholders are robust to endogeneity concerns. Finally, we also confirm robustness using alternative accounting-based risk proxies such as the standard deviation of Tobin's Q and ROA. Our study implies that the monitoring of institutional shareholders is important in Japanese corporations whose top executives might be prone to seek a 'quiet life'.

Social entrepreneurs are often at the forefront of remedying complex societal issues by linking the entrepreneurial mindset with approaches to solving these systemic societal issues. We build upon existing notions regarding the field of social entrepreneurship and existing forms of social entrepreneurship while deepening the understanding of the different roles that social entrepreneurs must embody on a daily basis. Agency theory is used by identifying principal and agent factors underlying social entrepreneurship in terms of role stressors and role conflict. We outline varying types of social entrepreneurs and discuss role duality, an area with room for much exploration. We also identify and discuss problems for principals and agents within these types of social entrepreneurship. Thus we contribute to the literature (1) by extending on the types of social entrepreneurs, (2) by identifying the threats that social entrepreneurs face through an agency lens; namely the dual role that social entrepreneurs must embark upon, and (3) by describing the boundary conditions of the different social entrepreneur types, we link the potential challenges of social entrepreneurship with a deeper look into the growing domain that is social entrepreneurship.

This study investigates specifically the effects of institutional settings and risks on dividend payout policy for banks operate in an emerging market of Nigeria. The present study measures the risk by using financial, business, credit, and default risk at the bank-level and financial, economic, and political risk at the country level. To achieve the objective of this study, panel data random-effects Tobit estimation methodology is employed from the period 2007-2016. Findings reveal that the weak institutional settings lead Nigerian banks to pay out fewer dividends and set their payouts corresponding to the substitution agency model of dividends. Also, results show that Nigerian banks typically pay out more dividends in cases of growth opportunity as a substitute mechanism for mitigating agency problems and for establishing a good reputation. However, by strengthening the levels of investor protection, Nigerian bank managers prefer a low payout policy and are less probable to use dividend policies as a substitute mechanism. Moreover, except for the positive effect of default risk, findings show that the risks at the bank-level, in particular, business risk, and at the country level, particularly financial and economic risks, have a significant negative effect on dividend payouts. Results are robust to alternative estimation procedures and also document that global risk has a statistically significant negative impact on Nigerian banks' dividend payouts policy.

Infusing stakeholder agency theory with insights from behavioural agency theory, we describe a frame-dependent relationship between CEO stock option incentives and tax avoidance. Our theoretical framework highlights the role of competing shareholder demands in providing a salient reference point for a CEO contemplating the implications of tax avoidance for their stock option wealth. In a study of 2,573 publicly listed U.S. firms between 1993 and 2014, we show that the implications of CEO stock option incentives are contingent on whether the firm's effective tax rate is anticipated to be below or above the tax rate of peer firms - an outcome that the CEO can cast as balancing stakeholder demands. Consistent with our theoretical reasoning, we also show that, both above and below this reference point, the implications of option incentives for corporate tax avoidance are amplified by the level of activist institutional ownership and attenuated by the CEO's ability to unwind their bond with shareholders through hedging. In doing so, our study offers an impetus for a broader stakeholder approach to governance research examining CEO incentive alignment.

Motivated by the rising consensus that corporate engagement in climate change actions holds the key for society's transition into environmentally resilient economy, the study examines whether a firm's commitment to climate change action and its carbon risk exposure shape the firm's debt financing policy. Based on insights drawn from signaling, corporate reputation, and agency theories, we develop models that link corporate commitment to climate change actions and a firm's carbon risk exposure with its debt financing decisions. Using data drawn from S&P 500 companies, for years 2015 to 2019, we find a robust evidence that firms that engage in higher levels of commitment to climate change actions issue a higher proportion of debt with longer terms to maturity, even after controlling for their carbon risk exposure. However, we do not find a robust evidence corroborating an association between firms' carbon risk exposure and their debt financing policy. These findings are consistent with arguments that high-commitment firms enjoy positive reputation, better credit rating, and reduced agency and information asymmetry costs, allowing them to gain easier access to long-term debt markets.

This study examines the effects of executive gender diversity (EGD) and board gender diversity (BGD) on hotel financial performance in China based on the framework of the gender role, agency, and resource dependence theories. This research documents a negative effect of EGD and no significant effect of BGD on hotel financial performance. Moreover, the effect of EGD on hotel financial performance captured by return on equity (ROE) exhibits a U-shaped curve, with the profitability measure bottoming out at 21%. Our analysis also shows that a critical mass of 40% of EGD serves as a positive moderator for the EGD-ROE relationship. Beyond this point, gender-balanced executive groups evade negatives rooted in the gender role theory, enjoy positives drawn in the agency and resource dependence theories, and generate superior financial performance compared to all-male executive groups. This research offers important implications for human resource management and policy and regulation formulation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

This study aims to develop accounting standards, curriculums, and research to cope with the rapid development of big data. The study presents several potential convergence points between big data and different accounting techniques and theories. The study discusses how big data can overcome the data limitations of six accounting issues: financial reporting, performance measurement, audit evidence, risk management, corporate budgeting and activity-based techniques. It presents six exciting research questions for future research. Then, the study explains the potential convergence between big data and agency theory, stakeholders theory, and legitimacy theory. This theoretical study develops new convergence points between big data and accounting by reviewing the literature and proposing new ideas and research questions. The conclusion indicates a significant convergence between big data and accounting on the premise that data is the heart of accounting. Big data and advanced analytics have the potential to overcome the data limitations of accounting techniques that require estimations and predictions. A remarkable convergence is argued between big data and three accounting theories. Overall, the study presents helpful insights to members of the accounting and auditing community on the potential of big data. (c) 2021

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the moderating role of family involvement on the corporate social responsibility (CSR)-firm performance (FP) relationship in the US hospitality industry. Building on agency theory, this study examines how family ownership, management and board control influence the relationship between CSR and FP. Design/methodology/approach: To examine the moderating effect of family ownership, family management and family board control, this study adopts the two-way fixed-effects model and performs a panel regression analysis with robust standard errors. The sample period spans 1994-2018 and 565 firm-year observations are included. Findings: This study finds that the impact of CSR on FP is positively moderated by the extent of a firm's family member involvement. In specific, all three aspects of corporate governance (i.e. ownership, management and board control) positively moderate the relationship between CSR and FP. Research limitations/implications: Findings of this study yield several recommendations for hospitality managers, including shaping strategic decisions for implementing CSR, by providing a unique perspective that the involvement of founding family members can be helpful in enhancing firm value through CSR activities. Originality/value: This study sheds light on the further understanding of the CSR-FP link in the hospitality literature. In addition, this study provides practical guidelines for hospitality firms in the context of CSR by revealing possible advantages of strengthened founding family involvement.

Multi-family firms represent an important and complex type of family firm that is not as well understood as single-family firms. We develop a governance-based framework of the agency complexities in multi-family firms, theorizing that divergent family-centered noneconomic goals between the owning families create complex inter-family agency problems that are intensified by evolving family dynamics. We propose governance mechanisms that address these problems by limiting opportunistic behavior associated with the pursuit of noneconomic goals related to firm control, family altruism, social capital, and transgenerational succession. We then present a future research agenda that can expand our knowledge of multi-family firms. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

When should business-to-business firms encourage their salespeople to advocate for the customer in pricing negotiations? This research extends dual agency theory to the sales domain to address this question. In Study 1, the authors examine discount negotiations with secondary data from a major U.S. distributor. They find that the customer and seller both experience the most favorable outcomes when the salesperson advocates strongly for both parties; advocacy for either party alone is counterproductive. Study 2 confirms these results using matched survey, pricing, and profit data and demonstrates a key boundary condition: broad customer-seller ties enable the synergy between customer advocacy and seller advocacy by enhancing the firms' abilities to monitor the salesperson. In Study 3, experiments with business-to-business buyers replicate key findings and provide evidence for theorized mechanisms.

Although the business strategies of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are investigated theoretically and practically, their diffusion and features in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are not clearly described in the literature. This is in particular due to the recent transformation that member countries have been going through since the financial crisis of 2008 and the Arab Spring. Through shareholder maximization theory, agency theory, and the resource-based view we identified the reasons and characteristics of M&As in the Middle East and North Africa regions. Following a systematic literature review methodology, we identified 37 articles related to M&A in MENA countries published in peer-reviewed journals and reported in CABS ranking (Chartered Association of Business Schools). Based on this analysis, we map the extant literature on the topic and present an integrative framework of these features for future researchers to further explore and expand the boundaries of the domain.

This study investigates the impact of corporate performance and corporate governance on executive remuneration in a Chinese market setting. Using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation approach for a sample of 860 non-financial firms listed on Chinese Stock Exchanges over the 15 years period of 2004-2018, the study found a positive and significant association between corporate profitability and executive pay. The study further reports that ownership concentration is positively related to executive pay revealing an entrenchment effect i.e., collusion between large shareholders and top management. Consistent with managerial power and agency theory CEO duality exhibits a positive relationship with executive remuneration, while board size and board independence also reveal a positive association with executive pay, indicating board ineffectiveness in reducing managerial entrenchment. Interestingly, non-state-owned enterprises report a negative relationship of board size with executive remuneration which means non-state-owned enterprises with larger board size tend to reduce executive pay because they may have better control and monitoring. Following the managerial power propositions, CEO duality weakens the performance sensitivity of executive pay, but contrary to agency theory the impact of board independence on this sensitivity is in contrast and weakens the relationship of managerial pay and performance, making the independent director's role ambiguous.

Over the past few years, scholarly interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been increasing. However, research on the relationship between CSR and firm performance has revealed a complicated relationship. In this paper, we argue that part of the basis for the generally positive relationship between CSR and firm performance might come from a reduction in agency costs. Relying on behavioral agency theory, we construct a model in which CSR moderates the impact of the agency problem on specific firm outcomes, including firm performance, the use of stock options, and goodwill. Based on panel data of publicly traded U.S. firms from 1999 to 2013, we find support for that model. These findings suggest the role of CSR in improving corporate governance efficiency through mitigating agency problems inside the firm. (c) 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The choice for corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a strategic tool remains a debatable issue. While past studies suggest that the financial performance of a firm is the primary driver of CEO turnover; we found that a firm's CSR performance also has a relationship with CEO turnover, a negative relationship. Consistent with the hypotheses, our findings suggest that firm's CSR performance positively moderates the firm's financial performance-CEO turnover relationship. The firm's negative CSR performance-CEO turnover relationship is more pronounced in highCSR-ranked firms. Precisely, the findings posit that CSR appears to (a) reduce likelihood of CEO turnover in general, (b) somewhat increases the likelihood of CEO turnover in case of poor financial performance, and (c) greatly reduces the likelihood of CEO turnover in case of better financial performance is good. Therefore, a CEO who is motivated to deliver profits in a socially responsible way may face both positive and negative personal consequences. Given the importance of the board gender diversity/gender critical mass, our findings show that the presence of gender critical mass moderates the firm's negative performance (CSR and ROA)-CEO turnover relationship. Further, we split the sample into low and highCSR-ranked firms, and the findings show that the presence of gender critical mass substitutes the firm's negative performance (CSR and ROA)-CEO turnover relation in highCSR-ranked firms; whereas, it moderates the relation in lowCSR-ranked firms. Therefore, the presence of gender critical mass supports the statement that "CSR--combined with board gender diversity--is the new competitive environment for CEOs.".

It is timely for Technological Forecasting and Social Change to have a special issue bringing together recent research about corporate governance and financing of under-researched young technological firms. These enterprises tend to have much wealth stored in intangible assets that are seldom easy to measure. With their typical asset base unlike that of established corporations in traditional sectors, their growth is also different, often with a great need for resources, including capital infusions to capture entrepreneurial opportunities at various times. These new entrants in innovative and high-tech markets are characterized by an insatiable appetite for external financing, and the intrusion of new types of external funders has a strong impact on the governance of these ventures. It is therefore essential to have appropriate methods to finance growth; this has major implications for governance as well as finance. Although research underpinning the phenomenon of alternative finance has been gaining ground, this is still a relatively under-researched field. This paper reviews relevant literature and presents an overview and brief synthesis of the contributions in this issue, within the context of literature and lacunae. (c) 2020

Purpose: Challenging the static view of family business governance, we propose a model of owner-manager relationships derived from the configurational analysis of managerial behavior and change in governance structure. Design/methodology/approach: Stemming from social exchange theory and building on the 4C model proposed by Miller and Le Breton-Miller (2005), we consider the evolving owner-manager relationship in four main configurations. On the one hand, we account for family businesses shifting from a generalized to a restricted exchange system, and vice versa, according to whether a family manager misbehaves in a stewardship-oriented governance structure or a nonfamily manager succeeds in building a trusting relationship in an agency-oriented governance structure. On the other hand, we consider that family firms will strengthen a generalized exchange system, rather than a restricted one, according to whether a family manager contributes to the stewardship-oriented culture in the business or a nonfamily manager proves to be driven by extrinsic rewards. Four scenarios are analyzed in terms of the managerial behavior and governance structure that characterize the phases of the relationship between owners and managers. Findings: Various factors trigger managerial behavior, making the firm deviate from or further build on what is assumed by stewardship and agency theories (i.e. proorganizational versus opportunistic behavior, respectively), which determine the governance structure over time. Workplace deviance, asymmetric altruism and patriarchy on the one hand, and proorganizational behavior, relationship building and long-term commitment on the other, are found to determine how the manager behaves and thus characterize the owner's reactions in terms of governance mechanisms. This enables us to present a dynamic view of governance structures, which adapt to the actual attitudes and behaviors of employed managers. Research limitations/implications: As time is a relevant dimension affecting individual behavior and triggering change in an organization, one must consider family business governance as being dynamic in nature. Moreover, it is not family membership that determines the most appropriate governance structure but the owner-manager relationship that evolves over time, thus contributing to the 4C model. Originality/value: The proposed model integrates social exchange theory and the 4C model to predict changes in governance structure, as summarized in the final framework we propose.

Evidence in the literature suggests that employees can engage in other types of creative behavior at work beyond producing something new and useful for their organization. This paper seeks to advance our understanding of these "atypical" creative behaviors. We conceptualize a typology that encompasses both the commonly studied form of employee creativity (conventional steward-type) and three other types of employee creativity that have not been previously theorized (critical steward-type, cunning agent-type, and innocent agent-type). We then advance a conceptual model to identify situations that may lead employees to use their creative potential one way versus another. Further, we examine the different implications of these creative behaviors for the organization, employee, and society. Our conceptual framework provides a broader perspective of workplace creativity in which a wider range of behaviors, mechanisms, and outcomes must be considered. It provides new directions for future research as well as implications for managing creativity in different organizational and cultural contexts. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Central to economic development is entrepreneurship. Using an agency theory lens, we seek to better understand how national policy can spur entrepreneurship. Guided by capitalist and socialist logic and ideals we investigate the direct and joint effects of market freedom and social spending national policies. In drawing from a sample of 19 countries spanning 2004-2010, we find that neither market freedom nor social spending alone positively impacts entrepreneurial activity; however, an interaction exists, as entrepreneurial activity is bolstered when enhancing market freedom and social spending complement one another. Findings suggest mixed national policies that combine market freedom and social spending are best positioned to spur entrepreneurship. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Nonprofit leaders face the challenge of making decisions within a complex environment of heterogeneous and often competing stakeholder claims. In such a setting, leaders not only make judgments about the power of their organization's stakeholders but they also make conscious choices about which stakeholders they personally represent while making organizational decisions. This study uses insights from stakeholder theory and agency theory to investigate (1) how nonprofit leaders' perceptions of stakeholder power and stakeholder representation are interrelated across a wide range of stakeholder groups and organizations, and (2) how perceptions of power and representation differ between board members and executive managers. Drawing on data from 491 nonprofit leaders, we find evidence of stakeholder representation surpluses and deficits for several stakeholders, although perceptions of these deficits and surpluses differ considerably between board members and managers. Our study holds important implications for nonprofit governance, the practice of stakeholder analysis, and the use of stakeholder constructs in future empirical research. (c) 2020 The Authors.

We use the staggered adoption of the Universal Demand Laws (UD Laws) to examine the effect of an exogenous reduction in shareholders' ability to litigate on the extent of accounting conservatism. On average, we find an increase in reporting conservatism post-UD. The increased conservatism is concentrated in firms that contemplate equity issuance, with a high proportion of monitoring investors, and high corporate governance quality. In contrast, firms with specific short-term incentives for aggressive accounting-such as those narrowly beating benchmarks, those with abnormal insider trading, and those likely to violate debt covenants-weakly governed firms, and firms with high ex ante litigation risk decrease reporting conservatism after UD. Our results suggest that the relation between the litigation environment and reporting conservatism is complex and dependent on specific characteristics and unique circumstances of the firms.

A single family office (SFO) is an organizational entity owned by a single family and primarily dedicated to managing assets and meeting the needs of family members. While a rising number of SFOs around the world emphasize the importance of this specific vehicle for entrepreneurial families, scholarly knowledge on SFOs is surprisingly scarce. To better understand this phenomenon, we conducted and analyzed exploratory interviews with 109 German-speaking SFO-owning families. We answer a call for research on SFO heterogeneity by identifying two relevant, separate dimensions: a) whether the family still owns the original family firm and b) whether the family generation who founded the SFO still owns the SFO. Based on our qualitative insights and theoretical approaches such as socioemotional wealth (SEW) and agency theory, we develop propositions about how the respective heterogeneity of SFOs affects the family-related goals, entrepreneurial investment behaviors, and governance of SFOs.

Using a database of 56 studies on corporate governance in the banking industry that were published between 2007 and 2019, this study performs a meta-analytic review to examine the impact of board governance on bank performance. We investigate how board size, CEO duality, outside directors, and female directors on board play a role in determining bank performance. Variations in the relationship between board governance and bank performance that attribute to moderating effects of potential moderators, including the system of corporate governance, bank performance measures, the definitions of governance variables, publication quality, and endogeneity concerns, are also encapsulated. Our study shows that bank performance is positively associated with larger boards and a high proportion of outside and female directors, supporting the resource dependence theory. We find that the moderating variables considerably alter the link between board governance and bank performance. The study offers ways to enhance board effectiveness by enforcing governance practices in the banking systems based on each countries' legal and institutional framework and suggests reconsidering mandates for smaller boards and duality on boards of banking firms.

We investigate the dividend policies of firms in the United Kingdom to understand whether firms in different markets use dividends as a signaling or disciplining device. The sample consists of 1247 firms from the highly regulated Main Market (MAIN) and relatively unregulated Alternative Investment Market (AIM) for the period 2002-2017. We find that firms in AIM pay lower dividends than their MAIN counterparts. However, during turbulence, AIM firms decrease dividends lower than MAIN firms. In line with the signaling hypothesis, AIM firms with increased profitability are more likely to increase dividends. These results suggest that AIM firms depend more on the signaling feature of the dividends, whereas MAIN firms use dividends as a disciplining device to limit managerial discretion. Specifically, we find that AIM firms facing bigger agency problems pay lower dividends compared to other AIM firms, in line with the outcome view of agency theory. (c) 2020 The Authors

Purpose: Debt, dividend and investment policy constitutes a company's important financial decisions to determine firm performance. The research emphasizes on the problem of overinvestment, a phenomenon that worsens firm operation. Furthermore, it clarifies the moderation role of debt and dividend policy in mitigating the negative effect of overinvestment on firm performance in the case of Vietnamese listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses all financial statement of non-financial Vietnamese listed companies on Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi Stock Exchange in the period of 2008-2018. The data are collected from Thomson Reuters Eikon. The final data set is comprised of 669 listed companies. The study measures overinvestment though investment demand function and HP filter. Moreover, the research employs the dynamic model, so it has to apply the SGMM method to deal with the problem of endogeneity caused by the lagged dependent variable. Findings: The research finds that overinvestment is negatively associated with firm performance. Debt or dividend policy separately can moderate the negative effect of overinvestment on firm performance. However, when these two policies are combined, they lessen the positive interaction impact of each policy due to the substitution between debt and dividend policy. Research limitations/implications: The research may have two limitations. Firstly, the research measures overinvestment indirectly through investment demand function and HP filter. These two measures only help identify the sign that companies may have the problem of overinvestment because we cannot determine whether they overinvest or not in reality. Secondly, when using interaction variables, the problem of multicollinearity may be higher, and this may adjust the signs and significance level of variables in the models. Practical implications: Practically, the research proposes three policy recommendations. Firstly, a company can exploit debt or dividend policy to limit excessive free cash flow in order to constrain the problem of overinvestment. Secondly, a company should enhance its corporate governance to resolve agency problems. Thirdly, the government should make the financial sector more transparent and effective to improve monitoring functions of various parties in the capital market. Social implications: Overinvestment sometimes can cause social issues. Overinvestment means that companies make ineffective investment. If they continue this situation over a long time, companies may have financial distress or even go bankruptcy. As a result, it will slow down economic growth and increase unemployment in the economy. Originality/value: The research is supposed to make two great contributions to the existing empirical studies in two aspects. Firstly, it is the first attempt to take into consideration the interaction between overinvestment and financial policies. Secondly, it helps enhance the fundamental stance of the agency theory, which supports the interdependence of debt, dividend and investment policy. (c) 2020, Nghia Nguyen Trong and Cong Thanh Nguyen.

The paper investigates the impact of chief executive officer (CEO) compensation on firm performance from a sample of 155 listed French companies on SBF 120, over 2009-2018. Findings suggest that an increase in CEO compensation seems to improve the accounting-based firm performance, nevertheless it hurts the firm stock market value. More pronounced results are reported when we control for sector compensation interactions. We argue that attractive compensation may improve the executive services in achieving shareholders' objectives, but investors seem to not appreciate a CEO compensation increase. Based on the agency theory, it might be argued that investors fear possible executive opportunistic behavior encouraging them to enjoy overcompensation. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Agency theory posits that the profit orientation of firms influences their social and organisational performance. However, due to the extensive heterogeneity of lending organisations operating in the microfinance industry, there is no general agreement in the literature on how profit orientation affects social and organisational outcomes of microfinance institutions (MFIs). In this paper, we contribute to this debate by analysing whether the relationship between outreach and financial performance of MFIs is mediated by their productivity and loan portfolio quality, and, separately, whether this relationship is moderated by their profit orientation. To this end, a partial least squares (PLS) multi-group analysis is applied to a worldwide sample of 435 MFIs. First, we find substantial differences in the business model among non-profit-oriented and profit-oriented lenders, but the findings also reveal that both types of MFIs can increase their outreach while improving their financial outcomes. Essentially, the analysis shows a negative direct effect of outreach on financial performance for non-profit lenders, but we also find that this negative effect is positively mediated via productivity and portfolio quality of non-profit lenders which leads to a positive overall impact of outreach on financial performance. Hence, our findings do not support the mission drift hypothesis popular in the microfinance literature. On the contrary, the results suggest that non-profit-oriented lenders achieving higher levels of productivity and loan portfolio quality can additionally obtain better financial outcomes.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of board governance quality (BGQ) and its mechanisms, namely board activity, board independence, board communication and board expertise, on the level of risk disclosure compliance (RDC) among financial institutions (FIs) in Uganda. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a cross-sectional design where data are collected through a questionnaire survey and audited financial statements of 83 FIs. The authors employ partial least square structural equation modeling (SmartPLS32.7) to test hypotheses. Findings: The authors find that the level of RDC in Ugandan FIs is low. Further, the study finds the positive relation between BGQ and RDC. Moreover, the authors find that RDC is positively and significantly related with board activity, board independence, board communication and board expertise. Furthermore, the authors find that the level of RDC is positively and significantly related to ownership type, firm size and board size, respectively. Nevertheless, industry type, number of branches and firm age are insignificantly related to RDC. Practical implications: The study provides relevant insights into regulators and policy makers with early symptoms of potential problems regarding weak board governance in FIs. Policy makers may also use these findings as a guideline tool for improving existing board governance frameworks in place and development of new disclosure policies. In addition, the study provides an input into the review and amendments of existing corporate governance codes for the regulators. Originality/value: This study offers the empirical evidence on the nexus between BGQ and RDC of FIs in Uganda. Moreover, the study also offers evidence on how BGQ mechanisms impact RDC. The study also further adds theoretical foundations to the RDC literature. (c) 2020, Geofrey Nkuutu, Joseph Mpeera Ntayi, Isaac Nabeeta Nkote, John Munene and Will Kaberuka.

Our study aims to investigate how information asymmetry and ownership structure affect cost of equity capital. For that purpose, we collected 246 issuers over 4 years for a total of 984 observations. By using panel data processing, we found that the information asymmetry we proxied through Price non-Synchronization and trading volume had an effect on the cost of equity capital. Our results also confirmed both Agency Theory and Pecking Order Theory. Both theories are in line with the conditions of the stock market in Indonesia. In addition, we found that institutional and foreign ownership structures also had an effect on the cost of equity capital. Furthermore, our results also confirmed Interest Alignment Theory and Entrenchment Theory. Our research is expected to contribute to the debate on the existence of information asymmetry and ownership structures in relation to the cost of equity capital. We also hope that it will be a valuable input for investors in considering their investment. Moreover, from the results of this study, investors can also consider foreign ownership or institutional ownership in determining their investment. In addition, stock market regulators in Indonesia can develop approaches to minimize information asymmetry and encourage foreign investors to invest in Indonesia. (c) 2021 by the authors.

Purpose: The agency theory predicts that there are conflict of interests between managers and shareholders over free cash flow and major operating decisions. Earnings management can help managers hide and retain their private benefits of control. Given that, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether financial leverage reduces agency and information problems caused by earnings management. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a sample of annual data of 200 firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange during 2002-2016. The data required is obtained from the Rahavard Novin database. The research uses multivariate regression models that regress financial leverage on earnings management proxies and other determinants of capital structure. Findings: The research documents that firms with higher income smoothing and the absolute value of discretionary accruals, as the proxies for earnings management, have higher financial leverage. The results suggest that a higher level of financial leverage can discipline managers and generate useful information about firm quality. Originality/value: The study highlights the informational and disciplining role of debt in the presence of severe uncertainty about firm quality in a developing country.

It is estimated that within the online advertising industry, online advertising fraud (OAF) accounts for at least 10 percent of all spending. Such a phenomenon requires a systematic analysis to examine the marketing perspective; therefore, this article examines online marketing professionals' attitudes toward OAF by conducting eighty-nine interviews. The findings suggest that OAF is a high risk to the advertising industry and an urgent daily problem for many players. Building on Agency Theory, the results show that online professionals often tolerate fraudulent traffic due to a low awareness of OAF and a lack of sufficient knowledge among clients. Ineffective measurement systems and unrealistic expectations of clients also inhibit effective fraud detection practices. The present study aims to raise awareness by providing a better understanding of this understudied topic from a marketing perspective and aims to motivate practitioners and academics to establish effective fraud prevention procedures.

This study exploits the staggered adoption of universal demand (UD) laws, which place significant obstacles to derivative lawsuits and thus, undermine shareholders' rights by 23 states in the United States (U.S.) from 1989 to 2005 as a quasi-natural experiment to examine the effects of shareholder litigation rights on corporate payout policy. Weakened litigation rights for shareholders materially increase firms' payout ratios. The effect is more pronounced for firms exposed to higher shareholder litigation risk ex-ante, firms with higher institutional holdings, and ones financially unconstrained. Overall, the findings are consistent with lower shareholder litigation threats motivating firms to increase dividend payouts. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Research Summary: Venture capital firms (VCs) must simultaneously manage a range of relationships with investors, investees, prospective buyers, and co-investors who frequently exert divergent influences on when investments should be exited. The greater weight of one particular relationship can lead a VC to exit an investment earlier than would maximize returns for that investment. In this study, we utilize a global sample to examine how VC firms' investment duration decisions are shaped by firm-specific and environmental factors. Our findings suggest that VCs are less patient and exit faster when they have less experience, invest in more institutionally challenged host countries, or are foreign and invested in an emerging economy. Importantly, while co-investing with other VCs increases patience in advanced economies, this effect disappears in emerging economies. Managerial Summary: Agency theory explains why firms commonly capitalize on information advantages created by conditions of uncertainty to prioritize their own private interests over those shared with partners. This article introduces a framework, based on multiple agency theory, to examine the factors shaping the duration of venture capital firms' investments. Our findings, based on a sample of deals across 33 countries, suggest greater patience when host country market institutions are more advanced and venture capitalists themselves have more experience. In emerging economies only, we find that patience is increased by being local or from a foreign country with similarly challenging institutions. Importantly, while co-investing with other venture capitalists increases patience in advanced economies, this effect disappears in emerging economies. (c) 2021 Strategic Management Society.

We investigate firm-level determinants of capital structure using a large sample of 4,284 Japanese firms over a 19-year period (i.e., over 61,000 firm-year observations), a hitherto less examined sample for this purpose. We conduct our analysis and interpret our findings predominantly within the pecking order, the trade-off and the agency theoretical frameworks. We uncover three new findings. First, our evidence indicates that insights derived from the extant literature on capital structure are cross-national and are applicable in the context of Japan, despite the unique characteristics of Japanese firms. Second, financial crisis significantly impacts the relationship between leverage and firm-level determinants, particularly accentuating the effect of asset tangibility and growth. Third, product market competition significantly impacts the observed relationship between firm-level determinants and leverage. Our results are robust, controlling for the joint effects of competition and crisis. (c) 2020 The Authors. International Journal of Finance & Economics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine bases of effectiveness in internal Shariah auditing undertaken in Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). Design/methodology/approach: This paper is theoretical in approach taking, as its starting-point, an extensive literature review. From a general agency theory, an Islamic agency theory is articulated and then applied to ascertain attributes of internal Shariah audit effectiveness revolving around the concept of independence. Findings: Effective internal Shariah auditing, as a mechanism of assuring Shariah compliance by IFIs, varies directly with the degree of independence enjoyed by internal Shariah auditors themselves. The research propounds that an articulated Islamic agency theory holds potential to serve as a theoretical foundation to build a multi-dimensional conceptual framework based on independence utile for evaluating internal Shariah audit effectiveness. Research limitations/implications: Evidence is drawn strictly from secondary sources. Practical implications: To assure effectiveness of internal Shariah auditing, IFIs ought to increase the level of independence of internal Shariah auditors. Originality/value: Internal Shariah audit effectiveness in IFIs has not been extensively studied in comparison with both studies of external Shariah audit effectiveness in IFIs and internal audit effectiveness undertaken by conventional financial institutions. This research fills that gap. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

In view of integration and development, compliance with regulations on information disclosure has important implications for users. Corporate social responsibility disclosure (CSRD) is an increasing concern of the community and society. CSRD always poses many challenges for the profitability of banks. The article uses the ordinary least square method to examine this relationship and employs time-series data of five years from 18 Vietnamese listed banks from 2015 to 2019. The analysis is informed by Jensen and Meckling's Agency theory, Freeman's Stakeholder theory, and Dowling and Pfeffer's Legitimacy theory. The study results show that, with the CSRD dependent variable, return on assets (ROA) and net interest margin (NIM) have an opposite influence, but return on equity (ROE) has no effect on CSRD, while on the profitability dependent variable, CSRD has a different influence from ROA, ROE, and NIM. To enhance the relationship between CSRD and profitability, Vietnamese listed banks need to comply with CSRD as well as demonstrate responsibility to the community and society. Managers need to have clear development policies and strategies to ensure both profitability and responsibility regarding social and community activities. The State Securities Commission of Vietnam should enforce strict sanctions, conduct inspection, and complete evaluation criteria for Vietnamese listed banks.

While CEO compensation is seen as influencing firm performance, the intervening mechanisms that govern this influence have remained largely unexplored. Using the agency and expectancy theories, this paper attempts to open the "black box" between CEO compensation and firm performance and empirically tests the intervening effect of CEO risk-taking behavior on this relationship. Specifically, we hypothesize that CEO compensation indirectly influences firm performance through its direct effects on CEO risk-taking behavior. Results based on data collected from 204 U.S. manufacturing firms revealed a strong, positive relationship between CEO option pay and a firm's strategic risk, stock returns risk, and income stream risk. Results also showed that firm strategic risk, measured by R&D expenditure, mediates the CEO option pay-firm performance relationship, sometimes fully and sometimes partially, depending on which type of performance is being examined.

Agency theory suggests that entrenched managers are less likely to pay dividends. However, according to the catering theory, external pressures from investors can force managers to increase dividend payments. Hence, we test whether entrenched managers respond to investor demand for dividends and share repurchases. Using a large sample of 9677 US firms over the period 1990-2016 (i.e. a total of 80,478 firm-year observations), we test and find evidence that managerial entrenchment negatively impacts dividend payments. Our findings suggest that catering effects weaken the negative impact of managerial entrenchment on payout policy and that in firms with entrenched managers an increase in the propensity to pay dividends is conspicuous only when there is external investor demand for dividends. Our results indicate that while insiders and institutional owners might not necessarily favour dividend payments, firms respond to catering incentives when dominated by insiders but not institutional owners. Overall, our findings are consistent with the view that dividend payments are a result of external pressures to reduce agency problems associated with firms run by entrenched managers.

The objective of this study is to examine the impact of managerial ownership on carbon transparency. Agency theory suggests that there is conflict of interest between managers and shareholders, and managers tend to take advantage of information asymmetry to entrench their interest. Further, extant literature indicates that management entrenchment incentives is linked with managerial ownership. Draw on agency theory and the insight from prior studies, we argue and predict that corporate carbon transparency is associated with management entrenchment incentives. We measure management entrenchment using managerial ownership and find a positive association between managerial ownership and carbon transparency in the low (0%-10 %) and high (beyond 30 %) regions of convergence-of-interest. However, this relationship becomes negative when ownership is in the entrenchment region (10%-30 %). The findings suggest that managers with ownership in the regions of convergence-of-interest are inclined to be open and apply a proactive strategy, whereas entrenched managers are likely to be opaque, so become insensitive to call for climate stabilisation and carbon transparency.

The study examines the influence of board structure on the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of corporate sustainability performance from the perspective of agency theory and stakeholder theory. If a firm's commitment to sustainable development is to satisfy environmental and social needs and to develop long-term relationships with all stakeholders for sustainable business, we expect that a board of directors would demonstrate their commitment by enhancing all different dimensions of sustainability. Based on a panel analysis of data from the emerging East Asian markets between 2011 and 2016, we identify which board attributes promote corporate sustainability performance and also prove that some attributes fit well with some particular sustainability dimensions. The findings have important implications by identifying the role of corporate boards in sustainability performance and providing a foundation for their efforts to enhance sustainable development.

Motivated by growing attention to the agency problems of institutional investors, along with recent changes that have identified real estate investment trusts (REITs) as a separate industry segment, this study investigates the impacts of institutional ownership on the firm value of hotel REITs. Hotel REITs provide unique regulatory and operational settings in which it is appropriate to investigate the potential adverse consequences of institutional investments on firm value. This study performs additional analyses using non-REIT hotel corporations (hotel C-corporations) for comparison. After testing pooled ordinary least squares, fixed and random effects, and two-stage least squares in quadratic models, the results of the random effects models are found to be valid and are thus adopted to examine the hypothesized relationship. The analysis showed a U-shaped relationship between institutional ownership and firm value (as measured using Tobin's q) but a dominantly negative relationship in the majority of observations, whereas no significant relationship is found for hotel C-corporations.

Using the first ever Newsweek "Green Rankings" of the 500 largest U. S. firms in 2009 as a significant historical event, we test for the stockholder reaction to ratings of corporate environmental performance. Both the conventional null hypothesis significance testing and Bayesian approaches show that stockholders react significantly more positively to corporations with higher ratings of corporate environmental performance and that this effect is stronger in family owned firms. Our findings suggest that majority shareholders do not necessarily appropriate minority stockholders' rents when investing in environmental activities, as would be the case in the presence of "Type II" agency conflicts between majority family owners and minority stockholders. The family ownership effect is also found to be stronger in dirty (heavy polluting) industries as well as in more competitive and more opaque industry contexts.

In this paper we exploit the complementarities between agency theory and resource dependence theory to investigate the influence of regulatory monitoring on financial reporting quality in the higher education sector. Our setting is U.K. universities. Using 14 years of data over the period 2002-2015, we find that financial reporting quality, (proxied by discretionary accruals), improves with the intensity of monitoring and resource dependence (proxied by the proportion of funding from regulators/funding bodies). However, this positive influence is mitigated in the presence of a pre-discretionary deficit, a proxy for the threat of regulatory intervention. A net benefit from monitoring remains for those universities with low levels of regulated funding but in those where there is high dependence the monitoring benefit is reversed and a pre-discretionary deficit is converted to a small reported surplus. Both agency and resource dependence theories offer explanations for these findings. Agency theory predicts increased financial reporting quality with increased monitoring and also a reduction in financial reporting quality to avoid costly regulatory intervention. Resource dependence theory predicts that both these effects will increase with increased dependence on resources from a key provider. These findings extend our theoretical understanding of financial reporting quality of universities, contribute to the limited literature on financial reporting quality in the not-for-profit and public sectors, and contribute to the exploration of the use of alternative theoretical frameworks in the domain of public sector accounting.

Purpose: The main objective of the study is to ascertain the level of independence and the effectiveness of the Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) members of Islamic banks in Bangladesh. This is because only SSB members are empowered to oversee and certify the overall business functions of Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach: This paper implements qualitative case research approach to explore the research objective in the context of Bangladesh. We applied purposeful and snowball sampling tactics for selecting respondents. By using a semi-structured questionnaire and face-to-face interviews, we collect data from SSB members, central bank executives and experts in Islamic banking and Shariah governance. Findings: The study finds that majority Islamic banks' SSB's positions are similar to the Board of Directors (BOD) of the banks. Next, this study finds that in recruiting/selecting SSB members, some banks do not follow the guidelines of the central bank. This study finds mixed evidence regarding the independence of the members of the SSB. Most of the respondents opined that SSBs do not have power; in some cases, members of SSB are not independent and seeming powerless as BOD selects and recruits them. In contrast, they are dependent on management in respect of strategy implementation. Research limitations/implications: The study significantly contributed to the national and global regulatory bodies by identifying an important governance determinant of Islamic banks that is the independence of SSB members, which is highly important for both Shariah functions, and to enhance the trust level of the stakeholders. This study makes a theoretical contribution by documenting the violation of stakeholder theory and agency theory in recruiting SSB members by BOD's choice. The lack of SSB members' independence has an impact on Shariah legitimacy of the Islamic banks which is contradictory with the notion of legitimacy theory. This study recommends the central bank to ensure the independence of the SSB and central bank should take initiatives to develop an environment for the Islamic banking sector. Originality/value: This study extends the literature of corporate governance relating to Islamic banking and financial institutions. More specifically, this paper explores the necessity of independence of members of the monitoring body (here SSB), an important constituent of governance, to ensure high-quality governance and transparency in reporting to increase diverse stakeholders' trust/confidence. The absence of independence of SSB in performing their functions contradicts with the agency, stakeholder and legitimacy theory, which is inconsistent with global evidence, that demands further investigations.

Purpose: In the wake of certain corporate scandals, many stakeholders are questioning if current high levels of executive remuneration, world-wide, are in fact related to company performance. After the implementation of King III in 2010, there has been an expectation that governance has improved in South African companies. If so, empirical testing should find executive remuneration to be positively related to forms of performance that reflect an increase in company value, like Tobin's Q, or return on assets, rather than measures such as total revenue. Design/methodology/approach: Agency theory predicts that if executive remuneration is not carefully designed to maximise the value of the company, executive directors will tend to maximise revenue instead. To test this prediction, hand-collected panel data from Johannesburg Stock Exchange company reports are linked to company performance data to test this prediction, across the years 2010-2017, post King III. Findings: Results challenge certain important assumptions. Generalised method of moments tests find total revenue, rather than value added measures of performance such as Tobin's Q or return on assets, to predict executive director remuneration. This is notwithstanding the significance of Tobin's Q in testing based on ordinary least squares. Implications of these findings for the field are derived and discussed. Originality/value: Unique findings suggest that complacency about the relationships between executive director compensation and company performance is unwarranted. In light of a decline in the country's international rankings on the quality of its corporate governance, a renewed focus on the effectiveness of human resource compensation strategy may be necessary in this context.

Although innovation can be a critical source of competitive advantage, research has found that debt can erode management's willingness to invest in R&D. In this article, we employ a stakeholder bargaining power perspective to argue that this effect is most pronounced when the firm's bonds are concentrated in the hands of bond blockholders. Furthermore, we contend that the temporal orientation of bondholders influences this relationship. Specifically, while it is commonly assumed that bondholders have a limited temporal orientation that induces them to focus on short-term value appropriation, we argue that some bond blockholders adopt a long-term temporal orientation. This orientation, in turn, makes them more inclined to support long-term value creation for the firm in the form of enhanced investments in R&D. Moreover, while agency theory suggests that there is an inherent conflict of interest between shareholders and bondholders, our results suggest that the temporal orientation of investors (i.e., both shareholders and bondholders) matters much more than whether they invested in the firm's equity or its debt.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the link between national culture and investment efficiency through a cross-country study. Based on a sample of 3,216 firms operating in 23 countries and observed over the 2009-2018 period, the study uses national culture Hofstede dimensions and overinvestment as operationalised in Biddle et al. (2009) model. To this end, a logit model and a GMM regression are applied. The results indicate that individualism and masculinity dimensions reinforce the likelihood that managers overinvest and tend to increase overinvestment levels since people from these cultures are known by their individual and money-oriented aspirations. However, managers from power distance cultures and high uncertainty avoidance engage less in overinvestment. This study provides additional cross-country factors that explain overinvestment not determined by agency theory. Manager's investment decisions are not only perceived through an objective financial perspective but also through beliefs and perceptions which are inherited from a manager's culture.

Cognizant of the growing importance of internal control as a corporate governance mechanism in organizations, this paper investigates factors that are associated with internal audit effectiveness. Additionally, this paper also investigates the relationship between internal audit effectiveness and internal audit quality. A total of 102 questionnaires were collected from internal auditors and chief audit executives of 12 multinational companies in Malaysia. The data was analyzed through structural equation modeling by using SmartPLS Software 3.0. The findings reveal that management support, interdepartmental coordination and the support and acceptance of auditees were associated with internal audit effectiveness. Conversely, the findings also revealed that independence, objectivity and competence (the three building blocks of internal audit effectiveness) were also related to internal audit quality. The study contributes to the agency theory by highlighting the factors associated with the effectiveness of internal audits and quality audit outcomes to protect the best interest of principals while fulfilling the corporate governance imperative. This study also contributed to the institutional theory by highlighting how proper structures and systems can lead to a culture of governance and internal controls. The study confirmed the significance of interdepartmental coordination and the support and acceptance of auditees towards internal audit effectiveness, the exploration of which remains limited in current literature.

Rationale/Purpose: Certification is an institutional mechanism that may, indirectly, have utility for managing the challenges that are likely to be present when the state and voluntary sport clubs (VSCs) connect for sport development. Design/Methodology/Approach: A hermeneutic-dialectic approach guides the adoption of agency theory to conceptualize the state as principal and VSCs as its agents, and to consider agency problems of information asymmetry and divergent interests. Findings: The potential for VSC certification to counter agency problems through harmonization of interests, VSC signaling and reporting of quality and professionalization, state screening and monitoring, and confidence-building through quality assurances, are discussed. Practical Implications: The challenges of certification further inform implications for its indirect application for effectively managing the VSC-state relationship. Research Contribution: The paper advances the limited consideration of both VSC certification and agency theory in the sport literature, combining them for new insights into the potential role of certification for government and community sport relations.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of audit fees, auditors' quality and board ownership on tax aggressiveness in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of this study is based on 215 firm-year observations of SET-100 listed companies in Thailand during the 2010-2018 periods. This study employs a panel least square regression with period fixed effects. The study retrieved the corporate governance variables from the downloaded annual reports, whilst the remaining data were collected from the EMIS database. Findings: This study provides evidence that audit fees reduce tax aggressiveness and board ownership enhance tax aggressiveness among the firms. Nonaudit services provided by auditors impair auditors' independence and lead to higher tax aggressiveness. The result supports the agency theory, which explains that managers and blockholders may enjoy private benefits of control at the expense of other shareholders in the absence of market control. Thus, firms need good governance practices such as incentives paid for the effort of auditors and nonaudit services monitoring to curb such exploitation. Research limitations/implications: The results provide implications to the firms and regulators that incentives to the monitoring parties such as auditors can reduce tax aggressiveness among the firms. Nevertheless, higher ownership given to boards as incentives may lead to concentrated ownership and thus lead to the type 2 agency problem, which is between majority and minority shareholders. The result also provides caution to the regulators to monitor the nonaudit services provided by the auditors as it might impair their independence and compromise the tax paid to IRB. Originality/value: This study is pioneer research discussing tax avoidance in Thailand. The Thai Government has been noticing that tax avoidance is being performed in the country, but academic discussion on this topic had never been elaborated. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The objective of the present research is to examine the relationship between corporate governance and voluntary disclosure, and to determine how certain factors enhance governance practices and consequently increase voluntary disclosure. The study considers the content analysis of 22 Saudi listed companies from 2015 to 2019. A comprehensive index is developed, with a check-list covering 30 items to extract and measure corporate governance practices and levels of voluntary disclosure. The researchers use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to examine whether corporate governance-specific mechanisms can explain any differences in voluntary disclosure levels among the listed companies. The results indicate a statistically significant relationship between the number of non-executive directors and board size and the level of voluntary disclosure. This study concluded that non-executive directors and board size are ranked the highest in terms of their positive effects on voluntary disclosure. The relationship between the independent directors and audit committees and voluntary disclosure is insignificant. The results suggest that the high number of non-executive directors and the increase in the number of directors on the boards lead to greater voluntary disclosure of information. This study helps regulators of corporate governance and company directors understand the factors affecting voluntary disclosure. Corporate governance regulators should require an increase in the minimum number of boards and non-executive directors for listed companies in order to gain the desired levels of voluntary disclosure and transparency. Saudi listed companies are advised to willingly increase their board members to the maximum number specified by regulation. This study has some limitations as participants represented a small sample; hence, the results cannot be generalised. Furthermore, the voluntary disclosure data were collected only from annual reports; sources such as websites, public announcements and press releases, were not taken into account, but would have provided many relevant details.

This article uses Michel Foucault's conceptualization of power to rethink how power operates within leadership relations. Foucault (1980:220) defines power as a "a structure of actions, bearing on the actions of those who are free." This idea is explored, noting how it differs from much leadership theorizing which defines power in terms of a leader's position or personal characteristics. Foucault's assertions that "power is everywhere" (1988, 12), that it is relationally based and is best perceived through its effects are examined. We identify implications for researching power from this perspective, including the appropriateness of methods capable of mapping social, historical, and institutional dynamics. We offer four analytic strategies: beginning from power's outcomes, investigating points of resistance, proactively identifying hidden dynamics and attending to networked alliances. Insights generated from this approach highlight the contingent, ephemeral nature of power and help explain the indeterminacy leaders often experience when wielding it in practice.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the moderating role of chief executive officer (CEO) power on the relationship between divestiture strategy and firm performance by framing the relationship under the agency and power circulation theories. Design/methodology/approach: This study focuses on a sample of 319 non-financial public-listed companies in Malaysia from the year 2012-2016 and estimates the model under two-step generalized method of moments panel regression to eliminate the endogeneity issue. Findings: The results show that divestiture strategy decreased the firm performance. Meanwhile, greater CEO power changed that divestiture effect but still failed to increase the performance. This study also indicates the CEO power strengthens the relationship between firm performance and divestiture. Research limitations/implications: The overall findings show that the positive moderating role of CEO power on the relationship between divestiture and performance. This research confirmed the agency and power circulation theories by showing that CEO power can make divestiture strategy works. However, the moderating plot tells different. CEO power may strengthen the relationship between divestiture and performance; it fails to boost up the performance in overall. Therefore, this study is about CEO power on the strategic decision and gives a good implication for corporate governance concerning the impact of CEO power on the organization's alignment process. Originality/value: This study examines the effect of CEO power on the performance of divestiture strategy implementation by contesting the agency and power circulation theories within an emerging country context.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the empirical relationship between family firms and lean innovation (i.e. generating more output with less input) as well as the moderating role of the executive's compensation. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data for ten years (2007-2016) have been collected from the CSMAR database. This study concludes the findings using descriptive statistics, correlation and panel data analysis techniques applying statistical software STATA. Findings: Results show that family firms are not motivated to follow lean innovation strategies until unless the executives are compensated well. We further find that family firms are more likely to pursue a lean innovation strategy, and they demonstrate a superior record of converting R&D inputs as granted patents, and; both input and output innovation are significantly affected by executive compensations. However, this study shows an insignificant negative relationship of propensity to patents with the moderating effects of executive compensation. Research limitations/implications: This research has been conducted on the emerging Chinese market. The study is useful for policymakers and managers to devise such strategies which can make the role of executive's more effective to reduce the agency cost and reap the benefits of innovation input more effectively (Petersen, 2009). Also, family firms are heterogeneous, and the research outcome may be applicable for both advanced and emerging economies. Originality/value: The previous family firm's research paid less attention to the role of the executive's compensation on the relationship of family firms and lean innovation. Moreover, they prioritize insight into how executive's compensation affects different proxies of innovation. This study sheds new light on the paradoxical findings of family firms and lean innovation by analyzing the significant role of executive compensation. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The purpose of this paper is to examine whether corporate governance has a mediating or moderating effect on the relationship between capital structure and firm performance. This study employs a quantitative method with a sample of 224 Italian non-financial listed firms from 2013-2017. Collected data were analysed using OLS and GMM estimations to test the research hypotheses and to assess the mediating and/or moderating effect of corporate governance. Based on an integrated theoretical framework that draws insights from agency theory, pecking order theory, and trade-off theory, our results are threefold. First, we find that capital structure has a negative and significant impact on firm performance. Second, we show a significant association between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance. Specifically, we find that board size has a negative effect on firm performance, while board independence and managerial ownership has a positive effect on firm performance. Finally, our results indicate that corporate governance mechanisms do not mediate, but instead moderate the association between capital structure and firm performance. This study further suggests some important policy implications for both theory and practice. (c) 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and earnings management is still a debate. Several previous studies showed that CSR is a determinant of earnings management. Meanwhile, others revealed the reverse. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of CSR disclosure on earnings management and the effect of earnings management on CSR disclosure. This study was conducted with mining companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in the 2016-2019 period. The research data was analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. The data is obtained from financial statements, annual reports, and sustainability reports. The results reveal that there is a positive relationship between CSR disclosure and earnings management. This study also shows that the relationship model of CSR disclosure and earnings management is recursive. This finding implies that CSR disclosure is a tool used by management to cover up unethical actions from stakeholders. These results verify the agency theory and opportunist hypothesis regarding the relationship between CSR and earnings management. The novelty of this study lies in highlighting the recursive model of the relationship between CSR and earnings management.

Rule changes are not uncommon in most professional sports, and scholars often study the effects of such changes. Given the substantial increase in rule changes and the substantially different nature of new rules (e.g., safety driven) in the National Football League since 2005, the authors examined how coaches adapt to the changing National Football League in terms of coaching strategies and securing subsequent head coach positions in the labor market. Using agency theory, the authors identified agency misalignment when coaches employ strategies whereby incurring more penalties results in on-field success, but decreases their likelihood of obtaining future employment as a head coach. In addition, the authors found evidence that, regardless of the penalties accrued, former coaches who previously held more head coaching jobs, are Black, or are younger have higher chances of securing subsequent head coaching positions. However, these attributes do not increase team performance, indicating that coach-hiring decisions are incongruent with determinants of coach performance. (c) 2021 Human Kinetics, Inc.

This study examines the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on corporate social performance. The amount a given country spends on corporate social responsibility activities varies due to various motives. Therefore, the objectives of the study involve examining the impact of board characteristics and ownership structure on corporate social responsibility. Based on a panel data regression, this study finds that board size is positively related to corporate social performance (social performance and environmental performance) in the Chinese context. In the case of India and South Africa, board size exhibits a negative relationship, which is inversely related to China. CEO duality is positively related to firms' corporate social performance in India and China. However, in the context of South Africa, it exhibits a negative relationship. Gender diversity has positive impact in India and South Africa, wherein in case of China it is inversely related. It is observed that women on the board and women directors significantly influence corporate social responsibility spending. Moreover, among the ownership structure, family ownership is positively related to corporate social responsibility in the India and South Africa. The institutional investors have a negative impact in South Africa and a positive impact in India and China. This study supports the stewardship theory and agency theory and finds that firms should spend on corporate social responsibility activities to protect the interests of the stakeholders and the role of firms' responsibilities towards different sectors of society. Finally, this study provides insights into the state-of-the-art literature and offers practical implications for top-level management and shareholders. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

Since the early 2000s, Sino-foreign equity joint ventures (JVs) have declined sharply as a predominant strategy for multinational enterprises (MNEs) to enter and operate in China. We study one of the contributory factors, foreign buyout, and its performance implications. By applying incomplete contract theory and an agency perspective, we provide micro evidence that superior post buyout performance is observed in converted wholly-owned subsidiaries (WOSs) with efficiency-seeking operations and subsequent CEO succession. The findings extend our understanding that ownership per se does not guarantee performance improvement. Instead, it is the alignment between ownership and the owner's inputs, and between ownership and the owner's managerial control, that give rise to performance improvement. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We present evidence that the negative impact of CEO short-termism on firm value can be attributed to a sub-optimal exercise of real options. Accordingly, the value relevance of firms' real options portfolios is maximized in the absence of CEO temporal myopia. Moreover, the impact of real options on firms' stock returns' idiosyncratic characteristics is more pronounced when CEOs' decision horizons are longer, in line with the view that enhanced operating flexibility from longer decision horizons can amplify the convexity of real options' payoffs. These findings have important implications regarding the impact of CEO career horizons on corporate strategies and board decisions related to CEO incentives and succession.

This study examined the impact of working capital management on the profitability of selected quoted agricultural and agro-allied companies (from 2012 to 2016) in Nigeria. Secondary data were extracted from eighteen quoted agricultural and agro-allied companies in Nigeria, four of which are agricultural companies out of the twenty-three in Nigeria. Descriptive research design and regression analysis were used. Working capital management was measured using the trade receivables collection period, trade payables, payment period, inventory turnover period, and cash conversion cycle, while profit before interest and tax measured profitability. This study found that working capital management and profitability are related to the agriculture and agro-allied sector in Nigeria. The result shows the trade receivables collection period and profitability are negatively related. The result also shows the trade payables payment period and profitability are positively related. The result shows that the inventory turnover period and profitability are related, the cash conversion cycle and profitability are positively related. The conclusion is that working capital management and profitability are related. If the management of firms takes efficient and effective decisions in managing the company's working capital, all things being equal, the maximization of the firm's profitability, value, and shareholders' wealth can be guaranteed. Consequently, agency costs asserted by agency theory would be eliminated automatically. (c) Adegbola Otekunrin, Tony Nwanji, Damilola Fagboro, Johnson Olowookere, Oladipo Adenike, 2021.

This paper investigates the role of a firm's information visibility in the assessment of its default risk. We use press coverage to proxy for firm visibility and find that highly visible firms generally have better credit ratings. The positive association between firm visibility and credit ratings arises because (1) press coverage facilitates the generation and dissemination of firm-specific information to market participants and (2) it disciplines the activities of managers and large shareholders. This positive association becomes stronger for firms with more severe information asymmetry or weaker alternative monitoring systems. Our findings contribute to the accounting literature by providing new evidence on the influence of firm visibility in the debt market. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

The topic of corporate cash holdings ha received relatively little attention from academic researchers. However, this decision has always been at the center of interest of any company seeking to improve its performance. This article aims to examine the relationship between agency costs related to managerial discretion and cash holdings by Moroccan companies. In order to do this, we will mobilize both agency theory and free cash flow theory. To date, and to our knowledge, no research has been conducted on the cash flow of Moroccan companies in the light of agency theory. This study contributes to cash holdings research in Morocco by exploring the reasons for holding cash through a sample of Moroccan non-financial companies that are listed on the Casablanca Stock Exchange for a period of 12 years (from 2007 to 2018). This research uses econometric models based on a positivist approach with a hypothetical-deductive method. Our results show that there is a strong positive relationship between cash holdings and cash flow. It also turns out that the liquidity of these companies is significantly negatively affected by the debt leverage and the growth opportunities of the company.

The theory of agency has found applications across the social sciences as well as in management fields; there are literally thousands of papers that employ it. Unlike many popu-lar theoretical approaches in social science, however, the theory of agency has no standard citation. Most applications to date have employed variations on the economic theory of agency, with the most cited article being Jensen and Meckling (1976). Most literature using agency has featured the assumptions, terms, logics, and domain common to approaches in economics. But agency theory did in fact have a distinct origin: it was first proposed, independently, by Mitnick (1973, 1974, 1975), beginning the institutional stream, and by Ross (1973, 1974), for the economics stream. Revisionist work on agency theory has taken for granted that the task involves extensions and repairs to the economic theory of agency. The present Guidepost essay argues that many of the criticisms do not necessarily apply to institutional agency theory. Work should return to an institutional approach that focuses on incentive relations rather than incentives; relationships of con-trol, such as authority and responsibility, not just decisions; attention to how the inevita-ble imperfections of agency are managed, not just how they are corrected; the exploration of complex motivation, including terminal values; the influences of social norms on agen-cy; and the design and functioning of systems of assurance that permit imperfect institutions to remain credible.

Our study aims to investigate the impact of some governance mechanisms especially, shareholder activism, gender diversity, board independence, and board size, on investment efficiency as measured by capital expenditure (CAPEX). So, we conducted an empirical study on 626 Asian listed companies (China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and India) during the period2012-2019. To test our hypotheses, we used panel data estimation and constructed estimates using three estimation methods: GLS, NEWEY-WEST, and WLS regressions. To strengthen our results, we established a robustness test by choosing a new measure for our dependent variable: the growth rate of Property, plant, and equipment (Growth PP&E). The results of our study highlight that shareholder activism, gender diversity, and duality impact negatively and significantly the level of investment efficiency, while debt and board size have positive impact on the dependent variable. The robustness check confirmed these results. (c) 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This paper examines the private equity (PE) corporate governance model by bringing together insights from legal scholarship, management studies, finance economics, and government data. While the PE business model emerged to solve the principal agent conflicts found in large publicly traded corporations, we argue that it creates principal agent conflicts higher up the investment chain between the limited partner investors (LPs), or principals in PE funds, and the general partners (GPs), or agents who administer those funds. We draw on and extend multiple agency theory and examine three types of asymmetries that may undermine the interest alignment of GPs and LPs: Asymmetries of power, information, and incentives. Using this framework, we consider the economic outcomes for stakeholders, whether solutions exist for better interest alignment, and the implications for future research and policy development.

This study investigates and analyzes the difference in Indonesian banks' earnings quality in the pre-audit and post-audit period. This study also investigates the difference in audit quality done by public accounting firms. This study employs time series data taken from the unaudited and audited financial statements of banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2012-2016. Sample selection is made by using a purposive sampling method. The population of this study is 43 banks, and after checking the data for validity and reliability, the final sample size was 26 banks. Audit quality is operationalized with the size of the auditor. Earnings quality is proxied by accruals calculated using the Beaver and Engel (1996) model. The data analysis method used in this study is the paired-sample t-test and chow test. This study shows that there is no difference in earnings quality in the pre-audit and post-audit period. This study also reveals no difference in audit quality between the big four and non-big four auditors. These findings mean that independent auditors do not play a useful role in increasing the reliability of accounting information presented by management to stakeholders. Besides, this study's results do not verify the agency theory regarding auditors' role to minimize opportunistic management behavior in preparing financial statements. (c) Copyright: The Author(s)

Using data from 862 firms and 6,071 firm-year observations from 17 emerging countries, we find that the employee friendly practices are negatively related to the dividend payments. This relationship is found to be stronger for government owned firms. We further examine the 'agency problems' and 'future investment' as possible channels through which employee friendly practices may lead firms to pay low dividends. We find the support for the future investment channel. Lastly, we examine the value effect of employee friendly treatment and find that employee friendly practices increase firm performance in emerging markets which lends support to the effectiveness of the investment channel.

In this paper we predict and find that the lobbying activities of firms can complement executive networks in determining executive compensation. Firms of all sizes, after considering market competition as a governance mechanism, prefer to consider lobbying as a means of networking along with executive level networking to determine executive compensation. The empirical implication of the study provides guidance to scholars who should consider lobbying along with executive networks in determining executive compensation. The composite theoretical underpinning and the importance of information flow through lobbying activities of firms will be an important insight for policy makers involved in determining executive compensation.

This paper examines whether firms' deviation from target leverage may predict types and outcomes of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals. We find that over-levered firms are more inclined to be involved in public acquisitions than non-public acquisitions. Consistent with the proposition of information economics theory, our findings suggest that information asymmetry is the main motive behind over-levered firms' preference for public targets. Specifically, we observe that over-levered acquirers not only prefer public targets, but also pick those with less information asymmetry. We find that, in the short term, the market reacts negatively to the announcement of public acquisitions by over-levered firms. However, in the long term these acquirers experience better operating synergies and values, measured by changes in return on assets and Tobin's q, respectively. Our results are robust after controlling for M&A deals-, firm-, industry-characteristics and endogeneity concerns using both propensity score matching and Heckman two stage methods. Overall, our findings support the premises of agency theory and Uysal, Journal of Financial Economics (2011), 102, 602-620 view that over-levered firms have a high tendency to pursue most value-enhancing acquisition deals due to the high pressure of holding high levels of debt.

The paper aims at investigating the Accounting and Finance theories on the best way of financing the firms. On the one hand, the agency theory perspective conflicts with the aggregate of leverage in the firm's capital structure (CS). While Modigliani and Millers' argued that debt is preferred in some circumstances. Therefore, the effect of equity and debt levels on a firm's value at a specific Jordanian industrial market is our concern. The study sample includes 34 Jordanian Industrial firms during 2001-2015 listed in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE). The study used multiple stepwise regression models analysis. The study measures the firm value using Earning Per Share (EPS) as a dependent variable. Also, the debt divided by the total assets (DR) and the total liability ratio divided by total equity (DE) isa measurement of the external sources of CS. Furthermore, the total equity ratio divided by total assets (EA) is a measurement of the internal sources of CS. The result of the study indicated a negative effect on capital intensive measured by (DR) and (DE) on firm value in all models. Alternatively, the study found a positive impact on capital intensive measured by (EA) on firm value. Finally, the study established the positive effect of corporate characteristics sales growth, profitability and firms size on firm value in all models under the study. Higher debt is not preferred in Jordan's industrial sector, according to the study. Thus, internal resource in terms of capital intensive equity is better than other resources.

The current research aims to analyze the impact of institutional shareholding on the dividend payout policy of Islamic mutual funds in Pakistan and Malaysia. A sample of 185 Islamic funds, including 85 Pakistani and 100 Malaysian funds, is used for the analysis. The data for the analysis spans nine years, i.e., from 2010 to 2018. The analysis is carried out using the fixed effects regression and dynamic panel system GMM techniques. The results show that institutional ownership has a positive impact on the dividend payout policy of Islamic mutual funds in both countries, which is in line with the assumption of the agency theory. Therefore, asset management firms need to encourage higher institutional ownership to increase dividend payments. In this way, these firms would be able to attract a large number of investors.

Although municipalities are major economic and social actors in most countries, remarkably little is known about their audits, particularly the determinants of their audit report modifications. The existing evidence is ambiguous at best and scarce, which provides opportunities for further accounting studies in this area. Therefore, based on an agency theory framework, we fill this important research gap by exploring three determinants of audit report modifications in municipalities: (1) economic performance, (2) decentralization of decision-making across different decision-making bodies, and (3) political competition between political parties in local councils. These determinants are examined based on a large panel of data on Finnish municipalities for the period from 2009 to 2013, covering virtually all of the country's municipalities. We find that a striking 33 percent of audit reports had modifications during this period, which raises serious concerns about the state of municipal management, accounting, and auditing in Finland. Regarding the above determinants, the following conclusions can be made based on our analyses. First, we find partial evidence that weak economic performance increases the likelihood of audit report modifications. Second, the lower the competition among political parties in a local council, the lower the likelihood of audit report modifications. Finally, the more decentralized decision making is across the different decision-making bodies under the local council, the higher the probability of audit report modifications. These results are consistent with agency theory's explanations regarding the value of auditing. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We examine the extent to which outsider chief executive officers (CEOs) influence corporate financial leverage policies. We define an outsider CEO as one who appears in the reporting year and became CEO either immediately upon joining or within 3 months of joining a firm. There are arguments in the literature that the selection of an outsider CEO can either increase or decrease financial leverage. We investigate this issue using 11,118 Australian firm-year observations from 1216 firms listed during the period 2001-2015. Our findings suggest that, in the short-term after their appointment, outsider CEOs reduce firm dependence on debt. This result is robust to several additional tests and four measures to minimize endogeneity concerns. However, with an increase in their tenure at the firm, outsider CEOs revert to greater dependency on corporate debt. After supplementary analyses, we determine that the outsider CEOs short-term strategy of reducing financial leverage involves using cash reserves and restricting dividends to reduce existing debt. Instead, outsider CEOs finance capital expenditure projects thus providing a positive signal to the market that such CEOs are more creditworthy. Our results also suggest that outsider CEOs exercise more control over financial leverage when they have specialist attributes. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Research Question/Issue: On the basis of a dynamic interrelation between the assumptions of agency theory and stewardship theory, this study seeks to make sense of disobedience at the highest corporate level. Departing from a processual view in order to better understand how loyalty plays a critical role in the relationships between a CEO and his/her principal, we propose a conceptualization of the options open to a top executive in disagreement with the principal. We view the relationship from "below" by primarily taking the CEO's perspective, resulting in a more complex view on how "duty" is perceived and acted upon by the CEO. Research Findings/Insights: We use the rich and abundant archives left behind by the CEO of a large French firm. We had access to over 50,000 pages of documents that allowed us to follow the CEO and his relationships with his principals, at times from day to day. We found two competing loyalties (loyalty to the principal--agency theory--and loyalty to the organization--stewardship theory) that gradually become independent of each other, triggering different responses in terms of "exits" from the relationship with the principal. This particular dynamic in which the CEO acted as a guardian of the overall purpose of the organization enabled the emergence, development, and consolidation of a disobedience process that over the years contributed to the well-being of his firm as well as to the social changes occurring in France at that time. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This longitudinal study extends the corporate governance literature by offering a process-oriented approach, quite rare in this stream of research, and a more dynamic view of how agency theory and stewardship theory interact. Then, by providing empirical support for the idea that the disobedience process can protect and allow an organization to first evolve positively over time and eventually contribute to social improvements, our study proposes a form of responsible stewardship. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers important insights for executives, directors, and shareholders on how to make sense of, and in the long run potentially benefit from, disobedience at the highest corporate levels.

This study examines the relationship between board composition and voluntary risk disclosure during uncertainty for a sample of United Kingdom-listed companies. A strand of the disclosure literature focusing on the impact of the board on corporate disclosure argues that board composition influences the extent and quality of corporate disclosure, but such literature has largely used data from stable periods and rarely on risk disclosure. Instead, using agency theory, we examine the impact of board composition on risk disclosure during corporate uncertainty for a sample of UK-listed companies for the period 2006-2015. We used content analysis to derive our measure of risk disclosure and measure board composition based on its size, independence, meeting frequency, and gender diversity. Our regression analyses controlled for the extent of firms' agency costs, firm risk level, and the impact of mandatory risk disclosure regulation, among other control variables. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that board size and board independence are positively associated with firms' risk disclosure during uncertainty, but board meeting frequency and gender diversity seem inconsequential for risk disclosure. Firms' risk disclosure is positively associated with risk level and mandatory risk disclosure. Our results are robust to alternative model specifications and endogeneity concerns. We highlight the implications of our findings for management practice and regulations. (c) 2021 Board of Trustees, Vernon K. Zimmerman Center, University of Illinois.

Despite concerns that profit-sharing plans might have a detrimental effect on audit quality, there is little empirical evidence on this issue. We examine the effects of the type of profit-sharing plan, level of client importance, and auditor reinforcement sensitivity ( joint sensitivity to rewards and punishments) on auditor reporting decisions. By relying on agency theory and reinforcement sensitivity theory, we posit that the joint effects of profit-sharing and client importance on auditors' decisions are contingent on reinforcement sensitivity. In an experiment with 450 audit partners and managers, we manipulate type of profit-sharing plan and client importance, and measure extroversion and neuroticism. We find the highest audit quality when profit-sharing is based on firm performance, client importance is low, and reinforcement sensitivity is high. Thus, instead of just modifying the type of profit-sharing plans, it is the mix of economic incentives and personality traits that affect audit quality. (c) 2021, American Accounting Association.

This study investigates the associations between investment efficiency and both the existence of a board investment committee (IC) and its expertise. Using a sample of industrial firms from six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries across the 2005-2018 period, we find that IC existence reduces both under- and overinvestment by these firms. We also find that financial expertise among committee members affects firms' investment efficiency positively. These findings are consistent with the assertion that ICs assist with the monitoring and control of firms' investments. We also find that ICs reduce over- and underinvestment in firms with high levels of foreign ownership concentration. Our finding that reliance on an investment committee enhances investment efficiency is consistent with the tenets of agency theory in firms dominated by government and family ownership structures. These results are robust to a battery of additional tests that use alternative measures of investment efficiency, and to tests for self-selection bias and endogeneity.

Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: This paper aims to examine how the political effectiveness and board independence moderate the effect of managerial entrenchment on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/Methodology/Approach: Data of non-financial firms from the BRICS countries for the period of 2010-2018 were obtained from Thomson Reuters (asset 4) and financial reports. Panel regression model was employed to analyse the data. Research findings: The results show that there is a positive relationship between managerial entrenchment and CSR. Political embeddedness was found to strengthen the positive relationship between managerial entrenchment and CSR. Independent directors was reported to weaken the relationship between managerial entrenchment and CSR. Theoretical contribution/Originality: Theoretically, this study contributes to the literature on agency theory. The finding provides novel insights into how managerial entrenchment affects CSR activities. It also expands the body of knowledge on corporate governance and CSR by focusing on manager's self-interest to shareholder's interest. Practitioner/Policy implication: Practically, this study provides valuable information to stakeholders, regulatory authorities and investors who wish to assess various antecedents of CSR. Research limitation/Implications: Future study should consider comparing the developed and developing countries. Other aspects of CSR should also be considered for better understanding. This study sheds light on the relevance of promoting the social and environmental awareness mechanisms surrounding companies in addition to developing CSR policies focused on corporations of BRICS countries.

The growth in institutional holdings of public firms has led to increased interest in the concept of common ownership, in which the same investor owns stakes in multiple firms within the same industry. Economic theory suggests that common ownership could affect firm performance, but little empirical research has examined the nature of this effect or how a firm's extant marketing potentially relates to this effect. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a relationship between common ownership and firm performance that is moderated by the firm's extant marketing capabilities and its relative marketing strategic emphasis. Our empirical approach employs data from over 43 million institutional holdings to develop a measure of common ownership and accounts for empirical issues like endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity. The results document a positive relationship between common ownership and firm performance and provide some evidence that this effect is stronger for firms with lower marketing capabilities and a relative strategic emphasis towards R&D spending. These results suggest that public policymakers should consider the firms' extant strategic marketing when assessing regulations on common ownership. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: This study aims to assess the relationship between managerial entrenchment and accounting conservatism in Iran. Design/methodology/approach: To test hypotheses, all listed companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange during 2013-2018 (six years) that qualified were selected. Given the defined limitations of the study, a total of 120 firms with 720 year-observations was selected. After collecting data and figures, they were analyzed using EViews software. Having presented the inferential model tests, the panel data with fixed effects model is chosen. Findings: The study results indicate a positive and significant relationship between managerial entrenchment and unconditional conservatism presented in the income statement. Moreover, the authors find a meaningful relationship between managerial entrenchment and unconditional conservatism about the balance sheet. Practical implications: Managers will be more aware of the positive consequences of employment optimal corporate governance such as conservative accounting. Such corporate governance is likely to serve their interest in the long run by providing positive signals to the equity owners and board of directors. Originality/value: By assessing conservatism's literature in Iran, we observe many studies on this concept. Still, no investigation is carried out on the relationship between conservatism in accounting and managerial entrenchment. The present study is innovative because it evaluates the relationship between managerial entrenchment and two types of conservatism, namely, balance sheet and income statement conservatism, which have never been investigated by prior studies, notably in emerging markets.

Research Summary: Boards are unlikely to be effective if they do not have sufficient collective expertise to understand, monitor, and address future risks. This begs the question, does the board, in fact, have this expertise? If not, can they reconfigure their expertise to address those risks? Building on agency theory, we analyze the alignment between the board's expertise and the firm's future risks, with the expectation that board composition will change over time to reflect the firm's future risks--strategic reconfiguration. Our results show that misalignment has negative implications for firm performance, misalignment also motivates appropriate board reconfiguration, and that this reconfiguration positively effects firm performance. Managerial Summary: Our study illustrates the need for board expertise to be aligned with firm risks. While there has been increasing pressure for firms to assess their directors' expertise (i.e., skill matrices), simply identifying expertise which is present or absent does not speak to whether that expertise is actually needed (or not) by the firm given the risks faced. We analyze boards' collective expertise, compare that with the risks that firms are facing, and identify the gaps which may detrimentally impact the monitoring ability of the board and cause firm performance to suffer. Consequently, understanding the degree of (mis)alignment is of paramount importance for boards to be effective monitors and positively influence firm performance. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Based on agency theory, this paper contributes to the literature by assessing the effects of Supervisory Board size, gender diversity, and multiple directorship on performance within the banking industry of the small island developing state: Curacao. The research made use of the data drawn from annual reports of locally generated banks and its subsidiaries. Results from linear regressions indicate a positive relationship between multiple directorship and bank performance, and a negative association between bank outcomes and both gender diversity and board size. According to these results, it is concluded that the legislation on corporate governance for credit institutions in Curacao should incorporate a maximum number of members on the board, as well as promote interlocking directorates and quotas by gender.

We investigate the impact of managerial optimism on investment decision sensitivity to cash flow. Optimists tend to overestimate returns and make overly optimistic cash flow forecasts, which leads to increased investment levels, as well as increased sensitivity of investment decision to cash flow. We use several measures of optimism and a panel of UK listed firms to confirm two hypotheses, namely that optimism increases the sensitivity of investment to cash flow, and that this sensitivity is only found in cash constrained firms. Our results are generally consistent with previous studies conducted on US firms. (c) 2021

Prior studies examining the impact of organizational controls on subsidiaries' strategic initiatives have to a large extent failed to find a significant direct association between the two. We argue that this lack of direct association may be due to the fact that the control mechanisms used exert their influence on subsidiaries' strategic initiatives indirectly by suppressing subsidiaries' decision-making autonomy. Drawing upon agency theory we consider the effects of two types of controls, monitoring and incentive alignment, as mediated by subsidiaries' decision-making autonomy. We test this effect on data from 115 subsidiaries of foreign multinationals operating in Greece. The results of our analyses empirically validate this assertion for both mechanisms. Our findings further show that, when both mechanisms are present, one may accentuate the effect of the other, highlighting the value of employing a contingency approach to fully capture the effects of organizational controls on the pursuit of subsidiaries' strategic initiatives.

Scholars endorsing the embeddedness outlook call for directors' greater engagement in the strategic management process. In contrast, scholars endorsing the control outlook argue that directors should focus on fulfilling their fiduciary duty of supervising top executives. Based on the behavioral-agency theory, this paper outlines a conduct outlook on boards. Recognizing the benefits of directors' participation in the strategic management process, we hypothesize that it may boost directors' satisfaction with firm's performance, strategic planning, and strategy. This could lead to cognitive entrenchment and spur inertial tendencies. Structural equations modeling analysis of the data from a survey of 367 Canadian directors supports the hypotheses. These findings add knowledge to latest research on the advantages vs. disadvantages of activist boards. (c) 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Disclosure plays an important role for information users. Voluntary disclosure is more meaningful for stakeholders in order to make appropriate decisions. The article researches the impact of firm characteristics on the voluntary disclosure of the top 50 listed firms in Forbes Vietnam (50 listed firms) from 2015 to 2019. It uses the ordinary least squares of time-series data to test the regression model. The signaling and agency theory is used to explain the relationship between firm characteristics on voluntary disclosure. The research results show three variables of firm characteristics that positively impact the voluntary disclosure of 50 listed firms, including firm size, growth rate of market share value to book value, and audit type, in which audit type has the strongest influence. Accordingly, the state agencies of Vietnam should encourage 50 listed firms to improve the Vietnamese listed firms' voluntary disclosure and meet international economic integration.

Although the literature has established that CEO inside debt induces risk aversion, it remains inconclusive whether these CEOs increase firm payout or not. While some studies show that high inside debt CEOs increase firm payout to avoid risky projects, others document that they reduce payout to preserve funds. This study addresses this contradiction by examining a sample of U.S. firms over the 2006-2018 period. Consistent with the agency theory, our results show that CEOs with larger inside debt adjust payout policies to mitigate prior overinvestment. Specifically, they increase payout in the subsequent period if their firm is already overinvested. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-seven years have elapsed since Bergen et al. (1992) published their work on agency theory in marketing. Agency theory is still relevant in marketing today. However, since 1992, there has been no comprehensive update of the literature on agency theory in marketing-related contexts despite the various developments in marketing, such as the advent of the internet, that have occurred in the interim. This paper covers the application of agency theory to marketing-related topics between 1992 and 2018. It seeks to update the overall knowledge of this application, suggesting new areas of research and managerial implications. (c) 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Agency theory and stewardship theory are both widely accepted within the corporate governance literature but it is unclear whether these theories are compatible or competing explanations of principal-agent relationships. This study used an inductive approach to integrate agency theory and stewardship theory in the context of non-profit sport organizations. Drawing on interviews with gift officers for athletic departments and employing a Gioia methodology for analysis, this article asks: How do athletic foundations reconcile their priorities with financers' interests when creating gift-financed projects? Findings show seven scenarios where athletic department priorities are reconciled with donor interests, ranging from scenarios where athletic department priorities prevail over donor interests to scenarios where donor interests come first. The ideal scenario, a cultivated donor base, is a special case and the only situation described by a perfect stewardship relationship. This article contributes a continuum model that blends agency theory and stewardship theory. Copyright (c) 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

IMPACT: We need to know more about the financial accountability of corporatized public services. In this article, the authors analyse the audit fees of a large sample of English local SOEs from 2009-2017, assessing the impact of board composition and ownership structure on those fees. SOEs with more politicians on their boards of directors had higher audit costs and this was especially so for majority-owned SOEs.

This article investigates the relationship between political control and audit fees for local state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in England--hybrid public service organizations not subject to public sector audit. Panel regression techniques are used to analyse secondary data on 405 SOEs for 2009-2017 where major local authorities held an interest. Statistical results suggest greater political representation on boards of directors of local SOEs is associated with higher audit fees and positive relationship between political control and audit fees is stronger for majority public ownership.

This study examines the role of the risk management committee as a moderating variable. The risk management committee will moderate the relationship between firm size, profitability, ownership concentration, and the size of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) disclosure board. The study is based on agency theory, which discusses the relationship between management and company owners and shareholders. The research sample consisted of 56 manufacturing companies in Indonesia with 224 units of analysis obtained using the purposive sampling technique. It has been proven that the risk management committee can moderate the relationship between firm size and ERM disclosure and ownership concentration and ERM disclosure. Company size is known to affect the disclosure of risk management in a company. But ownership concentration shows different things, that is, it does not affect corporate risk management disclosures. The results also show that the risk management committee cannot moderate the relationship between profitability and the size of the board of commissioners on the company's risk management disclosures. It has also not been proven that profitability and the size of the board of commissioners directly affect corporate risk management disclosures. Thus, it can be stated that the risk management committee plays a role in controlling the extent of the company's risk management disclosures; this is necessary to maintain stakeholder trust in the company.

Purpose: Classical assumptions of agency theory (AT) fall short of providing satisfactory answers to modern management and organizational knowledge (MOK) problems, and there is a need for extending the scope of the field. This article aims to compare modern AT assumptions with the agency perspective of Islamic historical political treatises (namely, siyasetnamas) and point out how AT can be furthered. Design/methodology/approach: This article applies content analysis method to find out agency perspectives in Islamic political treatises and then compare them with those of the basic AT assumptions to find out similarities and differences between them in explaining agency problems. Findings: The agency perspective in siyasetnamas are based on the following assumptions which could contribute to the development of AT with their emphasis on (1) responsibilities beyond contracts, (2) entrustment rather than ownership, (3) shared societal responsibility rather than conflicting individual interests, (4) importance of self-control for both principals and agents and (5) trust discourse which emphasizes inner virtues rather than control discourse. Originality/value: Agency perspectives cannot be considered independent of cultural imprints. By introducing siyasetnamas' agency perspective, this article makes an effort to suggest implications for how to further modern MOK based overwhelmingly on individualistic cultural assumptions to rediscuss agency problems from the viewpoint of specifically the emerging markets in which collectivist culture plays an important role in social and economic life. In this respect, siyasetnamas' agency perspective based on the notion of entrustment seems, arguably, to be a better fit to the contextual realities and managerial practices of emerging markets.

Agency theory and legitimacy theory were studied in which four criteria were extracted (corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, sustainability, and leadership).These criteria were then analyzed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) powerful mechanisms using information collected by a developed questionnaire that compares and sets priority between each element in the designed AHP model.The finding of our study shows the importance of corporate governance in improving the overall financial performance of the listed companies in the UAE. With the least emphasis on the outcome based leadership.This paper makes several important contributions to literature. First, it is an answer to the most recent calls from experts in the MENA region regarding the new trends faced in the financial market. Second, the present paper provides an examination of the performance of the big listed companies in the UAE Financial Market to reach a possible alternative that will lower the level of fluctuation in the stock exchange, which is considered among the first initiatives in the field. Third, this paper will provide a new insight to authority, as it will identify some gaps in the corporate practices and compliance in relation with different financial auditing, which will help not only in mitigating risks but also in improving the listed companies performance over the long run.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the link between agency costs mitigation via three levels of rights protection (minority rights protection, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency issues) provides the propitious climate for financing investment opportunities around the world. Design/methodology/approach: We use Bartlett's three-group method to stratify countries based on how well they protect investors as measured by the scores provided in the Doing Business dataset developed by the world bank for 189 countries. We then test a variety of independent hypotheses that the alleviation of agency costs via three levels of protection (minority investors' rights, contract enforcement, resolving insolvency issues) is associated with better access to credit via the banking system, better valuation of listed firms via the stock market and higher investment and growth. Findings: Our findings support Agency Theory which explains why the absence of legal protection of external investors leads to stock markets and financial institutions failing to fulfill their role of financing the economy. Practical implications: The policy implication from this study indicates that countries ought to (1) develop legislation that protects investors' rights, (2) improve the quality of their judicial system in terms of enforcing the legislation and (3) build the framework for resolving disputes during insolvency as these are important ingredients for a developed financial system. Originality/value: We use the World bank dataset and a new methodology to quantify the significance of the relationship between minority rights protection, ineffective enforcement, lack of bankruptcy laws and access to firm financing via the banking sector and the stock market. It provides new evidence that the quality of the judicial system in a country matter for firms' ability to raise financing and enhance value creation. (c) 2021, Mejda Bahlous-Boldi.

The current study examines the effect of ownership structure (i.e., government ownership, family ownership, and foreign ownership) on chief executive officer (CEO) compensation in an emerging market, by considering Jordan as a case study. By using a sample of 136 non-financial firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange over the period of 2015-2019, we find that family ownership has a positive and significant impact on CEO compensation. The finding regarding foreign ownership is contrary to expectations, with a higher foreign ownership reflecting a higher CEO compensation. Overall, these results imply that the ownership structure of Jordanian companies exerts a significant influence on the CEO pay setting process. However, government ownership has no relationship with CEO compensation. This indicates that government ownership is ineffective in determining CEO compensation. We further find that firm size is positively related to CEO compensation, indicating that larger companies have more ability to generate high internal funding, and can afford to pay higher compensation to quality managerial talent. In contrast, the effects of firm age and liquidity are not at significant levels. (c) 2021 Asian Economic and Social Society. All rights reserved.

Determining cash holdings is amongst the most important financial decisions made by heads of corporations. This decision relies on theoretical convictions and views as well as firm specific characteristics. This article analyzes the determinants of cash management in Moroccan corporations. By mobilizing all the theories of optimal financial structure, our research attempts to focus on the field of knowledge in the financial management of cash surpluses. No analysis has been carried out concerning cash and cash equivalents in Moroccan firms. These results could, therefore, contextualize the existing knowledge in this research theme and better understand the behavior of companies and their main trends in terms of cash flow, as well as the objectives and motivations of managers. The sample studied consists of 42 Moroccan companies, which are all publicly traded on the Casablanca Stock Exchange over 13 years (2007-2019). This research uses an empirical econometric study based on a positivist approach with a hypothetical-deductive method. We use panel regression analysis and perform all the necessary tests to determine the exact nature of this dataset. Our results show some evidence that a strong positive correlation exists between liquidity level and cash-flow as well as family shareholding. It is also found that the cash holdings of these companies are significantly negatively affected by how large or small the firm is, working capital requirement, debt leverage, as well as growth opportunity of the firm.

The purpose of this study empirically investigates the influence of corporate governance structure on the firm's financial performance of the alcohol beverage industry in the United States. Secondary financial data were collected for the U.S.-based alcohol beverage firms. Bivariate correlation and fixed-effects model analyses were performed to examine the proposed impacts. A two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression analysis was subsequently performed to examine the endogeneity. The analysis outcomes support the finding that certain corporate governance attributes significantly affect the financial performance of alcohol beverage firms. Theoretically, the findings reaffirmed the financial impact of industry-specific corporate governance structures (i.e., stewardship versus agency theory, and integrated traits of hospitality, retail, and distribution of the alcohol industry). Managerial implications are suggested in terms of the alcohol industry's specific corporate governance models, such as the balance among common stock ownership, executive tenure, board-size increase, and levels of control by outside board members. As a relevant sector (e.g., festival) of the hospitality and tourism industry, corporate governance of the alcohol beverage industry has never been empirically nor theoretically studied. The governance attributes in this study are compared between stewardship and agency theory and provide a better understanding of alcohol beverage industry firms' corporate governance structure.

Previous studies hold that information asymmetry and offsetting accrual hypotheses explain the role of diversification in earnings management. Our paper adds to this line of research by examining the effect of corporate diversification on earnings management and investigating whether managerial shareholding matters in the relationship between diversification and earnings management in the context of an emerging economy. The study used a sample of 45 companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange from 2008 to 2018 and the Generalized Least Square (GLS) regression technique. The results revealed that industrial and geographical diversification have significant positive effects on earnings management. The result also showed that managerial shareholding has a significant negative moderating effect on the relationship between industrial diversification and earnings management. These findings suggest the need for regulators to encourage managerial shareholding in diversified firms through share-based remuneration to have more reliable earnings.

Effective corporate governance leads the way towards aligning the interest between managers and shareholders. Effectiveness of practicing the corporate governance of companies in Sri Lanka is debatable topic due to the variation between standard and actual practices. This study aims to examine the influence of board diversity on agency costs of companies listed in Sri Lanka as proposed by agency theory. The sample of this research consists of all companies listed in Sri Lanka, exclusive of bank and financial institutions which are practicing unique governance practices issued by Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The final sample consists of 180 companies during the period from 2013 to 2019. This study deployed panel regression analysis to test the relationship formulated in the hypotheses by using the EViews 9 software. The results showed that the board diversity-related variables such as separate leadership structure and presence of non-executive director on companies' board are appeared to have significant influence on agency costs. Meanwhile, board size does not have direct impact on agency costs. The findings of this study regarding board diversity and agency costs have important managerial implications, that these findings are unlikely to the prediction of agency theory and best practices. Agency theory is not applicable to these companies, since the exiting corporate governance practices increase agency costs. The potential benefits of this study led to re-think the board of directors of the companies, managers, shareholder and the policymakers to re-organise the implementation of best practices.

Anchoring upon the agency theory of corporate governance, auditing function as a monitoring mechanism is supposed to alleviate information asymmetry between the managers and the shareholders of a company by controlling distortion of reported earnings by the former. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of audit quality on earnings management and substitutability of earnings management strategies using a sample of all Bombay Stock Exchange-listed companies for 10 financial years, that is, from 31 March 2010 to 31 March 2019. The previous studies addressing the issue have mostly captured companies in the developed countries or have dealt with only one strategy at a time. This study adds to the literature by undertaking a comprehensive approach to the analysis by studying both accrual earnings management as well as real earnings management in the Indian context, which are estimated through various models. The findings suggest significance of Big 4 auditors in constraining all forms of earnings management. For firms within the sample that have the incentives to distort earnings, long auditor tenure is found to be aiding earnings management through accruals, thus impairing audit quality.

Although risk management is prevalent in organizations, agency theory studies on contractual relationships in firms fail to address it. Risk reduction is mostly discussed within the context of monitoring, understood as insight into the activities of subordinates. Hence, this literature review discusses 18 main analytical studies on monitoring, reviewing whether they can be reinterpreted as depicting risk management, thereby allowing for the transfer of gained insights. Accordingly, only Meth, B. (1996). Reduction of outcome variance: optimality and incentives. Contemp. Account. Res. 13: 309-328 and Durr, O., Nisch, M., and Rohlfing-Bastian, A. (2020). Incentives in optimized teams for projects with uncertain returns. Rev. Account. Stud. 25: 313-341, can be reinterpreted as such, bearing the following risk management implications: (1) risk management is vital for firms, as firm's risk affects employee incentive contracts, firm's utility, and optimal firm size; (2) risk attitudes of risk managers are crucial for designing incentive contracts, with incentives necessary for more (less) risk-averse agents to encourage risk-taking (risk reduction); and (3) risk management should be delegated as a task separate from other managerial activities. The other studies do not depict risk management. Therefore, many research subjects remain open, such as organizing risk management in hierarchies, delegating risk management as a task and incentivizing it when a firm's outcome is unavailable for contracting, and establishing the connection between the performance measures and the risk of a firm.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify whether negative operating cash flows are related to investment inefficiency, and specifically whether they are related to subsequent overinvestment and if this relationship is driven by agency problems within the firm. Design/methodology/approach: The study conducts fixed effect regressions, testing the relationship between negative operating cash flows and the firm's subsequent investment inefficiency. The relationship is further examined for all firms based on size, corporate governance and cash holdings - all of which are related to agency problems. Findings: The proportion of firms reporting negative operating cash flows has been increasing over time and is positively related to subsequent investment inefficiency. This increase is explained not only by the rise in investment of intangible assets. The positive relationship is not explained by the firm size or corporate governance, but is related to cash holdings. These results are consistent across four different measures of firm investment. Practical implications: The percentage of publicly traded firms with negative operating cash flows has never been higher. This paper is one of the first to identify factors that may be contributing to this rise. Originality/value: This study extends prior findings by identifying previously unexplored factors related to the rise in firms with negative operating cash flows. The rise in investment of intangible assets does not explain the increase alone. High cash holdings also influence the rise in negative operating cash flows. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Background: Sticky SG&A costs provide a novel opportunity to investigate whether payout policy serves as a remedy for management overspending on perquisites that are embedded in SG&A expenses. Payout policy, especially under strong governance, may reduce overspending. Another possibility is that management may use sales declines opportunistically to repurchase shares when sales are expected to rebound. Methods: Regression analysis is used to examine the effect of payout mechanisms (dividends, share repurchases, and combinations thereof) and shareholder rights (EIndex) to determine whether managerial overspending on perquisites is reduced through payout policy. Results: The results indicate that dividends and share repurchases are associated with reduced SG&A cost stickiness. Payout policy reduces sticky SG&A costs under both strong and weak governance, where dividend payout is significant only for firms with strong governance, and share repurchases primarily significant for firms with weak governance. Conclusion: Under strong governance, dividends are significantly associated with reduced SG&A cost stickiness, supporting agency theory. However, strongly governed dividend payers are only significant when they also repurchase shares. For the weak governance sample, dividends are not significant, but share repurchase is significantly associated with less sticky SG&A costs, consistent with weakly governed management repurchasing shares in times of lower sales to improve earnings per share, reduce SG&A expenses to improve net income, and fund the share repurchases.

This book studies the gap between bank financing and the small and medium sized enterprises (SME) sector, based on the economic theories of information asymmetry and agency theory. Access to finance continues to remain one of the key constraints faced by SMEs to start and expand businesses, particularly in the developing economies where access to bank loans is subject to the availability of collateral. The SME financing gap, studied from the perspectives of both the key actors - banks and SMEs - is well presented in this book. The authors have used Sequential Explanatory Design, a mixed methodology, to collect data from SMEs and banks. The econometric model of the study represented SMEs' debt accessibility as a function of independent variables of loan repayment capacity, financial information, characteristics of the firm and owner and bank loan characteristics. The book provides empirical evidence that SME financing constraints are caused by factors arising from SMEs as well as the banks, primarily SMEs' high information opacity and banks' imposition of collateral to offset the credit risk. In the estimation of the econometric model, the size of collateral and owner's equity were among the most significant predictor variables. Likewise, the thematic analysis of interview data of credit officers to understand the banks' lending behavior evidenced a strong positive relationship between the size of the collateral and owner's equity and access to bank loans. SMEs' high information opacity and credit risk induced adverse selection and credit rationing on the part of finance providers. The findings of this book contribute towards academic literature on developing economies characterized by limited data available for academic and empirical research. This book provides a unique example of rigorous research on SME finance within an information economics framework. The theoretical issues are nicely balanced by the practical application of information economics to an emerging market. It can be used as a reference by researchers, academics, practitioners and policy makers in the areas of development finance, banking, development economics, microfinance and rural development. In addition, it can be used as an academic reference for a finance subject at the Master's or Doctoral level. The book is relevant to key stakeholders in understanding the debt inaccessibility from SMEs and the banks in drafting policies and measures to address the SME financing gap.

This paper studied how firm governance affects the performance of quoted deposit money banks in Nigeria. The paper aimed to ascertain the effects of board size, board composition, and gender diversity after controlling for firm age and firm size on financial performance. The study was predicated on stewardship theory, agency theory, and resource dependency theory. Data was fetched from the financial statements of all quoted deposit money banks. The study utilized a panel regression method to examine the relationship between the predictive and explanatory variables from 2015 to 2019. The study population comprised the 14 banks listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange as of 31 December 2019. The individual outcomes showed that board size and gender diversity in conjunction with firm age have significant impacts in both directions on the financial performance proxied by return on assets. As can be inferred from the panel random effect test results, it was concluded that corporate governance mechanisms were collectively discovered to have significant relationships with the financial performance in the study, which was confirmed by the p-value (0.01695<0.05). The study recommended, among others, that deposit money banks in Nigeria should ensure that the employment of autonomous executives should not only be based on the supervisory ability of these members, but also on liberated proficient business competence and skills.

Prior empirical research investigating the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) tenure and firms' financial performance has shown inconclusive results. Based on arguments of agency and behavioral agency theories, we suggest that this relationship is nuanced and may vary depending on CEO pay and board monitoring. In response to these arguments, we meta-analytically test 385 studies (n = 1,029,602). We find that CEO tenure is positively related to firms' financial performance. This positive relationship is enhanced when CEOs receive higher cash compensation or hold more stock ownership. On the other hand, the above positive relationship becomes weaker when CEOs receive higher long-term incentives or when the firm has more independent board directors. These findings suggest that CEO pay and board monitoring, or agency mechanisms in general, can offer new research avenues to help explore boundary conditions of the CEO tenure and firms' financial performance relationship.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the relationship between financial structure towards the financial performance of companies listed on Amman stock exchange (ASE) as one of the emerging economies. This paper adopted a panel data set of 88 non-financial companies listed on the ASE over a period of 10 years from 2009 to 2018. According to empirical results that there is significant evidence to support the fact that debt repaying ability (DRAB), managerial ownership (MANOW), and foreign ownership (FOROW) are positively related to firm performance. Otherwise, the findings revealed no evidence to support the impact of the financial structure ability (FSA) towards firm performance. Moreover, the findings support the fact that firm size (SIZ) has a positive impact on firm performance of companies listed on the ASE. On the other hand, (AGE) has a negative impact on firm performance, while (GROWTH) has no impact on firm performance. The current study encourages managers to maintain a good percentage of debt repaying ability and owners to grant shares as managers' incentives, and also to attract foreign investors. Future studies, should try applying the current study on the financial sector. (c) 2021, Universiti Teknologi Mara. All rights reserved.

Using an agency theory framework, we investigate the relationship between CEO option pay and CEO risk-taking behavior. We integrate the incentive alignment and monitoring approaches to reducing principal-agent conflicts by considering them simultaneously. We develop and test hypotheses that suggest that aspects of the governance system of a firm moderate the relationship between CEO option pay and CEO risk-taking. Results based on data collected from 204 Fortune 1000 U.S. manufacturing firms revealed a strong, positive relationship between CEO option pay and CEO risk-taking. Further, moderating effects were found for CEO duality, blockholder ownership, institutional ownership, and insider ownership. However, empirical analyses fail to provide adequate evidence to support the expected moderating effect of board independence. (c) 2021

This book analytically reviews the impact of the global anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) framework on the compliance trajectory of a number of jurisdictions to this framework. The work begins by examining the international financial sector reform and its evolution to inculcate the global framework for AML/CFT regulations. It challenges the resulting uniform AML/CFT due to its paradoxical impact on the compliance trajectory of African countries and emerging economies (ACs/EEs). This is done through an examination of the pre-conditions for effective regulation and compliance drivers for ACs/EEs that reveals the behavioural impact of the AML/CFT standards on the bloc of countries. Through the application of agency theory, it explores the relationship between ACs/EEs on the one hand and the international financial institutions that formulate, disseminate and facilitate compliance with the global framework for AML/CFT standards on the other. The remaining chapters review empirically the compliance pressures and resulting compliance trajectory of ACs/EEs with the AML/CFT standards. The final part of the book provides a detailed explanation of the compliance challenges of ACs/EEs and the legitimacy concerns that facilitate this. This book offers a new direction on the impact of global AML/CFT standards on ACs/EEs and contributes to the understanding of the conditions under which the global standards are likely to facilitate proactive compliance within these blocs of countries. As such it will be a valuable resource for academics, researchers and policy-makers working in this area. (c) 2021 Nkechikwu Valerie Azinge-Egbiri. All rights reserved.

This study attempts to examine the role of managers in the associated agency theory on dividend policy decisions for firms that do not skip dividend payments. This research sample considered the firms that are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and pay regular dividends on an annual basis from the financial year 2011 to 2020. Panel data econometric tools and robustness tests were carried out for model validation. The study results show that there is a higher positive relationship between change in payout ratio and managerial remuneration. Similarly, there is a large positive significance to increase manager incentive for regular payer firms with greater promoter control in higher dividend payout. Thus, this brings an agency theory perspective of rewarding well to managers to increase promoter wealth. Hence, policymakers can contemplate these findings to analyze the nexus between managers and promoters in the dividend policy of firms that never skip their dividend payments.

The disclosure level in the interim financial reporting is important to users when making business decisions. Useful information from interim financial reporting ensures timeliness and flexibility of business operations. Information disclosures that ensure completeness will enhance the quality of information for users. The paper aims to examine the factors of corporate governance that affect the disclosure level in interim financial reporting of Vietnamese commercial banks. To test the model, ordinary least squares (OLS) are used. For the data of this study, 286 samples of 30 commercial banks were studied and time series data were used for 10 years from 2010 to 2019. The results show that there are two factors that positively influence the disclosure level in interim financial reporting, such as the Board size and foreign Board members. Thus, the paper offers some policy recommendations for the Central bank of Vietnam and Boards of directors of commercial banks, as well as investors to improve disclosure in interim financial reporting.

International diversification and its effect on the firm remains a key theme in business literature. Yet how international diversification-firm performance (IDP) relationship is influenced by firms' ownership has not been adequately examined. This represents an important gap in the literature as owners differ significantly in motivations, capabilities, and governing styles. Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, agency theory, and institutional perspective, this study examines how ownership type impacts IDP relationship of a sample of 1074 publicly-listed Indian firms. Results suggest that family- and domestic corporate ownership positively moderates IDP relationship but foreign corporate ownership results in negative moderation. Results further suggest that domestic- and foreign financial institutional ownership imparts no statistically significant influence on IDP relationship. These findings are new to the literature. In conclusion, we discuss our study's implications and limitations and provide directions for future research. (c) Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

The uncertainty of outcomes from innovation typically affects related decision-making in family firms. Innovation presents both opportunities for business growth and investment risks, and the relationship between family firms and innovation remains inconclusive. Moreover, the interplay between family firm ownership and control rights may result in agency problems. Ownership by family members can be regarded as a real option for family shareholders. Thus, we combine agency theory and the real option view to argue that ownership structure characteristics among family members in board affect innovation in family firms. Examination of the innovation behaviors of Taiwanese family firms reveals that ownership concentration among family board directors positively influences innovation in family firms. In addition, family board directors without personal ownership in the family firm are more supportive of innovation than those who have such ownership. (c) 2021 IEEE.

The purpose of this study is to investigate capital structure in the Pakistani corporate sector in light of the interest rate gap with other countries and emerging Islamic banking in the country. The study investigates the effect of leverage on firm value (Tobin's Q) and how other variables impact this relationship. The study used the System-GMM-Fixed effect model for linear analysis and fixed effect panel threshold regression model by Hansen (1999) for quadratic analysis using data from non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock exchange for the period 2005 to 2019. The results show that there is a negative relation between leverage and the value of the firm. In contrast, debt and non-debt tax shields have a positive relationship with the value of the firm. The study also found that there is quadratic nature of leverage with the value of the firm. The study supports Trade-off theory, pecking order theory, while it doesn't support agency theory.

Despite the agency theory prescribes risk alignment effect of corporate governance through CEO ownership, the empirical inquiries into the relationship between CEO ownership and corporate risk-taking thus far yielded a mixed result. This study aims to examine the nuances of such a relationship in the presence of financial slack and technological opportunities by contingency models. The study employs the secondary data in a sample of S&P 1500 from 2006 to 2018.

Short-termism (i.e., the sub-optimal favouring of short-term performance over long-term performance) is generally explained as an outcome of the agency relationship whereby self-interested managers and/or stock market pressures distort the balance between short and long-term performance. We investigate if short-termism (Crilly, 2017; Reilly, Souder, & Ranucci, 2016) is due to cognitive bias (temporal distortion) rather than agency costs. We test these hypotheses with an experimental approach by applying a 3x2 factorial design to manipulate temporal distortion on 60 non-conflicted decision-makers. Results suggest that individuals make inconsistent investment decisions based on differing payout time horizons. Participants faced with simple comparisons between investment opportunities were consistent across different time periods and followed a model of rational decision-making. In contrast, more complex decisions led to intertemporal inconsistency. We provide evidence that: 1) individuals on the whole struggle to deal with incorporating time into business decisions in a consistent way causing us to question the link between short-termism and agency theory; 2) principals likely view investment decisions inconsistently across time and so are a cause of sub-optimal investment decision-making and 3) we need to look beyond studies of moral hazard associated with agency theory and/or myopic market pricing when investigating short-termism.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the effect of gender diversity and institutional ownership on earnings management in distribution industry sub-sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2017-2018. Research design, data and methodology: This research is case study research, where the population in this study are all distribution sub-sector companies listed on the IDX in 2017-2018. The sample selection technique used was purposive sampling and obtained 74 companies with the 2017-2018 research period. Multiple linear regression analysis was used in this study, using Stata 17. Results: The results of this study indicate that: 1) Gender diversity has a negative effect on earnings management. 2) Institutional ownership has a negative effect on earnings management. Conclusions: This study contributes to the agency theory where gender diversity and institutional ownership can reduce the agency conflict that the shrinkage of earnings management. These results indicate that companies in which there are female directors will reduce earnings management practices, this is due to the attitude of female directors who tend to avoid risk. The results also show that institutional ownership will also lead to reduced levels of earnings management, because institutional investors will increase its oversight of the company. (c) 2021.

The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship between government and public sector universities in the perspective of agency theory and propose a theoretical framework that will highlight the various aspects of the principle and agents. In this perspective government plays a main role as principal while public sector universities are as agent and this relationship is known as agency theory. This relationship normally has two major issues such as goal conflicts and information asymmetries. Correspondingly, in this review paper, systematic approach and content analysis approach have been adopted. The reviewed literature revealed that the government provides performance based grants to the public sector universities so government have pursued some expectations from public sector universities like accountability and transparency of the funds. Similarly, it has been highlighted that to verify the relationship between government and public sector universities in the context of agency theory because there is a sheer need to conduct empirical research studies.

Drawing on agency theory, we posit that agency costs are high for banks that frequently change CEOs and those that appoint CEOs from external sources. The results indicate firms that borrow from banks with high agency costs adopt less conservative accounting practices and employ real activities earnings management when deteriorating management conditions lead to negative cash flow. This study provides a strong empirical foundation for future research by verifying that appointment structure and tenure of bank CEOs affect borrowers' accounting choices.

How multinational enterprises (MNEs) coordinate and control their geographically dispersed subunits is central to international management research (Kostova, Nell, & Hoenen, 2018). Our study adopts agency rationales to evaluate the effects of headquarters (HQs)-subsidiary convergence on the performance levels of the latter. Convergence within organizations relies to a large amount on controls that predicate a specific extent of alignment. In theory, the concept of alignment is seen as a valid proxy of agency intensity (Eisenhardt, 1989). Drawing on the supposition that MNEs are differentiated networks, where some subsidiaries continue to function the traditional competence-exploiting role while others are competence-creating and augment the advantages of their home-base (Bjorkman, Barner-Rasmussen, & Li, 2004), alignment challenges can be manifested in six dimensions that define their strategic posture, span the organizational context and underly competitive imperatives: 1) subsidiary strategy, 2) culture, 3) governance practices, 4) financial decisions, 5) human resources, and 6) environmental activity. Drawing on a sample of 72 MNE foreign operations and gathering 254 responses from top management team (TMT) members, our results indicate that strategic, cultural, governance, and HR alignment are important determinants of subsidiary performance. However, whereas strategic, cultural, and governance convergence between HQs and subsidiaries are positively related to increased performance levels, an ethnocentric approach towards HR practices seems to trigger welfare losses.

This study aims to review 13 litertures to obtain an overview of the organizational structure and cultural capital which is the development of the theory of intellectual capital (intellectual capital) in relation to credit risk, efficiency and financial performance. The novelty of this researchis where cultural capital which is the development of intellectual capital is measured by the collective culture and organizational culture typical of VCI based on agency theory. Like other financial institutions, VCI operations cannot be separated from risks, including credit risk, which can affect the efficiency and financial performance of the VCI. The results show that for VCI management, this theory does not necessarily apply. Supervisor, VCI administrators and employees come from local customary villages who are generally very attached to their interests as citizens based on collective cultural thinking. Besides that, with its unique organizational structure, wherethe customary Bendesa directly acts as chairman of the supervisory board, it will color the VCI organizational culture which complements the spirit of the collective culture to achieve the VCI goals.

The most contentious element in debate regarding corporate governance is the association of corporate governance (CG) with firm performance. This research employed the 2SLS regression model on a panel data, collected from 24 Asian multinationals from 2006 to 2015. The firm performance was measured in two ways; accounting measure (ROA and sales growth) and market measure (Tobin's Q). The outcomes demonstrate that quality of corporate governance (QCG) index has a significant association in enhancing the performance of firms in Asian economies. Furthermore, these results also indicate that explicit corporate governance variables such as board independence, audit committee independence, ownership concentration and CEO duality, also have significant association with the performance of companies in Asian countries which is in accordance with the agency theory.

Risk management is a prevalent concept that underlines the value of providing good quality control and risk management functions to effectively monitor the corporate risk management framework. Previously, the MCCG 2007 mandated listed companies to include a risk management team in the internal audit committee to assess the efficacy of the organization's risk management, internal control, and governance process. However, due to recent corporate failures and ineffectiveness of audit committee to monitor firm performance, there is a growing need for a separate RMC. Thus, the purpose of the study is therefore to analyse the risk management committee's structure and effectiveness distinguishing two (2) models; a separate and combined RMC on the firm financial performances of listed companies in Malaysia. The research is based on a Static Panel data technique involving regression based on FEM, REM and Pooled Ordinary Least Square (OLS). The findings indicate that a company that set up an RMC consisting of a majority of independent non-executive directors, specifically a separate RMC, would significantly improve the firm's performance. The latter results support Agency Theory which suggests that independent non-executive directors enhanced the transparency of corporate boards as they improved the firm's compliance with the disclosure requirements.

This study aims to examine the role of supervisory board on internationalisation of Indonesia's listed companies. Based on the agency theory, supervisory board may improve the international company performance through company oversight. Specifically, this study investigates the effect of supervisory board composition, size, and expertise on international performance. The sample of this study is 61 manufacturing listed companies from 2012-2016 periods. The result shows that supervisory board composition has a positive and significant relationship with the company internationalisation. While, supervisory board size and expertise have no effect on company internationalisation. In addition, the company age and leverage also contribute to the internationalisation of companies.

Even though the Board of Commissioners has a significant role in making an optimal international decision, there is a limited empirical finding using data from the Unique Continental corporate governance system, such as Indonesia. This study examines the relationship between the Board of Commissioners diversity and service companies' international decision. Specifically, this study investigates the effect of ethnic, nationality, qualification, and experience diversity of Board of Commissioners on the international decision. A company with a high Board of Commissioners diversity tends to have more effective monitoring the Management Board and therefore reduce the agency cost and the company performance. Ninety-nine service companies listed in Indonesia's stock exchange has participated in this study. As this study using the multivariate regression analysis, the classical assumptions must be satisfied. The result shows that ethnic, qualification and experience diversity have a significant effect on the international decision. Besides, company size tends to have a better position to sell in the foreign market. A company with higher leverage is likely to have a higher international decision. Theoretically, this research implies that board governance diversity in a unique two-tier board model could also be explained by agency theory. This finding also shows that the company can increase the international decision by increasing the Board of Commissioners' qualification and experience diversity. However, the Board of Commissioners ethnic diversity should be reduced to increase the international decision. (c) 2021 Ascociacion Internacional de Economia Aplicada. All rights reserved.

Purpose: We examine how the net share purchases of top executives of acquiring firms, specifically the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Operating Officer (COO), can impact shareholder perceptions of a merger and acquisition (M&A) around the announcement time. Design/methodology/approach: Regression tests using the post-announcement cumulative returns as the dependent variables, and CEO and COO net purchases as independent test controlling for the net purchases of all other insiders, COO and CEO ownership, exercised options, unexercised exercisable options, merger type, pre-announcement firm size, past performance, industry growth, industry instability, year and industry fixed effects. The regression tests are used for various sub-samples (i.e. non-contemporaneous events, duality, operational complexity, economic conditions). Findings: We find that overall shareholders value the COO's net purchases before the announcement but not those of the CEOs. If the COO is also the CEO, then executive buy-ins appear to have a negative reaction from the shareholders. When the firm has many business segments or when the announcement is made in an economic recession, the COO's net purchases do not have a positive influence on the shareholders. Originality/value: We are the first to provide evidence that investors pay attention to the COO around M&A announcements. In the age of celebrity CEOs, who can instantaneously change the stock price with one press release, having another executive that can shape the opinion of investors can diversify the agency risk.

Theoretical literature provides different predictions on the relationship between multiple directorships and managerial ability (relationship). Therefore, we empirically investigate the relationship. We find that the relationship is generally negative and statistically significant but not economically significant, i.e., the relationship is very small. In this regard, we show that the relationship is negative (positive) and also statistically and economically significant for firms with high levels of monitoring (advising) needs. Furthermore, we show that the regulatory oversight (1) mitigates the general negative relationship; (2) changes the direction of relationship from negative to positive, for firms with high levels of monitoring needs; and (3) does not influence the relationship, for firms with high levels of advising needs. Collectively, the results suggest that the monitoring-advising needs and regulatory oversight are important factors in the analysis of the relationship. (c) 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The study examines the effect of board size, frequency of board meetings and frequency of audit committee meetings on the market value of 11 Jordanian commercial banks as measured by Tobin's Q. Random effect panel data regression is employed to test the study hypotheses. Results reveal that board size has a significant and negative effect on bank market value. Results also show that frequency of board meetings has no effect on bank value, while the frequency of audit committee meetings has a significant and positive effect on bank value. The results suggest that the argument of agency theory and resource independence theory towards the role of board and its committees in supporting firm value should be always combined with the appropriate size. Accordingly, one important implication of the study is that the selection of an appropriate number of board members and the prior effective preparation for their meetings are critical factors to enhance the value of banks in Jordan.

There is a growing concern towards full integrity of Halal food and its traceability as supply chains become global. This research identifies the current traceability challenges for the food supply chain in Malaysia to comply with Halal requirements. We position these challenges in the context of institutional theory and agency theory. Our manuscript directly addresses Duan et al.'s (2020) call for studies grounded in actual real-life data to address Blockchain implementation in Halal food chains. As such, we propose a novel traceability framework built on Blockchain derived from real-life Blockchain implementation in three distinct Halal supply chains. The technology with smart contract is proposed with inputs from three Blockchain software providers with the aim to create a conceptual framework that integrates both Halal processes and technologies to improve traceability of Halal food supply chain from farm to fork.

Over the last 2 decades, the literature on corporate governance and sustainability has increased substantially. In this study, we analyze 468 research studies published between 1999 and 2019 by employing three clustering analysis visualization techniques, namely keyword network clustering, co-citation network clustering, and overlay visualization. In addition, we provide a brief review of each cluster. We find that the number of published items that fall under our search criteria has grown over the years, having surged at various times including 2014. We identified three main thematic clusters, which we have called (1) corporate social responsibility and reporting, (2) corporate governance strategies, and (3) board composition. The weighted average years that major keywords appear in the literature published over the last 2 decades fall into a period of 4 years between 2014 and 2017. This is due to the massive increase in the number of publications on corporate governance and sustainability in recent years. By means of chronological analysis, we observe a transition from more abstract concepts--such as 'society,' 'ethics,' and 'responsibility'--to more tangible and actionable terms such as 'female director,' 'board size,' and 'independent director.' Our review suggests that corporate governance and sustainability literature is evolving from quite a conceptual approach to rather more strategic and practical studies, while its theoretical roots can be traced back to a number of foundational studies in stakeholder theory, agency theory and socio-political theories of voluntary disclosure.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the attributes of corporate boards in UK companies and their tendency to assure their corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports. Design/methodology/approach: From the agency theory perspective, the authors examine the impact of board attributes on the assurance of CSR reports for the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 350 during 2016-2019. The authors used annual integrated reports, companies' websites and Thomson Reuters Eikon database for data collection and the logistic regression for data analysis. Findings: The results confirm that some board attributes significantly influence a company's decision to assure its CSR reports. While board size, board tenure, the presence of female board members and female executive directors and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs)' global working experience positively contribute to CSR assurance (CSRA) decisions, the chairman's independence negatively contributes to it. However, board independence, board meetings and board financial expertise demonstrate no effect on the CSRA decision. Research limitations/implications: The authors focus on some attributes of board members, but the authors did not consider board diversity in its broader meaning. Moreover, the effect of board committees and their attributes on CSRA was not addressed. The authors also did not consider the impact of scope, the quality level of assurance service and the differences between assurance providers on companies' decisions to neither undertake CSRA nor choose between assurance providers. Practical implications: The study provides insights into the increasing demand on voluntary assurance to boost the credibility of CSR reports and the role of the board of directors (BOD) in taking this initiative. The findings highlight the importance of board diversity (e.g. gender) in improving transparency and sustainability reporting, which can help policymakers and regulators in shaping future governance policies. Additionally, the findings refer to a drawback in the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding the chairman's independence, which requires corrective actions from the Financial Reporting Council. The findings raise concern over the small share of audit firms in the assurance service market, despite the growing demand for these services in the UK, which may require more attention to these services from the audit firms. Social implications: Companies are increasingly pressurized, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, to discharge their accountability to stakeholders and to act in a socially responsible manner in their business activities. CSR reporting is one of the main tools that companies use to communicate their social activities. Understanding the determinants of voluntary CSRA helps to increase the credibility of CSR reports and the favorable response to social pressure. Originality/value: The authors add empirical evidence to the limited literature on CSRA about the role of the BOD in undertaking companies' social responsibility, improving CSR reporting and reducing information asymmetry. It also highlights the significance of maintaining a balanced BOD in terms of gender, experience and tenure, in minimizing the risk of perpetuating non-transparent integrated reporting.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the impact of ownership structure and board characteristics on dividend policy in the listed Turkish firms between 2013 and 2019. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the probability of paying dividends, dividend payout ratio and dividend yield measures. The suitable regression procedures (logit, probit and Tobit models) are used to examine the research hypotheses by focusing on a panel data set drawn from the Borsa Istanbul (BIST) 100 index, excluding financial and utility firms. Findings: The empirical findings indicate that institutional and concentrated ownerships are significant and positively associated with dividend payouts, whereas family ownership does not influence dividend policy. On the other end, board size is positive, while chief executive officer duality is negatively related to dividend policy. Additionally, the female directors and board independence are insignificant in influencing firms to pay high dividends. Research limitations/implications: Future researchers can validate this paper's findings by considering the stock dividends as well. Additionally, future researchers may investigate the relationship between these constructs by extending the sample size of firms listed on BIST or in other emerging markets. Practical implications: This study's findings may serve policymakers, regulators, investors and academic researchers to get valuable guidance from relevant literature. The Turkish firms may improve dividend policy by implementing the regulatory framework introduced by the Capital Markets Law in 2012 for effective monitoring and protecting the minority shareholders' rights. The controlling shareholders may alleviate principal-principal conflicts by ensuring the independence of directors and increasing the number of female directors according to the critical mass of at least 30% of board members. Originality/value: This study contributes to agency theory and signaling theory by considering ownership structure and board attributes among Turkish firms related to dividend payments.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of corporate governance attributes, in the form of board characteristics, on risk disclosures provided through integrated reporting (IR). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon an agency theory perspective, this study examines the effect of the main corporate governance board characteristics (size, gender diversity, independence and meeting frequency) on the level of risk disclosure provided by a sample of 95 IR adopters from 24 countries for 2018. Findings: The results suggest that firms are slow to realise IR's potential to produce innovations in risk disclosure mechanisms. In addition, certain board characteristics, such as gender diversity, independence of directors and meeting frequency, are positive drivers of the risk disclosure provided via IR. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on risk disclosure provided via IR. Connecting corporate governance mechanisms to IR risk disclosure practices can contribute to enhancing the practical and theoretical understanding of the role that the board of directors may play in stimulating transparency and accountability about risks via an alternative communication tool, IR, to the benefit of both investors and other stakeholders.

The role of corporate governance in performance of firms has been widely discussed in the extant literature. In contrast to examining direct relationships, this study investigates the mediating role of working capital management within these connections. Employing a large sample of nonfinancial firms listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange from 2009 to 2018, findings suggest that a corporate governance quality index and efficiency of working capital management are positively related to firm performance. Additionally, the results indicate that working capital management partially mediates the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. These findings extend existing literature by offering new empirical and theoretical insights. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study examines the relationship between the board of directors and cash holdings before and during the global financial crisis. We focus on the main demographic characteristics of the board: CEO duality, independent directors, and board size. Employing a sample of listed Italian industrial firms over the period 2003-2013, our empirical findings show the different behaviors of the members of the board of directors in determining cash holdings in normal conditions and during a crisis. In normal periods, in line with agency theory, a vigilant board--characterized by a high proportion of independent directors--reduces cash holdings. Diversely, the presence of CEO duality and larger boards increase cash holdings. In times of crisis, members of the board of directors abandon their monitoring duties or opportunistic behavior and become more participative to help the firm to survive. The results suggest that the effects of the board of directors' characteristics are contingent on a firm's external environment.

Purpose: The main aim of this study is to examine the effect of investment in outside governance monitoring (IOGM), through non-executive directors' remuneration (NEDR) and external audit fees (AFEE), on real earnings management (REM) in an emerging market in the Southeast Asia region, Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: The data comprises 1,056 observations from manufacturing companies listed on Bursa Malaysia for the four-year period, 2013 to 2016. The study tests IOGM individually and aggregately with REM. Feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) regression is used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results show that NEDR is negatively and significantly associated with REM. Likewise, AFEE is significantly associated with lower REM. Aggregate IOGM significantly mitigates REM. Additional tests conducted show consistent findings. Research limitations/implications: This evidence supports agency theory and signaling theory, that a high level of investment in governance monitoring signals a high demand for monitoring and fewer agency problems. It justifies more investment in outside scrutiny and monitoring to limit the existence of managers' opportunistic behavior in concentrated markets. This study relies on an aggregate measure of REM and focuses on manufacturing companies in Malaysia; thus, the results may not be the same using other measurements and samples. Originality/value: The study, to the best of the researchers' knowledge, is the first to document evidence in an emerging market suggesting that higher NEDR and AFEE are individually and aggregately associated with lower REM. Policymakers, shareholders and researchers may consider investment in these two mechanisms as a proxy of high-quality monitoring that mitigates REM. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Conventional wisdom leads to assert that good governance may underpin bank performance while bad governance destroys stability and soundness. We run a factor analysis to synthesize 23 bank board characteristics of the Eurostoxx banks into seven key features: independence, size, dedication, tenure, corporate governance quality, external perspective, competence, and diversity. We then use multiple regression and find that independence and board and committees size are the most relevant characteristics for banks risk-taking and in line with the agency theory, our results show that independence increases the solvency of banks, and size reduces it.

Interorganizational fraud, or fraud that occurs between organizations, is a critical component of supply chain fraud and supply chain relational risk, yet empirical evidence on the scale of interorganizational fraud and its antecedents remains scant. Despite its hidden nature, interorganizational fraud can have major implications for supply chain performance. Based on the theories of transaction cost economics, agency theory, and the fraud triangle, widely used in accounting and auditing research, five potential antecedents of supply chain fraud are considered and compared with reported losses due to interorganizational fraud. The data collected via a survey questionnaire with a sample of 151 supply chain employees in manufacturing demonstrate that informants estimated median losses due to interorganizational fraud to be 9% of their firm's total revenue. The most common types of fraud reported include product quality fraud, pricing/invoicing fraud, and corruption. Using a two-step generalized method of moments technique for estimation, the results found that transactional complexity, competitive pressures facing the supply chain, and weak firm ties were significantly related to interorganizational fraud, and that supply chain monitoring and ethical sourcing were not significantly related to interorganizational fraud. These findings contribute to the research on relational risk, supply chain risk management, and opportunism. (c) 1988-2012 IEEE.

In the "shareholder primacy" (SP) view of the modern corporation, shareholders are endowed with ownership rights over the corporation. This view stems from the property rights and agency theories of the business firm formulated by financial and business economists in the 1970s and 1980s, which subsequently fed into US corporate law debates. It relies on positive legal assumptions that have largely been debunked by legal scholars, and on normative economic ideas that are equally problematic. However, SP is still very influential - if not the dominant paradigm of corporate governance, especially in the United States. The goal of the present study is to come back to the theoretical debates around the foundations of the SP paradigm to seek to identify key ideational properties that may explain, in part, the resilience of such paradigm in policy, scholarship and business practice. In particular, this paper proposes that one important reason for the persistence of the SP ideology lies in the latter's foundation on the radically contingent nature of shareholders' claims over the corporation.

Purpose: This study aims to know whether board composition is effective in improving firm performance and particularly to determine whether this relationship varies across different levels of performance, that is, companies with very low performance, low performance, moderate performance, high performance and very high performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a data set covering 213 Indian companies registered on S&P Bombay Stock Exchange 500 Index over the period 2001 to 2019 by using Tobin's Q as a performance parameter. The study applies the quantile regression technique and compares the results with fixed effect generalized least squares (GLS) regression. Findings: The findings reveal that board size positively affects the company's performance across all quantiles. Independent directors negatively impact the performance of companies across all quantiles. However, the strength of these relationships increases with increase in performance, thereby supporting agency theory and stewardship theory, respectively. The effect of executive directors on the performance of the companies varies across quantiles. The effect is adverse at moderate and high quantiles only. Practical implications: The findings provide some grounds for regulators to exercise caution while designing board composition guidelines, keeping in mind the unique internal environment of each company which ultimately affects their performance levels. Similarly, Indian companies are also suggested to compose their boards keeping in mind their performance levels. Originality/value: The study contributes towards the debate on the board composition and firm performance relationship by adding to the agency theory and stewardship theory that all the companies cannot have the similar board composition. Rather its composition depends upon the performance levels of the companies. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

While past research on minority acquisitions has ignored how agency conflicts could prevent acquirers from realizing value creation opportunities, this study investigates whether principal-agent and principal-principal conflicts with the target's managers and controlling shareholder hinder acquirers' ability to capture value from acquisitions of non-controlling equity stakes. Using archival data from a global sample of 443 minority acquisitions announced between 2011 and 2019, we found that cumulative abnormal returns are positively associated to minority shareholder protection and negatively associated to the presence of a strong controlling shareholder in the target firm. We also found that acquisitions of small non-controlling equity stakes amplify the negative effect of the strong controlling shareholder, which instead weakens if acquirers purchase large non-controlling equity stakes. This study contributes to the development of our understanding of the conditions that expose acquirers to value losses from minority acquisitions by examining the intricate bundle of agency conflicts with the target's managers and controlling shareholder. In so doing, this study also provides useful insights to business practice. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

This paper presents an examination of the relationship between the presence and composition of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee on the corporate governance board and CSR decoupling. Using a sample of listed firms drawn from 41 countries, we found that the presence of a CSR committee on the corporate board is negatively associated with CSR decoupling. We also noted that the nature of the industry to which a firm belongs, a firm's level of CSR orientation, and corporate governance quality strengthen such association. Further analysis of the relationship between the structure of the CSR committee and CSR decoupling shows that larger CSR committee size and a greater independence and longer tenure of its members negatively affect CSR decoupling. Our results are robust to various alternative specifications and offer important research and managerial implications. The findings of this study contribute to the growing literature on corporate governance and CSR. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

Digital technologies are increasingly changing the nature of competition and generating externalities that impact society. On the one hand, digitalization allows organizations to create substantial economic value in shorter periods of time through improved economies of scale, scope, and learning, resulting is increasing returns on capital and competitive concentration. On the other hand, ensuing societal concerns with inequities, regulatory lapses, and lack of transparency and truthfulness represent significant challenges for effective corporate governance. This article addresses the consequences to stakeholders that emerge from the digital economy, discussing how traditional governance mechanisms are ill-equipped to subvert negative externalities. We offer a stewardship-based model of corporate governance as a solution to the pressing problems plaguing consumers, employees, and other salient stakeholders of digital business excesses, with an emphasis on truthful disclosures, enhanced transparency, improvements in equitable allocation of organizational resources, and heightened trust relationships. The focus is on the positive role that organizational leaders can play as exemplars of virtuous stewardship in a highly networked society. The article redefines a modern view of stewardship in a digital economy and applies its principles to the four Ts of virtuous stewardship, a practical corporate governance model that encompasses truthfulness, transparency, trust, and technological equity.

We use a sample of French firms over the period 2001-2017 to investigate the relationship between board gender diversity and related-party transactions (RPTs). Although some of these transactions are efficient, RPTs are usually perceived negatively by outsiders because of the existence of conflict-of-interest transactions deemed to be value-destroying. Based on agency theory and managerial power theory, we argue that female directors have the ability and motivation to challenge managers' use of RPTs. Consistently with this argument, we find that board gender diversity negatively correlates with the number of reported RPTs. This negative correlation is driven by female directors involved in the board's monitoring duties (female independent directors and members of the audit committee). However, because they are less likely to be able to challenge managers, female inside directors do not affect the occurrence of RPTs. In January 2011, the French regulator enacted a gender quota law resulting in a significant increase in female board representativeness. We find that the marginal effect after enacting the gender quota law on the number of reported RPTs is negative for the proportion of female independent directors and female audit committee members, and positive for female inside directors.

CEO pay has gone through remarkable changes over the past two decades. The most striking new features have been the increased use of stock options in the early 2000s, and of restricted stock since then. Both forms of stock-based compensation are intended to resolve the agency problem that occurs when CEOs do not act in the best interests of stockholders, but each has its advantages and limitations. In this instalment of Organizational Performance, we discuss the history of their use and similarities and differences between the two, and argue that both are often overused. Bonuses based on strategic goals, on the other hand, may be underused. We conclude with a contextual approach to guide boards of directors in making choices among the forms of CEO compensation--stock options, restricted stock, salary, and bonus--to incentivize CEOs to work toward maximizing organizational performance. Briefly, stock options are most appropriate for growth firms, and restricted stock for stable firms. Both forms of stock-based compensation are more appropriate for new than for long-tenured CEOs.

Purpose: Using agency theory and impression management theory, this study examines the impact of financial performance (FP) and corporate governance (CG) mechanisms on the extent of intellectual capital disclosures (ICDs) and the three components within the CEO statement - human capital (HC), structural capital (SC) and relational capital (RC). Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a sample of non-financial SPF-120 French listed firms to capture the relevant variables; it collects data for 2010-2017, using a panel data technique to run the random effects regressions. Findings: The study finds that FP, measured using both market (Tobin's q) and accounting (return on equity and return on assets) indicators, plays a vital role in the extent of ICDs and the three components in the CEO statement published by SPF-120 companies. This confirms its impact on the decision-making needs of stakeholders. Among the CG mechanisms, this study finds that cultural diversity and gender diversity affect some ICD components. Moreover, CEO characteristics such as age, education and role duality affect ICD, while institutional ownership drives the extent of such disclosures. Practical implications: Our findings have comprehensive implications for managers of French listed firms, the Autorite des Marches Financiers, and stakeholders in general. Originality/value: This study provides significant insights by investigating the impact of FP, CG and company characteristics on the extent of the ICDs published in CEO statements.

Purpose: The main purpose of the study is to analyze the impact of research and development (R&D) expenditure on firm performance and firm value in an emerging economy. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, firm performance is examined by firm financial performance (return on asset (ROA) and return on equity (ROE)) and market performance (Tobin's Q (TBQ)). This study conducted a multivariate analysis on the sampled data using pooled ordinary least square (OLS) regression method. In addition, both the level and lagged models have been used to test hypothesis in order to get the results. Findings: All the empirical results from different models found significant and positive association of R&D expenditure with firm performance and firm value. The study also validates that all results are robust and free from outliers and multicollinearity issues. Research limitations/implications: Most of the studies regarding the R&D expenditure and its impact were conducted on developed countries addressing only firm performance. Whereby, this study examined the impact of R&D expenditure on both firm's financial performance and market performance as well as firm value in the context of an emerging economy. Practical implications: The outcomes of the study will enable the entrepreneurs, managers, investors and policymakers with more confidence to invest in R&D expenditure that will also ensure the organizational sustainability in the long run. Originality/value: Most of the prior studies regarding the R&D expenditure and its impact were conducted on developed countries addressing only firm performance. Herein, both firm's financial performance and market performance along with firm value have been analyzed in the context of an emerging economy. This paper is unique empirical research study due to different institutional and regulatory setting as well as corporate characteristics. This study strongly advocates the organizational learning theory, agency theory and resource-based view theory of firms' allocation of funds for future growth and innovation.

Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to the discussion on the executives' team and firm performance by investigating the relationships between executives' compensation, management gender diversity and firm financial performance in growth enterprises market (GEM) listed firms in China. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from 461 companies listed on GEM boards during the period from the year 2016 to 2018. Specifically, executives' compensation and female executives are set as the independent variables, and the proxy selected of corporate performance is Tobin's Q ratio. Findings: The results show that the correlation between corporate performance and executive cash payment is not significant, while executives' equity-based compensation shows a significant positive correlation with firm performance. In addition, the participation of female executives is negatively associated with firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The results have practical implications for governments, policymakers and regulatory authorities, by indicating the importance of women to corporate success. In particular, the findings of this paper emphasize the specific background of GEM in China and provide empirical support for the value of women's participation in corporate governance. In addition, the finding on the relationship between executive compensation and corporate performance of GEM listed companies provides guidance for the establishment of a performance compensation system of GEM listed companies in China. Originality/value: This paper provides new evidence for the current literature of executive team and corporate performance. This is the first paper to adopt triangulation in theories from different disciplines including optimal contractual approach, managerial power approach as new perspectives of agency theory, upper echelons theory, motivational-hygiene theory and women leadership style theory. The results will contribute to provide guidance for enterprises to formulate an efficient compensation system and build a reasonable senior management team structure.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the nexus between gender-diverse boards and cost of debt in the developing economies context. Specifically, the authors examine whether firm size moderates the relationship between female board representation and cost of debt, regardless of the industry type. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use panel data from 17 non-financial listed Ghanaian firms over the period 2007-2017, ordinary least square, two-stage least square and generalised method of moments estimations to test the hypothesis. Findings: The authors find that board gender diversity is positively related to cost of debt. Further evidence suggests the interaction of firm size and board gender diversity displays a negative association with cost of debt. Practical implications: The study evidence suggests larger non-manufacturing firms with gender-diverse boards attract lower cost of capital in an environment with lax enforcement of rules and regulations in corporate governance. Social implications: Lenders consider the size and industry of firms in pricing debt. This has implications on UN Goal 5, highlighting that shareholders of larger non-manufacturing firms benefit immensely from board gender diversity in the context of debt. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the board gender diversity and cost of debt literature by demonstrating that firm size and industry type matter in the developing economies context.

This paper investigates the relationship between earnings management and financial performance of firms in Anglophone sub-Saharan African Countries in a dynamic framework. The study shows how this relationship is moderated by aggregate disclosure and best-practice corporate governance quality metrics. The findings indicate that earnings management's performance effects persist even after controlling for dynamic endogeneity, simultaneity, and unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity inherent in the earnings management and performance relationship. Again, the results support the prediction of agency theory regarding the efficient monitoring effect of adherence to best-practice internal governance systems in constraining firms' earnings management practices and subsequently enhancing firms' performance. Moreover, the study's findings regarding the positive effect of earnings management on performance, which suggests efficiency motives behind earnings management practices in Africa, demonstrate that the African context is uniquely different from other emerging markets that report opportunistic motives. Concerning the moderating role, our study reveals that the positive effect of earnings management on the financial performance of firms tends to be stronger in the presence of corporate governance quality.

Supplier audits are frequently criticized for lacking authenticity and objectivity. Technology-enhanced audits (TEA) offer a potential solution to supplier audit problems by enabling enhanced analytical, visualization, modeling, and predictive capabilities. This paper explores the potential of Industry 4.0 practices in enhancing supplier audit authenticity and efficacy, as well as reducing supplier monitoring costs. The application of Industry 4.0 in supplier auditing is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper adopts an exploratory approach building on an extensive review of the literature. The paper builds upon an inductive-deductive approach to explore how the individual technologies underlying Industry 4.0 can be leveraged to enhance supplier audits. Based on insights from the literature, the paper develops propositions outlining the role of Industry 4.0 in supplier audit authenticity, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. The paper builds arguments against the backdrop of traditional audits' limitations and illustrates how TEA can overcome many of these limitations. TEA can enhance the authenticity and efficacy of supplier audits, while also reducing supplier monitoring costs. TEA are most effective in an Industry 4.0 environment where the use of technologies is supported with governance structures. The application of Industry 4.0 can make supplier audits more transparent and value-adding, benefiting both the buyer and supplier. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are explored. Suppliers can leverage TEA to create opportunities for strategic differentiation, enhance transparency and trust, and stand out from those who view audits solely as a cost. Buyers can use TEA to enhance audit efficacy, enhance insights into supplier operations, cut monitoring costs, and improve their competitiveness. TEA is a new generation of supplier auditing that has the potential to bring fundamental changes to current auditing models and make audits genuine, authentic, prospective, and insightful while building on Industry 4.0 principles.

Concentrated ownership implies greater alignment between ownership and control, mitigating the agency problem. However, it may also engender governance challenges such as funds appropriation through related party transactions and the oppression of minority shareholders, especially in the context of weak legal systems. We draw from legal theory (the tradeoff controlling shareholder model and private benefits of control) and from organization theory (socioemotional wealth), to suggest that concentrated ownership can be beneficial in both robust and weak legal systems for different reasons. We advance theory on the effects of controlling shareholders and suggest that the longer-term outlook associated with engaged concentrated ownership can aid the shift of the corporation toward Berle and Means' (1932, p. 355) "third possibility" of corporations serving the interests of not just the stockholders or management but also of society.

Financial statement analysts are concerned about the earnings power of companies, thus reliable information from a quality external audit and financial reporting is important as it will have an effect on the performances of GCC companies. On that note, underpinned by the agency theory, this study examines the effects of financial reporting quality, audit quality, and earnings power on companies' performances of the six Arabian GCC countries (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates). Company performance is measured using the accounting measures, i.e., return on assets and market-to-book value (ROA, M/B) and the market measures (Tobin's Q, EPS). The data sample of this study covers the period between 2013 and 2017, (pre-covid-19), across 191 companies, using 1337 company-years observations. The study uses EGLS Panel Data Regression analysis. The results of the study indicate that earnings power, audit quality, and financial reporting quality have positive effects on companies' performance. The agency theory confirms that financial reporting quality and audit quality increases the reliability of financial statements and decreases information asymmetry. (c) 2022 The Author

In this study, we examine whether and how managers' intentions to raise equity are associated with future stock price crash risk. Therefore, we apply modern information retrieval techniques to corporate textual disclosures by constructing document embeddings that preserve contextual relationships in managers' discussions on liquidity and capital resources. Using these document embeddings, we construct a continuous measure of managers' intentions to raise equity. We document that the search for equity is associated with higher future stock price crash risk. Further analyses suggest that managers with stronger intentions to raise equity are more likely to block negative news flow and that these intentions reinforce the effects of earnings manipulation and textual obfuscation on stock price crash risk. In summary, our results suggest that managers' search for equity incentivises managerial bad news hoarding. (c) 2022, The Author(s).

Studies find that oil-rich African countries (OACs) suffer slow socio-economic growth and development. The petroleum operations in these countries are also primarily in the hands of multinational corporations (MNCs). Motivated by their profit maximisation prospects (PMPs), the MNCs face significant corporate social responsibility (CSR) dilemmas with reference to their contribution to the socio-economic growth of these African economies. Even though there are few studies on CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP) within the African context, little or no attention has been paid to how and the extent to which MNCs' PMPs, CSR and CFP interact to affect the socio-economic growth of OACs. Drawing from legitimacy, institutional, and agency theories we employ a panel data approach covering 14 years (2003-2017) to understand the drivers of these PMPs, how PMPs affect corporate ethical considerations, and CFP and their implications on OACs' socio-economic growth. We find that PMPs of MNCs within OACs impede their CSR commitment. There is a significant positive relationship between CSR and CFP; efficient CSR practices impact CFP positively, and MNCs' contribution to OACs' socio-economic growth is significantly constrained by weak institutional environments. We conclude that institutional reforms and strategic investment in CSR could foster rapid socio-economic growth and development within OACs. Our study contributes to policy and knowledge on MNC's PMPs, CSR practices, CFP and literature on business ethics and the natural resource-curse. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd

This study examines the effect of voluntary disclosure in annual reports on tax avoidance activities. The agency theory of tax avoidance suggests that tax sheltering is associated with important agency costs, underlining the importance of corporate governance mechanisms such as voluntary disclosure in shaping tax planning. Using a sample of 3448 firm-year observations of French listed firms over 2007-2013, the results show that voluntary disclosure is associated with lower tax avoidance activities, providing evidence that this disclosure can be seen as an effective monitoring tool that reduces the insiders' likelihood to engage in rent extraction through tax avoidance activities. The results also indicate that the negative effect of voluntary disclosure on tax avoidance is significant only when family control is below 40%, suggesting that the disciplinary role of voluntary disclosure is limited to firms with relatively low family control levels. Overall, our findings are consistent with the agency theory of tax avoidance and highlight the important role of corporate disclosure in improving corporate governance.

Purpose: The study aimed to examine the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on the performance of Egyptian firms listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX) between 2014 and 2016. Design/methodology/approach: We relied on agency theory and resource dependence theory to generate testable hypotheses and capture the empirical findings. We regressed various performance measures (Return on Assets; Asset Utilization Ratio, Tobin's Q) regarding governance mechanisms (institutional ownership, managerial ownership, board size, board frequent meetings, the presence of non-executive directors and female directors) while controlling for firm size, leverage, years of listing and market share. The study uses ordinary least square (OLS) and two stages least square (2SLS) regression analysis to address the possible endogenous impact of the firms' ownership structure. Findings: Board gender diversity, the managerial ownership and frequent board meetings positively influence the Egyptian firms' efficiency measured by assets utilization, while the institutional ownership and board size have negative effects. When using Tobin's Q, the managerial ownership shows a negative effect while institutional ownership and board size present positive effects. When using 2SLS regression, findings remained stable whereas non-executive directors showed a significant negative association with assets utilization. Practical implications: Policy makers are recommended to draft policies related to limiting the number of board members, diluting the government's indirect ownership of firms, empowering women in boardrooms and developing the skills needed for non-executive directors. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, our study is one of very few that address firms' performance after a period of political instability accompanied by a greater role for females in the boardrooms of Egypt.

Purpose: This study aims to explore the moderating role of board gender diversity (BGD) in the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms (i.e. board size, board independence, chief executive officer (CEO) gender, CEO duality and ownership concentration) and firm risk-taking. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 192 non-financial publicly traded Italian firms over 2014-2018, this study tests the proposed research hypotheses and assess the moderating effect of BGD. Findings: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study finds a significant relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm risk-taking, which is significantly moderated by BGD. BGD accentuates the negative effect of board size, independent directors, CEO gender and CEO duality on firm systematic risk and attenuates the positive impact of CEO duality on firm unsystematic risk. The results, which are consistent with the risk-reduction effect of BGD, are robust to the use of alternative measures of firm risk-taking. Practical implications: Women's presence on corporate boards plays a critical role in the board's involvement in risk-taking. Hence, investors and stakeholders should consider women on corporate boards as a crucial risk-mitigating factor. Originality/value: This paper contributes to our knowledge on risk management by demonstrating the moderating role of BGD while relating corporate governance mechanisms and firm risk-taking.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between board gender diversity and private firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the association between board gender diversity and private firm performance by estimating pooled multivariate regressions using an unbalanced panel data set of 115,253 firm-year observations. Findings: The authors find that younger, less busy and local women directors enhance private firm performance. Firms with 40% or more women directors report triple the economic benefits compared to boards with at least 20% women directors. Considering firm size, women directors significantly increase small firm profitability, and the effect is more pronounced for high-risk firms. Greater board gender diversity enhances small firm performance as the monitoring role of women directors benefits the firm even in the presence of busy men directors. Consistent with the agency theory framework, the authors find that women directors improve small firm profitability in the presence of agency costs. Research limitations/implications: Due to the lack of availability of data about private firms, many factors are not directly observable. The analysis uses accounting-based performance measures that may be subject to managerial discretion. Nevertheless, the authors report highly significant results using cash-based performance measures that substantiate the overall findings. Practical implications: The results of the present study point to the need for private firms to increase board gender diversity and consider women director busyness, age, nationality and firm size when making board director appointments. Originality/value: This study adds to the scarce existent literature investigating private firms. The results contribute to the understanding of gender-diverse boards as well as the attributes of women directors that enhance private firm performance. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the role of earnings management in the relationship between firm performance and capital structure, dividing earnings management into discretionary and nondiscretionary accruals to test established theories on the capital structure. Using data on 802 companies in the member countries of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), our findings reveal that, in the absence of earnings management, the relationship between the capital structure and firm performance follows the trade-off theory or the pecking-order theory. Our results are consistent with agency theory only through managers' intervention via earnings management. In India, substantial opportunistic behavior in discretionary accruals is observed, and management seems to focus on manipulating capital structure performance in opportunistic ways. Furthermore, discretionary earnings are focused more on hiding asset inefficiency that arises from forced increases in firm size, reducing earnings risk. These practices reduce the impact of the capital structure on firm performance. This study has vital implications for debt managers and performance analysts in APTA member countries. Rather than testing the applicability in a traditional way, this study recommends dividing earnings management into discretionary and nondiscretionary accruals to test capital structure theories. Because nondiscretionary accruals play a dominant role in earnings management, firm behavior is consistent with trade-off or pecking-order theory, as seen in patterns in the relationship between the capital structure and firm performance, whereas agency theory holds only after external intervention by managers in terms of earnings management.

Purpose: The study aims to identify the impact of board characteristics (BC) on a firm's environmental performance, and provides future research directions in the area of BC impact on environmental disclosures (ED) in case of India's environmentally sensitive and non-sensitive industries (SI and NSI). Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect firm-level data from Prowess and Bloomberg, which cover 1,158 firm-year observations from National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) 500 listed companies from 2015 to 2020, and use a dynamic panel regression analysis to get deeper insights on the relationship of ED and BC. Findings: The study found that lagged environment disclosure score is positively and significantly associated with current environmental disclosure scores. The presence of sustainability committee, board size and frequency of meetings has a positive and significant association with ED for sensitive as well as non-sensitive industry groups. Factors such as board Independence, board gender diversity and CEO duality have no significant impact on ED of both sensitive and non-sensitive industry groups. Originality/value: Based on agency theory and stakeholder theory authors study for the first time in the context of India the effect of BC on ED using a large sample and covering an extensive period of six years. This study contributes by offering deep insights about the impact in case of "environmentally sensitive, non-sensitive and also all industries case". The findings of this study are valuable for corporate managers and regulators who are interested in improving ED practices through a better-governed corporate mechanism.

Previous research suggests that investment-cash flow sensitivity (ICS) has arisen from agency costs. This study investigates whether equity-based compensation (EBC) reduces these costs. We find that ICS is lower when companies grant EBC to chief executive officers (CEOs). EBC with long-term vesting periods, and especially with graded vesting conditions, is associated with a lower ICS. EBC with performance hurdles is associated with higher sensitivity. However, when the performance hurdles are set as a relative market index rather than an absolute target, the sensitivity becomes lower. Our results suggest that appropriately designed EBC plays an important role in mitigating investment-related agency problems. (c) 2021 Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential influence of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms on audit risk in Tunisian companies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of Tunisian non-financial firms listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange (TSE) over the periods 2005 to 2010 (pre- 2011 revolution) and 2011 to 2017 (post -2011 revolution), consisting of 371 observations for the whole period, the authors apply the generalized least square (GLS) to test the research hypotheses and model. Findings: The results are consistent with the agency theory suggesting that efficient corporate governance is able to control and reduce a company's agency problem. Evidence reveals that the effectiveness of the director's board/ownership structure and audit quality have the most influence on audit risk before than after the 2011 revolution, although governance mechanisms should play a more active role in encouraging companies to be more transparent in the post-revolution period. Moreover these findings are confirmed when identifying a composite measure of corporate governance. Practical implications: Significant implications are provided for analysts, investors, regulators and academics. First, findings can help Tunisian regulators determine corporate governance disclosure requirements. Second, this research will make investors and stakeholders aware of the fact that minimizing auditor risk will be effective in reducing agency problems in emerging markets like Tunisia. Then, this work can help researchers better understand and realize the corporate governance role in the quality of audit process and financial statements and encourage them to deeply and broadly investigate this issue on other emerging markets. Originality/value: This study stands for an extension of the existing research on corporate governance and audit risk. It fills a research gap in the local context. In fact, the considered data are those of the pre- and post-revolution Tunisian market, mainly in periods of instability. Although emerging markets make up the vast majority of economic activity around the world, they have received limited attention in academic research. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Corporate governance has received substantial scholarly attention for decades, although the focus of this research has by and large been on publicly traded for-profit organizations. However, agency problems are increasingly recognized in nonprofits. As such, we examine the application of corporate governance logic in the context of nonprofits. Our study relies on nearly a decade of data spanning 6853 US-based charities and comprising nearly US$346 billion in total revenue. Our results show that common corporate governance practices--such as independent boards, chief executive officer oversight, and transparency--enhance the degree to which donor contributions are allocated toward a charity's mission. Overall, we assess the broader applicability and benefits of corporate governance and build on literature highlighting links between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In doing so, we demonstrate the usefulness of governance in this economically and socially consequential context. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the relationship between internal audit functions (IAF) and financial reporting quality (FRQ) and whether such a relationship is moderated by senior management support (SMS) in listed companies in Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). Design/methodology/approach: This research is a cross-sectional study, using primary data in the form of a survey sent to 175 listed companies in NSE. A total of 149 questionnaires have been collected and analysed out of which 97 were found to be useful and used in the final analysis. Findings: The findings indicate a positive and significant relationship between internal audit qualities of work performed, internal control activities, coordination between internal and external auditors and FRQ and this finding was also supported by SMS as a moderator. However, the results show a negative and insignificant relationship between internal audit competency, organisational status and FRQ. Research limitations/implications: The findings support the assumption with regard to agency theory. The board should support the IAF to serve as an effective monitoring mechanism in minimising opportunistic management actions. Regulators should also ensure adequate structures that will strengthen the organisational status of the internal auditors to perform towards improving FRQ. Originality/value: The study contributes to the existing literature by assessing the effect of IAF on FRQ as moderated by SMS. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the impact of gender diversity on sustainability growth, and moderating role of family ownership in an emerging economy, Pakistan. We employed 3730 firm-year observations, comprising of 307 non-financial firms listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange, over a period 2008-2020. Using framework of agency theory, resource dependence theory and social identity theory, we report that gender diversity results in higher sustainable growth in our sample firms. Further, our results indicate that due to strong identification of family owners with their firms, their presence positively moderates this relationship. Overall, we report that despite of a weak corporate governance mechanism, the presence of female directors and family owners results in higher firm growth and low agency conflicts, which serve as positive signals for the investors. Our study provides empirical support to mandatory appointment of female directors on boards and urge the policymakers to focus on capacity building of female workforce.

Building on agency and resource dependence theories, we study the relationship between the value of initial public offerings and the extent of board independence, which we find to be an inverted U-shape: beyond a certain threshold, board independence becomes excessive. Consistent with agency theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced when ownership and control rights are separated. Consistent with resource dependence theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced in companies with higher industry diversification and less pronounced when the roles of the CEO and president of the board of directors are separated.

This paper aims to systematically review the existing studies of corporate governance with organisational performance in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and put forward theories, research methods, topics, and variables that emerge from the review. The systematic literature review is based on 42 peer-reviewed journal articles on the topic written by reputable academics on the Science Direct Database focused on corporate governance, board characteristics, and ownership structure. This study's conceptual framework is based on agency theory, which is the most widely used to analyse corporate governance (Fama & Jensen, 1983; Jensen & Meckling, 1976). The majority of results show a positive correlation between corporate governance and organisational performance (Pucheta-Martinez & Gallego-Alvarez, 2020) with agency theory being the most utilised theory of choice (Bergh, Ketchen, Orlandi, Heugens, & Boyd, 2019; Panda & Leepsa, 2017). This paper undertakes a significant thorough systematic review of corporate governance with firm performance and the Fourth Industrial Revolution literature. It gives an 11-year review with a reference index from 2011 to 2021, useful for both academics and professionals. This study recommends more evidence-based systematic reviews for different aspects and within different regions. It is further recommended to expand geographical spread across all continents to cover corporate governance area and to improve studies related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and its impact on corporate governance. Lastly, it is recommended that more studies that look at the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on corporate governance and firm performance should be performed. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Horizontal logistics collaboration can increase environmental sustainability and reduce shipping costs. Given these benefits--and the fact that few shippers actually opt to collaborate--public sector agencies and industry associations have attempted to sponsor and support the facilitation of horizontal logistics collaboration projects over the past 20 years. The literature, however, has yet to reveal the fact that these efforts have largely failed. Here, we introduce systematic horizontal logistics collaboration and apply Ostrom's theory of the commons and agency theory to extract antecedents on why these projects failed. We present a multiple-case study on unsuccessful horizontal logistics collaboration projects in Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. We address a gap in supply chain literature with regard to systematic collaboration; we also demonstrate the utility of commons theory in the supply chain domain and contribute to the literature on supply chain collaboration with facilitators. Finally, we discuss managerial implications, both for the practitioners attempting systematic horizontal logistics collaboration and for the policymakers seeking to promote it. (c) 2021 The Authors.

This study examines the effectiveness of audit committee (AC) financial expertise in mitigating accrual and real earnings management (AEM and REM hereafter). Although extant studies have examined the effects of AC expertise on earnings management, findings are inconclusive. Prior studies have also focused mainly on AEM not REM. We used the data for a sample of Hong Kong Hang Seng Composite Index with 1714 firm-year observations between 2010 and 2015, which was analyzed using panel fixed effect regression models. The results show statistically significant negative relationship between AC financial expertise and AEM but surprisingly, we find that AC financial expertise is associated with increase in REM. We argue that whilst AC members have developed monitoring skills on AEM, REMs are relatively recent and are more complicated to detect. We argue that management may be shifting their opportunistic use of earnings management from AEM to REM. A possible reason could be a steep AC's learning curve on the nature of REM. Our investigation provides evidence on the impact of AC expertise on both AEM and REM from a unique context. (c) 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Purpose: In view of the current climate change emergency and the growing importance of the climate-related accountability of companies, this paper aims to advance a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of carbon-related chief executive officer (CEO) compensation. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the agency-theoretical perspective on executive compensation and existing work in the fields of management, corporate governance, cultural studies, and behavioral science, this paper derives a multilevel framework of the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation. Findings: This paper maps the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation at the societal, organizational, group, and individual levels of analysis. It also provides research propositions on the determinants that can support and challenge the implementation of this instrument of environmental corporate governance. Originality/value: In the past literature, the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation have remained largely unexplored. This paper contributes to the academic discussion on environmental corporate governance by showcasing the role of interlinkages among the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation and the possible countervailing impacts. In view of the complex interdisciplinary nature of climate change impact, this paper encourages businesses practitioners and regulators to intensify their climate change mitigation efforts and delineates the levers at their disposal.

Purpose: This study draws on resource dependence theory (RDT) to explain a board's governance function in the United States (US) nonprofit healthcare industry. Specifically, while various nonprofit research studies have appealed to agency theory (AT) to explain the monitoring role of an outside board, RDT offers an alternative explanation that emphasizes an outside board's resource gathering role. Design/methodology/approach: In drawing on the nonprofit GuideStar database, a fixed effect (FE) panel estimation was conducted on a sample of 230 US Non Profit Healthcare Organizations (NPHCOs). This panel estimation examines the relationship between the composition of an outside board and an NPHCO's revenue and public support performance. Findings: A key finding of this study is that the composition of an outside board involving its' number, compensation and gender impacts an NPHCO's revenue and public support. Research limitations/implications: This study shows that the composition of an outside board impacts an NPHCO's ability to gain access to external resources. As NPHCOs face increasing pressure to seek external forms of revenue support, this study suggests that boards should favor a larger number, compensation and female representation of outside members. Practical implications: The composition of an outsider board can offer external sources of revenue support that lower the poor's requirements for financial assistance and thus affirm an NPHCO's identity as a charitable organization. Originality/value: As an NPHCO's identity as a charitable organization is dependent on serving the medical needs of the poor, an outside board not only introduces a resource gathering function that is absent in the monitoring explanations of AT, but that this resource gathering function is important to affirming this identity.

This study contributes with an integrated understanding of SME capital structure patterns at the nexus of internal (firm-specific) and external environment determinants. The hypotheses draw on pecking order theory (POT), agency theory, and business cycle theories, and estimates are obtained from a data panel of 424 UK SMEs, over a ten-year period. Furthermore, the findings and discussion draw on both static and dynamic models of capital structure. The results between the static and the dynamic model are qualitatively similar, illustrating that firms change their capital structure over time, which is consistent with the POT and agency theory. In contrast to previous results on capital structure choices, the present study reveals that size relates to long-term debt borrowing only in the short-term, and SME growth is not positively linked with gearing ratios. The findings also offer evidence that support macroeconomic conditions as having a nonlinear, convex relationship with the gearing ratios of the sample firms.

This study is relevant because it examines the determinants of corruption in local governments that have a negative impact on the success of sustainable development. This study aims to examine the effect of New Public Management (NPM), as measured by fiscal decentralization, financial reporting quality and independent audits, on the level of corruption. The sample consisted of 433 local governments in Indonesia based on data from 2011-2017. PLS-SEM was used as a data analysis technique. The results test shows that fiscal decentralization positively affects corruption with a path coefficient of 0.19 and a p-value of 0.004. The quality of financial reporting has a negative effect on the level of corruption with a coefficient of -0.26 and a p-value < 0.001. Hypotheses testing results also show that audit finding positively affects corruption with a coefficient of 0.10 and a p-value < 0.10. On the other hand, follow-up audit results have no significant effect on corruption with a p-value > 0.10. This study concludes that the NPM mechanism in the form of fiscal decentralization positively affects corruption. These results imply that fiscal decentralization needs to be balanced with good governance, among others, by increasing the quality of financial reports and independent audits.

IMPACT: This article has multiple implications for state-owned hospitals. The authors show that state-owned hospitals will try to meet the financial targets required by the supervisory authorities. When the central government expects a certain financial outlook, hospitals will manage their accounts to comply with these expectations. Oversight authorities and legislators need to be aware of this tendency and its implications for audits. The article identifies the factors that affect the manipulation of earnings so that strategies can be set to predict and avoid such behaviours. ABSTRACT Using agency theory, this article evaluates the extent to which Greek state-owned hospitals followed earnings management techniques to affect reported earnings and which accrual accounts are relevant to explain discretionary accruals. Covering the period from 2009-2019, the analysis reveals that the Greek state-owned hospitals try to report small surpluses. Accrual-based accounts and changes in their value between successive years provide evidence of relevance for earnings management. (c) 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Previous corporate governance research has paid little attention to the role of chief executive officer (CEO) labor markets in controlling CEO behaviors because the CEO labor market has been considered inefficient. With the increasing mobility of top executives across firms, however, the potential of CEO labor markets to serve as an external disciplining force has been growing. In this study, we argue that CEOs will be more pressured to engage in desirable behaviors as the CEO labor market becomes more efficient. Using a longitudinal sample of S&P 1500 firms in high-technology industries in United States from 2011 to 2019, we found that CEOs tend to increase R&D investment as CEO labor market supply increases. We also found that the tendency is greater when external CEO succession is more frequent in the market. Our results demonstrate that CEO labor markets have the potential to function as an effective external governance mechanism. Copyright (c) The Author(s), 2022.

This paper investigates the role of corporate governance in China's outward foreign direct investment (ODI) using a sample of Chinese public firms over the period 2009-2015. Different from previous studies, which mainly use country-level aggregate data to examine China's ODI behavior, this study utilizes firm-level data to explore the impact of corporate governance on firms' ODI decision making. Building on the integration of agency theory and foreign direct investment theories, the study finds that ownership concentration, share ownership, and executive compensation significantly influence China's ODI flows in both full-sample and sub-sample estimations. The corporate governance has an essential effect on firms' ODI flows in that the firms with better corporate governance are more interested in undertaking ODI projects. The results are robust across different sample periods and in both state-owned and non-state-owned firm sub-groups. The government may design some policies such as friendly tax regulations to stimulate private firms to invest overseas. (c) 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland

This study examines the effect of board size on the economic impact of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the US. Using a hand-collected dataset of 508 M&A between 2012 and 2018, we find that board size is negatively related to acquirer excess returns. In an additional analysis, we show that large boards have positive value implications for banks that combine the CEO and chairman roles as well as for large banks. Our findings indicate that a "one-size-fits-all" approach to board size is not necessarily in the interests of shareholders; instead, a more flexible and proactive formulation is needed.

Prior research has found that corporate political activity (CPA) can both positively and negatively impact firm performance. Combining agency theory with the resource-based view, we examine the relationship between domestic lobbying (a key form of CPA) and firm performance by explicating the moderating effects of international and product diversification. We argue that expansion into international and product markets increases a firm's resources and reduces agency costs in domestic lobbying. Our results, based on a sample of 737 firms, show that lobbying is positively associated with performance for firms that are diversified in both international markets and along product-lines; whereas lobbying is counter-productive for purely domestic and undiversified firms. Our results contribute to the literature on the firm performance implications of corporate political activity by highlighting the roles of international and product diversification.

India has recently witnessed a set of banking frauds, pointing toward the possibility of loose corporate governance mechanisms in the banking sector. The present study aimed to evaluate the composition of the board of directors in terms of the corporate governance parameters to assess whether they impacted the performance of the listed Indian banks. The hypothesis for the same was formulated based on the agency and the resource dependency theory. The study made use of the 34 public as well as private sector banks listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange 500 for a period of 12 years (2010-2022). The analysis was conducted using the STATA software's fixed-effect panel data regression model. The results suggested that board size, percentage of women directors, and percentage of independent directors on the board of banks impacted the financial performance of these banks. The study shed light on the mechanism and ways to improve bank performance using corporate governance parameters. It makes valuable contributions to the literature on corporate governance and shall be helpful for both managers and policymakers in formulating regulatory guidelines.

This study investigates the determinants of dividend pay-out of listed firms in Pakistan from the year 2011 to 2015. The focus of the study is the life cycle theory of dividends, agency theory and signaling theory. Corporate governance indicators, firm efficiency and cash flow volatility are the main determinants used in this study. This study also includes eight corporate governance indicators namely insider ownership, ownership concentration, institutional ownership, board independence, board size, CEO duality, audit committee independence and remuneration committee. It is found that ownership concentration, institutional ownership, CEO duality, firm efficiency and cash flow volatility are the significant determinants of dividend pay-out in Pakistan. It is also found that growth opportunities significantly moderate the impact of ownership concentration, institutional ownership, CEO duality, firm efficiency, cash flow volatility on the dividend pay-out. This research is among the pioneer studies which examine the impact of firm efficiency on dividend pay-out. Likewise, the study is among the first attempts to incorporate growth opportunities as moderating variable in the relationship between corporate governance indicators, firm efficiency and cash flow volatility with dividend pay-out. Results show that the management of an efficient firm pays a high dividend to increase its reputation in the market. Furthermore, the negative signaling effect of dividend omission may not exist for efficient firms. It implies that efficient firms at their growth stage may also skip dividends.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the significance of board gender diversity (BGD) on the firm's intellectual capital (IC) performance of 272 Indian firms listed on the National Stock Exchange during 2007-2019. Considering the recent regulatory amendment by the Indian regulatory system (Security Exchange Board of India, 2018) which mandates at least one female independent directors on boards of all listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on theories and literature reviews, hypotheses were developed. This paper uses the proportion of female director on board and proportion of female independent directors to measure BGD and modified value-added intellectual coefficient (MVAIC) methodology to measure firms' IC performance. Two-step system-generalised method of moment panel data regression analysis has been employed to identify the variables that significantly affect IC performance. Findings: This paper finds female representation on boards has a significant impact on MVAIC; capital employed efficiency shows the strongest association with female directors on board, followed by structural capital efficiency and human capital efficiency, while relational capital efficiency shows no significant effect. The results further demonstrate that female independent director has a significant but negative impact on IC. Research limitations/implications: As the study is limited to the listed firms of an emerging economy with a mandatory female quota for boards. Thus to increase the generalizability of findings, future research can be extended to include all listed and non-listed firms from another emerging economy with a mandatory female quota. Practical implications: From the practical perspective, this study bridges the gap between theory and practice in terms of providing a deeper understanding to the policymakers and Indian regulatory bodies like the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Securities Exchange Board on the importance of including female members on board as a vital contributing factor for leveraging firm's intangible performance. Originality/value: Using resource dependency theory and agency, this study extends the literature on IC efficiency and female representation on boards by presenting the research outcome for Indian listed firms. This paper, addressing the recent changes introduced by Indian regulators and using the female independent directors on board, is amongst the first attempts to assess the relevance of BGD and IC performance. This issue has still not been discussed and analysed by researchers in India. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

MICE Tourism is a segment of the tourism industry that deals with the organisation of Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions, which are experiencing a major process of disintermediation. This article applies the principal-agent problem in the theory of agency to analyse MICE disintermediation. It uses a dominant/sequential qual-QUAN mixed methods approach. Firstly, through interviews with MICE professionals to validate the research variables, test sample and questionnaire. Then, quantitative research using a survey sent to 365 MICE stakeholders in Europe. The opinions of hoteliers were compared with those of other MICE stakeholders to analyse disintermediation and determine the role of hoteliers in this new scenario. Our findings confirm a trend of partial disintermediation in which hotel bookings are the most disintermediated service and hoteliers are the stakeholders that pose a more proactive and aggressive attitude towards disintermediation. This paper is of interest for MICE stakeholders to better understand their position in the value chain and interpret the process of disintermediation. Its originality is based on the fact that it gathers the opinions of all MICE agents with a special focus on the perspective of its most dominant actor: the hotel. (c) 2022, Universidad de Huelva.

We investigate the relationship between firm whistleblower governance and audit pricing of Australian listed financial firms over the 2008-2018 period. Consistent with agency and organisational justice theoretical tenets, we find that firms that exhibit stronger whistleblower governance incur lower audit fees. We find that the negative association between strength in whistleblower governance and firms' audit fees is more pronounced for firms that are exposed to increased litigation risk, and for firms having an anti-fraud policy. Our results are robust to endogeneity tests including difference-in-difference (DID), two-stage least squares (2SLS) and propensity score matching (PSM) analyses.

This study aimed to analyze the influence of board characteristics on the quality of risk disclosures in integrated annual reports of banks in India. Integrated reports support organizations in controlling risks, identifying opportunities, connecting risks with business policies, developing business models, and contributing to the value creation process. In February 2017, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) recommended the adoption of an integrated reporting (IR) framework by the top 500 companies in India on a voluntary basis from 2017-18. Considering the relevance of integrated reporting and its underlying benefits to various stakeholders, banks have primarily adopted the IR framework and started publishing their annual reports in line with the IR principles. Using content analysis on the sample of 30 banks listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India, the efficacy of risk disclosures, the outlook orientation (past, present, and future), approaches to risk (positive, neutral, and negative) were investigated, and the influence of attributes of board of directors on the quality of risk disclosure was examined. On examining 4,183 sentences concerning risk disclosures by Indian banks, the results showed a positive relationship between board size, diversity, independence, meetings, and education background in accounting/finance with risk disclosure quality (RDQ). Also, it was found that integrated reporters tended to disclose more risks and suggested ways to mitigate those risks compared to non-adopters. (c) 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

This paper uses new and unique bank-level data to investigate whether board governance determines executives' remuneration and if the pay-governance relationship changes across bank ownership groups in India. The findings based on dynamic pay model estimated using two-step system GMM approach reveal that (i) past pay levels hold significant predicting power for the future level of executives' pay, (ii) executive remuneration is significantly responsive to forward-looking market-based profitability measures, and (iii) individual board attributes play a significant role in pay setting in the Indian banking industry. Frequent board meetings and a more significant proportion of female directors on board moderate the executive remuneration packages. The results further infer that the board's monitoring abilities considerably differ across ownership groups, with boards play a more prominent role in private banks, while boards of public sector banks lack adequate autonomy to determine executives' pay. The results validate the "managerial power" approach, suggesting that any weaknesses in governance structure (especially in private banks) may inhibit bank boards from effectively performing their monitoring functions in optimal pay fixation.

Not-for-profit organisations are increasingly being held to account for their social performance. Due to their resource dependency, they generally rely on external financial resources to ensure their missions. This alternative is usually coupled with social accountability requirements from private investors. Given their externally induced nature, social accountability initiatives might result in the implementation of management control systems imported from for-profit organisations without any real consideration - and, consequently, leading to an oversimplification - of the social sector's characteristics and complexities. Relying on both agency and stewardship theories, we consider how to reconcile external reporting obligations with the characteristics of non-profit organisations. To this end, we use a single qualitative case study of a social organisation responsible for housing services, which recently introduced a reporting system to meet its private investors' external requirements. We stress the potential risks of implementing an agency theory-based system in a social context and maintain that the expected accountability targets are unlikely to be reached. We also make recommendations to improve the current system by drafting new metrics. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Multinational corporations (MNCs) are considered as dispersed structures of power, in which diverse headquarters (HQ)-subsidiary power relationships collectively influence performance and management. Yet, few studies have accounted for the subsidiary portfolio characteristics shaped by the entire set of differentiated HQ-subsidiary power relationships, and little is known about their effect on the performance and management decisions of MNCs. Drawing on agency and resource dependence theories, this study investigates how the power structure of the MNC, or the pattern of power distribution in the subsidiary portfolio, affects MNC performance and expatriate utilization. Results from a comprehensive panel of Korean MNCs show that the degree of power concentration in the subsidiary portfolio has inverted U-shaped relationships with MNC performance and the use of expatriate control. However, the results also reveal that these relationships vary between manufacturing and downstream subsidiary portfolios. These findings suggest that the structural characteristics of the subsidiary portfolio are important determinants of MNC performance and management. This study opens an important new avenue for international business scholarship by explicitly conceptualizing the MNC as a portfolio of differentiated subsidiaries and by examining the consequences of the subsidiary portfolio characteristics.

Board director independence is critical to achieving and maintaining control to address the agency theory-based issue of interest misalignment between the principal (the organization) and the executives (agent). However, theoretical and empirical research and strategic risk considerations have brought into question the role or relevance that director independence plays in these control task and agency theory domains. We ask, using a quantitative survey method, whether board activity-based applications of independence may be associated with the service task of the board, namely its resource dependence mission. Our findings suggest that the resource dependence duty of the board may be positively associated with some autonomous activities, and yet other activities might be driven primarily by normative practices. Based on this, we suggest that a theoretical scope beyond and greater than agency theory may be needed when reassessing the role of director independence.

Within MNCs' foreign subsidiaries financial slack, i.e., uncommitted financial resources in excess of those needed for current operations, may incur costs for headquarters. These costs may emanate from subsidiaries' decision to forego investment opportunities and stockpile cash instead, which, in turn, may lead to fewer resources being available for redistribution within the organization. From an agency theory perspective, headquarters can minimize these costs through monitoring mechanisms. While agency theory is considered theoretically appropriate for the study of the headquarters-subsidiary relationship, it reflects a rather undersocialized manifestation of human behaviour, which in turn limits its applicability. In this paper, we attempt to address this limitation by suggesting and empirically exploring that the effect of monitoring mechanisms is dependent (1) on the different types of monitoring used, and (2) on subsidiaries' external embeddedness. Drawing on empirical evidence from 94 subsidiaries of foreign multinationals operating in Greece, we provide some initial evidence on the differential impact of monitoring through expatriates and monitoring through bureaucratic processes. Most importantly, we show that subsidiaries' structural embeddedness moderates both associations. In doing so, we reveal that whether subsidiaries behave opportunistically or as good citizens is partially determined by the social context in which they are embedded. An unexpected finding concerns the positive effect of the origin of the CEO on subsidiaries' financial slack for expatriates compared to local managers. This finding underscores the importance of the CEO identity, and highlights the need for future research exploring its effect on subsidiaries' performance. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

This study seeks to analyse the direct association between earnings management (EM), earnings quality (EQ) and the cost of equity capital (CoEC). It also studies the mediating role of EQ and the moderating role of board gender diversity (BGD) in the context of the EM-CoEC nexus. Contradictions in the results of earlier investigations inspired the current study, with the findings filling a gap in the existing literature. This study presented a novel empirical model based on a mediation-moderation model, which sheds light on the mechanism of effect of numerous factors on the CoEC. The findings of this study reveal that the influence of EM practices on EQ is negative. Furthermore, the impact of EM practices on CoEC was positively significant, implying that the more EM practices there were, the higher the CoEC. At the same time, the findings show that EQ has a negative significant influence on CoEC. Additional findings confirm that EQ fully mediates the EM practices-CoEC nexus. Following that, in terms of BGD's moderating role, the findings indicate that BGD has a significant negative impact on CoEC, and the interaction impact (EM x BGD) is positive and significant.

This research aims to analyze the impact of board gender diversity on dividend payments in Indonesia. Indonesia is one of the emerging economies. Some of the institutional specificities of emerging economies are the lack of protection of minority shareholders' rights, and market uncertainty may increase agency problems that raise doubts about future cash flows such as dividend payments. This research uses the data of listed firms from Indonesia Stock Exchange over the period 2013-2016. The data collection method uses purposive sampling. Indonesia implements a two-tier system that has directors and commissioners. We find evidence indicating that women directors are negatively related to the dividend payment, while women commissioners have positively related to the dividend payment. Moreover, we find that women independent directors, women executive directors, and women executive commissioners are positively associated with dividend payments, while women independent commissioners do not have an effect on dividend payments. The sample in this study is limited because the payment of dividends is not a necessity. This study provides the view that board gender diversity can create systems that make better decisions and encourage women to have a chance to participate in top management.

Purpose: While there is an increased demand from various corporate stakeholders on the need for public companies to have risk management frameworks as well as a stand-alone risk management committee to mitigate risks and simultaneously improve performance, this study investigates the effects of the risk management committee attributes on firm performance, and the role of board size is highlighted on this relationship in Malaysian listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: Both accounting- and market-based performance measures have been used for measuring performance. A dynamic model using the generalized method of moments (GMM) has been employed to control for potential endogeneity, simultaneity and unobserved heterogeneity. Findings: The findings reveal that risk management committee attributes such as size, independence and meetings negatively affect book-based performance measures and positively affect market-based performance measures. Moreover, board size positively moderates the risk management committee attributes and performance relationship. The study embraces the predictions of agency theory and resource dependence theory. Practical implications: The findings are practically significant for Bursa Malaysia, Securities Commission Malaysia to assess the compliance of the Corporate Governance Code (MCCG, 2017) and for academia to further explore significant relationships in other emerging economies. Originality/value: The paper contributes to multiple aspects: first, it studies the impact of risk management committee attributes on firm performance; second, it investigates the moderating effect of board size on RMC-performance relationship; in the end, the study employs dynamic modeling for estimation process to avoid dynamic endogeneity considered a main econometric problem for CG-performance relationships.

Purpose: Capitalizing on a unique measure of takeover susceptibility principally based on the staggered implementation of state laws, this study aims to explore the takeover market's effect on managerial ownership. The market for corporate control, often known as the takeover market, is an important external governance mechanism, whereas managerial ownership is a vital internal governance instrument. Managerial ownership brings into convergence the interests of shareholders and managers. The originality of this study arises from the usage of state-level anti-takeover legislations as a measure which is beyond the control of firms and plausibly exogenous to firm-specific characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: In addition to the standard regression analysis, this study also executes a variety of robustness checks to minimize endogeneity, i.e. propensity score matching, entropy balancing, instrumental-variable analysis, Lewbel's (2012) heteroscedastic identification and Oster's (2019) testing for coefficient stability. Findings: Based on a large sample of US firms, the results show that more hostile takeover threats bring about significantly lower managerial ownership. The results reinforce the prediction of the substitution hypothesis. The disciplinary function of the takeover market reduces agency conflict to the point where managerial ownership is less necessary as a governance mechanism. Specifically, a rise in takeover susceptibility by one standard deviation diminishes managerial ownership by 7.22%. Originality/value: `To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to shed light on the impact of the takeover market on managerial ownership using a novel measure mainly based on the staggered adoption of state laws, which are plausibly exogenous to individual firms' characteristics. Consequently, unlike prior research, this study is more likely to indicate a causal effect, rather than merely a correlation. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Management research has emphasized the effects of slack resources on the decision-makers' strategic choices. Behavioral theorists have argued for a positive effect of slack through encouraging search and innovation while agency theorists have emphasized that slack can accentuate the principal-agent problem, which negatively affects firm performance. This paper aims to extend this argument and empirically investigate the separate effects of three types of slack resources (i.e. available, recoverable and potential) on firm performance in an important emerging market, namely, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Design/methodology/approach: The two-step system generalized method of moments (Sys-GMM) is applied to a panel of 360 firms in the six GCC countries, namely, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain, over the period between 1999 and 2019. Findings: The authors find that available and potential slack are both negatively associated with firm performance. The relationship between recoverable slack and performance is quadratic (inverse U-shaped) where recoverable slack improves performance only up to a specific point, but after that level, recoverable slack starts to negatively affect the performance of the firm. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature in three important ways. First, this paper advances a first attempt to differentiate between three separate types of slack on firm performance in the context of the GCC market. Second, this paper empirically investigates the presence of the principal-agent problem in the GCC market and relates it to the ongoing debate on the agency effects of slack resources. Finally, this paper underlines the effects of institutional frameworks and environments on the relationship between slack resources and firm performance. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper explores the impact of cash holdings on stock returns in small and medium enterprises. The sample includes 24 SMEs listed on the Egyptian Nile Exchange, excluding service firms, with a total of 96 observations from 2016 to 2019. Data was collected from financial statements and reports obtained through an information dissemination company in Egypt. This study uses a panel data analysis with comparing all results via ordinary least squares and the generalized method of moments. The findings show a statistically significant negative effect of cash holding on stock returns in small and medium enterprises on the Egyptian Nile Exchange. Further, the evidence shows that firms with higher levels of cash holding have higher investment alternatives and then lower stock returns. This result supports the agency theory that an increase in cash holding leads to managers exploiting cash resources to achieve personal benefits, thus increasing agency costs, lowering investment efficiency, and therefore lowering stock returns. The results support the trade-off between risk and return by using cash holding to finance operational activities and investing in higher investment alternatives and then lower stock returns.

In the wake of technological innovation, supply chain transparency has become a concrete avenue for long-awaited improvements to supply chain processes and practices. Transparency is of particular interest to Supply Chain Finance; however, it is yet empirically unknown whether and how benefits would materialise. Being at the interface of finance and operations, Supply Chain Finance aims at improving the inter-company management of financial flows. Nowadays, different financing schemes are offered foremost by cooperation between financial institutions and fintechs. Uncertainty remains on whether and how supply chain transparency would benefit these schemes to allow the adoption of more sophisticated, higher-value schemes. By applying the Gioia method, we analysed a series of interviews with experts from the Supply Chain Finance industry regarding transaction cost economics, agency theory, and dynamic capability. The resulting series of pragmatic, theory-grounded but practice-inspired propositions untangle the relationship and barriers between supply chain transparency and Supply Chain Finance. The propositions provide advances in the theoretical understanding of Supply Chain Finance and uncover relevant directions for future research. This poses the base for actionable results in future research and leads to an impact in research by addressing the concerns and tensions raised by Supply Chain Finance experts.

Purpose: Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are notoriously prone to disputes among stakeholders, some of which may unduly jeopardize contract performance. Contract disputes arising in Iran are often due to inefficiency of PPP concession agreements and practice. This study presents a causal-predictive model of the root causes and preventive measures for inter-organization disputes to enhance the likelihood of achieving desirable performance in PPP projects. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical "causal-predictive" model was developed with fourteen hypotheses based on extant literature and contractual agency theory, which resulted in the creation of a pool of 110 published items. Data were obtained from a questionnaire survey with 75 valid responses, completed by 4 stratified groups of Iranian PPP experts. Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used for validating the proposed model via a case study. Findings: Results reveal that the main three factors of PPP desirable performance are as follows: on-time project completion, high quality of activities/products and services for public satisfaction. Further, the most influential factors of the lifecycle problems, construction stage, and preferred risk allocation included risk misallocation, improper payment mechanism and failure to facilitate a timely approval process. Originality/value: For researchers, the findings contribute to the theory of contractual agency; specifically, how different influences among the model's elements lead to better PPP performance. In practical terms, proposed outcome-based strategies will inform PPP stakeholders to avoid dispute occurrence and thus improve the time, quality and services of projects.

Background: Over the last few decades, with the emergence of integrated reporting (IR) and sustainability reporting (SR) as new reporting methods, corporate reporting practices attracted substantial interest as a topic of research. Throughout the literature, many theories have been adopted to explain IR and SR practices and there is currently an increased focus on non-financial reporting. Aim: The purpose of this study is to identify and analyse the theories used in the growing body of IR and SR research, to gather insight into current trends in the use and dominance of these theories in the related literature. Setting: Research articles in the Scopus database for the period spanning from 2010 to 2019 were included in the study. Method: Using a systematic review methodology, 574 articles on IR and SR published in the Scopus database for the period spanning from 2010 to 2019, were systematically searched for the presence of theories that may be used to explain these practices. Results: The results show that the most dominant theories in the last decade are the legitimacy, stakeholder, institutional, agency and signalling theories. Conclusion: Supported by extensive numerical data, this research provides insights into the theoretical perspectives used in the study of IR and SR and contributes to the existing discourse surrounding applicable theoretical frameworks for studying corporate reporting practices. These insights can be used to study IR and SR as the world grapples with changes in the reporting and business environment. (c) 2022. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.

Purpose: In this study, the authors explore the effects of politically controlled boards on bank loan performance in both state-owned commercial banks (SCBs) and private sector commercial banks (PCBs) in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: The data consist of 409 bank-year observations from 46 sample SCBs and PCBs of Bangladesh for the period 2008-17. The authors apply ordinary least squares pooled regression with year fixed effect for baseline econometric analyses and generalized method of moments regression for robustness tests after addressing the endogeneity issue. Findings: The regression results reveal that the presence of bank "boards controlled by politically affiliated directors" (PA) have significant positive effects on non-performing loans (NPLs). Similarly, the presence of "boards controlled by politically affiliated directors without substantial ownership interests" (PAWOI) show positive association with NPLs. In contrast, the presence of "boards controlled by politically affiliated directors with substantial ownership interests" (PAOI) exhibit an inverse relationship with NPLs. These findings support 'agency conflict' arguments and document that both PA and PAWOI are detrimental to bank loan performance in Bangladesh, while PAOI do not have significant effect on increasing NPLs. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing bank governance literature by providing evidence from an emerging economy perspective, where politically affiliated directors (PADs) exploit their positions for personal and/or political gain at the cost of other stakeholders by taking advantage of relaxed regulatory oversights and investor protections.

In the trend of globalization, profit is always a concern for companies because the competition is increasingly fierce. With accounting tools and policies, managers of companies can perform profit management. The purpose of this paper is to test the influence of the board of directors on the discretionary accruals in Vietnamese listed companies. The paper uses time series of table data. The sample includes 915 observations of 183 Vietnamese non-financial companies in the period from 2016 to 2020. The feasible generalized least squares method is used to test the hypotheses of the research model. The paper uses two foundational theories, including the agency theory and the signaling theory, to explain the discretionary accruals of Vietnamese listed companies. The results show that the independence of the board of directors, the meetings of the board of directors, and the foreigners in the board of directors influence the discretionary accruals in Vietnamese listed companies. Then, the paper proposes some appropriate policies on regulations to control the discretionary accruals in Vietnamese listed companies to improve the quality of accounting information in the context of regional and international economic integration.

This study developed a model that can be used to differentiate between fraudulent and non-fraudulent reports and helps the auditor to identify and assess material misstatement risk due to fraud. This model was based on the three stages of the fraud triangle, as well as on the agency theory and stakeholder theory. To develop the model, we used a sample that consists on a group of Portuguese companies that show evidence of fraud and another group of companies without evidence of fraud. Logistic regression results showed a positive relation between fraudulent financial statements and: companies need of higher financing, that represented the pressure to commit fraud; operations ineffectiveness, when the relative weight of accounts receivable is greater when compared to assets, which constituted the opportunity to commit fraud; and higher management turnover, which was characterised by managers who showed predisposition to commit fraud (rationalisation).

Purpose: There is still an ongoing debate on the value relevance of capital structure and its determinants. Recently the issue has been explored in family firms after being explored in mature firms. This paper investigates the role of institutional investors and the firm's innovation activity in influencing the firm's decision and ability to acquire debt capital. Design/methodology/approach: A large sample of 700 privately-held family firms in Italy from 2010 to 2019. Two analysis techniques are used: panel analysis and path analysis. The value of debt and the debt ratio are used as leverage measures. The value of patent (as a proxy for innovation) and institutional investor are the explanatory variables. Findings: The results show that institutional investors have no relationship with financial leverage measures except when controlling for an interaction variable (Institutional investors x Lombardy region). The patent value is positively correlated with debt; however, the ratio patent-to-asset is negatively related to financial leverage indicating higher risk exposure. The nonlinearity test demonstrates a turning point when the relationship between patent value and debt inverts. Practical implications: Firms should monitor their innovation activity since excessive innovation increases risk exposure and affects financing opportunities and value. The involvement of institutional investors does not always enhance value. Originality/value: Existing literature focuses separately on family firm innovations and financial leverage as outcome variables, emphasizing the role of institutional investors in both fields by adopting agency theory and socioemotional wealth framework. In this study, the authors go further by merging both relationships, investigating the dynamics of the institutional-family firm innovation relationship in influencing the firm's capital structure. The authors contribute to the ongoing debate by providing original findings on capital structure, governance and innovation, supported by rigorous methods to enhance family firms' decision-making.

In this paper, we investigated the impact of financial leverage on investment decisions on a sample of 811 firms from ten emerging South-Eastern European countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Croatia, Greece, Romania, North Macedonia, Slovenia, Serbia and Turkey). We apply a panel regression model involving investment ratio as a dependent variable, leverage as independent variable, and control for several firm characteristics that closely determines the corporate investments. The results of the analysis show that leverage is negatively related to investment in the companies in SEE. But only long term debt has a stronger negative impact on investment for firms with low growth opportunities than for firms with high growth opportunities. These findings show supportive evidence of agency theories of corporate leverage, especially with the debt overhang theory, but did not give strong validation that leverage has a disciplining role for firms with low growth opportunities in SEE emerging markets. In addition to leverage, we found that corporate investments in the SEE countries decrease significantly with tangibility and the company size. Corporate investments in the SEE countries increase significantly with cash flow, sales, non-debt tax shield and profitability. Overall, the results slightly defer with those from the research on the case of developed markets. (c) 2022.

This study examines how the board of directors (BOD) of Islamic banks (IBs) might affect earnings management differently, compared to BOD of conventional banks (CBs). Our results indicate that banks in the MENA region that promote BOD independence incur less earnings management. Distinguishing between CBs and IBs, we document higher loan quality and credit policy at IBs. Moreover, smaller BOD size and board independence decrease earnings management at IBs. Findings suggest that agency theory might not accommodate the agency conflicts at IBs, since it neglects stakeholders' behavioural patterns. Thus, these results suggest the need to shape directors' financial acumen at IBs. (c) 2021 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.

Choosing between different compensation strategies is one of the major concerns of owners in construction contracts. This paper is aimed at examining the choice between behavior-based and outcome-based payment types through the views of practitioners from construction projects with variables defined by agency theory. The study adopts the analysis of data through the Delphi technique supported by factor analysis and multinomial logistic regressions to test the paper hypotheses. The paper shows that in projects with a high level of contractor risk aversion, outcome uncertainty, task programmability, and information systems, cost-plus-fee payment is more attractive than lump-sum payment. Conversely, the paper shows that in projects with a high level of goal conflict and outcome measurability, lump-sum payment is more attractive than cost-plus-fee payment. The results demonstrate the practical usefulness of agency theory in the arena of construction management. The contribution of this paper lies in providing insights into choosing an appropriate contract payment type based on agency theory parameters. (c) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: This study examines the effect of board characteristics on earnings management and the moderating effect of gender diversity over this nexus by investigating 393 Bursa Malaysia listed companies from 2014 to 2018. Design/Methodology/Approach: This study applies the performance-adjusted Jones model (Dechow et al., 1996) and the performance-matched Jones model (Kothari et al., 2005) to measure accrual-based earnings management. Research findings: Based on the results, the agency theory fails to illustrate that board characteristics (i.e., defined by the attributes of board independence, board size, and non-CEO duality) are effective in reducing earnings management. On the other hand, the results show that gender diversity in independent directorship and board membership apparently reduces the level of earnings management. However, this research finds no significant moderating effect of gender diversity on the relationship between CEO duality and earnings management. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study adds to the literature by demonstrating that the application of agency theory does not have a significant impact on reducing earnings management in the Malaysian context. Applying gender socialisation theory, the findings of this study show successful moderation of gender diversity in terms of reducing the level of earnings management. Practitioner/Policy implication: The results on gender diversity are likely of interest to policymakers to come up with regulations related to ensuring an increasing presence of female directors in the boardrooms to increase the board gender diversity. Research limitation: This study examines only three board characteristics under corporate governance, and measures only accrual-based earnings management. Moreover, the sample is restricted to only non-financial listed companies. (c) 2022, Faculty of Business and Economics,University of Malaya. All rights reserved.

This study examines the association among the effectiveness of audit committee, arrangement of internal audit function (IAF), and financial reporting lag (FRL). It also expands the literature by exploring the effect of IAF sourcing arrangement on financial reporting lag. Financial reporting lag is measured based on the number of days between the dates of the financial year end to the date of announcement of financial reporting. The effectiveness of the audit committee consists of size, independence, meetings, experts, and the chairperson's qualifications. The internal audit arrangement is either performed in-house or outsourced to a third-party internal audit service provider and the cost of incurred for the IAF in the financial year. The agency theory is applied to explain the framework of this study and tested on 2,284 Malaysian listed companies from 2012 to 2015. Results show that IAF sourcing arrangement and cost are significantly associated with financial report lag. These findings offer important implications on audit committee and IAF literature through improving the timeliness of financial information.

Purpose: This study aims to analyse whether theories and views of classical Islamic scholars are widely adopted as references in Islamic accounting and finance (IAF), Islamic economics (IE) and Islamic business management (IBM) research studies as part of their contribution to solving current economic and financial problems. Design/methodology/approach: The research adopts a qualitative meta-analysis methodology using NVivo 12 with selected data from 474 international journal articles published between 1981 and 2021. The study considers 172 IAF articles, 111 IE articles and 191 IBM articles. Findings: The results of the study show that the use of theories and views of classical Islamic scholars is not widespread among the examined research papers. The findings show that 90% of researchers tend to acquire modern economics, management, psychological and sociological theories instead of classical theories. Both modern and classical theories have been discussed in the studied articles namely agency theory, stakeholders' theory, hisbah (accountability), maqasid al-Shari'ah (objectives of Islamic law) and wa'd (unilateral promise). The gaps prevail not only in the taxonomy of terms but also in the choice of paradigm references. It is found that 66% of the 474 journal articles adopt a positivist paradigm, followed by interpretivism (19%), post-structuralism (9%) and critical orientation (6%). Research limitations/implications: This paper considers only ABS ranking journal articles. Future research may consider other journal articles from different ranking groups such as Scopus or Thomson & Reuters. Practical implications: The paper sheds light on how Islamic educational institutions can develop strategies for the Integration of Knowledge (IOK) in their curriculum. Social implications: This paper helps to shape the Muslims' way of thinking within an Islamic worldview which will lead to an Islamic way of expressing knowledge, skill and behaviour. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the model of IOK that has been deliberated among Islamic universities, especially those that develop IAF, IE and IBM studies.

This article investigates the determinants of dividend policy on the Casablanca stock exchange. The variables tested were based on the main theories of dividend policy, and the fixed effect model was used to test panel data over a period of 16 years from 2003 to 2018. The eight independent variables tested were profitability, firm size, retained earnings, firm age, leverage, growth opportunities, price to earnings (P/E) and a dummy variable introduced for financial companies. To corroborate the results, two proxies were used to test the dependent variable: dividend yield and payout ratio. The results led to the identification of three significant determinants of dividend policy, which are firm age, growth opportunities and firm size. The negative correlation between the variables of firm size and firm age with dividend policy is explained by signaling theory. On the other hand, the negative correlation between growth opportunities and dividend payments is predicted by different theories, such as agency theory, financial flexibility theory and life cycle theory. This study provides insights for investors, analysts and researchers into dividend policy determinants on the Casablanca stock exchange based on firms' characteristic variables.

We provide a comprehensive study of how different corporate governance mechanisms influence corporate innovation. Using panel data regression analysis across a sample of more than 13,600 firm-years for firms based in the United States between 1996-2010, we find that entrenched boards, though commonly associated with lower firm value, actually generate substantial innovation. We find that busy boards hinder innovation unless they also have interlocking relationships. Conversely, interlocked directors enhance innovation, unless they are busy. Directors who are CEOs or Board Chairs at other companies hinder innovation. Interestingly, despite being significant determinants of firm value in other studies, director experience, independence and ownership are not related to innovation. In order to be innovative, firms should appoint directors to leverage their professional relationships and directors must have a long-term perspective. (c) 2022 by the authors.

This article evaluates the influence of ownership structure (OS) components on dividend distribution policy in India. More precisely, it aims to comprehend the impacts of promoters' shareholdings (PRMS), institutional investors' shareholdings (INS) and retail investors' shareholdings (RIS) on dividends of Indian listed companies. This article uses equity dividend divided by book value (DNW) to determine the dividend distribution policy for the selected panel of 80 listed companies for the period of 5 years (2016-2020). The static as well as dynamic panel data regression models are applied in the study. The static panel data regression results exhibit that none of the three OS explanatory variables (PRMS, INS and RIS) affect significantly the dividend distribution policy of Indian listed companies. Similar results are depicted by the dynamic panel data regression model also, thus ensuring robustness of the results. Hence, this article does not find support for agency theory, signalling theory and clientele effect. The study recommends that investors need not consider the composition of shareholding pattern of a company to have any significant influence on dividends while making their investment-decisions. The findings also add to the increasing studies across the globe evaluating the influence of OS on dividends. (c) 2022 Institute of Public Enterprise.

We examine the association between cost stickiness and the risk of stock price crash, defined as asymmetry in the distribution of weekly stock returns. We use information opaqueness and heterogeneous investor beliefs as our two theoretical frameworks. Using a sample of US firms, we find a positive association between cost stickiness and crash risk. This association is more pronounced for firms with an opaque information environment as proxied by fewer analysts following. As efficient cost management is key to profit maximisation, studying the implications of cost stickiness makes a valuable contribution to the literature on cost management.

The paper presents a conception of firms' efficiency that breaks with the agency theory of the firm, which sees the efficiency of firms as no different in nature from that of markets. We argue that firms are efficient relative to markets, thanks to two kinds of social interaction, namely, interpersonal interactions and compliance with authority; these interactions take place among workers engaged in a collective productive venture and could not develop in markets. Two kinds of norm emerge from these interactions that create the rights and obligations needed for horizontal and vertical cooperation; the functioning of firms and their specific efficiency thus have a deontic basis. Just as shareholder-oriented governance is normatively derived from agency theory's vision of the firm, which has succeeded in powerfully influencing corporate law and corporate governance since the 1980s, participatory governance is the governance mode that normatively derives from our understanding of the firm.

The goal of this paper is to study how firms' cash holdings have recently performed. We have not only used GMM approach, but also a pioneer econometric approach to evaluate the determinants of firms' cash holdings, ML-SEM. The results are more robust in comparison with those obtained using GMM. Our results showed that cash holdings have increased during the 2008 financial crisis and rose significantly after that time. The exception were firms placed in the United States and emerging markets. We have found that cash holdings, in general, were positively influenced by the banking system and capital market, although the results have been more robust for the first variable. Our results also showed that the development of the rule of law and shareholder rights lead to a decrease on firms' cash holdings, which confirms the agency theory as an explanation of firms' cash holdings.

The founding of the town of Guelph, Ontario, was uncommon in that the town was established prior to the development of surrounding agricultural lands. This was done through an arrangement between the British government and a private, for-profit company. Grounded in agency theory, this study examines the establishment of the town and the role of accounting in its early development. The results show how the absence of accounting created a space in which the company's agent could operate in a way that promoted the well-being of the local population while adopting a long-term approach to shareholder wealth creation. This study highlights the insights that can be gained by investigating where accounting is absent and the importance of aligning accounting techniques with organisational and social objectives, particularly in the context of private companies acting on behalf of governments.

Purpose: Internal audit is an essential component of the accountability structure in Ghana's local government system. Favourable conditions are required for its operation to assist management bodies to fulfil their responsibilities efficiently and effectively. Using Internal Control-Integrated Framework, this paper investigates the conditions under which internal auditing is carried out in four selected local governments in the Central Region of Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: Based on interpretivism and qualitative approach, purposive sampling technique was used to select 14 key informants at various levels of governance for primary data by the use of key informant interview guide. The data were analysed using pattern matching and content analysis based on themes. Findings: The findings of the study indicate that internal auditors faced unfavourable conditions including intimidation, threats and administrative interference in the course of performing their duties. Research limitations/implications: This paper is based on qualitative data from four selected local governments in the Central Region of Ghana. Hence these findings are specific to the local governments, internal auditors and management bodies in the country to benefit from them. The implication of the findings is closely related to the efforts to realise the ultimate goal of the recent government reforms and the need for further reforms to enhance independence, objectivity, effectiveness and efficiency. Practical implications: This study helps management of local governments in finding out conditions under which internal auditing operates. This helps to enhance favourable conditions and minimise the unfavourable conditions for the purpose of efficient and effective utilisation of resources towards improvement of service delivery of local government system to meet the needs of the people. Social implications: The study contributes to the understanding and application of Internal Control-Integrated Framework to local government system in the Central Region. It also uses the agency theory to explain the conditions under which internal auditing is carried out in the selected local government institutions. Originality/value: This study provides new insight into the conditions of carrying out internal auditing in local governments and raises awareness of stakeholders on the need to enhance service delivery to the people. It also introduces a novel idea of placing all internal auditors under a newly established Internal Audit Class to advance independence and objectivity.

Corporate governance (CG) failures, exemplified by noncompliance with laws, regulations and best practices, have pecuniary costs. Using agency theory, the study aimed to quantify costs of governance failures in South Africa's FTSE/JSE Top40 listed companies and establish ultimate cost bearer. This differentiates this study from extant literature and makes both methodological and practice contributions by using Value at Risk procedures. Except for Steinhoff, which lost 85% of its value in six weeks, event study method was used to select the other eleven Top40 listed companies included in the study. Data on identified CG failures, published on the Stock Exchange News Service and announced by Regulatory Authorities between 2008 and 2016, was used. At 99.99% confidence level, up to 73.33% of revenue and 62 cents per R1 of market capitalisation were eroded because of governance failures. Due to ascertained losses, the study concluded that CG failures have pecuniary socioeconomic costs incurred by principals and government through social expenditure. Theoretical implications suggest agency theory's extension as agency costs underestimate potential costs by excluding socio-economic costs. The study recommended the use of behavioural theories for insights into agents' behaviours leading to governance failures and losses. It also recommended that policymakers should strengthen the role of gatekeeping professions to curb the magnitude of ascertained costs. (c) 2022 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd. All rights reserved.

This concept paper synthesises the special issue with an integrated discussion of all four papers published therein, from the viewpoint of the theme of this special issue: opportunities and challenges for future empirical research in corporate finance. The four papers highlight that future empirical research faces the challenge of acknowledging fundamental paradigms in the literature. These include analytical models of capital structure, agency theory, the literature on Initial Public Offering anomalies and earnings valuation. An opportunity for future empirical research is to use these foundations to contribute to emerging paradigms. The latter include the empirical evidence of the shareholder wealth effects of government investment, managerial overinvestment and the acknowledgement of unlisted entities within capital markets research.

We study the effects of financing sources and financial constraints in mergers and acquisitions. We explicitly distinguish between methods of payment and financing used in takeovers and find that financial constraints have a strong influence on choices of both payment and financing methods. Financially constrained firms are less likely to pay for acquisitions in cash. Greater financial constraints are associated with greater use of equity financing, followed by internal funds, with debt as the least preferred financing alternative. Consistent with agency theory, more constrained bidders experience higher takeover announcement returns. However, we find financing sources to have little impact on abnormal returns.

The tenets of agency theory suggest that CEO inside debt holdings induce risk-reducing corporate investments. Further, the coinsurance hypothesis implies that diversification strategies designed to decrease cross-segment correlations reduce firm risk. Motivated by these views, we hypothesize a positive relationship between CEO inside debt holdings and the risk-reducing (e.g., coinsurance) effect of diversification. Moreover, we examine the impact of coinsurance, induced by CEO inside debt holdings, on the excess value of diversification. Using a sample of 4053 firm-year observations for the period of 2006-2013, we document a positive relationship between CEO inside debt and the extent of the coinsurance effect of diversification. In addition, consistent with the implications of the managerial risk aversion hypothesis that risk-reducing corporate diversification strategies destroy shareholder value, our results show that the coinsurance effect of diversification, when induced by CEO inside debt, negatively affects the excess value of diversification.

Purpose: On the example of professional football in Germany, this paper analyses the conflict about the punishment of fan misbehaviour within an agency-theoretical framework to cast light on the reasons for the ineffectiveness of the sentences and to show possible solutions. Design/methodology/approach: In a pre-study, more than 1,300 hand-collected past sentences against clubs by the German and European sports courts were analysed to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the penalties so far. Additionally, in the main study, 26 expert interviews with German representatives of the football association, courts, clubs, sponsors, police and active fan scenes allow a deep insight into the relationships of the involved parties. Findings: The paper suggests that the sentences do not sufficiently consider several agency problems. Due to moral hazard, they exert hardly any influence on fan behaviour and only a small one on the clubs. While the lighting of pyrotechnics is by far the most punished type of misbehaviour, most of the interviewees cite the impossibility of preventing it. Despite the sentences, some clubs make non-public agreements with their fans about still tolerable misconduct or do not pass the penalties on to the polluters as intended by the association. The findings highlight the importance of communication for less misbehaviour. Originality/value: For the first time, the agency theory and the economic theory of optimal punishment are brought together with insights from interviews with the involved parties. The authors discover a two-stage principal-agent problem and get new insights into stakeholders' hidden motivations and attitudes. The results should encourage a debate on the current penalties and possible solutions to the recurring problem of pyrotechnics. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Recent research shows that studying the traditional cost behavior within a firm may not be sufficient to fully understand the elements that influence management behavior. Studies have pinpointed a cost-related issue called "cost asymmetry," which has gained the widespread name of "cost stickiness." Researchers have explored factors that cause cost stickiness through three theories: adjustment cost theory, agency theory, and political process theory. This study seeks to determine the sticky cost behavior of three costs, namely cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, and total cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses. It also aims to examine if the adjustment costs, political costs, and agency costs, otherwise referred to as latent variables impact cost stickiness. Publicly-listed firms in the Philippines are assessed from the years 2009 to 2019. Findings show that the stickiness of all three costs without latent variables was significant. No latent variable had a significant effect on cost of goods sold. Only adjustment costs and political costs had a significant impact on both selling, general, and administrative expenses and total costs. However, political costs decreased the cost stickiness of selling, general and administrative expenses but increased the stickiness of the total costs. (c) 2022 by De La Salle University.

The purpose of the article is to investigate the interaction between the behavior of managers and investors toward Iran's capital market and the focus on agency theory which ends up with the conflict between the utilities of manages and investors because a conflict of interest implies an attempt to spread opportunistic behavior. In the current study, the benefit of reducing capital cost (manager's utility) and return on assets (investor's utility) are considered variables of interest of either party, in that Osborne's game theory was used in a two-step manner. The study population consisted of the companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange and Iran Over-the-Counter Market, classified in the game table according to managers' behavior toward high or low earnings management and investor's behavior toward acceptance non-acceptance of stock. The experimental results presented in this paper uphold the agency theory, indicating a conflict between managers and investors in Iran's capital market, particularly in the Tehran Stock Exchange. According to game theory, Nash's dominant equilibrium comes to the fore when dealing with the manager's low earnings management and investor'schoice of strategy to accept a share in Iran's capital market and Tehran Stock Exchange. Alternatively, the presentation of transparent financial statements and the acceptance of such a company stock can maximize parties' utilities. (c) 2022, Hrvatsko Drustvo Ekonomista.

The institutional complexity of social enterprises (SEs) often hinders their access to financing from conventional investors. To align the interests of SEs and their investors, innovative investment instruments of social finance are emerging. However, there is evidence of a mismatch between the financial needs of SEs and the instruments offered by social finance entities (SFEs). The analysis of 34 SEs and 6 SFEs through the lens of agency theory shows that some barriers are caused by contradictory agent--steward models of behaviour, whereas others are deficiencies of the SE sector in general. The study demonstrates that the SE financing gap is a complex problem that requires multifaceted solutions. (c) 2022, International Society for Third-Sector Research.

The literature shows that the performance of bidders has been historically poor both in the short run and in the long run. Agency theory tells us that unless CEO owns 100% of the firm, the decision-making process would deviate from shareholder value maximization. Building upon the theory of internal governance by Acharya et al. (J Financ 66(3):689-720, 2011), this study documents the salutary effect of the novel governance mechanism on corporate acquisition activities. Internal governance is optimal if neither the CEO nor her subordinates are dominating. The curvilinear relationship suggests that when power and responsibility sharing is balanced in acquiring firms, myopic CEOs would have lower acquisition propensity, lower likelihood of targeting public firms, higher deal completion rate, and stronger short term gains. A system of regression equations is applied to mitigate the concerns about potential endogeneity and selection bias. Moreover, the empirical evidence demonstrates that good internal governance has strong predictive power for long term performance in the post-acquisition period, which sheds light on the influential role of subordinates in post-deal integration.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and shareholder wealth arising from announcement returns of security issuance from a frontier market. It also explores the role of business group affiliation (BGA) on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses short-term scenarios to examine the link between CSR and shareholder wealth using the event study methodology which helps us mitigate the reverse causality problems related to studies of the relationship between CSR and firm value. Abnormal returns surrounding the security issue announcements were generated using the market model. Findings: This paper finds that security issuers with high CSR scores are associated with higher shareholder value. However, this paper finds that CSR activities of security issuers with BGA are value-destroying which is consistent with the agency perspective of CSR. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to only one nascent market, namely the Colombo Stock Exchange. Originality/value: This study documents that CSR and BGA are important determinants, among others, of stock price reactions to security offerings in emerging markets.

Recently ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) activities have attracted a lot of theoretical and practical attention. With these changes, there have been an active research on corporate social responsibility activities measured by ESG and major financial strategies of companies. Related with previous research, this study seeks to systematically analyze the association between social responsibility activities and dividend policieswww.earticle.net of corporations. Studies such as Rakotomavo (2012) and Benlemlih (2019) suggest that social responsibility activities have a positive impact on dividend policy, while studies such as Pham and Jung (2020) and Ni and Zhang (2019) report that social responsibility activities have a negative effect on dividend policy. In addition, the domestic previous research has analyzed the effect of social responsibility activities on dividends by using a simple OLS regression. These studies have not considered the endogeneity problem of variables and the partial adjustment of dividends with panel data. They did not investigate the relation between corporate social activities and stability of dividends either. Studies on these topics with Korean firms are still lacking. The dividend theory has been greatly developed with signaling theory, agency theory, and life cycle theory based on the dividend-irrelevance theory of MM (1961). If the signal theory of dividends is true, it can be argued that social responsibility activities will affect dividend payout level positively (Benlemlih, 2019). If the outcome hypothesis of agency theory of dividend is true, social responsibility activities will show a positive relationship between dividend levels (Adjaoud and Ben-Amar, 2010), conversely, if substitute hypothesis of agency theory is true, social responsibility activities and dividend levels will show a negative (-) relationship (John and Knyazeva, 2006). According to life cycle theory, corporate social activities have a positive association with dividend payout (Rakotomavo, 2012). In addition, Benlemlih (2019) shows that the companies with excellent levels of social responsibility activities prefer to have more stable dividend policy in order to signal a reduction in agent costs through dividend and a sound management policy. Matos, Barros and Sarmento (2020) also show that the firms with more sustainability have more stable dividend policies by using data from the European securities market. These studies imply that social responsibility activities are expected to have a significant impact on the stability of dividend policies. This study utilizes the ESG ratings provided by the Korea Corporate Governance Service as the measures of CSR/ESG activities of firms. We collected the data from the non-financial firms listed in Korea security market during the period of 2013 through 2019. The financial data required for analysis used the KIS-VALUE database of Korea Credit Evaluation Information. The information about the major shareholders' equity was collected from the section of ownership status in the annual reports of the firms. The samples used in this study are 4,126 firm-year unbalanced panel data. The empirical analysis was conducted by applying a fixed effect panel analysis and a two-stage fixed effects panel analysis using the industrial average of social responsibility activities as an instrumental variable for social responsibility activities to alleviate the endogenous problem of social responsibility activities. The results of the analysis are as follows: First, the empirical results show that the ESG activities of the company have different effects on dividend level according to the measures of dividend payout. When dividend payout ratio (dividend/net income) is used for the dependent variable, only the social rating has been analyzed to have a statistically significant and positive effect on dividend. On the other hand, when dividend rate (dividend/total asset) and dividendwww.earticle.net yield(dividend/stock price) are used as dependent variables, the company's ESG integration rating, environmental rating, social rating, and governance rating have been shown to have a significant and positive impact on dividend. These results shows that the increase in corporate social responsibility activities among corporate ESG activities can improve the dividend propensity of companies. Since the dividend payout ratios of Korea firms remain relatively low, it is suggested that the company's social responsibility activities should be strengthened more in order to increase dividend propensity. In addition, it can be confirmed that the company's ESG activities have a significant and positive impact on the dividend level of the company, so that the company should be more interested in ESG for sustainability. In other words, the more a company have interests in the various stakeholders of the firm, the more profitable it is for shareholders. Second, this the findings can be explained by the outcome hypothesis of agent theory and the life cycle hypothesis. The cash ratio, which is the proxy variable of the agency issue, has a significant and positive effect on dividend propensity. Cash ratio, majority shareholder equity, foreign equity have a positive association with the dividend ratios, and the majority shareholder's ownership has a significant and positive impact on dividend yield. In addition, it was also confirmed that the ratios such as operating cash flow/total assets, earned surplus/total assets, and gross operating profit/total assets, which are the proxies of life cycle theory, are significantly and positively associated with the dividend rate. The variables such as market value/book value, earned surplus/total asset, gross operating profit margin have a significant and positive impact on the dividend yield. Third, the ESG activities were analyzed to have a significant impact on the stability of dividend policy. The better the ESG activity, the higher the target dividend level, and the faster the difference between the target dividend level and the actual dividend level was adjusted. This means that the better the ESG activity, the higher the sustainability, and the higher the dividend level can be maintained. Since the company is more profitable with better ESG activity, it can be adjusted to the target dividend level more quickly. (c) 2022, Korean Finance Association. All rights reserved.

Context: infrastructure projects assume the use of intensive capital and the participation of several actors, where the institutional environment influences their respective contractual arrangements. A financial instrument for project governance is surety bond (SB), whose purpose is to ensure compliance with the contracted object. However, research involving SB in the context of emerging countries such as Brazil is still incipient. Objective: this study aims to understand the use of SB in Brazil and proposes a conceptual model for analyzing transactions. It contributes to the literature by investigating the relationship between the actors and transactions involved in SB using the transaction costs theory and agency theory perspectives. Methods: this study adopts a qualitative methodology using primary data collected with 10 in-depth semi-structured interviews with market professionals with substantial experience in SB. In addition, it uses secondary data based on debate and a specific lecture on the topic involving the reality and the use of SB. Results: the findings indicate that the agency problem and the high transaction costs in Brazil prevent the development of this risk coverage market, giving rise to targeted public policies. Conclusion: the proposed conceptual model reflects the various specific transactions in the use of SB, the underlying phenomena and the validation of propositions related to market failures, and the institutional environment's influence.

Purpose: The issue of tax evasion through fraudulent financial reporting committed by companies is a major concern facing the tax authority in Malaysia. As such, the purpose of this study is to propose a cohesive model of predicting tax evasion from the perspective of fraudulent financial reporting amongst small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) taxpayers. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model for this study is designed to explore the extent of the relationships between the independent variables: family ownership firms, company size, presence of tax professionals, company's duration in business and frequency of tax audits and the moderating variable, i.e. tax audit officers' level of competence; and the dependent variable, i.e. tax evasion from the perspective of fraudulent financial reporting. This study is grounded on four theories: agency theory, political cost theory, economic deterrence theory and competency theory. Data will be gathered from actual audit cases resolved by the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia. Ordinary least square regression analysis is proposed for the investigation. Findings: This study anticipates that family ownership firms, company size, presence of tax professionals, company's duration in business and frequency of tax audits could be associated with tax evasion amongst SMEs in Malaysia. This study further proposes that highly competent tax audit officers could mitigate the relationship between frequency of tax audits and tax evasion practices amongst SMEs in Malaysia. Originality/value: This study should be able to provide a cohesive model of predicting tax evasion from the perspective of fraudulent financial reporting amongst SMEs in Malaysia. Research on fraudulent financial reporting amongst SMEs is very limited, especially involving the level of competence of the tax audit officers; therefore, this study should contribute to the tax evasion literature by providing a comprehensive model of predicting tax evasion through fraudulent financial reporting using a Malaysian tax setting.

Based on the Resource Dependence Theory (TDR) and the Agency Theory (TA), this research aims to analyze whether there is a relationship between the number and type of directors (construct board of directors) concerning indicators of financial performance of the company based on ROA, ROE, Net Profit Margin, Income Per Employee, and Beta or Systematic Risk (construct financial performance). Using the innovative and suitable method for small samples, PLS-SEM, authors create a theoretical model based on literature review and a measurement model that operates based on multiple and simultaneous correlations between the selected variables. The results show the conformation of two constructs and denote a statistically significant relationship between them. It has the limitation of being an exploratory and transversal analysis. The study is original in applying the statistical method to the field of corporate governance and finance and in the selection of variables. It is concluded that the proposed theoretical model is efficient in studying the constructs in companies. (c) 2022 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas. All right reserved.

This study analyzed the determinants of tax audit quality with the audit process as the mediator in Ethiopia with special reference to the Ministry of Revenues. A mixed research approach with concurrent triangulation was used in the study. The conceptual model was developed based on the Agency Theory, Contingency Theory, Inspired Confidence Theory, Stakeholder Theory, and an empirical literature review. The data was collected from tax auditors including tax directors, supervisors, process owners, and team leaders using a questionnaire survey and key informant interviews. Thematic analysis and PLS-SEM using the ADANCO were used to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data respectively. The findings revealed that audit input factors, audit process, and contextual factors had a positive significant effect on tax audit quality. In addition, the audit process had a mediation effect on the relationship between explanatory variables in this study and tax audit quality. (c) 2022, Universiti Teknologi Mara. All rights reserved.

This paper estimates the efficiency of value added by banks using their total resources (physical capital resources and intangible resources) and finds an association between board characteristics and efficiency of value added. The paper is grounded in the theory of resource and knowledge based view of the firm, and agency theory, and tries to establish links between these two theories. This study departs from existing literature of examining the effect of board characteristics on financial performance, corporate sustainability, and corporate environmental responsibility, and tries to understand the relationship between board characteristics and the efficiency of value added by banks through their resources. This is also the first study of its kind to study the relationship between board structure characteristics and value creation in Indian banks using the Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAIC) methodology. Using the data for 41 commercial banks in India from 2008 to 2017 and by employing Prais-Winsten Regression, this study finds that board meetings and CEO-Chairman duality significantly and positively influence the efficiency of value added by banks through their total resources and intellectual capital resources. At the same time, independence in the boards negatively influences the efficiency of value added through physical capital resources. Overall, the findings of the paper indicate that board governance influences bank performance measured in terms of efficiency of value added. Policymakers, regulators, and bank managers should frame appropriate policies to ensure more board meetings, and the presence of board duality. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

This paper investigates how analyst forecast optimism is associated with disclosures of internal control material weaknesses (ICMWs) and their remediation under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). Drawing on agency theory, I hypothesize that analysts are likely to issue earnings forecasts that are more optimistic for firms with ICMW disclosures than for those without ICMW disclosures. Using a sample of 20,875 firm-year observations with 10-K (10-Q) reports from 2004 to 2018, I find a positive association between ICMW disclosures and analyst forecast optimism. This positive association is partially driven by investors' inability to unravel analyst forecast bias and analysts' intentions to curry favor with management for private information. In addition, analysts are found to issue less optimistic forecasts for firms with ICMW remediation disclosures compared with those without ICMW remediation disclosures. A series of propensity score matching and regression analyses are conducted to test the robustness of my inferences. Overall, the paper suggests that analysts have incentives to take the opportunity of firms disclosing ICMWs to bias their forecasts upward for self-interest. The findings have the potential to assist regulators in guiding analyst behavior and educating investors to unravel positive bias in analyst forecasts. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

According to the Theory of Economic Regulation, corporate lobbying is a productive investment for firms looking to influence legislation and public policy. Corporate political activity can generate benefits for the organization; however, in the presence of agency conflicts the advantage is often offset by agency costs borne by the shareholders. Sometimes excess remuneration is offered by the principal in exchange for the agent's commitment to shareholder wealth creation. In this study we evaluated the association between corporate lobbying, chief executive officer remuneration and corporate performance in 238 firms traded on the New York Stock Exchange, covering the period 2014-2017. Our regression analyses reveal that corporate lobbying is positively associated with chief executive officer remuneration and negatively associated with corporate performance, suggesting the existence of agency costs resulting from corporate lobbying. In such scenarios, based on our sample, corporate lobbying does not improve performance or generate benefits for shareholders, but serves as a personal and political tool for executive self-promotion.

The aim of this study is to examine a possible relationship of corporate financial performance and board membership changes. As a consequence, whether too little or too much board membership changes would produce a detrimental impact to financial performance. Furthermore, this study investigated whether this effect is more pronounced in family firms over non-family firms. Based on the agency theory and stewardship perspective, the results indicate that board membership changes are significant for family firms towards short-term financial performance indicators, with positive effect above a certain interval, though it signaling to the market may not be relevant. Also provides insightful examination of a specific corporate governance issue that is valuable both for academics and practitioners. (c) 2022 Authors. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The practice of corporate chief executive officer (CEOs) engaging in sociopolitical activism on issues both related and unrelated to their companies is gaining attention in the popular press and among management scholars. The purpose of this paper is to explore the antecedents and motivations of CEO sociopolitical activism in a typology of influences internal and external to the CEO and to the organization. This study's typology highlights the need for greater understanding of CEOs' sociopolitical activism for the CEO as an individual actor and for the company they represent. Design/methodology/approach: This study's approach is to conceptually review the literature on CEO activism and to create a theoretic framework for future analysis of the antecedents and motivations and ramifications of CEOs' sociopolitical activism for the CEO as an individual actor and for the company they represent. The author highlights four theories and seeks future application of these theories to the phenomena in a typology. Findings: The typology highlights the application of management theories to various ramifications of CEO activism to four influences on CEO activities. Upper echelons theory helps explain the motivation of a CEO internally, whereas agency theory applies to CEO activism internal to the CEO and external to the organizational operations. External to the CEO, organizational culture theory supports responses internal to the organization, and stakeholder theory provides insight into responses external to the CEO and the organization. Originality/value: This study provides conceptual support for the study of CEO activism and encourages future research on the topic. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Organizational citizenship behavior is a highly sought-after outcome. We integrate insight from the psychological ownership perspective and agency theory to examine how the juxtaposition of informal psychological mechanisms (i.e., ownership feelings toward an organization) and formal and informal governance mechanisms (i.e., employee share ownership, agency monitoring, and peer monitoring) influences employees' organizational citizenship behaviors. Our empirical results show that psychological ownership has a positive effect on organizational citizenship behavior. Contrary to the common belief that informal and formal mechanisms complement each other, we find that the positive influence of psychological ownership on organizational citizenship behavior is more pronounced when employee share ownership and agency monitoring is low compared to high. Implications for theory and future research are discussed. (c) 2022, The Author(s).

The current study evaluates how gender diversity impacts the stock price, whether on the audit committee, commissioners, or directors, using firm size as the moderating variable. A total of 240 secondary data samples were derived from 24 publicly listed banking institutions from 2012-2021. The multiple regression and moderated regression analysis used to process the sample research was considered the most suitable for this study. The statistical test in the first model showed that the existence of women executives on the board of directors impacts the stock price. This first model result is in line with the research by Baez, Baez-Garcia, Flores-Munoz, and Gutierrez-Barroso (2018). The gender diversity in the composition of commissioners and audit committees showed that it had not impacted the stock prices. Furthermore, the directors and audit committees affected the stock price in the second model. This result is in line with the research by Qayyum et al. (2021) that demonstrated that the women officers on a company's board could lower crash risk in stock price. Contrarily, the variable in this second model, the board of commissioners, did not impact the stock price. Thus, the second model noticed that firm size, as moderating variable, weakened the impact of the audit committee on the stock price. The current study contributes to the literature concerning the impact of gender diversity in company officers' levels on the stock price. Future researchers can use other samples from other emerging markets countries. Further investigations are urged to broaden the context of the study to achieve more enriched findings.

Abstract This research examines the relation between annual report readability and company performance in a German-speaking country, Austria. The incomplete revelation hypothesis, management obfuscation hypothesis and agency theory assume that firms with lower performance strategically use readability in their disclosures to obfuscate negative results. For investors, reading, analysing, and interpreting data becomes a costly affair; this weakens the negative effect of such data on a firm's reputation and share price. We use LIX and Flesch formulas to measure the readability of letters to the shareholders and/or interviews with the board in annual reports. The sample consists of 37 companies that are listed on the Prime Market of the Vienna Stock Exchange and their data from the year 2009 to 2020. Company performance is measured by the change in turnover, profit, and share price. The analysed sections mostly show high to very high levels of difficulty. During the observation period, readability levels do not change significantly. We find that the annual reports of firms with lower performance are not harder to read and, therefore, cannot confirm the management obfuscation hypothesis. A significant influence of change in profit/loss on readability is minutely observed. Possible reasons for this observation could be characteristics of the German language, statistical outliers, the long observation period, more professional investor relations offices, and changing communication channels between companies and stakeholders. The last point, changing communication channels, also puts the obfuscation hypothesis and its application to readability up for discussion again. Implications for Central European audience: Our study shows that also Central European countries are confronted with low levels of readability in annual reports. Nevertheless, we cannot see a clear tendency towards obfuscation in corporate disclosures. (c) 2022, Central European Business Review. All Rights Reserved.

Following its 40th anniversary and more than three decades after its introduction to the strategic management literature, agency theory remains the predominant theory of corporate governance. In this paper, we examine affect, an underexplored dimension in principal-agent relationships. Using the CEO-board of directors relationship as a context, we develop a theoretical lens that explains how interpersonal affect underlying relationships between CEOs and directors of boards shapes behavior in ways that deviate from traditional agency theory predictions. We discuss how the incorporation of an affective perspective advances principal-agent research by revising agency theory's assumptions concerning human nature and behavior and suggesting new research directions. By acknowledging a central role of affect, we connect existing behavioral approaches to organizational agency and advance our understanding of socioemotional foundations of principal-agent tensions, problems, and agency costs.

This article aims to summarise a significant number of previous qualitative and quantitative researches in order for scholars to reconsider their understanding of corporate governance mechanisms. The fundamental purpose of examining corporate governance practices is to define the way earnings management can be reduced. The findings show unclear conclusions concerning the board of directors' and the committee's characteristics on earnings management. That is why adopting corporate governance mechanisms strives for reducing the 'agency' problem. Furthermore, researchers can monitor the impact of corporate governance mechanisms by focusing on recent literature (2019, 2020, 2021). Future research in this area is therefore being promoted. Implementing corporate governance in companies is a given, as it can ensure their effectiveness and increase their credibility and prestige. Adopting corporate governance practices mitigates earnings management phenomena, and companies make the right decisions for their smoother operation. Copyright (c) 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Corporate governance developed to maintain the accountability, stability, and performance of corporations. It has evolved to concern not just the financial health of the company, but its social and environmental impact. There is considerable international institutional diversity in corporate governance. The role and significance of market institutions varies among different governance systems. This work provides a concise insight into the defining impulses of late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century corporate governance evolving through a series of competing epoch-making paradigmatic contests. The present paradigm highlights a shift towards corporate sustainability involving the corporate delivery of long-term value in financial, social, environmental, and ethical terms. In analysing the purpose of the company and the definition of value creation, the hegemony of agency theory and shareholder primacy is challenged. More expansive theoretical explanations are considered which recognise the deeper values companies are built upon, the wider purposes they serve, and the broader set of relationships they depend upon for their success. This book will be of value to researchers, scholars, and students in corporate governance, sustainability, business, and accounting. Managers, professionals, and other general business readers will also find this text of interest. (c) 2023 Thomas Clarke.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations on accrual earnings management (AEM) and real earnings management (REM) in Iran's emerging capital market. Design/methodology/approach: The panel data regression is used to testing hypotheses. The sample includes 2,020 data and 202 companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) over a period of ten years from 2012 to 2021. Also, the companies covered in this study include financial and nonfinancial companies. Furthermore, the data related to the research variables were extracted from the annual financial statements and the TSE database. Findings: The results show that compliance with AML regulations leads to a reduction in AEM and REM. In other words, companies with higher money laundering (ML) tend to manage their earnings, which is in line with agency theory. Practical implications: This study has implication for policymakers and regulators, auditors and managers. Considering the negative impact of AML regulations on earnings management (EM), Iranian auditing firms need to emphasize on the full implementation of AML regulations in TSE. Also, the results of this research may aid policymakers and regulators to detect financial crimes through accounting signals. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study in an Iran capital market to examine the impact of AML regulations on EM in financial and nonfinancial companies. Previous research has not controlled for the effects of financial companies. Prior studies have not examined the effects of financial companies. In addition, this study differentiates itself from previous studies by introducing a new method for measuring the independent ML variable based on auditor opinions. The obtained data can aid international bodies to better understand compliance with ML regulations in Iran and can reduce their concerns in negotiations. (c), Emerald Publishing Limited.

It has become a common practice for restaurant firms to spend amounts exceeding their earnings on share buybacks by depleting their cash reserves or even by borrowing money. Given restaurant firms' limited ability to generate internal cash and the high cost of debt financing, using these means to finance share buybacks could jeopardize restaurant firms' long-term success. However, little is known about the factors influencing restaurant firms' tendency toward this seemingly aggressive buyback behavior. This study revealed that the more restaurant firms' earnings reduce, the greater their tendency is to conduct such aggressive share buybacks. This result could provide some evidence that managerial self-serving behavior plays a role in aggressive share buybacks in the restaurant industry. The study also demonstrated that the positive impact of reduced earnings on aggressive buybacks becomes stronger as a firm's degree of franchising increases. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the moderating effect of external financing needs on the relationship between the disclosure level of integrated reporting (IR) and firm value using evidence from Egypt. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a panel regression analysis for a matched sample of 50 companies listed on the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX), specifically from EGX100. The sample covers four years (2017-2020). The current study uses content analysis to measure IR and Tobin's Q as a proxy for firm value. Findings: The findings reveal a significant positive relationship between the disclosure level of IR and firm value. In addition, the authors find that external financing needs moderate the relationship between IR and firm value. It is concluded that the higher the disclosure level of IR content, the higher the firm's value, and that this relationship strengthens in firms with high needs for external financing. Practical implications: Several practical implications can be derived from the results of the current study. Policymakers and regulators can impose mandatory requirements for IR in Egypt. It also opens new insights for board members, managers, analysts and auditors in forming financing decisions based on annual reports. Originality/value: The present study has a novel insight from a developing country and significant contributions to the extant literature. The study provides empirical evidence from an emerging economy and an insight into how external financing can be used for firms with different levels of IR. It also provides a comprehensive disclosure index to estimate the level of IR. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The growing number of corporate scandals globally highlights the importance of effective corporate governance mechanisms. Many of the corporate governance frameworks that are rooted in the agency theory advocate the election of independent non-executive directors, an independent chairperson, and a lead independent director. Shareholder voting on the election or re-election of directors (hereafter referred to as 'director re-elections') has been largely unexplored in South Africa--a country widely recognised as a pioneer in the corporate governance field and yet marred by several corporate scandals in recent years. In this study, an unbalanced panel data set was thus constructed comprising voting outcomes and board-level characteristics of companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2020. Significant positive relationships were noted between shareholder voting opposition to director re-elections and both board size and board tenure. Shareholders who cast opposing votes mainly did so because of their concerns about the lack of director independence, at board, committee, and nominee level. The findings of this study were explained in the context of the agency, stakeholder, stewardship, and resource dependence theories. It is recommended that nomination committees use more robust selection criteria for directors. Shareholders are also encouraged to vote more actively on director re-elections to monitor these monitors. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

This study investigates the relationship between corporate governance and corporate sustainability performance in the emerging Asian markets where the central role of sustainable development was perceived after the 2008 global financial crisis. We base our study on the triple bottom line approach that incorporates three dimensions of sustainability: economic, environmental, and social performance. A governance index comprising ten firm-specific provisions is proposed to summarise internal corporate governance. Consistent with agency theory, we confirm that firms with better corporate governance have better corporate sustainability performance. We also determine which main factors drive the governance-sustainability relation. The findings have practical implications for firms, shareholders, and policy makers by emphasising the role of corporate governance in assessing and enhancing corporate sustainability performance.

Faulty board configurations associated with risk management practices are alleged to be the primary sources of most corporate failures. Therefore, experts have suggested that firms should adopt holistic risk management practices. This study investigates the interactive effect of board characteristics with risk management activities on the performance of listed Nigerian non-financial firms. The study is anchored on the agency theory perspective. It is designed as ex post facto inquiry with a population of 113 companies, from which a sample of 96 firms was drawn from firms with a complete set of data. Secondary data were extracted from the NSE Factbook and Thomson Reuter's DataStream for 2010-2019. The static panel regression technique was utilized to analyze and estimate the interaction between the variables. The findings show that all the independent variables positively impacted ROA of the listed firms. Nevertheless, concerning market evaluation (Tobin-Q), except for board financial experts and audit committee meetings, risk management committee meetings and the presence of chief risk officer showed an insignificant impact. The combined implication is that although firms have complied with the provision of the CG codes on risk governance structure, the improvements associated with risk management aimed at enhancing market evaluation are nonetheless not deeply embedded in these firms. Firms are suggested to implement effective risk management practices to achieve competitive advantages and substantiality. More studies are advocated to extend the literature by expanding the scope.

This study uses human capital that shows the intangible asset's core in reducing the risk or improving firm performance to solve previous inconsistent results of women's role in firm performance. Thus, this paper examines the role of human capital as the mediator in the influence of gender diversity on credit risk in a rural bank. This examination involves 433 rural banks based on the purposive sampling method. The result reveals that higher gender diversity has higher human capital (a = 0.135, r = 0.005) and higher human capital has lower credit risk (a = -0.205, r = 0.000). It also revealed that when gender diversity is controlled by human capital as a mediator on credit risk, gender diversity does not affect credit risk (a = -0.022, r = 0.625). However, human capital still affects credit risk (a = -0.205, r = 0.000). It implies that the higher a woman on the board of directors, the lower the credit risk through her education competence. Women as organization leaders have high self-appreciation from organization members in implementing their strategies and supervising them. High credit risk in rural banks needs appropriate management as a part of an internal governance mechanism. This study contributes to gender diversity literature through the ability to manage risk in measuring women's role as strategic agents. This study also contributes to investor protection through the reputation of women on boards as monitoring agents.

Drawing on agency and socioemotional wealth theory, this study elucidates that ownership succession intentions affect earnings management in private family firms. Based on a combination of questionnaire data and archival data of 331 Belgian private family firms, results indicate that family firms intending to transfer ownership to non-family members engage more in earnings management than those planning to transfer ownership to family members. Our findings also show differences in earnings management within each subset of ownership succession, thereby highlighting family firm heterogeneity. Family owners intending to transfer ownership to their children engage less in upward earnings management than those planning to transfer ownership to other family members. Family owners intending to transfer ownership to employees engage more in downward earnings management than those intending to transfer ownership to outsiders. This study contributes to both theory and practice by considering ownership succession intentions as a driver of earnings management.

Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate how the negative effect of litigation risk on firm performance could be controlled through the channel of voluntary disclosure and under the condition of institutional ownership. Design/methodology/approach: To get the objectives, the study analyzed an unbalanced panel of 918 non-financial listed Chinese firms from 2010 to 18. To capture any expected unobserved heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the unbalanced sample, the authors have applied fixed effect regression with robust standard errors clustered at the firms' levels as suggested by Newey and West (1987). Findings: The research provides that the good disclosure practices and presence of institutional ownership in corporations raise the trust of the investors by making the corporate operation clear in the eyes of the stakeholders. This increases the corporate credibility and as consequence corporations are protected against litigation risk. Thus, in the light of the information asymmetry and signaling theories, voluntary disclosure practices, and financial institutions' ownership, bridges the information gap and transmit a positive signal in the market regarding the better financial performance of the corporations. Research limitations/implications: These findings are helpful for the corporate managers for effective strategic decisions, regulatory authorities for policy formulation, and individual investors for developing a diversified investment portfolio. Originality/value: By applying the mediation and moderation effects, the research enhances the understanding of the underlying causes of the association between a firm's litigation risk and its performance. The current research contributes to the literature, that agency issues which create litigation risk could be settled internally with voluntary disclosure practices and externally with institutional ownership.

This study empirically examines the impact of board gender diversity on corporate performance, payout policy, and investment efficiency using a sample of 1021 firms listed in Asia Pacific markets for 2006-2016. Using fixed effect regression models, the results suggest that having a woman director on the corporate board enhances the investment efficiency and increases the propensity of dividend payout of the firms as compared to companies that do not have a women director. Nevertheless, the presence of a women director has an impact on weakening corporate performance. The results are robust across alternative measures of gender diversity. The study concludes that the presence of a woman director in the boardroom grants company a competitive edge over its competitors. (c) 2022 Inderscience Publishers. All rights reserved.

This research examines and compares perceptions of Omani university students with those of American business students towards entrepreneurs and business managers. Bucar and Hisrich's (2001) model was used to measure and collect students' perceptions towards ethical behaviours of firm managers and entrepreneurs. T-tests were employed to test statistical significance in the mean scores of Omani and American students. Results showed that Omani students perceive entrepreneurs as more ethical in decision making than managers, following the American sample, but with no significant gender based alterations among them. However, degree of perception among American students was higher than Omani students, being contrary to previous studies. This study contributes to body of literature contextually, firstly by adding Oman (Arab) to existing body of knowledge based on gender, national differences and institutions, and secondly by making comparative study of youth perceptions towards ethical behaviour of entrepreneurs and managers between a developed and a developing country.

Shippers and logistics service providers implement information communication technology (ICT) in outsourced logistics to increase efficiency and remedy information asymmetry. However, the nature of outsourced logistics operations can create technology management challenges due to the organizational distances between the technology initiator and the technology users. Here, we apply the lens of positivist agency theory to study four cases of technology management and agency in multi-tier outsourced logistics services. Our findings suggest that while ICT remedies some information asymmetry, it also creates new information asymmetry--and gives rise to user privacy concerns. Furthermore, the setting of multi-tier subcontracted logistics services appears to be a critical factor in designing governance mechanisms for effective technology management. In addition to our theoretical contributions to technology management in multi-tier outsourcing, we offer an empirical account of agency, proposals for future research, and practical suggestions to help managers tackle agency issues that arise from information asymmetry.

Increasingly organizations have dedicated systems and personnel (recipients) to receive and handle internal whistleblower reports. Yet, the complexity of handling whistleblower reports is often underestimated, and there is a dearth of literature that attempts to describe or analyse the challenges internal recipients face. This paper uses an agency theory inspired lens to provide insight into the complexity of internal whistleblowing, with the aim to identify focal points for improving internal whistleblowing processes. We conceive of internal recipients as agents of two principals in the event of whistleblowing: owner/top management as well as whistleblowers. We identify sources of agency problems and agency costs within these double-agent relationships. We provide avenues for solving these problems and reducing the agency costs. We close by offering paths for future research. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

This study investigates the impact of delegation structure of the top management team upon the corporate voluntary disclosure on financial outcomes. The paper develops two competing hypotheses pertaining to the relationship between the degree of delegation and the quality of management earnings forecasts (MFs), the most influential type of voluntary financial disclosure. In support of the literature on strategic information transmission, the empirical findings demonstrate a U-shaped relationship between the degree of delegation and the quality of MFs, suggesting that an internal optimality of responsibility sharing between the CEO and her immediate subordinates does not exist for internal information production and dissemination. Specifically, the paper analyzes four aspects of MFs, and the documented curvilinear forms are generally persistent across the multiple quality metrics. Consistent with the literature on aging executives, the curvilinear relation is more significant when the top management team is led by an older CEO. The paper utilizes a system of structural equations to ameliorate estimation biases and the results are robust to a battery of robustness checks.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of managerial myopia on information technology (IT) investment. Specifically, it aims to investigate the influence of chief information officer (CIO) compensation on IT investment and the moderating role of the board monitoring strength on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The study examines a sample of 194 firms listed on US stock exchanges with a CIO position in 2019. The authors employ hierarchical regression analysis to test the hypothesis. Findings: The results show that CIO compensation negatively influences IT investment. Further, even though vigilant board monitoring does not necessarily reduce such opportunistic behaviors, weak board monitoring creates an environment for such actions. Research limitations/implications: First, the cross-sectional data can limit the results' generalizability. Second, the sampling frame is not perfectly random as it consists of firms that have CIO compensation information in the ExecuComp for 2019. Third, we include only two measures of board monitoring strength. Practical implications: Board of directors should wisely select compensation packages' components since equity incentives potentially exacerbate managerial myopia. Moreover, firms may regulate CIOs' investment behaviors through board-level IT governance. Originality/value: This study is one of the few studies that utilize CIO sensitivity to measure CIO compensation. Moreover, by examining the factors affecting IT investment behavior, this study sheds light on CIO incentives' impact on IT investment behaviors. Finally, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate board monitoring's role in the relationship between CIO sensitivity and IT investment intensity.

The paper uses both the agency theory and the legitimacy theory to provide a complementary framework that links different patterns of disclosures (i.e., transparency) to corporate performance for a sample of 116 United Arab Emirates (UAE) listed firms between years 2008-2016. It investigates the relationship between corporate disclosures (i.e., transparency), organisational commitment to law, a set of governance mechanisms (namely, board size, CEO decision-making power, and foreign ownership) and corporate performance while controlling for corporate specific characteristics such as size, type, age and leverage. The empirical results show that transparency indices have a puzzling pattern across different performance measures - namely return on assets, asset turnover and organisational growth. The paper is one of very few studies that examine the association between corporate transparency and corporate performance in an emerging market economy such as the UAE.

Capital structure is not only the result of various financial characteristics of the firm but also depends on who is in control. Thus, it is fundamental to understand the influence that certain features of the shareholding structure or the composition of the board, including the potential differences between family and non-family firms, exert on capital structure decisions. The paper uses a sample of wine firms in Portugal, because it helps to capture a business sector where family firms make up a significant portion of the industry. It is used an unbalanced panel data set of 460 firms for the period 2010 to 2018 and applied a random-effects model specification. Our results do not evidence significant differences between family and non-family firms. Still, they indicate that firms with fewer shareholders, smaller boards, and where the main director or member of the board is also a shareholder tend to present higher debt levels. There is no evidence of a non-monotonic relation between the ownership structure and debt, nor the presence of moderating effects on that relation. This paper fills a gap in the literature as the impact that specific characteristics of firms and their leaders have on capital structure decisions is still a topic less studied in the literature, particularly in bank-based economies.

This study evaluates whether an association exists between the agency incentives of the audit committee chair and voluntary disclosure of their monitoring activities in their audit committee report. Prior research suggests that a shift toward greater voluntary disclosure in the audit committee report occurred following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act but does not directly address the determinants of voluntary disclosure. Consistent with agency theory, audit committee chairs signal their duty-specific monitoring activities to shareholders, possibly to protect their reputation and justify their compensation. Within a high-litigation industry, this study provides evidence that audit committee chairs with a greater reputation level (i.e., more public company directorships) provide more concise duty-specific voluntary disclosure when serving companies with high levels of agency conflicts. This provides evidence consistent with efficiency in the market for audit committee chairs. This study also provides evidence that audit committee chairs respond to likely shareholder concerns by providing more concise duty-specific voluntary disclosure when their company has previously restated its financials. Finally, audit committee chairs provide increased voluntary disclosure specifically related to external audit oversight when high agency conflicts exist. As a whole, this contributes to the existing audit committee literature by providing evidence that voluntary disclosure incentives for financial reporting are also important determinants of more qualitative compliance-based reporting in the proxy statement. This has implications for accounting and governance practitioners as voluntary audit committee report disclosure offers shareholders detailed information that they may use in evaluating audit committee monitoring performance.

This paper explores the effect of dividends on the investment decisions of listed firms in Vietnam from 2010 to 2020. The study employs quantitative research methods to reveal the significant effect of dividends on investment decisions. In addition, the phenomena involving endogeneity and over-identifying restrictions are tested to ensure the reliability of the findings. The dividend-investment relationship is explained based on some theories, including the bird-in-the-hand theory, the asymmetric information theory, the signalling theory, and the agency theory. Under control variables, the findings define and support the effects on the dividend-investment relationship. (c) 2022, Institute of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. All rights reserved.

This study examines the effect of family control on the price reaction to rights issue announcements of publicly listed firms in Indonesia during the period of 2005-2018. The study uses agency theory, which discusses the conflict of interest between controlling/majority and non-controlling/minority shareholders. The results show that the price reaction to the right issue announcements for publicly listed firms in Indonesia is statistically significantly negative. The mean of cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) falls between -1.40% (for the Day 0 window period) and -3.43% (for the -5 to +5 window period). Further examination indicates that family control is associated with a more negative price reaction to these rights issue announcements. Specifically, for rights issue announcements of family firms, the mean cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) fall between -1.98% at announcement day (Day 0) and -5.23% for the event window period (-5 to +5). Meanwhile, for rights issue announcements of non-family firms, the current study found statistically insignificant price reactions to rights issue announcements for all the event window periods. These findings suggest that investors perceive higher agency problems among family firms where the family controlling shareholders tend to misuse and tunnel the rights issue funds for their own private benefit.

In modern organizations, there is a separation between ownership and control of the firm. On the lenses of agency theory, this study statistically examines the relationship between ownership structure (i.e., ownership concentration and owner identity) and firm performance of non-financial listed firms of Pakistan by taking firm-level control variables of size, age, liquidity, financial leverage, and growth of the firm. Secondary data is collected from annual reports of 65 non-financial listed firms for the year 2008 to 2012. The least-square dummy variable model followed by the random effect model has been employed to statistically determining the impact of ownership structure on firm performance. The results of the least square dummy variable model reveal that the ownership concentration has a significant positive impact on firm performance. The owner identity (such as dispersed, family, institutional, and government ownership) has a significant causal effect on firm performance as indicated from t and p values. (c) 2022 by IGI Global.

Public companies represent a valuable tool for the state to intervene in the economy by correcting market failures. However, critical positions that advocate its privatization continue to appear since they do not usually have great returns. This study analyzes the effect that political goals have on the efficiency of a state-owned enterprise (SOE) when ownership and management tend to be concentrated in the same actor. Agency theory served as a reference framework, using Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) as a case study during the period 1995-2014. First, the period was divided into four stages differentiated by changes in the SOE volumetric strategy, the exploration strategy, the position regarding foreign capital, and the SOE participation in social development activities. Later, the SOE economic and productive efficiency was analyzed in the stages to identify relevant changes. The results indicate that the interests of the principal and the agent by good management of the SOE increase when the profit is reduced. It is mainly due to the need of the government to benefit from these activities. However, when the company surplus increase, the government tends to intensify its control to obtain additional benefits, especially during electoral events. (c) 2022 The author(s).

Firms are defined by a set-up of associations that represent contractual provisions for financing, capital structure, managerial ownership and recompense. It has been observed from business history that these relationships have disagreements but virtually every party has alleged to the overall objective of good performance of the business. Previous studies have investigated the relationship among various parties within a firm and the impact on performance through agency theory as this theory leads to separation of ownership and control. But the results of previous studies are rather mixed due to disparity in measures of ownership and performance. This study looks for examining performance under different and detailed list of ownerships and composition of board. Using panel data an attempt was made to study the association between ownership pattern and firm performance for all the major industries listed on BSE 500 index.

This study examines how controlling shareholders affected efficiency in Taiwanese electronics firms for the period of 2005-2017. This study measures firm efficiency using a dynamic data envelopment analysis model, which returns scores ranging from zero (not efficient) to one (efficient). Our regression results find that controlling shareholders' levels of shareholdings have significant negative effects on firm efficiency when their shareholding levels are low. However, there is a positive relationship between controlling shareholders' levels of shareholding and firm efficiency when the percentage of their shareholdings is high. These nonlinear results are also confirmed when we use board seat control rights held by the controlling shareholders. This study contributes to the field of corporate governance, specifically in the application of agency theory related to principal-principal relationships. Overall, findings suggest policy-makers should not consider solely controlling shareholders' levels of shareholdings, but also their board seat control rights.

Independent directors on a firm's board are theorized to enhance corporate governance by mitigating agency conflicts. However, some independent directors, referred to as grey directors, have prior relationships with managers that may hamper this role. Using data for Philippine firms, we construct a measure that categorizes independent directors as truly independent or grey, based on the 12 criteria used to define board independence as stipulated in the 2017 Philippine Corporate Governance Code. This measure is used to examine which firms are more likely to appoint grey directors and how the presence of grey directors affects firm performance. Consistent with agency theory, we find that firms with higher ownership concentration are more likely to have grey directors. However, we find that the presence of these grey directors does not adversely affect firm performance. We conclude that while grey directors are common among Philippine firms, their presence does not appear to escalate agency problems. (c) 2022 by De La Salle University.

Research question: This article aims to explain that poorly functioning separation between decision-making, decision-control, and risk-bearing is a fundamental reason for the financial underperformance of major or large sport events. We look at empirical data from four major sports events hosted in Norway: The 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics, the 2011 International Ski Federation (FIS) World Skiing Championship, the 2014 FIDE Chess Olympiad, and the 2017 International Cycling Union (UCI) World Road Cycling Championships. All these events suffered financially. Research methods: The study data were collected from 66 semi-structured interviews and different types of documents, like guides and reports filed by different stakeholders, applications for financial support, collaboration agreements, protocols of meetings, e-mail correspondence, financial statements, and budgeting documents. Results and findings: Through an examination of the previous literature, our analysis confirms drivers and symptoms of financial problems at sport events. These are: the exaggerated focus on legitimising the event, soft-budget practices, interference by political interests, and so on. We argue that many of these factors could have been handled better if a more consequent separation of risk-bearing, decision-making, and decision-control was in place. Implications: We propose a better separation between the decision-making and decision-control function, by means of a permanent and independent entity that is responsible for the decision-control function. Such an institution could enhance knowledge transfer, contribute competence and skills, and improve the financial outcome of a sports events. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

To defeat myopic brand management, we need to understand better what motivates executives to invest in brand building. Drawing from agency theory, we argue that a better alignment of executives` and shareholders` interests can help. Tests using longitudinal compensation data of chief executive officers (CEO) from 123 public firms suggest that decreasing the sensitivity of CEO`s Equity-Based Compensation (EBC) to the firm`s stock price and increasing its sensitivity to the firm`s stock return volatility are associated with higher brand equity. Weak governance somewhat offsets these effects. Moreover, we find that the impact of EBC on brand equity is partially mediated through the firm`s strategic emphasis. Our research highlights the importance of understanding managerial incentives as drivers of brand equity. (c) 2022 Westburn Publishers Ltd.

As procurement processes in many developing countries are without transparency, addressing agency problems becomes necessary. This study reflects on public procurement and public financial management in a comparative analysis within Asia and Africa through the agency theory lens. With a descriptive case study design, the study utilises datasets from 100 Asian and African countries from 2002 to 2018. The distinctiveness of this paper is that it uses public expenditure framework and accountability procurement indicators to ascertain whether agency cost has increased in both continents. The results showed that Asia performed better than Africa in all the indicators except for voice and accountability, and procurement complaint management. There is also clear evidence to suggest that procurement decisions reduce agency cost in Asia than in Africa. The study, therefore, concludes that Asian countries tend to converge more to international standards during procurement processes than African countries, which leads to efficient PFM outcomes.

This study investigates the effects of foreign return-oriented shareholders and domestic relational shareholders of Japanese companies on the earnings management behavior of their invested firms when stock option pay is adopted. We theorize that foreign shareholders seek short-term returns and do not engage in close monitoring due to an information disadvantage while domestic shareholders prevent managerial behavior that distorts information disclosure. Our findings show that managers of firms that use stock option pay engage in earnings management to increase their private financial benefits and meet capital markets' expectations, which allows them to enhance their own reputation. However, this managerial behavior is contingent on the firm's ownership structure. Our results show that while foreign shareholders enhance the positive impact of stock options on earning management, domestic shareholders and affiliated directors mitigate this positive effect. Our empirical analyses support the argument that ownership heterogeneity is a key determinant of managerial propensity to engage in earnings management when Japanese firms adopt stock option pay.

Prior literature acknowledges that, despite its importance in accounting research and practice, there is little understanding of how accruals (i.e., non-cash component of earnings) behave. To extend the literature on the complex behavior of accruals, this study examines how the asymmetric behavior of accruals is affected by managerial incentive structure. Built upon the agency theory, this study predicts that the "reverse" asymmetric behavior of accruals (i.e., being more sensitive to sales decreases than to sales increases) is mitigated (amplified) when the incentive structure for CEOs relies relatively more on short-term cash bonus (long-term incentives). The empirical results based on a sample of 26,183 firm-year observations for S&P 1500 companies are highly consistent with the prediction. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

Though managerial ties are substitutes for the weak market-supporting institutions in developing and emerging countries, little is known about the contingent value of these ties in credit markets. In this study, we disintegrate managerial ties into political and financial ties, and examine their effect on access to finance. Using agency theory, we propose that political and financial ties reduce information asymmetry between firms, politicians and banks, culminating in increased access to bank loans for firms. We also propose that CEO duality, through its influence on corporate governance and information consolidation, strengthens (weakens) the effect of financial (political) ties on access to finance. Using survey data from Ghana, we found support for our propositions. Overall, this study shows that the value of managerial ties is contingent on CEO duality. It also suggests that CEO duality is a double-edged sword with corporate governance and information implications for credit access in developing economies. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Purpose: This study draws on agency, theory to evaluate the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and earnings quality, proxied by discretionary accruals. Additionally, this study aims to examine whether board independence moderates the relationship between CEO duality and earnings quality. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a fixed-effects regression model to examine the effect of CEO duality on earnings quality and to test whether board independence moderates that relationship for a sample of non-financial listed Portuguese firms-year from 2002 to 2016. Findings: Consistent with agency theory, this study suggests that CEO duality decreases earnings quality. Further, the results also suggest that the earnings quality reduction associated with CEO duality is attenuated when the board of directors has a higher proportion of independent directors. Practical implications: The findings based on this study provide useful information to investors and regulators in evaluating the impact of CEO duality on earnings quality and the effect of board independence on the role of CEO duality, especially under concentrated ownership. Originality/value: To the knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the role of board independence on the association between CEO duality and earnings quality. In addition, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the direct and indirect effect of CEO duality on earnings quality in Portugal. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to look at the direct relationship between audit quality, earnings management (EM) practices and company performance, as well as the indirect influence (mediation) of EM practices in the relationship between audit quality and company performance. It offers empirical evidence from the Jordanian market, which is considered an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach: The population of this study is represented in Jordanian service companies listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE), with a total of 344 company-year observations. Furthermore, panel data analysis was used in this study, and data for the study were acquired from yearly reports as well as the ASE's database. Findings: Based on generalized method of moments model, the present findings demonstrate that the size of the audit firm and the tenure of the audit firm have a positive and negative influence on EM practices, respectively, but that industry-specialist audit firm has a negative and insignificant effect. EM practices have a negative impact on two company performance proxies (ROA and ROE), but have no effect on earnings per share (EPS). Furthermore, the size of the audit firm has a positive and significant influence on the performance proxies of the company [i.e. return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE)]. The presence of an industry-specialist audit firm has a positive and significant influence on two proxies of company performance (ROE and EPS), but a negative and significant impact on ROA. An audit firm's tenure has a negative and significant impact on two performance proxies (ROA and EPS), but a positive and significant impact on ROE. Then, EM practices either fully or partially mediate the relationship between audit quality proxies and company performance as assessed by ROA, ROE and EPS. Research limitations/implications: The current study's limitation is that it only searched in Jordanian service companies listed on ASE from 2012 to 2019 to meet the study's objectives; thus, the authors recommend that future work investigate the study model for other sectors, whether in Jordan or other emerging markets such as the Middle East and North Africa. Another limitation of this study is that the study models lack important variables, which may affect EM and company performance, such as corporate governance and ownership structure characteristics; as a result, the authors recommend that future work includes such variables in future research models to have more explanations in this context. Practical implications: Analysts, investors and other strategic decision makers may use the findings of this study to improve the efficiency and efficacy of Jordan's financial market. These findings will enhance policymakers' willingness to establish appropriate regulations, which might improve Jordan's financial market performance and efficacy. These findings may help investors make better judgments by using audit quality proxies and EM indicators, which can forecast business success. Originality/value: First, this study distinguishes itself from prior studies through establishing a new research model, by investigating the mediating effect of EM in the relationship between audit quality and company performance. It provides empirical evidence from the Jordanian market; hence, it increases the body of the knowledge in this context. Second, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to look into the link between audit quality, EM and company performance together; hence, the model of this study is developed using agency theory and information asymmetry theory. Third, the current study adds new evidence to the role of audit quality and EM in companies, as well as how audit quality and EM practices affect company performance in emerging markets such as Jordan.

The objective of this study is to examine the role that the specialized committees, created within the board of directors, and the auditor play in relation to the hiring of a non-financial information assurance service and in relation to the choices of the assurance provider for such non-financial information. Specifically, this study analyses the effect of the independence and specialisation of the audit committee, the existence of a CSR committee, and the reputation of the financial auditor associated with its classification as Big4. The results indicate that those responsible for financial information do not show interest in contracting an assurance service, especially if it is realized by an accountant provider, except that the information is standardised according to the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and the contracted service is comparable to the financial audit standards, has assurance for a reasonable/high level, and is carried out according to the ISAE3000 standard.

Cultural dimensions have a significant impact on capital structure decisions, particularly in Islamic economies where unique personal, social and ethical values are closely integrated with culture. This study considers the relationship between four Hofstede cultural dimensions to explain their connection with the capital structure decisions of Shariah-compliant firms. Using a panel of 342 Shariah complaint companies from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for the period 2013 to 2017, this study investigates the influence of cultural dimensions on short-term, long-term and total leverage in the presence of several firm- and country-specific variables. On average, Saudi Arabian firms witnessed comparatively higher percentages of all three debt classifications considered. Typically, determinants of debt do not otherwise differ significantly across the three countries. Firms also carefully consider asset structure and growth opportunities when raising debt capital. On the other hand, when tested alongside cultural dimensions, Islamic firms from countries with (a) higher power distance scores, (b) higher levels of individualism, (c) higher masculinity scores and (d) lower degrees of uncertainty avoidance exhibit a preference for long-term debt. This finding diverges from the existing literature on non-Islamic firms. Agency theory and pecking order theory predominate in explaining our findings. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Controlling shareholders are capable of influencing major decisions in firms, and their existence may give rise to principal-to-principal conflict as minority shareholders may feel sidelined during decision-making. This study employs a proxy (the highest control right), which takes into consideration both direct and indirect controls to investigate the excess cash usage preference of controlling shareholders. Again, the study investigates how the background characteristics of different controlling shareholders influence their underlying firms' acquisition decisions. With observations from 13,293 Chinese firms and the random effect probit model, we find that controlling shareholders are more likely to influence the use of excess cash into acquisition activities other than to retain such cash in the firm possibly for the payment of a dividend. Furthermore, we observe that the traditional way of classifying firms into either private or state is misleading, and the use of excess cash is influenced by the unique characteristics of the true owner. We recommend that on-going reforms in China should consider encouraging more institutional investors to acquire shares as this will reduce the powers of controlling owners.

Purpose: This study examines the relationship between the accounting information quality, tax avoidance, and political connection in all Jordanian companies listed on Amman Stock Exchange. The current study also investigates the moderating effect of political connections on accounting information quality and company performance relationships. Further, the study examines the moderating effect of political connection on tax avoidance and company performance relationship. Theoretical framework: Political connections, tax avoidance, and the quality of accounting information affect a company's performance. According to the agency theory, reliable accounting information improves business performance and resources' allocation efficiency by reducing information asymmetry. Additionally, the adverse effects of politics on companies are mitigated by accounting information quality. As a result, the cash flow is allocated effectively, improving the business's overall performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses the ordinary least squares (OLS) and applied moderated multiple regression (MMR). The sample data of this study includes 2266 company-years observations over the period 2008-2018 for all Jordanian companies listed on Amman Stock Exchange. The study compares accounting and market-based measurements of companies' performance (ROE, Tobin's Q). Findings: The study reveals consistent results among the measure. The results support the agency theory and found that accounting information quality reduces information asymmetry and positively affects companies' performance. Also, tax avoidance helps the companies to have more cash, and the results indicate a significant positive effect on companies' performance. In addition, the results support the agency theory argument and found that politics increase agency costs and negatively affect companies' performance. However, further analysis found that political connections sustain the positive effect of accounting information quality, which is a robust governance mechanism in Jordanian listed companies. Finally, the results found that tax avoidance with more political connections harms companies' performance. Research, Practical & Social implications: This study helps policymakers increase the governance mechanisms function in Jordanian listed companies. Also, the higher political relationship with the companies could be affected negatively on the Jordanian companies' achievement. Originality/value: The findings suggest several consequences for the fields of accounting and corporate governance. Additionally, the Middle East nations, including the Jordanian market, have had numerous economic difficulties that this study aids in resolving. For example, antagonistic political ties, information asymmetry, and insufficient allocation of financial resources. (c) 2022 AOS-Estratagia and Inovacao. All rights reserved.

The majority of projects - even ultimately successful ones - run into significant problems during their development. While organizations have a variety of mechanisms at their disposal to correct projects that are experiencing difficulties, one of the most radical is replacing the project manager. Replacing a project manager 'mid-stream' involves a major change to an ongoing project with the potential benefits of onboarding an individual with a different perspective or set of managerial and/or technical skills. Using agency theory as our critical evaluative lens and a qualitative data collection methodology, we interviewed 19 key informants who had experience as part of project manager replacement efforts. This article reports of the dynamics of replacing project managers, identifying the critical decision criteria and mechanisms involved in such decisions. We found that three themes emerged with regard to project manager replacement decision making: 1) replacement is a common correction practice for troubled projects; 2) replacement is viewed by decision makers and team members alike as a message for change; and 3) in reestablishing processes and trust in governance, project size is an important moderator when deciding on a course of action. We finally propose a process model, based on our analysis, which identifies the critical antecedents, effects, and consequences of project manager replacement. (c) 1988-2012 IEEE.

Purpose: The authors investigate the impact of governance on the leverage of East Asian firms in the financial crisis context, in order to understand the puzzle whether debt acts as a substitute for governance or an outcome of the governance mechanism. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use 86,030 firm-years and the country-level governance data from eight East Asian countries over the period 1996-2017. The authors employ the fixed effects (FE) model, in the main analysis and the weighted least squares model, as a robustness check in order to compare the two competing hypotheses of agency theory, substitute and outcome models. Findings: The authors' results show that debt acts as a substitute for governance before the GFC, but during and after the GFC the picture changes. Namely, debt acts as an outcome of the governance mechanism during the GFC and its aftermath. Since during financial downturns both agency costs increase, and information asymmetry widens, firms in poor-governed countries may be reluctant to increase their leverage in order not to face financial distress and additional restrictions. Thus, the results imply that the use of debt as a tool to mitigate agency conflicts and a substitute for governance strongly depends on the environment that the firms operate and the general macroeconomic conditions, such as facing a financial crisis or not. Research limitations/implications: This study provides an interesting case of the firms' capacity to raise money during a crisis and that governance plays an important role in borrowing activities of firms. This will undoubtedly help motivating owners and policymakers for improving governance. The authors' findings may be useful for policymakers to develop policies considering the adverse effects caused by exogenous shocks. This is crucial because the severity of GFC as a shock seems to change the macro and institutional environment that firms operate. While the authors properly address the research hypotheses using country governance data, future research may employ corporate governance data to attain firm-level results by testing two competing hypotheses. Originality/value: There are several important areas where this study makes original contributions. First, while Tsoy and Heshmati (2019) focus on the dynamics of capital structure for only Korean firms, the authors extend the sample including eight East Asian countries considering the impact of country governance on capital structure policy. Specifically, this study is the first in using the robust country governance data, which differs by country and year, in the crisis context. Next, the authors investigate both the AFC and GFC to compare whether these two crises have different effects on capital structure policy of East Asian firms. Finally, the authors aim to understand whether leverage is used as a substitute for governance or an outcome of governance mechanism considering recessions. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The alignment among multiple stakeholder benefits is a valuable performance indicator for the benefits generated by a firm for various stakeholders. Our research seeks to augment stakeholder-agency theory with an institutional perspective to analyze how national institutions affect stakeholder benefit alignment. We suggest that the current development of stakeholder-agency theory has overlooked the alignment of different stakeholders' benefits and the external institutional contexts as critical determinants in ensuring such alignment. We conceptualize stakeholder benefit alignment as a positive relationship between different stakeholder groups' benefits, and propose an institutional framework grounded in relative stakeholder salience. Using this framework, we argue that stakeholder benefits are better aligned when national institutions enhance the ease of withdrawal, legal protection, and private enforcement for intrinsically less salient stakeholders, and when a long-term oriented culture characterizes a society. We found supportive evidence by employing a meta-analytic approach based on 530 correlations from 94 primary studies representing 23 economies. Our study adds new insights to the stakeholder-agency literature by conceptualizing and quantitatively examining the degree of alignment across different stakeholder benefit dimensions, focusing on national formal and informal institutions as boundary conditions.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether threshold effects exist in the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the panel smooth threshold regression model (PSTR) to a sample of 284 non-financial French firms listed on Euronext Paris over the period 2009-2017. Firm performance proxies are Tobin's Q and return on assets (ROA). The board gender diversity is measured by the percentage of women participation in board. Findings: Threshold effects in the relationships between board gender diversity and firm performance measures are found. For Tobin's Q, the model has one threshold at the 34.17% of women directors' appointment on boards. Similarly, for ROA, the model has one threshold at the 38.28% of women presence in the board. The results show that above the estimated threshold, women directorship has a positive impact on firm performance. However, below the threshold, there is a neutral relationship. The findings support the critical mass view that a minimum of one third women representation in board is compulsory to achieve the desired effect of gender diversity. Practical implications: This study's finding provides useful insights to managers, investors and policymakers. Managers and investors can identify the adequate board gender diversity levels that enhance firm performance. Policymakers are divided on whether mandatory or voluntary board gender quota should be adopted. This study suggests that a quota of one third can be used in policy implementation. Originality/value: Unlike prior studies that consider the relationship between firm performance and board gender diversity as linear, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the threshold effects in this relationship using a new econometric approach.

Purpose: This study investigates the impact of managerial ability and auditor report readability on the cost of debt and corporate liquidity in Omani-listed industrial companies. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses data from the S&P Capital IQ database and audited annual reports published on Muscat Securities Market. The sample consists of 35 firms (175 firm-year observations) from 2015 to 2019. Managerial ability is measured using the data envelopment analysis proposed by Demerjian et al. (2012a, b). Auditor report readability is measured as a log of the auditor report digital file size proposed by Loughran and McDonald (2014). Findings: This study finds that a company's managerial ability reduces the cost of debt lending support to upper echelons and agency theory. Highly able managers of industrial companies are associated with increased corporate liquidity consistent with the precautionary motive of holding cash. In addition, less-readable auditor reports contribute to higher debt costs and reduce corporate liquidity. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, few studies have explored the influence of managerial ability and auditor reporting readability on firms' financial policy. For industrial-sector firms, this study demonstrates the managerial ability and readability of auditor readability as significant determinants of the cost of debt and corporate liquidity, especially during periods of uncertainty. Thus, the findings can be generalized to other non-financial sector firms in the country and the Middle East. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Using a cross-sectional dataset comprising 749 firms from 13 countries in Asia Pacific markets, this study examines the effect of board monitoring effectiveness (BME) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP). This study also investigates how BME and the country's legal system, and BME and CEO non-duality leadership interact to influence CSP. The results reveal that BME positively affects CSP, suggesting that strengthening board monitoring effectiveness will lead to a greater drive towards firms' sustainable business conduct. This study also finds that firms from countries with civil law system and firms practicing CEO non-duality leadership would enhance the impact of BME on CSP. Additionally, the effect of BME on CSP is more pronounced among non-duality firms operating in countries with civil law regime. The findings are consistent and robust to two different measures of CSP. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The literature has explored an association between corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure and accounting conservatism. This paper investigates how state ownership moderates this relationship in the context of the emerging Russian economy. Using a sample of 223 publicly listed Russian companies for the period of 2012-2017, we find that companies with higher CSR disclosure tend to have more conservative financial reporting practices. We observe, however, that state ownership has a negative moderating effect on this association, in line with agency theory. Moreover, we explore the unique structure of Russian companies' state ownership, whereby public companies often have a combination of federal, regional, and municipal state ownership, the outcome of privatization reform. We find that federal state ownership alone or in combination with regional or municipal levels of state ownership has a significantly negative impact on the CSR disclosure-accounting conservatism association. We find no evidence that a regional or municipal level of state ownership, a combination of regional and municipal levels of state ownership, or a combination of all three levels has an impact on the association between CSR disclosure and reporting conservatism. We address the recent call for a contextualized approach that focuses on institutional, legal, and cultural features of different economies to advance our knowledge of the antecedents of CSR disclosure, its association with reporting quality, and the factors that moderate it.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the relationship between key audit matters (KAMs) and audit costs and whether board size and independence affect this relationship. Furthermore, this paper examines the moderating effect of corporate governance on the relationship between KAMs and audit costs. Design/methodology/approach: The authors hypothesise that disclosing more KAMs in the audit report is positively associated with audit costs because of the greater effort. The agency theory suggests that firms with good governance will mitigate the agency conflict of interest and improve financial reporting quality. Thus, good governance might moderate the relationship between reported KAMs and audit costs. The authors use a quantitative approach. The authors are using a sample of the UK FTSE all-share non-financial firms from 2014 to 2018 for the UK Financial Times Stock Exchange all-share non-financial firms. Findings: The authors provide evidence of a significant positive relationship between KAMs and audit costs. The relationship is relatively higher when considering the independent directors' percentage as a moderating factor. These results came consistent with the agency theory literature. However, the authors found no empirical evidence to support a moderating effect of board size on the relationship between KAMs and audit cost. Practical implications: The finding benefits the regulatory setters to better understand the consequences of the new auditing standards. This paper has theoretical and practical implications for regulators, standard setters, professional bodies, shareholders and academics. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature assessing the regulatory changes related to audit reform and adds to the debate on the impact on audit costs. This paper underlines governance factors as a moderating role in this relationship between KAMs and audit costs. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

There has been growing scholarly interest in the impact of CEO narcissism on discrete firm outcomes. One area this CEO characteristic might impact is the firm's corporate political activity (CPA), and in fact scholars have called for further research into its antecedents. In this article, we argue that while CEO narcissism might be negatively related to CPA in general, the CPA the firms do engage in will be aimed at more ideologically extreme politicians. To test this prediction, we rely on prior research that has identified manifestations of CEO narcissism such as CEOs' compensation and the size of their pictures in the annual report. We develop databases following this guidance that we test using panel data analysis and propensity score matching to address endogeneity. We find support for our hypotheses by testing an unbalanced panel with 10,841 observations of 2,211 publicly traded firms over a ten-year period. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

After two decades of research on Emerging Market Multinational Enterprises (EMNE), the debate still concerns the antecedents and strategies of their foreign expansion. However, much less has been said on the effects of international participation on their productivity. Building on insights from the Resource-Based View of the firm and agency theory, we develop hypotheses on the presence of complementarities among export, import and R&D and their impact on productivity. Our empirical analyses on a panel of 23,000 time-year observations of Ukrainian MNEs over the period 2000-2006, confirm that: (i) EMNEs benefit from complementarities stemming from the assimilation and integration of knowledge from international external sources (import and export) with internal knowledge (own R&D investment); (ii) the effect is more pronounced for private-owned enterprises (POEs) rather than state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and (iii) especially when they trade with partners in/from advanced markets.

The purpose of this study is to gauge the efficacy of theories of corporate governance in alleviating bankruptcy in the Indian context. The study uses logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard model on a sample of 680 firm observations. Two-stage least squares regression is employed to mitigate endogeneity issues. Main results support agency theory in terms of CEO non-duality, low CEO compensation, and concentrated ownership variables, and defend resource dependence theory with respect to large board size and high directors' attendance, for precluding bankruptcy. Internal and external governance mechanisms are more favourable in 5 to 3 years and 1 to 2 years prior to bankruptcy, respectively. The predictive power of governance models is found to be better than of financial models in 5 to 4 years prior to bankruptcy. Combined models involving both governance and financial variables outperform standalone governance or financial models and are most accurate in the fifth year preceding bankruptcy. Additional tests show that the time availability of independent directors holds more importance over their resourcefulness in the initial years of distress. This study has a few key takeaways for stakeholders, companies, and regulating bodies. It is suggested that regulators enforce CEO non-duality and necessitate a minimum number of board meetings to be attended per year by the directors. This is one of the first studies to develop a corporate governance model on bankruptcy in the Indian context since the enactment of its new bankruptcy code.

Purpose: This paper examines whether ownership type has a moderating influence on dividend payouts during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis with respect to changes in profits. Future uncertainties because of the pandemic will result in a perceived need for liquidity within the company, but retaining cash may be risky for shareholders who could look for less risky alternatives. The dividend payout strategy is thus even more closely related to the overall type concentration and strategy of the owners during the crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The effects are explored and tested on early data from 2019 to 2020 of Finnish companies using ANCOVA while controlling for profitability and sector variables. Findings: A significant effect on dividend payout during the COVID crisis was found when the companies are dominantly held by individual owners validating early suggestions on such an influence. Therefore, this study contributes further to the academic debates on the influence of ownership concentration in times of crises. This study lists certain sectors which experience diminished profits during such a crisis which pinpoints sector separation in future discussions. Research limitations/implications: This study explores early data from a specific context in the Nordic countries. However, it does so out of purpose as explained in the paper. Practical implications: Ownership type and concentration matters when it comes to dividend payout decisions under uncertainty with regard to changes in profit. Investors need to accept these behavioural insights into their decisions. Originality/value: This study examines the signalling effect of dividends by analysing how actual or anticipated change in profitability due to a crisis is reflected by owners and leads to dividend payout decisions under uncertainty.

This study aims to examine a set of institutional isomorphic influences toward integrated reporting quality (IRQ) and the role of board independence in moderating such influences. The results from a cross-sectional sample of 200 international companies indicated that both coercive (regulatory quality) and normative isomorphism (press freedom, CEO with accounting qualification, Dow Jones Sustainability Index listing, and winning an IR award) exert positive effects on IRQ. Moreover, board independence moderates positively for the effects of mimetic isomorphism (environmental sensitive industry) on IRQ. This study contributes to filling the gap in the literature by offering a multi-theory approach to analyzing the antecedent of IRQ from the lenses of both institutional and agency theory. It also offers a practical contribution for corporate IR adopters, users, and regulatory authorities to improve corporate reporting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the moderating role of board independence on IRQ. (c) 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of corporate governance mechanisms, namely, board of directors and auditors, on tax aggressiveness in Italian companies listed on the Milan Stock Exchange. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a population of 168 Italian non-financial firms listed on the Milan Stock Exchange, holding shares in at least one foreign subsidiary in countries other than Italy in fiscal year 2018. Data on corporate boards and auditors were collected through the evaluation of companies' annual reports over the period 2011-2018. Five panel data analyses with fixed effects were performed for each tax aggressiveness index, yielding 1,176 observations to test the research hypothesis. Findings: This paper finds that corporate board characteristics, such as size, gender diversity and CEO duality, and auditors' features, such as external audit quality, increase corporate tax aggressiveness. Practical implications: This study provides investors with an understanding of corporate boards' and auditors' roles in preventing agency conflicts and evaluating a company's tax approach. Furthermore, the findings are useful for international political bodies in regulating corporate board composition and managerial monitoring. Originality/value: Almost all studies focusing primarily on corporate governance mechanisms' effects on tax aggressiveness are within the US context. Empirical evidence on the topic in the European contexts is limited. The legislative discrepancy between countries is reflected in the computation of indices measuring tax aggressiveness, affecting US studies' generalizability across nations. This paper extends the literature on the topic by investigating other unexplored corporate governance mechanisms. Five indices were used to measure corporate tax aggressiveness and to assess analysis reliability and data robustness. Moreover, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate the link between corporate governance mechanisms and tax aggressiveness in Italy.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the drivers for proactive workplace social performance in family firms through a configurational approach. Comparative research on family versus non-family firms and workplace social performance has produced mixed results. Consequently, several calls have been made to account for family business heterogeneity to understand better how family involvement in the business affects the workplace social performance. The authors respond to these calls by exploring the governance antecedents that can catalyze family firms' workplace social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using qualitative comparative analysis, the authors analyze 131 family firms from the STEP survey data. Findings: The authors find two governance configurations that lead to better family business workplace social performance. The first configuration is the combination of 100% family ownership, high family involvement in management and a mix of outside directors and family members on the board. The second configuration is the combination of less than 100% family ownership and low family involvement in management. Originality/value: The study builds on and extends the nascent work suggesting the integration of agency and stewardship theories. The authors show that these two theoretical approaches are able to not only coexist, but that they can also be complementary in helping to understand the unique workplace social behaviors of family firms.

Abstract: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle to obtain credit when credit ratings and collateral are used as criteria to assess their credit applications. In the context of Africa, the financial markets have gaping institutional voids, and contextual insights into SMEs' experiences remain underdeveloped. Drawing on the stakeholder-agency theory of debt financing, this paper advances the scholarly conversation by theorising about how collateral security, collateral security value and the gender of SME owners lead to the involuntary financial exclusion of many manufacturing businesses in Africa. Analysis of the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) dataset reveals that collateral security and collateral security value, together with gender biases in Africa's financial markets, reduce credit access potential. Consequently, SMEs' perceptions of the likelihood of obtaining credit for business purposes are reduced. Empirical results for 13,783 SMEs across 41 African countries indicate that the motivations to apply for credit also diminish. These observations contribute to entrepreneurial financing and SME research. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

Purpose: This study aims to determine the effect of the internal control system, information technology, applying of accounting standards, human resources competence, and the role of internal auditors on the quality of financial reports of local governments. Theoretical framework: Internal control system, information technology, applying of accounting standards, human resources competence, and the role of internal auditors affect the quality of financial reports. According to the agency theory, the quality of financial reports improves government performance and increasing accountability by reducing the information asymmetry. Additionally, under the agency theory approach, transparency and information are useful in controlling managers and making them responsible for their decisions, as well as overall organizational performance. Design/Methodology: The sample in this study was 126 respondents who were obtained using purposive sampling technique from the financial management and accounting officials of Kendari City, Southeast Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. The analytical method used is multiple linear regression analysis. Findings: The results support the agency theory and found that the internal control system, information technology, applying of accounting standards, and the role of internal auditors had a positive and significant effect on the quality of financial reports of local governments. Meanwhile, human resource competence has a positive but not significant effect on the quality of financial reports of local governments. This shows that the better the internal control system, information technology, applying of accounting standards, and the role of internal audit, the quality of local government financial reports will be better. Research, Practical & Social implications: This study can fill gaps in the results of previous research and helps to provide useful information for local governments in improving the quality of financial reports as an important part of efforts to increase transparency and accountability in the management and reporting of local government finances. Originality/Value: The findings suggest several consequences for the fields of public sector accounting and government governance. Additionally, recent empirical evidence shows that the implementation of accountability in many developing countries, including local government in Indonesia has not yet reached general standards and mainly focuses on compliance with applicable regulations, that this study aids in resolving by examining the factors that determine the quality of local government financial reports.

Do cost leaders engage with sustainability practices or avoid them to save costs, and do differentiators implement those practices to attract the sympathy of the customers or not? How do shareholders of each strategy follower consider those practices? Answering these questions is the main purpose of this study. We find that while cost leadership is significantly and positively associated with environmental, social, and governance sustainability, differentiation is significantly and negatively associated with social and environmental sustainability but not with governance sustainability. While cost leaders' shareholders approve of social and governance sustainability, differentiators' shareholders disapprove of environmental, social, and governance sustainability.

This study addresses the influence of sustainable institutional investors (SII), based on the signatory status of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), on corporate tax avoidance. Moreover, the moderating influence of corporate sustainability performance (CSP) is analyzed. The analyses concentrate on a European sample consisting of 1689 firm-year observations between 2014 and 2020 (EUROSTOXX 600) embedded in a stakeholder agency theoretical framework. Correlation, regression, and robustness analyses are conducted. The results are in line with prior studies on equity ownership and tax avoidance and indicate that SII have a negative impact on tax avoidance and that CSP strengthens this negative effect. These results are robust to a battery of sensitivity analyses. SII represent a major monitoring mechanism in promoting responsible tax behavior, which is in line with other stakeholders' interests. Tax avoidance should be integrated into overall sustainability management to realize an increased firm reputation. As the European Commission initiated several regulations on sustainable finance, sustainability reporting, and tax disclosure, the empirical results stress the interdependencies between ownership structure, CSP, and tax avoidance. The study makes a major contribution to prior analyses, as this study is the first to assess the link between SII and tax avoidance and the moderating impact of CSP to urge top management to increase sustainability efforts.

Drawing on principal-principal agency theory and the socioemotional wealth (SEW) perspective, this paper explores the motivations and mechanisms regarding the founding family's contingent choices of governance provisions that facilitate managerial entrenchment, which can potentially threaten firm performance. By investigating S&P 1,500 firms between 2007 and 2017 and employing quasi-experimental treatment effects analyses, this study finds that family firms are less likely to utilize the E-index provisions than non-family firms in general. Further, family firms tend to adopt more E-index provisions when the first generation of the founding family remains involved in the firm. However, as these firms age, they rely less on the E-index provisions to entrench family managers. Consequently, this paper expands current research on the governance of publicly-traded family firms by illustrating the differences between family and non-family firms as well as the impact of transgenerational family governance on the use of entrenchment mechanisms over time.

This paper explores how contracts in private equity-backed buyouts shape corporate governance in portfolio companies. Drawing upon agency theory and incomplete contracting theory, 50 actual contracts are analyzed in detail. Contracts focus on reducing adverse selection risks through limiting pre-investment information asymmetries and aligning the goals of investors and sellers. Moral hazard risks vis-a-vis management are limited through limiting post-investment information asymmetries and limiting shirking behavior through limiting free cash flows. Goal alignment is achieved through high-powered incentive structures combined with shifting risk of underperformance to management. Managerial hold-up problems are addressed through restricting share transactions and limiting managerial actions. Residual powers and contingencies are mainly used to deal with incomplete contract designs due to uncertainties. Few clauses are used to address the reverse agency problem in which management is protected against moral hazard problems created by the private equity investor. PE contracts have transparent and very strong outcome-based cash flow rights, both limiting downside risk and rewarding upside potential. This contrasts with VC contracts which are especially contingency-based given the high levels of uncertainty of the portfolio companies.

The study aims to investigate the moderating effect of the board independence on the COSO components (Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Information and Communication, Control Activities and Monitoring), and the financial performance in the Jordanian banks. This paper used 109 usable questionnaires from financial managers, internal control managers and internal Auditors and the secondary data of the Jordanian banks reports. The collected data were analyzed utilizing Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The study shows new findings and unique contribution to the impact of COSO components on the financial performance of Jordanian banks; the results show a positive relationship between COSO's components and financial performance (ROI, ROE). It also presented a statistically significant impact of two components (Control Activities and Control Environment) on ROI. In addition, the study showed that the association between COSO control components and the financial performance is positively moderated by board independence. This study provides a unique contribution to other studies of the impact internal control systems based on the COSO components control and their impact on the financial performance, as well as the moderator effect (board independence) on this relationship in the Jordanian banks. The results of the study support the agency's theory in which the level of financial performance satisfactory to shareholders will reduce the agency's problem and costs, and thus a new scientific shareholder path added to accounting literature that explains the relationships and impacts between COSO.

Businesses are increasingly expected to disclose their progress towards sustainable development via engagement with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Although there is increasing trend towards disclosure, corporate reporting on Sustainable Development Goals varies in content and quality, posing a challenge to assess and improve the quality of disclosure. To understand variation in Sustainable Development Goal disclosure, it is essential to examine significant factors influencing corporate reporting. Accordingly, this research aims to investigate key drivers of reporting. The study undertakes content analysis of sustainability reports from leading Australian companies and conducts multinomial logistic regression analysis to provide evidence on drivers of disclosure. Using institutional theory and agency theory, a set of hypothesised relationships between Sustainable Development Goal disclosures and determinants of disclosure are developed. The study finds that Sustainable Development Goal reporting practices are a developing trend driven by external institutional factors and organisational characteristics. The study concludes there is need for a more robust Sustainable Development Goal measurement and reporting framework that can support companies to align their business strategies with the goals. This research makes several contributions to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the determinants of specific attributes of Sustainable Development Goal disclosure; empirical insights into potential motives for Sustainable Development Goal reporting; and a unique disclosure quality index that will be useful to academics and practitioners interested in assessing and ranking Sustainable Development Goal disclosures.

Longstanding assumptions underlying strategic alliances, such as agency theory, are actively being revoked by dynamics in the new economy. The mechanism of inter-firm cooperation is increasingly being altered by radical developments in blockchains and artificial intelligence among other technologies. To capture and address this shift, this review takes a problematisation approach and focuses wholly on the pertinence of agency theory. First, it begins by acknowledging the established corpus in the area before, second, appraising the seven long-held assumptions in the principal-agent relationship encompassing (1) self-interest, (2) conflicting goals, (3) bounded rationality, (4) information asymmetry, (5) pre-eminence of efficiency, (6) risk aversion and (7) information as a commodity. Third, to add a fresh perspective, the review proceeds to proffer seven assumptions to advance a novel 'Blockchain Agency Theory' that would better describe new attributes and relaxed agency behaviour in blockchain alliances. These counter assumptions are (1) common interests, (2) congruent goals, (3) unbounded rationality, (4) information symmetry, (5) smart contracts, (6) mean risk and (7) information availability. In the fourth part, the prior audience of principals and agents is appraised and this culminates into, fifth, a consideration of a new audience of blockchain agency in algocratic environments. Altogether, the seven new assumptions extend and provoke new agency thinking among scholars and blockchain practitioners alike. (c) 2023 The Authors

How family firms innovate has captivated scholars for over a decade. However, an investigation into the benefits of research and development (R&D) for family firm value under differing economic conditions has received little attention in the family firm innovation or R&D literature. This study examines the relationship between R&D intensity and firm value among listed family firms during the economic recession period of 2007-2010 and nonrecessionary periods (referred to as normal periods) in the US between 1995 and 2013. Based on behavioral agency theory, we evaluate the moderating effects of investments in inward-looking and outward-looking corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives on this relationship. We hypothesize that R&D intensity is negatively related to family firm value during a recession period, but outward-looking CSR positively moderates the relationship between the two. The opposite is hypothesized during normal periods. The results support the assertions that outward-looking CSR can ease the negative impact brought about by R&D intensity on firm value during a recession period, while inward-looking CSR investments surprisingly bear no effects. Important implications for research, family firm leaders, and R&D managers are discussed. (c) 2023 The Authors. R&D Management published by RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The aim of this study was to examine the moderating effect of ownership concentration (OC) on the relationship between impactful female directors and earnings management (EM). The study concentrated on firms with the lowest positive earnings, measured by return on assets. The results showed that OC positively moderated the association between impactful female directors and accrual earnings management (AEM). With the moderating effect of OC, impactful female directors became positively associated with AEM. In terms of real earnings management (REM), the results showed that OC weakened the significant negative relationship between impactful female directors and REM that was found in the direct regression. With the moderating effect of OC, impactful female directors became insignificantly associated with REM. The study is extremely beneficial to policymakers, stakeholders, researchers, and society. It provides empirical findings that could help all parties to re-evaluate the role of the board of directors, specifically impactful female directors, in mitigating EM. The results highlight the impact of the majority shareholders, introduced by agency theory II, an issue that requires more solutions from regulators. (c) 2023 by the author.

Publicly listed firms have discretion to disclose (or not) advertising spending in their annual (10-K) reports. The disclosure of advertising spending can provide valuable information because advertising is a leading indicator of future performance. However, estimates of advertising spending are available from data providers, arguably mitigating the need for its formal disclosure. This article argues that firms' disclosure of advertising spending provides more complete and public information and therefore lowers investor uncertainty about future firm performance (idiosyncratic risk). Empirical analyses show that the effect is largely driven by the negative effect of disclosure of advertising spending on analyst uncertainty. Consistent with agency theory, the negative effect of the disclosure of advertising spending on analyst uncertainty is stronger for firms with more financial resources, firms with lower disclosure quality, and firms that are in more competitive industries. Additional analyses show that the disclosure of advertising spending has a significant positive effect on firm value in specific sectors. These results, therefore, identify an avenue for chief marketing officers to play a greater role in managing investor relations. In addition, they suggest strong merit for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board to reconsider current regulations governing advertising spending disclosure.

Purpose: Building on behavioral agency theory, the authors explore the role played by corporate governance characteristics as drivers of the diversification strategies of family firms. Specifically, this study aims to investigate the effects of board size and board gender diversity on the likelihood that family firms will execute a diversifying acquisition vis-a-vis a related acquisition. Furthermore, the authors investigate the contingency effects played by foreign directorship and the firm's listing status. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses are tested on an original sample of 213 cross-border acquisitions executed by Italian family firms between 2008 and 2021. Findings: The findings suggest that both large board sizes and greater gender diversity positively affect the diversification of family firms. While the presence of foreign directors magnifies the positive effect of board size, gender diversity discourages diversification in the case of listed firms. Originality/value: The originality of this study is twofold. First, while prior literature has mostly focused on the family vs nonfamily dichotomy, this paper contributes to an emergent line of research investigating the heterogeneity among family firms' corporate strategy decisions. Second, by exploring the corporate governance-diversification link in the context of family business, the authors answer to recent calls that diversification by family firms deserves further investigation in light of its highly controversial nature in terms of socioemotional wealth implications and potential mismatch among multiple objectives.

Extending past research, this paper proposes that the quadratic inverse-U relationship between family ownership and the performance of entrepreneurial firms when moderated by the presence of family management and external blockholding. Specifically, it proposes that both factors exacerbate the decline in performance when the proportion of family ownership in entrepreneurial firms remains high. The proposed hypotheses are tested on ten years of panel data from a sample of European firms. Analysis of data supports the hypotheses. Implications for the theory and practice of entrepreneurial firms are discussed. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

We document strong evidence that CEO incentive compensation can predict the significance of stock price momentum through discretionary accrual and real activities manipulation. The profit of momentum strategy increases with CEO pay-for-performance incentive, but decreases with CEO risk-taking incentive. It also evaluates the effects of information uncertainty on such relationship. The evidence is more significant for firms with older and longer tenured CEOs and firms with more informed traders. The relationship between the profit of momentum strategy and CEO pay-for-performance incentive is stronger among CEOs without the risk-taking incentive. Our results are robust for different sub-samples based on before and after Reg FD and Sarbanes-Oxley Act, even after controlling for the potential endogeneity. Further, our findings are consistent with the information diffusion explanation of momentum and the agency theory that incentivised CEOs tend to manipulate information by smoothing good news, concealing mildly bad news and accelerating the disclosure of extremely bad news.

For this, the payment and the determinants of compensation of approximately 600 executive board members of German DAX, MDAX, and SDAX companies in the years 2016-2019 were analysed. The differences in remuneration are theoretically founded at the company level by agency theory and at the individual level by human capital theory. The empirical results show that women receive lower compensation than men on average throughout the period under review. However, these differences in pay are especially attributable to the fact that women serve on average for a shorter period on the executive board and rarely hold the CEO position. There is also evidence that executive compensation depends directly on individual attributes (length of service on and position in the board) and company-specific characteristics (firm size and performance) that differ systematically between men and women, but gender determines compensation only indirectly through these factors. The study also confirms that women are still underrepresented on executive boards. With these results, this paper contributes to corporate governance research in the context of the dualistic board system and encourages the discussion about women in leadership positions.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the role of project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in international development (ID) project stakeholders' relationships. This study draws on agency theory to examine the specific role M&E plays in improving ID project impact. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative data comprising of in-depth interviews were collected from ID project stakeholders such as project donors, implementing partners and steering committee members. Findings: Results of the study show that project M&E activities can serve multiple purposes including the collection of data for the assessment of inputs, outputs, outcomes and impact. This information is shared with stakeholders to assist in evidence-based decision-making to improve project impact on community. This study shows that M&E activities strengthen the relationship between stakeholders by involving multiple stakeholders at different stages of ID projects to identify community needs and to demonstrate the positive community impact. Agency issues such as goal incongruence, information asymmetry and risk-sharing affect the relationship between the stakeholders. Investing in different M&E activities can reduce these issues, ultimately leading to a positive impact at the community level. Originality/value: There has been limited research that explores the principal-agent relationship between project stakeholders of ID projects through the lens of agency theory. The role of M&E to collect project data and address agency issues between project stakeholders to improve project impact is the novel contribution of this paper. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study aims to determine the moderating role of trust on the influence of export incentives over importer role performance. The mediating role of importer role performance and the impact of export incentives on exporter performance have also been investigated. Design/methodology/approach: This study used survey as the main data collection method to obtain data from 105 executives of exporting firms. An official database of export firms was provided to this study by the Department of Export Promotion, Ministry of Commerce of Thailand. Findings: Significant partial moderation effect of trust on the impact of export incentives over importer role performance has been seen. Also, this study found a partial mediating role of the importer role performance in mediating the association of export incentives and exporter performance. In addition, export incentives in the form of credible channel policies and price and financial incentives have been found to have a significant positive effect on importer role performance. Practical implications: This study will be of practical value for practitioners or managers of export firms because it is essential to enhance trust with importers and select the appropriate export incentives for importers. This could enhance competitiveness of the export firms. Originality/value: This is an original attempt to investigate the role of trust as moderator in influencing the impact of export incentives on importer role performance. Also, this study initially ascertains the mediating effect of importer role performance in mediating the effectiveness of both monetary and non-monetary incentives on exporter performance.

<Abstract> This study examines the effect of the interaction between controlling shareholder ownership and product market competition on investment inefficiency in Korea. Consistent with classical agency theory, this study finds that the lower the controlling shareholder owner-ship, the greater the overinvestment. However, this relationship strengthens in non-competitive markets but disappears in competitive markets. This suggests that product market competition has a disciplinary effect on the incentive of controlling shareholders to pursue private benefits. This study has implications for the disciplinary effect of competition and expands the literature on agency theory in emerging countries with concentrated ownership structures.

Purpose: Good earnings quality (EQ) provides reasonable assurance as to the reliability of future cash-flow generation capability of the borrowing firms and thereby mitigates the credit risk of the banks. Against the backdrop of the stressed-assets problem in public-sector banks in India, adversely impacting the public finance system, this paper aims to explore the role of EQ of the borrowers in obtaining bank credit and the ways to mitigate the problem. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of listed 3,486 non-financial and non-government firms, the authors apply Jones (1991) model to estimate their EQ. Then, the authors conduct Hausman's (1970) test and find the existence of a two-way relation between bank finance and EQ. The authors adopt a two-stage least-square regression model to test the nature of the association between the two after controlling for firm and industry-level characteristics. Findings: The empirical results suggest that there exists a two-way negative association between EQ and bank finance implying that the Indian firms tend to report abnormal accruals to enhance tangibility for enjoying higher credit limits and easier access to bank finance. Also, the poor EQ is associated with earnings volatility, adversely impacting the credit quality. The findings are consistent. Practical implications: The study highlights the role of EQ in mitigating credit risk and addressing adverse selection problems in granting credit by practicing bankers. Originality/value: The findings of the study enrich the literature on EQ, capital structure, agency theory and public finance in several ways and have significant ethical and policy implications in bank-finance-led economies.

Purpose: This paper aims to combine the agency theory and efficiency wage theory to explore the effects of relative compensation for executive directors with marketing experience on two marketing outcomes (marketing efficiency and market share) and the moderating roles of ownership type (private vs state-owned enterprises) and market concentration in this process. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 2,753 firm-year observations from Chinese listed companies (from 2010 to 2014) were retrieved from China Stock Market and Accounting Research database and analyzed using firm random-effects with industry, year and region fixed effects. Findings: Relative compensation has a positive effect on both marketing efficiency and market share, and these effects are moderated by ownership type and market concentration. Specifically, the positive effect of relative compensation on marketing efficiency and market share are stronger for central state-owned enterprises (SOEs) compared to local SOEs and private-owned enterprises but the results are mixed for market concentration. Research limitations/implications: This study shows that paying higher compensation to the executive directors with marketing experience can enhance marketing performance, but the data does not allow identification of the actual actions taken by these directors for this. Practical implications: This study highlights the importance of appropriate compensation for directors with marketing experience to motivate them to make better marketing decisions to overcome the challenges posed by market concentration and agency conflicts. Originality/value: This paper points out the importance of having directors with marketing experience and paying them suitable compensation to motivate them to be more effective.

Based on agency and asymmetric information theories, the objective of this paper is to investigate whether the transparency on corporate governance is determined by strategies followed by the board of directors (liquidity, investment, capital structure, innovation and board composition impact on the corporate governance transparency). The study sample is composed by 826 observations from Latin American firms during the period 2004-2010 (128 unique firms). A two-way cluster standard errors and GMM methods have been adopted to perform the econometric analysis. Results suggest that corporate governance disclosure is attributable to changes on firm's decisions made by the board with respect to financial aspects and innovation. However, the impact upon transparency of board composition with regards to female directors, independence and size of boards are attributable to industry and/or country effects. Although the main limitation of the study is focused on the period of analysis, the results provide important implications for the business sector, demonstrating that the board composition and the financial and innovation strategies adopted by the board encourage greater corporate transparency, thus increasing confidence in the markets.

Purpose: This article examines the influence of market opportunity, risk, and distance on the choice of destination country for Mexican franchises. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are developed under the theoretical approaches of institutional theory, agency theory, and transaction costs theory and were contrasted on the data obtained from 52 Mexican international franchisors operating in 37 countries as of 2016. This study uses linear regression with ordinary minimums using the STATA 13.1 software. Findings: The results reveal that a larger market size, a greater level of economic freedom, and a smaller geographic distance are determining factors in the choice of destination country. No statistical significance was found in the variables GDP per capita, level of democracy and cultural distance. Originality/value: This research contributes to the theoretical and practical field. On the theoretical side, this study integrates institutional theory, agency theory, and transaction cost theory to evaluate the factors of the destination country that influence the internationalization process of the franchise. Another contribution of this study is to apply theories and models of developed economies to the process of internationalization of franchises in an emerging economy. Additionally, this study is based on a model that considers the distance, opportunities and risks that are considered by Mexican franchisors in the selection of the international markets in which they maintain operations. This study contains important practical implications that can serve as relevant information for decision-making in the franchise sector and its internationalization. This data is valuable for new models of Mexican franchises that decide to start their internationalization process. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The study investigates the effects of financial accounting services on SMEs' financial performance. The agency theory was used in the research. The study used a quantitative strategy and a survey method to acquire the essential data for the project. The study used a sample of 320 SMEs to carry out the analysis. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used to undertake the statistical analysis. The results indicate that using financial accounting services helps SMEs improve their financial performance. The research also discovered a link between information technology and SMEs' financial performance. The findings of our research reveal that, small businesses that employ accounting services in their business experience an increase in financial performance. This is because the use of financial accounting has a lot of technical advantages which can be helpful to business users. A lot of SMEs need credit to be able to improve their business, therefore they need a financial statement to serve as evidence of their performance before the loan could be granted to them. This means that financial accounting service is a key component in the scheme of this SME. Information technology has been one of the driving forces of every business. It was found that information technology has a positive effect on the financial performance of SMEs. The study is unique in that it gives a successful approach for small and medium-sized businesses in emerging nations to focus more on the function of financial accounting in improving business performance.

Investors increasingly use ESG information for their investment decisions. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether investors practise disciplinary trading using the ESG scores provided by rating agencies to influence firms' cash holdings. Employing a larger sample of US listed firms, we find that stock liquidity acts as a channel between ESG scores and cash holdings. ESG scores carry vital information on the effectiveness of firms' governance and agency problems. Hence, investors respond to ESG information through stock trading that send signals to management, resulting in changes in firms' cash holdings. Consequently, investors use stock trading as a mechanism to create the necessary push for insiders to resolve agency problems. (c) 2023

Recruitment is one of the most important human resource functions for organizational success and survival. While organizations increasingly use headhunters to recruit employees, little research has focused on client-headhunter relations. This paper draws on agency theory and interviews with 130 contingency-based headhunters and corporate clients to examine clients' opportunistic behaviors and how headhunters sought to mitigate these opportunistic behaviors. Our analysis shows that clients used several headhunters in search assignments, negotiated and refused to pay placement fees, contacted candidates directly, changed search criteria and terminated search assignments, and used headhunters to poach employees from their competitors. Our analysis also shows that headhunters used various social interaction and contract-based approaches to mitigate these behaviors, which affected recruitment-related outcomes. This paper contributes to the literature by providing the first agency theory-based study on clients' opportunist behaviors, bringing principals into agency theory-based research, and showing that clients' opportunism affects recruitment-related outcomes.

Given that marriage transforms people, with wide-ranging and long-lasting impacts, we examine the role of CEOs' marital status on firms' cash holdings behaviour. Using a large sample of US-listed firms, we find that single CEOs stockpile more cash than their married counterparts do. Our finding is robust to controlling for various CEO characteristics, CFO influence, tackling endogeneity concerns and using alternative measures of cash. Moreover, we show that exogenous CEO turnover resulting in appointments of single (married) CEOs increases (decreases) cash holdings. Additional results show that single-CEO firms practise a more conservative payout policy and save more cash from operating and financing cash flows. Consistent with agency theory, single CEOs extract more compensation from the accumulated cash, leading to a lower value of cash holdings. External corporate governance mechanisms mitigate the relationship between single CEOs and cash holdings. Our results show that single-CEO firms are more prone to agency problems.

This article highlights the crucial areas and recent dynamics of the takeover field in family firms and recommends avenues for further research. Employing a bibliometric examination, this study analyzes a sample of 63 studies from the Scopus database on acquisition involving family firms between 1997 and early 2021. The study also performed a systematic literature review of the most significant articles as revealed by the computation. We obtain the prominent authors based on citation analysis. We also find current themes and suggest future research avenues. Despite the worldwide prevalence of family firms, there is less study on the takeover of family firms. The results also show that most of the articles are based on the few most studied theories, such as agency theory, resource-based view and stewardship and stagnation perspective, and so on. The scant studies on the takeover of family firms center around acquisition decisions, determinants of acquisition, and acquisition outcomes, with relatively less attention on measuring non-economic goals, board structure, and generation of family members. Finally, the results indicate that very few studies have focused on cross-industry and cross-country to examine the effect of family ownership on takeover events. (c) 2023 K. J.

This study examines the relationship between the earning management and audit quality on sustainable investment opportunities in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, including, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates. Further, moderating relationship of audit quality between earnings management and sustainable investment is also investigated in the present study. This study includes the data of 1337 companies and their-year observations from the period of 2011 to 2017. This study used the Panel Data Ordinary Least Squares with correlated random effect to examine the direct relationship and the moderated multiple regression to examine the moderating effects of audit quality on the earnings management and sustainable investment opportunities relationship. The results demonstrate that the earnings' management encompasses a significant negative relationship with sustainable investment opportunities but on the other side, it also displays a positive relationship between audit quality and sustainable investment opportunities. Furthermore, the study investigates the moderating effect of audit quality on the relationship of earning management and sustainable in-vestment opportunities. Empirical evidence suggests that the audit quality plays a vital role in mitigating the agency theory problem and reducing the information asymmetry. These findings suggest that the big audit firms act as a good governance representatives for the management and it further enhances the credibility of accounting information for the new investors. This research has several usages for policymakers and investors in the GCC. The investors should assess their choice when they are investing in firms. The big auditing firms mitigates earnings management, which may raise sustainable investment opportunities. Thus, listed firms in the GCC should implement governance and disclosure practices that strengthen the credibility of financial earnings and reduce the danger for investors who later discovers poor investment decisions.

Responding to the calls in both earnings management and sustainability literature to examine corporate governance patterns, this study fills the sustainability literature gap by shedding light on the moderating role of corporate governance on earnings management and environmental, social and governance performance. Using a sample of UK firms listed on the London Stock Exchange for the period 2016-2020, we find considerable evidence that earnings management reduces environmental, social and governance performance. Importantly, we find that board gender diversity among other corporate governance mechanisms is stronger and more effective in attenuating the negative effects of earnings management on environmental, social and governance performance significantly. We find support for the agency theory that corporate governance mechanisms reduce the managerial exploitation of resources required for sustainable investments and sustainability performance.

Despite the nonprofit sector's significance in economic contribution, workforce, and social impact, it faces unique innovation hurdles and is not well positioned for sustainability, growth, and prosperity. However, with only a partial, disconnected view from the extant research, we do not understand the relationship between boards and nonprofit innovation for growth. To address this problem, we conducted a systematic literature review drawing on 27 studies published since 2000 to provide a first-in-field and comprehensive integration of disparate, mono-factorial research. We conceptualize a new, multifactorial model that depicts a blend of board composition, relations and practice factors, and organizational and environmental characteristics that influence nonprofit innovation for growth.

This study reviews contemporary corporate governance (CG) in China. This is crucial because of the lack of awareness in the foreign investor community concerning the transparency and reliability of the second-largest economy's governance policy. The review offered in this study not only contributes to the expanding literature in relation to the Chinese CG model, but also further deepens the understanding of the governance issues concerning businesses operating in China among foreign institutional investors and foreign corporate practitioners. The significance of promoting the transparency and integrity of Chinese firms and capital markets is ensuring that firm assets are used diligently and effectively to safeguard the interests of investors and other relevant stakeholders. Moreover, this study sheds light on the latest developments in the Chinese capital market, regulatory framework, and CG perspective for managers of multinational firms to evaluate their potential direct investment decisions in China. In addition, this study provides a review of existing literature on whether Chinese CG is converging towards or diverging from the Anglo-American model, which may be helpful for the decision-making process of Chinese policymakers and regulators in relation to the formulation of new codes, regulations, and policies in the future.

Building on qualitative data from 53 interviews with different types of investors and start-ups, we study the financial and non-financial information that different investor types demand to monitor their portfolio start-ups' performance during different lifecycle stages, as well as how entrepreneurs generate and furnish the required information. We specifically show in detail how investors, like venture capitalists, incubators, or business angels, mitigate agency conflicts through the exchange of specific financial and non-financial information, both formally and informally. By directly comparing both investor and investee cases, we provide insight into the monitoring methods common among different investor types and start-ups. While investors consider accounting to be an important part of the relationship, some entrepreneurs do not or set their priorities differently. Our study illustrates that accounting not only plays a crucial role in the management of established businesses, but is equally important in entrepreneurial investment settings, as is financial literacy.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the direct relationship between board gender diversity (BGD) and financial performance and the moderating role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the said relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Using data collected from the Thomson Reuters Eikon ASSET4 database from 42 UK financial institutions listed in the ESG index for the period 2005-2019, this study used multivariate regression analysis on panel data to test the effect of BGD on financial performance and estimate the moderating effect of CSR between them. Moreover, to control the endogeneity problem, the authors conducted an additional analysis by testing the dynamic dimension of the data set through the generalized moment method. Findings: The empirical results show that BGD is positively related to financial performance and that BGD increases firm performance with the moderating effect of CSR. Regarding the endogeneity problem, the existence of continuity between financial institution performances over time is demonstrated. Research limitations/implications: The current paper sheds light on the importance of BGD in improving firm performance and the moderating role of CSR in strengthening the relationship between BGD and firm performance, thereby contributing to the agency theory, the resource dependency theory and the stakeholder theory. Therefore, regulators and policymakers in the UK can use the outcomes of this study to enforce the representation of female directors on boards to enhance the financial performance of financial institutions. Moreover, the findings could be useful for regulatory bodies to encourage financial institutions to practice CSR activities and disclose them in their annual reports. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study investigating the moderating role of CSR on the relationship between BGD and financial performance in the context of the financial sector. It is also the first study documenting that CSR reinforces the relationship between gender-diverse boards and financial institutions' performance. This study fills a research gap as it expands the existing literature that has generally focused on the impact of BGD on financial performance and has not reached similar results.

In recent years, attention to the circular economy (CE) has grown considerably and it is now recognised as a model capable of overtaking the current linear economy of unsustainable production and consumption. Organisations have started to implement circular practices to transition towards this sustainable business model and to disclose CE performance to their stakeholders. In this context, the integrated report serves as a suitable tool to provide a holistic representation of how CE could impact the companies' ability to create value over time. The relevance of this model has prompted various scholars to examine CE disclosure. However, only some studies have investigated this topic in the integrated reporting (IR) context. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no studies have examined how corporate governance mechanisms can affect the amount of CE information disseminated through the integrated reports. By applying the lens of stakeholder-agency theory, this study aims to fill this important gap by analysing the effect of the characteristics of the corporate governance mechanisms on the level of CE disclosure within the integrated reports. The analysis, conducted using a sample of 124 European companies, indicates a positive impact of the board size, board gender diversity and the presence of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee on the level of CE disclosure within the integrated reports.

Purpose: Public listing of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) stimulates unremitting transformations into their corporate governance (CG) practices. These transformations in CG are likely to impact the financial performance (FP). The current study examines how individual corporate CG mechanisms and their mutual interactions (configurational approach) stimulate the FP of listed SMEs. The study selects promoters' ownership (PO), the board (B-INX) and information disclosures (DISC) as individual CG mechanisms. In addition, market competition (COMP) is considered a form of external governance/regulation. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses five years of panel data (2018-2022) of 80 SMEs listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) SME listing platform in India. Panel data fixed effects and cluster robust standard errors estimated. In addition to the impact of individual CG mechanisms, their mutual interactions (configurational approach) are tested using moderated hierarchical regression and confirmed by slope tests. Findings: The results signify the ineffectiveness of individual CG mechanisms when acting in silos. However, their mutual interactions drive the FP. A hierarchy of results is obtained. PO is the dominant form of internal CG, negatively influencing the relevance of B-INX and DISC. B-INX tends to adhere to good governance by positively moderating the impact of DISC on FP. Lastly, COMP acts as external governance that dominates the ownership effects. Findings reveal that the interactions among individual CG mechanisms are essential to the FP of listed SMEs. Such interactions adjust the agency theory dynamics of CG in these firms. Research limitations/implications: The study takes a holistic approach to investigate the agency theory dynamics via the mutual interactions among multiple CG forms. It highlights how the presence of a dominant form of CG can adjust the financial effect of others, thereby adjusting agency theory dynamics. Practical implications: These results hold practical significance for SMEs in multiple ways. SMEs should embrace configurational approach to comprehend their agency dynamics. The configurational approach of CG mechanisms is the way forward for SMEs, which are known to be financially constrained. In other words, the fact that the resiliency of SMEs is very often questioned calls for the configurational approach, where different CG mechanisms coexist to drive FP. Originality/value: The study is by far the first of its kind to investigate the CG of listed SMEs against the backdrop of the configurational approach. The findings will benefit industry practitioners, academics and regulatory bodies to visualize the governance practices through the lenses of configurational approach.

Purpose: The aim of this study is to understand how board structure, size of audit committee (AC), gender diversity and ownership structure influence banks' performance in Pakistan. This study also aims to examine how various dimensions of governance differently affect the different measures of bank performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study used panel estimation techniques to quantify the impact of various elements of corporate governance on bank performance by taking annual data of 19 Pakistani banks for the period 2013-2020. The corporate governance is measured by board size, CEO duality, AC size, ownership structure and gender diversity. To get the robust results, this study measures bank performance by considering different indicators, namely, return on assets, earning per share, technical efficiency (TE) and total factor productivity. The empirical investigation is based on several well-known and well-accepted governance theories such as the agency theory, the stewardship theory, the tokenism/critical mass theory and the information asymmetry theory. Findings: The findings of the study reveal that the size of board and ACs both significantly improve profitability and productivity, whereas they decrease TE. Further, the findings suggest that most of the indicators of gender diversity significantly deteriorate the performance of banks. However, ownership structure significantly improves banks' earnings per share and TE. This study further illustrates that CEO's duality does not have any significant impact on bank performance. This finding holds true for all the performance measures considered for this study. Practical implications: The findings are of great importance to various stakeholders, especially to policymakers to know about the factors influencing different measures of performance. Specifically, based on these findings, they can devise the result-oriented strategies to enhance the financial and real performance of banks. The findings also suggest that both investors and owners should take into consideration the governance indicators while evaluating banks' performance by using accounting, market-based, efficiency and productivity measures. Originality/value: This research adds to the vast body of existing knowledge about the effectiveness of corporate governance by investigating how the different dimensions of corporate governance and gender diversity influence bank performance in a developing country, namely, Pakistan. Further, this study elaborates the domestic rules/regulations, governance theories and governance framework and practices and tries to link the empirical findings with them for better understanding the role of governance in determining the performance of the banking sector of Pakistan.

This study examines the relationship between the political connection and tax avoidance in all Jordanian market companies, the relationship between accounting information quality and tax avoidance, and the moderating effect of accounting information quality between the political connection and tax avoidance relationship. The sample data of the study includes 206 companies, with a total of 2266 observations from the period from 2008 to 2018. The results indicated that the political connection positively correlates with tax avoidance, which is supported (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). The results of this study also indicated a significant negative association between accounting information quality and tax avoidance. Moreover, the moderating effect of accounting information quality on the political connection and tax avoidance relationship indicated a significant negative association with tax avoidance. Thus, the study supported the agency theory that governance mechanisms such as accounting information quality function led to the reduction of agency problems and reduce information asymmetry. The study finding supported Ward et al.'s (2009) argument and suggested that accounting information quality plays a substitute role rather than a complementary role in mitigating the agency problem. The outcomes of this study could assist the policymaker and companies in the importance of accounting information quality in disciplining political involvement in the Jordanian market.

Purpose: As shareholder-elected monitors, independent non-executive directors (INEDs) should ensure that managers do not retain earnings to promote their own interests. The relationship between board independence and dividend distributions was hence investigated for selected companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). The country offers a well-developed corporate governance framework to listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: Data on the considered companies' dividend payout ratios (DPRs), board independence and six control variables were obtained from Bloomberg for the period 2007-2021. The significance of the observed trends in these variables was considered by conducting analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) tests. The hypothesised relationship was assessed using a mixed-model regression. Findings/results: The results are in line with prior research showing that dividends are often omitted or reduced during and after crisis periods, that is, the global financial crisis (2008/2009) and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (2020/2021). A negative but statistically insignificant relationship was reported between DPR and board independence. Practical implications: Although board independence was not significantly related to dividend distributions for the sampled companies, INEDs still perform an important monitoring role. Shareholders are thus encouraged to play a more active role in the election of these directors. Originality/value: This study extends and refines previous research in South Africa and reveals new insights regarding board independence and dividend distributions during three King regimes and distribution-related regulatory changes.

Purpose: From an agency perspective, the authors investigate whether family ownership and control configurations are systematically associated with a firm's choice of auditor and audit fees. Agency theory is an economic theory that purposes the existence of a contract between two parties, principals and agents. Auditor choice and audit fees by family firms provide interesting insights given the unique nature of the agency problems faced by such firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ Big-4 auditors (PWC, KPMG, E&Y and Deloitte) as a proxy for high quality auditor (Big N) for the auditor choice model. For the audit fee model, the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of audit fees (LnAF). The authors use two measures for family firm as explanatory variables: (1) a dummy variable (FAM_Control), which equals one if the firm is classified as a family firm and (2) FAM_Ownership, which is an indicator variable with a value of one if a firm has family members who hold CEO position, occupy board seats, or hold at least 10% of the firm's equity. Data of Chinese listed firms from 2011 to 2021 are used. The authors adopt the Heckman (1979) two-stage model to mitigate the potential endogeneity issue involved in the selection of Big-N auditors. Findings: The findings suggest that compared with non-family firms, Chinese family firms have a less tendency to employ Big-4 auditors due to less severe agency problems between owners and managers. Additionally, Chinese family firms sustain higher audit fees than non-family firms. Similar to the prior literature, however, Chinese family firms audited by Big-4 auditors incur lower audit fees than family firms audited by non-Big-4 auditors in this study. In contrast to young-family firms, old-family firms are less likely to pick top-tier auditors and sustain lower audit fees. Consistent and robust results are found from endogeneity tests and sensitivity analyses. Originality/value: The empirical evidence provides a unique insight, for accounting practitioners, policymakers, family owners and other capital market participants concerning the diverse effects of various family ownership and control features on selecting high-quality auditors and audit fees. This study advances the understanding, showing that a lower demand for audit quality occurs in Chinese family firms as they encounter less severe Type I agency problems. However, the more severe Type II agency problems in Chinese family firms sustain higher audit fees due to higher audit risk and greater audit effort. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper aims to identify the explanatory factors of mandatory disclosure (MD) and voluntary disclosure (VD) levels related to discount rates, based on disclosure theories. The size, leverage, profitability, and audit firms were selected from different theories, namely agency theory, signaling theory, positive accounting theory, including the political cost hypothesis, and the cost of capital theory. Furthermore, the materiality (weight of the items) and the relevance (nature) of the topic were also considered, based on the evidence already obtained in the literature. Research on disclosures related to discount rates has been assessed either as an incidental topic or from a limited-scope analysis, particularly with respect to MDs. This paper assesses this topic as its specific object of analysis for both MD and VD. The use of the discount rate has been assuming growing importance within financial reporting. Therefore, this topic should deserve particular attention from international standard-setting bodies. The understanding of the proper set of items to be disclosed and understanding the factors that explain its disclosure, aligned with the efforts to assure its compliance by legal authorities, may contribute to reducing asymmetries and increasing transparency in entities financial reporting. This study uses the method of archival research and content analysis of consolidated reports and accounts for the year 2020 of listed entities in Euronext Lisboa. Regression models were used, having disclosure indices related to discount rates as dependent variables. This paper finds a positive association between disclosures related to discount rates and the entity s size, as well as the materiality and the relevance, assessed by the weight of the items and the nature of the topic under assessment, respectively. It adds new explanatory factors on the VDs and MDs related to discount rates in a broader perspective of analysis. (c) 2023 Universidade de Sao Paulo. All rights reserved.

Purpose: Government levels may better fulfill the expanding expectations for public service governance, performance management, and accountability with the use of risk management backed by an integrated management accounting and control system. To explain how the risk management committee and risk disclosure affect bank value, this paper draws on agency theory and signaling theory, by using the market to book ratio (MTBR) to measure bank value. Theoretical Framework: This article explains how the characteristics of risk management committees (RMCC) (size, independence, qualifications, meetings, executive membership, expertise, and dual membership) and voluntary risk disclosure influence each other on the value of Jordanian banks from 2014-2021. Design/methodology/approach: The descriptive statistics of risk disclosure practices were calculated by the study sample using data from 18 banks collected between 2014 and 2021. The study variables' observations have an unbalanced distribution as well. 120 observations across all study variables are included in this paper. To calculate the bank value in this study, we use the Market to Book Ratio (MTBR). The regression analysis employed the multiple regression model. Findings: The results indicate that risk management committee qualifications in accounting or finance significantly negatively affect bank value, while other variables have a significant impact on the value of Jordanian banks, such as risk management committee expertise, risk management committee dual membership with the compensation committee, risk management committee independence, and executive membership in the composition of the risk management committee. Originality/value: This paper provides new empirical evidence in financial and accounting literature regarding the effect of the RMCC characteristics on Jordanian banks' value. Also, The main contribution of the paper is the discovery that the influence of an RMCC tends to encourage more disclosure of risk management to minimize risks. (c) 2023 AOS-Estratagia and Inovacao.

Background: Chief executive officer (CEO) payment and company performance are highly controversial, and existing research has focused on this link for decades. The study was conducted in South Africa where corporate governance regulators have introduced measures to improve the relationship between CEO pay and performance. Aim: This research aimed to explore the problem by extending Pepper and Gore's (2015) behavioural agency theory to examine the moderating effect of remuneration governance on the CEO pay - company performance relationship. Setting: The study focused on the Top 100 listed companies in which several regulations concerning CEO pay were introduced, which provided the opportunity to examine such regulations on the alignment of CEO pay and company performance. Method: Panel data from 67 company annual reports were analysed over two decades with 871 datapoints, divided into three periods corresponding with the introduction of regulations. Analyses included corrected panel standard errors and estimated generalised least squared hierarchical multiple regression and moderated multiple regression analyses. Results: Results showed a statistically significant positive relationship between company performance measures and total CEO remuneration (including long-term incentives [LTIs]) for each of the three periods. We found that LTIs tied to performance-vested criteria and CEO minimum shareholding do enhance pay-performance sensitivity. Results further suggest that the behavioural agency theory is incomplete and researchers should consider the role of remuneration governance in moderating CEO overpayment. Conclusion: Remuneration governance should be refined through the inclusion of retrospective CEO remuneration disclosure to increase pay-performance sensitivity. Contribution: This research contributes to knowledge of CEO payment and company performance. (c) 2023. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.

Purpose: Firm performance has become a thriving research field. However, a review of previous studies shows that the answers to several fundamental questions remain vague and require further investigation. Thus, the purpose of this study is twofold. The first is to determine the extent of the involvement of political connections (PCs) in Pakistani-listed companies, and the second is to examine the association between PCs and firm financial performance with director efficacy's moderating role. Design/methodology/approach: A data set of 221 non-financial companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for 10 years (2008-2017) was analysed using panel-corrected standard error regression. Additionally, the authors address endogeneity issue by using Hackman two-stage estimation and lagged variables regression. Findings: The study found that PCs negatively affected the firm's financial performance, and director efficacy as a moderator strengthened this relationship. The result is consistent with the political economy theory that argues that an unstable political system and a weak judicial system will strongly affect investors and their rights. Practical implications: The impact of political influence on the corporate sector remains a concern for policymakers, regulators, investors, financial experts, auditors and academic researchers. This study's findings are that an effective board of directors can strengthen the company's best practices by controlling political connectedness to protect all the interested parties, particularly investors, and restore their confidence. Therefore, the results of this study can assist all stakeholders when a PCs exists to make the right decisions. Originality/value: The study extends the literature in terms of theoretical contribution that uses an integrative approach to combine political economy theory, agency theory and resource dependence theory to address the moderating role of director efficacy with an association between PCs and firm financial performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no extant research has investigated the association between PCs and firm financial performance using five aspects of PCs, along with moderator director efficacy.

Purpose: This research aims to examine the moderating role of digital orientation (DO) on the relationship between innovation and internationalization by framing the relationship under an agency, resource-based view (RBV) and organization orientation (OO) theory. Design/methodology/approach: This study focuses on a sample of 392 listed companies in Malaysia from 2011 to 2018 and estimates the model under the double clustered regression, dynamic GMM panel model and one-lagged model to tackle endogeneity and reversal causality. This study also did a logit model as an additional robustness check. Findings: The findings support the RBV perspective: Companies with intensive innovation have high internationalization. However, the findings refute OO theory by revealing the evidence that DO leads to low internationalization. Supplemental analysis suggests that innovation impact on internationalization occurs in assets and sales internationalization (exports). Research limitations/implications: According to the RBV theory, innovation is strategic value creation for the organization to achieve competitiveness. A company can expand its market internationally when the business process is more productive and efficient due to innovation. The innovation process is closely related to DO. Hence, this research explores whether DO may strengthen the effect of innovation on the internationalization process. Originality/value: This study examines the effect of DO on innovation and internationalization implementation by contesting agency theory, RBV theory and OO theory within an emerging country context.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of ownership structure variables on the performance of Saudi listed firms. Design/methodology/approach: The impact of ownership structure variables on firm performance is examined using fixed effects and dynamic panel generalised method of moments regression approaches for 70 listed firms over the period 2016-2021. Ownership structure variables are captured by examining government, institutional, insider, foreign and family ownership, and firm performance is gauged in terms of the accounting-based measures of return on assets and the return on equity and the market-based measures of Tobin's Q and the market-to-book ratio. Findings: The results show that government, institutional, insider and foreign ownership all positively affect both accounting and market-based performance measures, whereas family ownership exerts a negative impact across the models. The findings support resource dependence theory, agency theory and alignment effects arguments. Practical implications: The findings have significant implications for Saudi regulators in their effort to improve domestic capital market efficiency and investor protection, while also highlighting the need for a corporate governance code to safeguard minority shareholders. The results demonstrate that government, institutional, insider and foreign ownership exert an important impact on firm operational and market performance. Originality/value: This study expands the literature by examining how ownership structure variables affect performance in an interesting developing country corporate context.

Research on entrepreneurship in family firms has grown exponentially over the past two decades. Due to the various theoretical perspectives and contexts found here however, this body of research remains fragmented, with a unified understanding of the current state of knowledge and the opportunities for future research in the field continuing to lack. In this study, we address this gap by conducting an updated bibliometric analysis of the research on entrepreneurship in family firms. Here we integrate two different bibliometric methods to provide a more comprehensive picture of the field, unveiling its intellectual foundations and current research discourses and how these two are related. To do this, we first conduct a co-citation analysis clustering the intellectual foundations of the research on entrepreneurship in family firms. Second, a bibliographic coupling of recent publications from 2010 to 2021 provides a transparent structure of current research discourses. Third, analyzing which intellectual foundations are primarily cited in each current research stream unveils the dominant theoretical paradigms in the current state of research. Analyzing 570 published studies, we identified four intellectual foundations of entrepreneurship in family firms: socioemotional wealth (SEW), entrepreneurial orientation, family-embedded resources, and agency theory. The current research can be clustered into seven main discourses: entrepreneurial motivation, gender and success, entrepreneurial orientation, individual and firm-level characteristics, the family embedded network, family firm internationalization, and family heterogeneity. An integrative network diagram provides an overview of the research field's development while also identifying the gaps to be addressed by future research. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

This study estimates the effect of COVID-19 on listed small and medium enterprises' capital structures in Vietnam from 2010 to 2020 by a dynamic panel model with 825 observations. Conducting the generalized method of moments, the findings show that COVID-19 is a significant factor affecting small and medium enterprises' capital structures. The current results are explained based on the signalling theory. Although the findings are consistent with the previous empirical studies indicating the capital structure and exploring its determinants in diverse ways, these studies are interpreted based on agency theory, pecking of order, trade-off theory. Furthermore, our results are robust to a series of endogeneity checks using an alternative method of regression. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the impact of risk committee characteristics on the risk disclosure of banking institutions in an emerging economy, Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: The data are collected through a manual content analysis of 21 banks regulated by the State Bank of Pakistan over the period 2011-2020. The study utilizes the generalized least square (GLS) regression model as the method of analysis. Findings: The study finds that risk committee size is positively associated with risk disclosure, which is in line with agency theory. However, risk committee independence and risk committee gender diversity are negatively associated with risk disclosure. This contradicts the theoretical perspective and is explained by the weak regulatory framework of Pakistan. Research limitations/implications: This study was carried out in a single research setting, which limits the generalizability of its findings to other developed and emerging economies. Practical implications: The results provide valuable insights for regulators by identifying the attributes that require regulatory focus to strengthen risk committees and enhance risk disclosure practices within the banking sector of Pakistan. The findings highlight the effectiveness of the risk committee size, call for fully independent risk committees and encourage greater representation of women in these committees. Originality/value: This study contributes to the corporate governance literature by empirically examining the risk committee characteristics and their impact on the risk disclosure of banks in an emerging economy. Moreover, this study contributes to theory by utilizing upper echelon theory in addition to agency theory as the motivation for the study. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework for further understanding the risks embedded in co-creation services in high-contact service transactions. It delineates behavioral and economic perspectives focusing on agency costs, risk behavior, compensation structure and provides a context in which information is processed. Design/methodology/approach: Following an extensive review of the literature, propositions are advanced that relate an agent's risk behavior to information processing, compensation and the propensity to engage in co-creation. These propositions provide a complementary context for understanding risks in the co-creation process. Findings: The propositions detail how a service agent's information processing can be enhanced if the customer's expected utility from transactions is maximized by managing the agent's risk behavior and earnings potential. A compensation structure that balances fixed base and variable pay can motivate risk-taking and the agent's propensity to engage in co-creation. Originality/value: This paper extends the understanding of agency risks in the co-creation of hospitality services that integrates economic and behavioral perspectives with information processing. Theoretical implications include a broader context of the risks underlying co-creation. Practical implications relate to how earnings potential could be maximized by considering the agent's risk behavior and the expected utility arising from such transactions.

This study utilizes agency theory to examine how Chief Executive Officers' (CEOs) compensation contracts impact marketing strategy decisions within firms. Specifically, we examine whether variations in CEOs' inside-debt to equity ratio (i.e., ratio of pension and deferred compensation to equity holdings) impact the firm's strategic emphasis. Our findings indicate that CEOs with large proportion of inside-debt (i) tend to refrain from value appropriation through reduced advertising investments, and (ii) strategically emphasize firm resources towards the value appropriation process (advertising) as opposed to value creation (R&D).

This research recognizes the increasing importance of the preservation of the natural environment for society as well as for the corporate sector. The study adopts a stakeholder-agency theory perspective to examine the influence of characteristics and effectiveness of the board of directors on the environmental disclosures made by the corporate sector. The method of content analysis was adopted for collecting information on board characteristics, board processes, and environmental disclosures made by the sample companies. The extent of environmental disclosure has been measured by using an Environmental Disclosures Index. It was found that a higher proportion of independent directors, the absence of chairman-CEO duality, and the overall board effectiveness had a significant positive influence on the extent of environmental disclosures. However, board diversity represented by female directors on the boards was found to have a statistically insignificant impact on environmental disclosures.

This study aims to provide a bibliometric review (Zupic & Cater, 2015; Hallinger, 2019) of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base. This paper is guided by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and based on the Scopus index for determining and extracting data. A total of 1,661 articles from 1983 to 2021 are included. The USA, the UK, and Australia are the leaders in the literature. A significant gap exists for further research from developing and non-Western settings. We identified authors with the highest citations (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Kose John), the most prominent authors based on the citation for each document (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Igor Filatotchev), and the most highly cited documents (--Higher market valuation of companies with a small board of directors||, Yermack, 1996; --Disentangling the incentive and entrenchment effects of large shareholdings||, Claessens et al., 2002, and --Boards: Does one size fit all?||, Coles et al., 2008). Besides, the review reveals an intellectual structure of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base in three schools of thought: agency theory, firm value, and boards of directors. Our findings provide an overview of top-influential research for new scholars and enable us to identify highly cited theoretical foundations quickly. (c) 2023 The Authors.

Guided by a call for research on small entities using innovative methodologies, this study is the first to analyse small municipality audit fees on a per capita basis. The research utilises a complete dataset of all 92 Connecticut municipalities that meet the study criteria and does not rely on samples or survey results. The measure of per capita was utilised to account for differences between town populations allowing for a more accurate comparison of audit fees and audit fee determinants across municipalities of differing populations. Consistent with the premise that auditee characteristics are an important consideration in audit fees, we find that when examining audit fees on a per capita basis in the subset of small municipalities: (1) smaller towns pay considerably more for audit services than larger towns, (2) towns with an ethics committee oversight function and best practices financial reporting practices have lower per capita audit fees than those that do not and (3) audit firm size, audit firm tenure and existence of audit/finance committee oversight have no significant impact on per capita audit fees. The results of this study help fill a void in the audit literature by providing insights into audit fee determinants in small municipalities by considering the added feature of a per capita analysis. The authors also sought to provide additional information for consideration in the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) efforts to streamline standards for auditing of less complex entities.

This paper examines the relationship between board capital attributes and corporate social responsibility disclosure (CSRD) quality and how CEO power moderates the association between board capital attributes and CSRD quality. Using a cross-sectional sample of 114 firms, we find that directors' experience and directors' interlocking have positive impacts on CSRD quality while directors' political ties have a significant negative impact on CSRD quality in Saudi firms. Contrary to our hypotheses, we find no support for the impacts of directors' education, directors' expertise, and board nationality on CSRD quality. Moreover, we find partial support for the moderation effects of CEO power. Overall, we theoretically highlight the roles of resource dependence theory and agency theory in enhancing CSRD quality.

We analyze the impact of Small Blockholders' (SBH-with 5% to 10% of voting rights) heterogeneity and their access to private information on the demand for audit services. By promoting enhanced audit services, we expect SBH to have a moderating effect on the relation between Large Blockholders (LBH-more than 10% of voting rights) and audit fees in a context of low shareholder protection. Drawn on Swiss public firm data over the 2002-2019 period, our results show that the presence of SBH flattens the concave relation between ownership concentration and audit fees found in prior studies. This moderating effect is mainly driven by the uninformed SBH, who given their lower-compared with informed SBH-access to private channels of information, are more likely to rely on audited public financial statements. Our findings contribute to the literature on the role of SBH in the company's corporate governance. (c) 2022 European Accounting Association.
