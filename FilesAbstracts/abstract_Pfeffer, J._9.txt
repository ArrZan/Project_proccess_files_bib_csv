This research examines the relationship between ownership structure and financial performance in the context of the agency theory. It improves upon previous research by presenting an improved risk-adjusted performance measure, by using a larger sample size than prior work and also by controlling for firm size differences. The results suggest that ownership is significantly related to firm financial performance even after controlling for size. Copyright (c) 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Taking agency theory and stakeholder theory as points of departure, this article proposes a paradigm that helps explain the following: (1) certain aspects of a firm's strategic behaviour; (2) the structure of management-stakeholder contracts; (3) the form taken by the institutional structures that monitor and enforce contracts between managers and other stakeholders; and (4) the evolutionary process that shapes both management-stakeholder contracts and the institutional structures that police those contracts.

Vertical integration is a fundamental corporate strategy of interest to the fields of strategic management and organizational economics. This paper synthesizes theoretical arguments and empirical findings from this literature to identify the underlying advantages and disadvantages of choosing vertical financial ownership relative to vertical contracts. It then suggests that in the absence of agency and transaction costs, vertical financial ownership and vertical contracting are equivalent governance structures for achieving corporate objectives. However, given a world of positive agency and transaction costs, the key theoretic question then becomes predicting when market mechanisms are sufficient, when intermediate forms of vertical contracting become necessary, and when vertical financial ownership becomes the preferred governance structure. The concluding section of the paper provides a framework for making this analysis based on a synthesis of agency and transaction costs perspectives. Copyright (c) 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Using agency theory, this study empirically examined the relationship between board composition and corporate philanthropy. Generally, the ratio of insiders to outsiders, the percentage of insider stock ownership, and the proportion of female and minority board members were found to be positively and significantly associated with firms' charitable contributions.

Board of director involvement in restructuring reveals whether restructuring is brought on as an action by the board in its central oversight role or whether managers are purusing positive strategic action or correction. Therefore, based on an integration of organization economics (agency theory and market for corporate control) and strategic management theory (internal control and strategic leadership contingencies), this research examines board involvement in restructuring. Board involvement is hypothesized to be contingent on the governance mechanisms used by the board to monitor top management, control emphasis used by managers to process strategic information and board and managerial characteristics. The basic premise of the paper is that, due to their oversight role, board members (especially outside directors) become involved in restructuring only when managerial strategy implementation appears to be deficient. Top management team equity stakes are found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring, while outside director ownership is found to be positively related. Emphasis on strategic controls by managers was found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring. Top management team tenure and top management organizational tenure are negatively related to board involvement. Outsider representation on the board is positively related to board involvement in restructuring, while board tenure was found to be unrelated. Results imply that incentives to monitor (ownership) and emphasis on strategic controls reinforced by higher top management team tenure result in less board involvement in restructuring. However, restructuring may be initiated by outsiders on the board when other governance and control mechanisms fail. This implies a substitution process between governance tactics (ownership vs. board monitoring) and internal controls (managerial vigilance). Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study seeks to estimate the relative importance of free cash flow, corporate governance, and takeover threat in determining financial and portfolio restructuring. The free cash flow hypothesis and agency theory prescriptions are used as the basis for developing a model of restructuring. A simple analysis of variance method is used to decompose restructuring transactions and outcomes into the three effects. The results support the hypothesis that financial and portfolio restructuring are motivated, in part, by agency costs. Decomposition of variances indicates that restructuring is equally explained by free cash flow and interaction of governance and takeover threat with free cash flow.

This article examines executive compensation in the United States, France, and the Netherlands. A brief review of executive compensation literature is conducted to expose its implicit value systems. Next, a qualitative study examines the interpretive schemas that executives express about the pay-performance relationship; US-developed expectancy theory and agency theory serve as a benchmark. the results indicate that US executives understand compensation in different terms from those employed by their European counterparts.

This paper tests competing theoretical explanations for the passage of corporate charter antitakeover amendments. The managerial entrenchment hypothesis suggests that antitakeover amendments are adopted by incumbent management to obtain job security at stockholders' expense. An alternative hypothesis is that antitakeover amendments are proposed in order to enable the management of the target firm to extract a higher price from the bidding firm and thereby benefit stockholders. Our event study from a sample of 409 firms that adopted antitakeover amendments in the 1974-88 period indicates a strongly negative effect on stockholder wealth, in support of the managerial entrenchment hypothesis that antitakeover amendments are adopted by managers at the expense of stockholders.

This paper proposes a contract model of employment relations that integrates insights from economic and sociological perspectives on labor market transactions. The utility of the contract model is illustrated empirically using a large data set on organizations and their employees in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing industries. The results are consistent with many transaction cost and agency theory predictions, though they also indicate the need to supplement these economic theories with sociological explanations based on political, cultural, and other institutional differences.

Recent research and public discourse on executive compensation and corporate governance suggests a growing consensus that firms can and should increase their control over top managers by increasing the use of managerial incentives and monitoring by boards of directors. This study departs from this consensus by offering an alternative perspective that considers not only the benefits, but also the costs of both incentives and monitoring in large corporations. The study develops and tests a contingency cost/benefit perspective on governance decisions as resource allocation decisions, proposing how and why the observed levels of managerial incentives and monitoring may vary across organizations and across time. Specifically, the study suggests that: (1) firms that are more risky face greater costs when using incentive compensation contracts for top managers, thus reducing the expected level of incentive compensation use for such firms; (2) firms facing this problem of low incentive compensation use can realize greater benefits from higher levels of board monitoring, and thus are likely to rely more on board monitoring; and (3) firms with more complex comporate strategies face higher costs in using board monitoring, and are thus likely to rely less on board monitoring as a source of controlling top management behavior. The study also proposes that within this contingency perspective there may be diminishing 'behavioral returns' to increases in monitoring and incentives. These hypotheses are tested using extensive longitudinal data from over 400 of the largest U.S. corporations. The supportive findings suggest that maximal levels of incentives and monitoring are not necessarily optimal, and that a firm's strategy may not only have significant product/market implications, but also corporate governance implications.

This paper evaluates agency theory as a theory of performance outcome. Agency theory attributes uncertainty in performance outcomes to moral hazard, adverse selection and the state of nature. This paper argues that by overlooking two critical sources of outcome uncertainty in organizations -- incomplete knowledge about the effort-outcome relationship and lack of agreement about effort and outcome -- the generalizability of the theory is strictly limited. Even in such settings where it is generalizable, principal-agent approaches to contract design are unrealistic to the extent that they presume that performance in organizations results exclusively from individual-contributor jobs, exagger ate the degree to which individuals are work-averse, and emphasize the quant ity of effort at the expense of the quality and type of effort. As a theory of performance, principal-agent approaches overstate the importance of opera tional effort and ignore the importance of facilitative effort such as team work. (c) 1994, Sage Publications.

Most studies of corporate social responsiveness (CSR) focus on the relationship between CSR and profit. Here, we use three perspectives (institutional theory, economic theory and agency theory) to explain CSR. Industry norms, market share and indicators of management reputation predict variance in CSR. The combined perspectives improve understanding of both CSR and the CSR-profit relationship in two ways. First, they suggest that CSR levels and their relationship with profit will vary by industry. Second, they suggest that stock market measures and accounting measures will respond differently to CSR measures. Stock market measures lead, while accounting measures lag, CSR.

Capital structure theories grounded in the finance paradigm (agency theory, transaction cost theory) have contributed to our understanding of capital structure decision making. However, they do not address the intricacies of capital structure decision making from a managerial choice perspective, especially in privately held firms. This article brings together research from strategic management, decision sciences, and social psychology to develop a conceptual model for understanding capital structure decision making in privately held firms. In general, it is posited that capital structure decisions are influenced by the firm owner's attitude toward debt as moderated by external environmental conditions. Attitude toward debt is a function of one's belief about debt as influenced by the individual's need for control, risk propensity, experience, social norms, and personal net worth. The integration of theoretical perspectives yields eight propositions for understanding the determinants of privately held firm capital structure. (c) 1994, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

This paper argues that attempts to build a theory of performance in organizations have largely been confined to individual disciplines of psychology, sociology, economics and organization theory. The paper highlights the inadequacies of the agency model of performance from organizational economics. The paper suggests that an integrated model of performance can be built by combining ideas from agency theory in economics and organization theory. The paper presents the first step towards such a model. It is shown that organizational activities can be classified as 'operational' or 'facilitative' based on the notion of interdependence. Implications of this model are discussed. (c) IOS B.V.

Several studies have addressed the CEO duality-performance relationship, with inconsistent results. This paper proposes that these inconsistencies can be resolved by integrating agency and stewardship perspectives on duality. Using data from 192 firms in 12 industries, both the direction and magnitude of the duality-performance relationship was found to vary systematically across Dess and Beard's (1984) environmental dimensions. These results provide partial support for both agency and stewardship perspectives. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We examine how ownership configuration affects the determination of CEO pay raises. Based on a sample of 188 firms over a 5-year period, it was found that pay raises were based on distinctly different factors, depending on the ownership profile of the firm. In management-controlled firms--where no single major owner exists--results suggest an overarching pay philosophy: maximize CEO pay, subject to demonstration of face legitimacy of that pay. In externally-controlled firms--where a major (nonmanager) owner exists--results suggest a very different philosophy: minimize CEO pay, subject to the ability to attract/retain a satisfactory CEO.

Critics have argued that the field of information systems (IS) lacks a coherent theoretical framework. This paper attempts to further the theoretical development of a critical and pervasive contemporary phenomenon, outsourcing of IS functions, by synthesizing four theoretical models (resource-based theory, resource-dependence theory, transaction cost theory and agency theory) that are useful for understanding determinants of a firm's outsourcing strategy. From these theoretical models, a contingency model of outsourcing is developed which can be used to direct empirical research. (c) 1995, Palgrave Publishing. All Rights Reserved.

This paper examines the influence of competitive strategy on the relationship between suppliers and their distribution networks. Drawing on agency theory, hypotheses are developed specifying the appropriate match between manufacturer strategies and systems of control within distribution channels. Cluster analysis is used to show distinct differences in channel management and structure for the three generic strategies of cost leadership, differentiation and focus. Results suggest that variation in control relationships may be explained by the demands posed by manufacturers' competitive strategies. This study therefore extends the applicability of Porter's typology to the specific structure of distribution channels and shows that agency theory can provide insights into the economic basis of interorganizational relationships.

The study of capital structure has increasingly gained importance in strategic management research. Paradigms derived from organizational economics have also gained popularity in explaining firm actions. Agency theory and transaction cost economics represent two such paradigms that rely on the notion of market imperfections. Notwithstanding the similarities between them, these two offer different explanations of the role of debt and equity in a firm. The governance abilities of the financing structures and the nature of assets of the firm provide two key sources of differences. Viewing capital structure from transaction cost economics gives rise to predictions that are contradictory to those presented by agency theory. It is argued that the extant evidence mainly supports the transaction cost viewpoint. Two organizational phenomena - leveraged buyouts and product diversification - are used to highlight the comparison.

Variability in employment levels, particularly when resulting from downsizing and layoffs, has considerable consequences for employees and organizations. Applying strategic compensation and agency theory principles to multiple years of employment, financial performance, and managerial compensation data on 152 organizations, we found that compensation design was related to employment variability through two avenues. First, organizations relying more heavily on long-term compensation incentives for managers exhibited less employment variability. Second, when groups of employees were covered by variable pay plans, their employment variability was lower.

Executive compensation has recently become the subject of extensive scrutiny by the popular press. However, compensation for corporate directors is one area which has only received little attention or research. The present study combined resource dependence and agency theories with previous research on executive salaries to develop an explanatory model of director compensation. Data were collected from US firms at two points in time to assess the stability of these predictors. Four variables were found to have a significant relationship with director compensation: firm size, firm profitability, equity ownership by directors, and resource richness of the board. However, the explanatory power of these variables appear to decline over time. Practical implications of these results are discussed.

This paper examines the factors influencing the relative weights placed on financial and non-financial performance measures in CEO bonus contracts. We find that the use of non-financial measures increases with the level of regulation, the extent to which the firm follows an innovation-oriented strategy, the adoption of strategic quality initiatives, and the noise in financial measures. We find no evidence that the choice of performance measures in bonus contracts is associated with the level of financial distress or the value of CEO equity holdings relative to salary and bonus. Our results also provide no support for the hypothesis that CEOs with greater influence over the board of directors are more likely to be compensated based on non-financial measures.

In this article I examine those business exchanges in which firms hire professional service organizations and give them limited decisionmaking authority to perform knowledge-intensive tasks. I frame such exchanges within agency theory perspective and invoke the extant literature on professions to delineate several attributes that make principal-professional exchanges intrinsically distinct from others, such as owner-manager agency. In doing so, I question and complement some key assumptions in agency theory and also discuss explicitly how the study of principal-professional exchanges helps highlight important considerations not addressed in the mainstream theory. I then present an expanded framework that integrates agency theory and the literature on the professions and present several propositions to outline four types of restraints on potential opportunistic behavior of professional agents: (1) self-control, (2) community control, (3) bureaucratic control, and (4) client control. The article ends with theoretical and empirical implications.

In recent years, agency theory has substantially influenced research on corporate governance. Organizational sociologists have critiqued the agency theory model of boards as limited and have studied how the functioning of boards is shaped by structural, political, and cognitive contexts. Building on their work, this paper empirically studies the cultural embeddedness of boards in a nonprofit organization called Medlay. It shows how organizational identity - the members' shared beliefs about the central, enduring, and distinctive characteristics of the organization - influences the construction and enactment of the director's role and shapes interactions among board members and managers. The findings demonstrate that the role of the director is shaped by Medlay's Janus-faced identity, as both a volunteer-driven organization and a family of friends; directors see themselves as vigilant monitors and as friendly, supportive colleagues. The findings also portray how some board members' scrutiny of the budget, including "lavish" travel expenditures, surfaces the contradictions in Medlay's identity, and creates conflicts for directors. Should board members take managers to task and thereby exercise vigilance and uphold the ideal of volunteer control, or should they safeguard the principle of friendship and avoid all conflict? An influential subset of directors and top managers resolved the budget issue and preserved Medlay's identity by using different "face-saving" strategies to make directors feel that they had been vigilant, and to affirm sentiments of cooperation. More generally, this study extends the literature on corporate governance by showing how organizational identity influences the construction and enactment of the director's role. It introduces the idea of "conflicts of commitment," a form of intra-role conflict that arises when directors are besieged by conflicting aspects of the organization's identity. When actions occur that breach the expected role performance of board members, latent contradictions in the organizational identity emerge, and directors are faced with the conflict of upholding one dimension of identity while undermining the other. The study also contributes to research on organizational identity by proposing a model of how organizational and individual identities shape the board role through the processes of identification and action, and how a hybrid identity generates the potential for intra-role conflict.

Previous empirical studies of top managers tend to draw from either positive agency theory or strategic leadership theory. This manuscript reviews and critiques these two approaches, outlining their advantages and inherent limitations. Because each is inherently limited, we suggest that developments in personality theory, transformational leadership theory, and visionary leadership theory can contribute to a more realistic view of top managers. Consequently, we contrast these three alternative perspectives with the two more dominant approaches in this manuscript. As a result, we identify future research directions for scholars interested in studying strategic leadership. (c) 1997 JAI Press Inc. All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

Downsizing and layoffs are an important mechanism for U.S. firms to cope with their strategic and economic environment. In contrast, the Japanese tradition of lifetime employment limits the ability affirms to employ layoffs as a strategic measure, relegating its use to conditions of financial distress. This paper provides the first comparison of layoffs in Japan and the United States and examines stock price reactions to layoff announcements in each country from 1990 to 1994. Agency theory and Aoki's cooperative game theory are employed to discuss differences in the governance structures of U.S. and Japanese firms and their implication for stock price reactions. Results show that layoff announcements trigger negative returns for both U.S. and Japanese firms. Specifically, layoff announcements of U.S. firms are associated with a negative 1.78 percent abnormal return, while layoff announcements for Japanese firms are associated with a negative 0.56 percent abnormal return. To better understand the impact of layoffs, this study examines the relationships between stock price reactions and various layoff characteristics (such as whether the layoff is proactive or reactive or whether the layoff is the first in the industry). Implications of the findings are discussed. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper's empirical results indicate that the average effect of antitakeover provisions on subsequent long-term investment is negative. The interpretation of these results depends on whether one thinks that there was too much, too little, or just the right amount of long-term investment prior to the antitakeover provision adoption. We use agency theory to devise more refined empirical tests of the effects of antitakeover provision adoption by managers in firms with different incentive and monitoring structures. Governance variables (e.g. percentage of outsiders on corporate boards, and separate CEO/chairperson positions) have an insignificant impact on subsequent long-term investment behavior. However, consistent with agency theory predictions, managers in firms with better economic incentives (higher insider ownership) tend to cut subsequent long-term investment less than managers in firms with less incentive alignment. Furthermore, managers in firms with greater external monitoring (due to higher institutional ownership) also tend to cut subsequent long-term investment less than managers in firms with less external monitoring. Thus, the decrease in subsequent long-term investment is significantly less for firms where the managers have greater incentives to act in shareholders' interests. Finally, there are interesting effects of the control variables. First, high book equity/market equity firms cut total long-term investment more. Second, firms that were takeover targets or rumored to be takeover targets cut long-term investment more. These results suggest that inefficient firms cut long-term investment more when an antitakeover provision is adopted. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Firms exporting via foreign channel intermediaries, such as import agents or distributors, trade off a lack of control of the foreign channel for a low-risk market entry. Agency theory and transaction cost analysis suggest that a lack of control manifests itself in the foreign channel intermediary (FCI) having opportunities to behave in its own interests, rather than those of the exporter. Even so, management strategies that result in an alignment of the exporter's and FCI's goals are more likely to result in a perception of satisfaction in the relationship than if only one party's goals were met. Such management strategies should commence with an extensive precontractual screening step to find an intermediary whose goals are complementary to those of the exporter. After forming a trading relationship, an exporter can better coordinate the relationship by noncoercive monitoring of the exporter, and reduce the potential for opportunistic behavior and achieve a relationship that performs to the satisfaction to both parties. Greater monitoring is also likely to maintain a state of goal congruence between the parties. Conditions of environmental uncertainty may, however, create difficulties in precontractual screening by the exporter. A conceptual framework explaining the interaction between these variables has been presented, along with nine testable propositions and directions for future research.

There has been a steady increase in the amount of research and theorising in the area of interorganisational research, especially with regard to buyer-seller arrangements in marketing channels (Andersen and Narus 1990, Bergen et.al., 1992, Boyle et.al., 1992). Alternative interorganisational governance models, such as joint ventures, strategic alliances, and sole-sourcing are the reality of modern business management (Borys and Jemison 1989, Buckley and Casson 1988), and so interfirm governance has become a strategic management issue. The much-cited work of Porter (1985, 1991) has focused on the optimal linkage of interfirm activities, and regards the planning and governance of interfirm relations as an important competitive strategic issue, a point reiterated by Heide (1994). The issue of channel relationships has been one of concern for both practitioners and academics, and theories such as those of transaction cost analysis (TCA), agency theory, and relational norms have on the one hand shed much light on the problems, and on the other provided a fruitful backdrop to much empirical research. Less attention has been given to the effects of time on these notions, both in the literature and in empirical research. In this article we provide an overview of the theories, and attempt an integration. The purpose of this article is to focus on transaction cost economics (TCE) and relational exchange theory to provide an overview of the areas of interorganisational research where relationships play a role. A number of areas where the theories diverge and converge are outlined. More importantly, we endeavour to bring the effects of time into consideration, and to develop propositions for further research. (c) 1997, MCB UP Limited

Firms' boundary choices have undergone careful examination in recent years, particularly in information services. While transaction cost economics provides a widely tested explanation for boundary choice, more recent theoretical work advances competing knowledge-based and measurement cost explanations. Similar to transaction cost economics, these theories examine the impact of exchange attributes on the performance of markets and hierarchies as institutions of governance. These theories, however, offer alternative attributes to those suggested by transaction cost economics or offer alternative mechanisms through which similar attributes influence make-buy choices. Traditional empirical specifications of make-buy models are unable to comparatively test among these alternative theories. By developing and testing a model of comparative institutional performance rather than institutional choice, we examine the degree of support for these competing explanations of boundary choice. Hypotheses are tested using data on the governance of nine information services at 152 companies. Our results suggest that a theory of the firm and a theory of boundary choice is likely to be complex, requiring integration of transaction cost, knowledge-based, and measurement reasoning.

This paper examines variations in executive pay as a function of CEO power. We assume that CEOs optimize their pay conditional upon their ability to shape decisions that favour their interests. Power is inferred from overt manifestations such as share holdings, but also from covert sources such as a CEOs' social capital. Two components of compensation are considered: base pay and bonus. While financial performance, firm size, and other factors are held constant, the results show overt power as measured by CEO, and CEO-family equity holdings, to have a curvilinear relationship with executive compensation. Proxies of covert power include tenure, being (one of) the founder(s), and firm diversification. These variables magnify or moderate the effect of equity holdings on compensation. The power effects are most pronounced for the size of CEO bonus.

Agency theorists argue that organizations typically get little value from using employees and that they should instead use nonemployees operating fully as residual claimants. Yet, even in a context where those theorists would predict virtually no employees - taxicab organizations - they are common. What drives the use of employment relationships in these organizations? The authors show how employment relationships are linked to firm capabilities and strategic opportunities in a sample of taxicab organizations, relying on arguments about the linkage of employment to the internal liquidity of labor, organizational routines, and internal cooperation. The theoretical arguments and findings suggest what organizations gain by having employment relationships and show that integrating the agency theoretic argument with the other theoretical arguments leads toward a resource-based view of strategy and human resources. The authors highlight the importance of embedding arguments on the internal management of human resources in the strategic and competitive context in which organizations operate. Their arguments also have implications for the resource-based approach to strategy in mapping the resource space of human assets in organizations and, within that space, directing attention to how organizations gain sustainable competitive advantage through managing human resources.

The development of the field of strategic management within the last two decades has been dramatic. While its roots have been in a more applied area, often referred to as business policy, the current field of strategic management is strongly theory based, with substantial empirical research, and is eclectic in nature. This review of the development of the field and its current position examines the field's early development and the primary theoretical and methodological bases through its history. Early developments include Chandler's (1962) Strategy and Structure and Ansoff's (1965) Corporate Strategy. These early works took on a contingency perspective (fit between strategy and structure) and a resource-based framework emphasizing internal strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps, one of the more significant contributions to the development of strategic management came from industrial organization (IO) economics, specifically the work of Michael Porter. The structure-conduct-performance framework and the notion of strategic groups, as well as providing a foundation for research on competitive dynamics, are flourishing currently. The IO paradigm also brought econometric tools to the research on strategic management. Building on the IO economics framework, the organizational economics perspective contributed transaction costs economics and agency theory to strategic management. More recent theoretical contributions focus on the resource-based view of the firm. While it has its roots in Edith Penrose's work in the late 1950s, the resource-based view was largely introduced to the field of strategic management in the 1980s and became a dominant framework in the 1990s. Based on the resource-based view or developing concurrently were research on strategic leadership, strategic decision theory (process research) and knowledge-based view of the firm. The research methodologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated and now frequently combine both quantitative and qualitative approaches and unique and new statistical tools. Finally, this review examines the future directions, both in terms of theory and methodologies, as the study of strategic management evolves. (c) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The Virtual Design Team (VDT) extends and operationalizes Galbraith's (1973) information-processing view of organizations. VDT simulates the micro-level information processing, communication, and coordination behavior of participants in a project organization and predicts several measures of participant and project-level performance. VDT-1 (Cohen 1991) and VDT-2 (Christiansen 1993) modeled project organizations containing actors with perfectly congruent goals engaged in complex but routine engineering design work within static organization structures. VDT-3 extends the VDT-2 work process representation to include measures of activity flexibility, complexity, uncertainty, and interdependence strength. It explicitly models the effects of goal incongruency between agents on their information processing and communication behavior while executing more flexible tasks. These extensions allow VDT to model more flexible organizations executing less routine work processes. VDT thus bridges rigorously between cognitive and social psychological micro-organization theory and sociological and economic macro-organization theory for project teams. VDT-3 has been used to model and simulate the design of two major subsystems of a complex satellite launch vehicle. This case study provides initial evidence that the micro-contingency theory embodied in VDT-3 can be used to predict organizational breakdowns, and to evaluate alternative organizational changes to mitigate identified risks. VDT thus supports true `organizational engineering' for project teams.

An enduring challenge for franchise management involves the reconciliation of (1) the franchisor's desire for standardization, consistency, and control for the preservation of its goodwill and brand equity, and (2) the franchisee's quest for autonomy, especially because franchises are frequently sold on the platform of be your own boss and have historically attracted would-be franchisees with self-employment histories and strong streaks of independence and autonomy. Building on arguments derived from agency theory, resource dependence theory, the locus of control argument, and the countervailing power premise, the present study attempts to evaluate (1) the interrelationships between the concepts of autonomy and dependence, and (2) the influence of competition, success, experience, and multi-unit ownership as determinants of the various autonomy-dependence perceptions. It is suggested that, contrary to the dominant perspective nested in the markets versus hierarchy dichotomy, which portrays the sentiments of dependence and autonomy as opposing theoretical variables (i.e., they are envisioned to exist only in high-low combinations of these two constructs), even their high-high and low-low combinations can emerge within a franchise setting, and that these diverse behavioral settings entail unique management challenges. The empirical portion of the study utilizes data drawn from the franchised channel of fastfood restaurants. The results support the emergence of all four combinations of dependence and autonomy (i.e., the traditional high-low combinations as well as the high-high and low-low combinations), suggestingthat behavioral settings of franchises are indeed richer than hitherto imagined. It appears that because franchisee-franchisor relationships encompass several domains, they each feel dependent on the other party in certain domains, and simultaneously, autonomous in other domains. The environmental factor of competition, the relationship factor of business success experienced in the franchise system, and the structural factor of multi-unit ownership emerged as significant predictors of dependence and autonomy. Notably, however, the countervailing power argument was not supported by the data. The multi-unit ownership effects were especially strong and provided a more direct test of the alignment of goals and incentives envisioned by agency theory. We conclude by identifying four categories of franchisees with distinct gestalts that franchisors would do well to learn to manage in the spirit of portfolio management.

In their response to our paper, Amihud and Lev (1999) and Denis, Denis, and Sarin (1999) claim that disciplinary differences don't matter and that methods and evidence should speak for themselves. In contrast, we argue that important differences exist between financial economics and strategic management, leading to differing beliefs, norms, methods, and interpretations of empirical results. Using a strategic management perspective to review the evidence presented by Amihud and Lev in their earlier study (1981) and in their and Denis et al.'s critiques of our work (1999), we find no reason to revise our original conclusion: there is little theoretical or empirical basis for believing that monitoring by a firm's principals influences its diversification strategy and acquisition decisions.

This article examines creative-risk-taking behavior by agencies and the circumstances that increase their propensity to take risks. Drawing upon agency theory, and the wider literature on risk in management decision making, two areas are investigated. (1) resolving the conflicting desires of agencies and advertisers, and (2) how advertisers control agent's risk-taking. A mail survey of senior creative directors across a cross section of agencies is used and data to test the hypotheses gathered. Analyses indicate that agencies are less risk-seeking than expected. Market response and advertisers have the most influence on agency risk-taking, and agencies take a portfolio approach to risk - being more likely to suggest creative risk-taking for relatively smaller clients. The findings are discussed in terms of developing winning creative ideas. Suggestions for future research are identified.

Incentive design for productivity gains has become important for Asian organizations in recent years. This paper introduces the theory of incentive design to an Asian audience while extending the agency theoretic approach to control. Hypotheses derived from this theory were tested in 61 retail stores in Singapore. The results show that employee skills, output measurability and task uncertainty significantly impact incentive design. The results indicate that agency theory may be applicable across cultures. Implications for the Asian context, and its adaptation in terms of behavior, are discussed. (c) 1999 bY John Wiley & Sons (Asia) Ltd.

The incentive intensity of rewards (the individual marginal gains in pay triggered by increased performance) has been linked to higher effort and the attraction of talent. Determinants of incentive intensity for individual rewards have been widely examined, but determinants of incentive intensity for group rewards remain unexplored. We used agency theory to test such determinants in 663 group-based pay plans. Incentive intensity was higher when groups were small, when plans did not need to measure quality, and when management participation was high. Plans embedded in small firms and plans with longevity had higher incentive intensity.

Using both agency and institutional theories, we examined factors associated with the board's adoption of a formal process for evaluating the performance of the corporation's chief executive officer (CEO). Our sample was drawn from the hospital industry. Results show that an independent board chairperson, the level of market competition and the degree of managed care penetration were significant predictors of whether or not the board had adopted a formal CEO evaluation process. These findings imply that initiatives to improve governance effectiveness based on agency theory should take into account the institutional environment of corporate boards.

Increasingly, the equity investments of individual investors are being channeled through financial institutions. This article posits that the role of institutional owners as financial intermediaries, and the resulting complexity that institutions bring to ownership, distinguish institutional ownership from individual ownership. I develop a model of institutional ownership, referred to as the nexus agency model (NAM), which reflects this complexity. The model provides a framework for identifying the potential additional agency costs to beneficial owners that are associated with owning via financial institutions. The degree to which owning via institutions benefits individual owners depends on the adequacy of the legal and regulatory environment and governance mechanisms in protecting individual owners' interests. The applicability of the nexus model to different institutional owner types is then demonstrated in a discussion of U.S. public and private pension plans and mutual funds, leading to the generation of a NAM-based research agenda for each type and across the types. The article ends with discussion of the model's applicability to non-U.S. institutional environments. (c) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This study argues that an evaluation of the relationship between CEO turnover and corporate performance can be usefully approached in three steps. (1) An empirical longitudinal analysis of 88 German corporations which had experienced a change in CEO shows that different kinds of CEO turnover are associated with different developments in published performance during the succession period. (2) Using a structural equations model it is possible to demonstrate the aptness of a hypothesis on performance variation based on agency theory and using empirical data on involuntary CEO turnover. (3) By introducing an indirect method of measurement it is shown that CEO "influence" explains a substantial part of the observed variation in performance during the succession period.

Governance in organizations according to traditional agency theory is based on the premise that managers and employees do not have identical goals. As a consequence, employees need to be monitored and controlled. If legal contracts are not sufficient for proper control, incentive contracts should be used. This paper argues that incentive contracts are not sufficient to solve governance issues in organizations due to problems in measurability and enforceability of presumed contract violations. Such problems are complicated by asymmetries in power, perspectives and aspirations between managers and employees. Acognitive argument is advanced suggesting that time constraints and bounded rationality render the idea of monitoring relatively ineffective. Governance ideas that focus on communication flow and information sharing are described. The role that other cognitive elements such as memory play in a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary framework for understanding governance relations is discussed.

The economic importance of 'knowledge work' has become widely accepted. Less widely accepted are the changes knowledge work requires in how we manage performance. This paper explores the differences between knowledge work and more traditional physical and managerial work, in the context of economic agency models, the most rigorous extant theoretical representations of how to manage performance. Assumptions derived from the characteristics of knowledge work are used to extend agency models. The conclusions about how to manage from this extended model are different from the conclusions of traditional agency models. Linking measured performance and compensation - a common recommendation that arises from interpretations of agency theories - is effective in knowledge work contexts only if knowledge workers are intrinsically motivated. We conclude that agency models and recommendations derived from them are relevant only to the extent that they employ modified assumptions consistent with the distinctive characteristics of knowledge work and knowledge workers.

The corporatization reform in Chinese SOEs has been largely influenced by the Anglo-American corporate governance model, but at issues is whether or not this model suits China's current institutional and cultural contexts. Agency theory and stewardship theory are two corporate governance theories that provide conflicting assumptions about human behavior and different prescriptions about governance mechanisms. In this study we drew upon both theories and developed competing hypotheses about the relationships between board composition, leadership structure, and organizational performance in Chinese shareholding companies. We gave special attention to China's unique institutional context and its influence on board attributes. The hypotheses were tested with a sample of Chinese listed companies. Overall, the stewardship hypotheses received stronger empirical support. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

In this study it is argued that positive agency theory is a relevant theoretical perspective in studies of the balanced scorecard in business management because agency theory addresses implementation and organizational control issues. If the balanced scorecard is to be applied also in public management, then positive agency theory should be complemented with political economy to incorporate possible implementation and organizational control issues related to political uncertainty, common agency and implementation ambiguity. It is argued that uncritical application of the balanced scorecard in public management could result in dysfunctions common in Soviet-type, central planning. However, such dysfunctions could be reduced with certain modifications of the balanced scorecard in order to facilitate political competition to a relatively larger extent. (c) 2001, MCB UP Limited

Adapting well-established organization theories to international joint ventures (IJVs), this paper develops an overarching theoretical model of the determinants and effects of parent control of IJVs from an interpartner bargaining power perspective. Drawing upon power dependence, transaction costs, and agency theories, we argue that the relative bargaining power between IJV partners serves as the key determinant of control structure, and that control exerts a direct effect on the venture's performance. In addition, government influence and interpartner working relationship are critical factors that complicate the linkage between control and performance but may help to explain past conflicting results. Propositions regarding these relationships are formed for future empirical test, and implications and directions for future research are provided. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The paper gives an overview of major scientific approaches to inter-enterprise relationships. A distinction is made between approaches that focus on business process integration (Supply Chain Management, Costing approaches), approaches that focus on organizational collaboration (Transaction Cost Theory. Agency Theory), and approaches that focus on the business environment (Strategic Management, Network Theory, Resource Dependency Theory). Although these approaches are different with regard to their perspectives on collaboration, variables and methods, the paper shows that they are complementary tools in the analysis and design of inter-enterprise relationships.

Despite Stock Option Plans' (SOPs) widespread use, evidence regarding their use and their effectiveness is relatively sparse and typically relies on an agency theory perspective that emphasizes the principal's interests in a market context. This study focuses on the agent as an individual who is involved in SOP management. Eighteen interviews with senior executives were conducted. Their responses indicate that SOPs are used to (a) initially align managemerit's incentives, (b) attract and retain key personnel, and (c) facilitate the payment of high levels of executive compensation. SOPs are successful when they are paid to employees whose actions influence stock prices. Our analysis suggests that no single theory provides a comprehensive explanation of SOP management. A critical assessment of agency theory as the dominant paradigm in executive compensation research and practice is presented, and the need for an integrated theoretical perspective for understanding SOPs is discussed.

Relying on neo-classical economics, agency theory, transaction cost economics and institutional approaches to organization, writers on the chaebol tried to highlight or elide certain organizational variables in their expositions of the growth and change of the chaebol organization. In this contribution, theoretical problems are discussed in these perspectives in explaining the chaebol, by focusing on four organizational variables: ownership and control structures, state regulation structures, inter-firm relations and technological uncertainties. These four organizational variables, despite their strengths, are found to miss some important points that are pertinent to understanding the rise of, and the current reform actions taken by, the chaebol.

Agency theory proposes that increasing managerial ownership in a firm can help align owner/management interests and motivate managers for better performance. This paper examines the relationship between managerial stock holdings and firm performance in the restaurant industry. Using the financial data of restaurant companies during 1995-1996, this study found that managerial ownership was positively and significantly associated with most of the performance measures, particularly in firms with 0%-15% managerial ownership. Firm size, a control variable, was also found to have a positive impact on performance. The results suggest that large restaurant firms with relatively low managerial ownership may raise managerial holdings to enhance their profitability and Stock returns.

There has been growing recognition in recent years of the importance of corporate governance in ensuring sound financial reporting and deterring fraud. The audit serves as a monitoring device and is thus part of the corporate governance mosaic. The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of various corporate governance factors, such as the board of directors and the audit committee, on the audit process. Importantly, there is little professional guidance on how auditors should consider such factors when formulating an appropriate audit strategy, and there has been only one prior study on this issue (Cohen and Hanno 2000). Because there are no current specific auditing standards that relate to the effect of corporate governance on the audit process, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 36 auditors on current audit practices in considering corporate governance in the audit process. Reflecting on client experiences, auditors indicate a range of views with regard to the elements included in the rubric of "corporate governance". Most significantly, auditors view management as the primary driver of corporate governance. The inclusion of top management in the "corporate governance mosaic" is inconsistent with agency theory's prescription of the board and other mechanisms serving as a means to independently oversee management's actions to protect stakeholders. Auditors consider corporate governance factors to be especially important in the client acceptance phase and in an international context. Further, despite the attention placed on the audit committee in the academic literature, in the business community, and by regulators in different countries (e.g., Canada, United States, Australia), several respondents indicated that their experiences with their clients suggest that audit committees are typically ineffective and lack sufficient power to be a strong governance mechanism. Implications for research and practice are presented.

In this article an extension of agency theory based on problems that arise in agency relationships, even when agents are assumed to be honest and dutiful, is put forward. With one exception, these assumptions lead to essentially the same predictions as in standard agency theory, suggesting that effects commonly attributed to self-seeking may be better understood as more fundamental effects of the agency relationship itself. This analysis raises a number of previously unexplored research questions concerning the nature of managerial agency relationships.

Application service providers (ASPs) offer multiple users a subscription-based access model via the Internet to centrally managed applications. The appeals of ASPs are the per-user-pricing models, one-to-many access possibilities to applications, IT expertise and capabilities, and value added management services. This paper argues that although the ASP model offers an electronic outsourcing solution, there are in fact many similarities with more traditional IT outsourcing. Using four case studies from exploratory research into ASPs, we illustrate the applicability of a little used contingency model from the research literature that combines resource dependency theory, resource-based theory, transaction cost theory and agency theory. From this, we develop six major propositions that customers should bear in mind when considering an ASP option. Similar to outsourcing services, ASP sourcing offers some interesting benefits, but equally entails a set of risks that practitioners should carefully evaluate when considering the 'netsourced' ASP option.

This article focuses on the role of the family business shareholder. Based on Agency Theory, it examines the elements that influence the conflict of interests and objectives between nonemployed shareholders and the top management team and its impact on commitment to the family firm. Data were empirically obtained from a field study of 156 shareholders and executives of 10 Spanish family firms. Combining quantitative and qualitative data, investigation results show that the degree of commitment to the family business is negatively correlated with the number of family members on the board of directors. Nevertheless, the most robust and statistically significant correlation (positive) was found between the number of external board members and the commitment level of the nonemployed shareholders. Regarding the mechanisms and processes implemented, results depended on the attention that the family business paid to the institutional overlap of the three subsystems: ownership, family, and business.

Most empirical investigations on the disassociation between executive compensation and firm performance have been done using agency theory. Agency theory alludes to a power imbalance favorable to the executives, allowing them to pursue their self-interest in the form of large pay packages. However, because of its roots in the economic discipline, agency theory has led researchers to test financial rather than behavioral hypotheses. Over 70 years of research has been conducted on the pay-form-performance relationship, but only a few significant relationships have been found. This paper attempts to incorporate behavioral conjectures of power into the agency theory framework to provide a comprehensive approach to testing executive pay. Agency theory is combined with the resource dependency theory and with specific measures of power developed by Finkelstein (1992) for a more complete executive pay model.

This study analyzes the impact of ownership structure on R&D investments in the United States and Japan. It begins with the premise that U.S. and Japanese firms have distinct patterns of ownership that may result in disparities in R&D investments. Agency theory and stewardship theory are used to hypothesize about the relationship between ownership and R&D investments. Empirical evidence shows that the level of ownership concentration, and its impact, differ across countries. We argue that these differences result from a mixture of motives and incentives.

How likely are multinational enterprises (MNEs) to use expatriate parent country nationals to staff culturally distant subsidiaries? How does their employment affect subsidiary performance? The agency theory prediction is that MNEs will rely more heavily on parent country nationals as cultural distance increases and that this reliance will weaken over time. Both agency theory and the "resource-based view" suggest that a positive effect of expatriate staffing on subsidiary performance increases with cultural distance but decreases over time. Results largely supported the predictions in data on Japanese foreign subsidiaries.

Two theories have emerged in the managerial control literature as to the best way for organizations to ensure that managers are acting in the firm's best interest: agency theory, which stresses controlling decision-makers through monitoring and incentives aligned with organizational goals, and stewardship theory, which stresses that decision-makers will act in the organization's best interest even in the absence of controls. Much of the research investigating the utility of these two positions is based on archival data where actual decision-making can only be inferred. In this study, we utilize a laboratory methodology in order to determine if decision-makers actually make different decisions when under the types of control (or lack thereof) suggested in these two theories. The results of this study show that individuals under agency controls invest more in alternatives that maximize profits of an organization than individuals under stewardship controls.

This article examines the franchisor-franchisee relationship from two theoretical perspectives - agency theory and exchange theory. Taking the case of the fast-food industry in Israel, the research focuses on control and autonomy in a domestic hamburger chain - Burger Ranch - and two international chains - McDonald's and Burger King. The findings led to the design of a model that illustrates several aspects, such as the concept of franchising, the size and age of the chain, and the range of the contract, that relate to control and autonomy. The combination of agency theory and exchange theory enables us to focus on control and autonomy as multidimensional concepts, and to present various possibilities for judiciously balancing them. The case indicates that in some respects (e.g. master franchisee), the two global chains are more similar to each other than to the domestic chain. However, in other respects (e.g. size, growth rate), the domestic and one of the two global chains show more similarities than differences. The findings indicate different forms of integration of control and autonomy in the three chains. (c) 2003, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

Empirical research on the impact of reform on the Japanese corporate governance system could provide useful lessons for their European counterparts who are themselves facing similar pressures to reform. We found that although participation of outside directors in strategic decision-making was associated with positive stock returns, the increase in the ratio of outside directors, the separation of the board members and executive officers, and the reduction of board size were not related to firm performance.

Do outside directors on corporate boards make a difference in firm performance during institutional transitions ? What leads to the practice of appointing outside directors in the absence of legal mandate? This article addresses these two important questions by drawing not only on agency theory, but also resource dependence and institutional theories. Taking advantage of China's institutional transitions, our findings, based on an archival database covering 405 publicly listed firms and 1211 company-years, suggest that outsider directors do make a difference infirm performance, if such performance is measured by sales growth, and that they have little impact on financial performance such as return on equity (ROE). The results also document a bandwagon effect behind the diffusion of the practice of appointing outsiders to corporate boards. The article not only highlights the need to incorporate multiple theories beyond agency theory in corporate governance research, but also generates policy implications in light of the recent trend toward having more outside directors on corporate boards in emerging economies.

Metrics provide essential links between strategy, execution, and ultimate value creation. Changing competitive dynamics are placing heavy demands on conventional metrics systems, and creating stresses throughout firms and their supply chains. Research has not kept pace with these new demands in an environment where it is no longer sufficient to simply let metrics evolve over time - we must learn how to proactively design and manage them. The intent of this paper is to convey the importance and need for metrics-related research. An outline of the important characteristics of the metrics research topic is provided. Specifically, we address the functions of metrics; their focus and tense; their operational and strategic contexts; as well as discuss the distinction between metrics, metrics sets and metrics systems. Some initial theoretical grounding for the research topic is provided through agency theory.

In this article, we document the growing influence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the realm of socially responsible investing (SRI). Drawing from ethical and economic perspectives on stakeholder management and agency theory, we develop a framework to understand how and when NGOs will be most influential in shaping the ethical and social responsibility orientations of business using the emergence of SRI as the primary influencing vehicle. We find that NGOs have opportunities to influence corporate conduct via direct, indirect, and interactive influences on the investment community, and that the overall influence of NGOs as major actors in socially responsible investment is growing, with attendant consequences for corporate strategy, governance, and social performance.

The role of the board of directors in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. However, research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies: the lack of an overarching theoretical perspective, reliance on proxies for the strategy role rather than a direct measure of it and the lack of quantitative data linking this role to firm financial performance. We propose a new theoretical perspective to explain the board's role in strategy, integrating organisational control and agency theories. We categorise a board's approach to strategy according to two constructs: strategic control and financial control. The extent to which either construct is favoured depends on contextual factors such as board power, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry.

To date, corporate governance research agendas have tended to concentrate on one particular role that a board performs. For instance, agency theory concentrates on the monitoring role, resource dependence theory concentrates on the board providing access to resources and stewardship theory concentrates on the board's advice-giving or strategic role. While these approaches provide practitioners with useful guidelines regarding issues such as board independence, we contend that practitioners need to take care not to act on the recommendations from a single theory in isolation from the others. To address this concern, we provide a model of board effectiveness that uses the construct of board intellectual capital to integrate the predominant theories of corporate governance and illustrate how the board can drive corporate performance. We further contend that boards that wish to improve their performance need to review their intellectual capital. We conclude by linking the model to a practitioner-focused framework that identifies four key areas on which a board must concentrate to develop its intellectual capital.

This paper advances the resource dependence and social networks literature by investigating a board's structural social capital created as a consequence of interlocking directorates. Using approaches and measures developed by social network analysis we compare the interpersonal directorship networks of the top 250 companies in the United States and Australia. We find that the smaller, sparser Australian network is only marginally less compact and connected than the larger US network at the firm level of analysis. However, at the director level of analysis the US network is much larger and more connected than its Australian counterpart. As a result, we argue that scholars studying the resource dependence role of boards should consider using measures of interpersonal links as well as traditional measures of inter-firm links. Understanding how boards impact on corporate performance is a question central to the corporate governance research agenda. Agency theory, for example, argues that the key way a board adds value is by ensuring the interests of the managers of the firm are aligned with the interests of the owners (Eisenhardt 1989; Jensen & Meckling 1976). A quite distinct area of inquiry, however, relates to the role that the board plays in providing access to important resources such as customers (Pennings 1980), capital (Mizruchi & Stearns 1988), the business elite (Uscem 1984) and power in general (Pfeffer & Salancik 1978). We aim to broaden understanding of the resource dependence theory of corporate governance by examining the links provided to a board by interlocking directorships. We commence by reviewing existing research on the resource dependence role of the board before outlining how the emerging construct of social capital can be adapted and applied to investigate this role. In particular, we highlight how it is the personal director network that is critical to the development of social capital rather than the corporate network (i.e. network of corporations). While this study is primarily exploratory and descriptive, we contribute to the literature by employing a new methodology to measure the 'opportunity network' that interlocking directorates provide a board within a national corporate governance system (Adams 2002a; 2002b; 2002c). We show how the formal models, procedures and techniques developed in social network analysis can be applied to individual-level networks among directors. We stress that we are not considering the formation of social capital at the individual level; rather we are examining the systemic connections of individual directors in order to illustrate the opportunity network available to a board within the national corporate governance system. A comparison of the Australian and US systems highlights the divergence in network attributes between corporate networks and the networks of interlocking directors. We conclude with implications and areas for further research.

This study strives to take an extra step to sharpen the comprehension of one aspect of agency theory as well as to extend previous research by examining the role of board of directors and managerial remuneration in enhancing corporate performance in the REITs industry. The main hypothesis in this study will be twofold. First, managerial remuneration is related to corporate performance. Second, the ratio of outside directors is related to corporate performance. This study will use a sample of REIT firms as of the end of 1996. The sample will consist of the actively traded REITs listed in the public stock exchanges. The final sample that meets all the criteria includes 167 REITs. The results indicate that there is a negative relationship between cash managerial remuneration and firm performance. Moreover, this study confirms a nonlinear relationship between board size and firm performance. The relationship is negative when board size is small, and it turns positive when board size grows.

Agency theory describes the viability of outcome and behavior contingent contracts in principal-agent transactions. This article proposes that a principal's choice between the two contract forms in a representative negotiation is constrained by the conditions that led a principal to employ an agent. Six of these conditions - expertise, emotional strain, the principal's preferred engagement strategy, zone of possible agreement, communal relationship norms, and repeated interactions between principals - are reviewed and summarized in testable propositions. Specifically, the six conditions are proposed to underscore the viability of behavior versus outcome contingent contracts in serving the principal's substantive and relationship-based interests.

This paper examines board effectiveness through an examination of the work and relationships of non-executive directors. It is based on 40 in-depth interviews with company directors, commissioned for the Higgs Review. The paper observes that research on corporate governance lacks understanding of the behavioural processes and effects of boards of directors. Whilst board structure, composition and independence condition board effectiveness it is the actual conduct of the non-executive vis-a-vis the executive that determines board effectiveness. Data about behaviour and relationships on boards suggest that traditional theoretical divisions between agency and stewardship theory, and control versus collaboration models of the board do not adequately reflect the lived experience of non-executive directors and other directors on the board. Developing accountability as a central concept in the explanation of how boards operate effectively enables the paper to both challenge the dominant grip of agency theory on governance research and support the search for theoretical pluralism and greater understanding of board processes and dynamics. Practically, the work suggests that corporate governance reform will be undermined by prescription that supports distant perceptions of board effectiveness but not the actual effectiveness of boards.

This paper argues that research in organization theory has seen a shift in orientation from paradigm-driven work to problem-driven work since the late 1980s. A number of paradigms for the study of organizations were elaborated during the mid-1970s, including transaction cost economics, resource dependence theory, organizational ecology, new institutional theory, and agency theory in financial economics. These approaches reflected the dominant trends of the large corporations of their time: increasing concentration, diversification, and bureaucratization. However, subsequent shifts in organizational boundaries, the increased use of alliances and network forms, and the expanding role of financial markets in shaping organizational decision making all make normal science driven by the internally derived questions from these paradigms less fruitful. Instead, we argue that problem-driven work that uses mechanism-based theorizing and research that takes the field rather than the organization as the unit of analysis are the most appropriate styles of organizational research under conditions of major economic change - such as our own era. This sort of work is best exemplified by various studies under the rubric of institutional theory in the past 15 years, which are reviewed here. (c) 2005 INFORMS.

Note: This study investigated six dimensions of effective board performance, as suggested by Chait, Holland, and Taylor (1991), in relation to three theoretical explanations (agency theory, resource dependency theory, and group/decision process theory) of how board governance activities potentially influence organizational performance. Survey research findings revealed that strategic contributions from the board are more robust in organizations with higher financial performance. In addition, organizations that are judged to be higher performing also reported having high-performing boards across all dimensions. In particular, the interpersonal dimension provided a unique explanation of judgments of organizational performance. (c) Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Through meta-analyses, this study reveals systematic relationships between board composition and six of the seven critical decisions examined. Interestingly, the results provide little support to agency theory's predictions on the impact of board composition on critical decisions that involve a potential conflict of interest between managers and shareholders.

Agency theory's insistence to link the compensation of managers and directors as closely as possible to firm performance is a major reason for these scandals. They cannot be overcome by improving variable pay for performance as selfish extrinsic motivation is reinforced. Based on the common pool approach to the firm, institutions are proposed, serving to raise intrinsically motivated corporate virtue. More importance is to be attributed to fixed pay and strengthening the legitimacy of authorities by procedural fairness, relational contracts, and organizational citizenship behavior.

Good governance for SMEs is critical for economic development and growth in both developed and developing economies. In this paper we focus on boards and governance in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) by investigating the role and contribution of "outside" directors in this setting. By contrasting board role theories against different types of SMEs, firms are expected to recruit "outside" board members for various reasons. Illustrated by 52 empirical studies of "outside" directors in SMEs we show how agency theory, resource based view of the firm, and resource dependence theory can be applied to understand the multiple roles that "outside" directors can play in family firms, venture capital-backed firms and other SMEs. The illustration shows that the concept "outside" director is not the same in different theories and in different empirical settings. Based on this finding, we argue for the need to have a conscious and balanced use of theories for understanding the role and contribution of "outside" directors in SMEs.

We reason that agency theory's behavioral assumptions may too closely reflect the US institutional context to explain the governance heritages that exist elsewhere. We propose that what constitutes opportunistic behavior and what can be done to limit it may vary due to differences in national background and formal institutions. We then test the validity of this nationally bounded model using historical sociology analysis of three nations whose corporate governance heritages are believed to differ (USA, Sweden, and France). Specifically, we review their political, cultural, and economic institutions to explore the different ways that their governance practices have evolved and infer causes for these historical variations.

American businesses and corporate executives are faced with a serious problem the loss of public confidence. Public criticism, increased government controls, and growing expectations for improved financial performance and accountability have accompanied this decline in trust. Traditional approaches to corporate governance, typified by agency theory and stakeholder theory, have been expensive to direct and have focused on short-term profits and organizational systems that fail to achieve desired results. We explain why the organizational governance theories are fundamentally, inadequate to build trust. We advance a conceptual framework based on stewardship theory characterized by "covenantal relationships" and argue that design of governance mechanisms using a covenantal approach is more effective in building trust in organizations. A covenantal relationship is a specialized form of a relational contract between an employee and his or her organization. We argue that regardless of incentives and control mechanisms carefully designed through contractual mechanisms, in the absence of covenantal relationships it is extremely difficult to build trust within organizations. We propose that organizations are more likely to build trust - both at the organizational level and at the interpersonal level - when they create reinforcing and integrated systems that honor implied duties of "covenantal relationships.".

This paper addresses how the global activities undertaken by multinational enterprises (MNEs) in international settings impact corporate governance mechanisms and accountability systems. International corporate governance and accountability research, whether from a political science, economics, finance, or accounting perspective, has thus far predominantly focused on the comparison of corporate governance schemes in different countries and on the investigation of institutional parameters that determine these schemes. Straying from this line of inquiry, this article discusses how globalization at the firm level affects governance and accountability systems at parent- and subsidiary-levels. It emphasizes how an MNE's globalization attributes such as globalization scale, foreign adaptation, global competition, and international experience influence the design of governance mechanisms such as board size, board composition, executive compensation, market discipline, interlocking directorate, ownership concentration, duality and inbreeding, as well as the design of accountability systems such as accounting information, auditing standards, and financial and non-financial disclosures. This article bases its conjectures on information processing and agency theories. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

How and to what extent should a transnational corporation's governance structures be differentiated to satisfy varying strategic roles played by foreign subsidiaries? Drawing on an agency theory perspective, we examine the effects of agency problems in the headquarters-subsidiary relationships on the design of corporate governance in transnational corporations. We propose that corporate governance of foreign subsidiaries in a transnational corporation should be constructed in response to different levels of agency problems associated with varying strategic roles of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we postulate that differentiating governance structures for each foreign subsidiary is a key contingency requirement in order to achieve superior MNE performance as a whole.

Research on detrimental workplace behaviors has increased recently, predominantly focusing on justice issues. Research from the integrity testing literature, which is grounded in trait theory, has not received as much attention in the management literature. Trait theory, agency theory, and psychological contracts theory each have different predictions about employee performance that is harmful to the organization. While on the surface they appear contradictory, this paper describes how each can be integrated to increase our understanding of detrimental workplace behaviors.Deborah L. Kidder is an Associate Professor in the Department of Management at Towson University, in Towson, MD, USA. Her Ph.D. is in Industrial Relations from the University of Minnesta.

In this theoretical paper we are investigating the important question of why, in the face of strong evidence that mergers and acquisitions (M&As) do not generate returns for acquiring company shareholders, CEOs continue to pursue these strategies. Drawing on a variety of theoretical perspectives, we argue that the firm's agents (the CEO and executives) and M&A promoters (investment bankers, lawyers and other advisors) have developed non-efficiency based relationships in the context of increased competitive pressures and a crisis in corporate ethics. The key theoretical point is that the nexus between CEOs, professional advisors and boards provides a more compelling explanation for the observed merger preference phenomenon than either the agency problem or the promoter effect on their own. Implications of the model for practice, research and theory building are discussed. (c) 2005 Yoser Gadhoum.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Agency theory suggests that the interests of opportunistic, self-interested agents conflict with those of principals. Stewardship theory suggests instead that executives' interests are aligned with company interests and that executives are thus more intrinsically motivated than agency theory implies. This study develops hypotheses regarding the psychological and situational factors that affect the applicability of each theory to executive compensation. I tested hypotheses using a unique data set of 1,238 executives from 528 private companies. Results suggest significant differences between founder-stewards and nonfounder agents that diminish with company growth, and significant effects of equity ownership and outside rounds of financing.

This study examines determinants of professional human resource management (HRM) practices within a sample of approximately 700 small to medium-sized firms. Predictions from the agency theory and the resource-based view of organizations lead to alternate hypotheses regarding the direct and indirect negative effects of family ownership and management on the usage of professional HRM practices. Results support predictions for both direct and indirect effects. These indirect effects occur through intermediary variables that reflect organizational complexity, such as firm size, (the presence of a) formal business plan, and HRM specialization. The findings lend partial support to both theories. (c) 2006, International Council for Small Business.

We draw on the concept of community-level social capital and apply it to the situation of a family-controlled public corporation. While traditional agency theory argues that agency costs are minimized in a family-controlled business (FCB) due to an improved alignment of owner and manager interests, we argue instead that FCBs endure additional agency costs uniquely related to the family firm organizational structure. To mitigate these additional costs, we propose that FCBs use board interlocks to build and maintain community-level social capital. That is, the intercorporate network of FCBs generates shared understandings, values, problem solving techniques, and approaches to dealing with family issues. Further, the network generates a level of social support for family business owners and managers grappling with challenges endemic to family control of public corporations. We generate a number of propositions that can be used in future research to test the theory developed here. We conclude with the assertion that the community-level social capital generated by the network of FCBs is an important reason for the survival and persistence of individual family firms, despite the existence of additional family-related costs.

The board of directors is regarded as one of the most imperative governance mechanisms in small and medium-sized family firms. Empirical studies examining both the roles these boards fulfil in a family business context, as well as evaluating the CEO's perceived importance of these roles, are scarce. Founded by a range of conceptual and multi-theoretical board role definitions, this paper contributes to the literature by empirically determining board roles. Furthermore, the importance of these board roles and differences between the board's performance and perceived importance are assessed. The results show it is indispensable to differentiate between two aggregated roles that boards in small and medium-sized family firms perform: control and service. The control role is predominantly based on agency theory, whereas the service role includes multiple theoretical perspectives. The CEOs of the family firms perceive the service role of the board as most important. However, in order to direct succession and to compensate for the owner/manager's altruistic behaviour, the board's control role should not be neglected. The acknowledgement of these two aggregated board roles and their importance may enhance future research on board roles within specific contexts. (c) 2006 Blaekwell Publishing Ltd.

Despite the fact that several event studies have investigated the market's reaction to information technology (IT) investment announcements, little is known about how specific transactional risks influence the market value of a firm. This study examines stock market data to assess investors' responses to various transactional risks associated with IT outsourcing. More specifically, we develop and test several hypotheses to understand how transactional risks that arise due to a range of factors (i.e., the size of outsourcing contracts, difficulties in performance monitoring, asset specificity of IT resources, vendor capability, and the lack of cultural similarity between client and vendor firms) influence investors' reactions to IT outsourcing announcements. Our results indicate that most of these factors indeed significantly influence investors' perceptions of the risks involved in IT outsourcing. We discuss these findings in a larger organizational context and offer implications for both research and practice. In particular, our study offers a theoretical rationale for why negative reactions to IT outsourcing announcements may occur, while providing practitioners with several means by which they can increase the informational value of outsourcing arrangements.

This article assesses the corporate governance-related antecedents of nomination committee adoption, and the impact of nomination committees' existence and their composition on board independence and board demographic diversity. We conducted a longitudinal study of board composition amongst 210 Swiss public companies from January 2001 through December 2003, a period during which the Swiss (Stock) Exchange (SWX) introduced new corporate governance-related disclosure guidelines. We find firms with nomination committees are more likely to have a higher number of independent and foreign directors, but not more likely to have a higher number of female board members. Further, the existence of nomination committees is associated with a higher degree of nationality diversity but is not related to board educational diversity. We also find that nomination committee composition matters in the nomination of independent and foreign, but not of female directors. Our results suggest that understanding different board roles and composition require a multi-theoretical approach, and that agency theory, resource-dependence theory and group effectiveness theory help to explain different aspects of board composition and effectiveness. Finally, the article discusses the concept of diversity and appropriate ways to study diversity in a boardroom context. (c) Springer 2006.

Purpose - This study seeks to examine the influence of board independence, CEO duality and ownership structure on the firm financial distressed status using a sample of distressed companies and a matched-pair sample of non-distressed companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia. Design/methodology/ approach - This study utilized publicly available data from annual reports of a sample of 86 non-finance distressed firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia and a sample of matched 86 non-distressed firms for a period covering the 1999-2001 financial years. Findings - Board independence and CEO duality are not associated with financial distressed status. Management and non-executive directors' interests are associated negatively with financial distress. A negative association is also documented for outside blockholders. The evidence also supports the contention that ownership by non-executive directors and outside blockholders effectively increases their incentives to monitor management in ensuring their wealth in the firms is intact. Research limitations/implications - One limitation of this research is that it relies on publicly available data and agency theory. Future research could apply other theories, such as resource dependency and stewardship. Use of process-oriented data could also improve the findings. Practical implications - Independent directors need to undergo training to help them improve and be aware of their responsibilities. Originality/value - This paper offers evidence on the extent to which distress is associated with corporate governance from a developing country. The paper should be of interest to the regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) traditionally have been governed by the Communist Party. Privatization has brought greater numbers of investors who have a stake and demand a voice in how SOEs are managed. Three traditional governance perspectives are agency theory, resource dependence, and institutional theory, but China's transition introduces several additional governance approaches. Are "capitalism with Chinese characteristics" and "bureaucratic entrepreneurialism" paradoxes? Based on initial interviews of SOE executives, a survey of top managers and board chairs of listed companies, and subsequent interviews and observations in select case companies, this paper develop a taxonomy of SOE governance that now exists in China. Two of the approaches represent the extremes of the old state-centered regimes and the new shareholder-centered regimes. Considering China's historical and cultural contexts coupled with its current stage of economic transition, two additional approaches to corporate governance are to have a vacuum as neither the state nor shareholders dominate or - in unique contrast to other countries - a hybrid of both.

In this study, we examine the importance of goal congruence in management control systems (MCS) using a theoretical framework that draws upon both agency theory and stewardship theory. Two aspects of goal congruence are considered: (1) a manager's voluntary acceptance of an organization's strategy, i.e., principal-agent alignment, and (2) manager consensus regarding their organization's strategy, i.e. agent-agent alignment among the potentially divergent interests of multiple agents. We demonstrate the impact of managers' strategy acceptance (consensus) on four measures of economic benefit: inputs (resource accumulation), outputs (volume of services), operating efficiency (output per unit of input), and cost structure flexibility (adaptability to volume). The results indicate that greater manager consensus is associated with hospitals that accumulate more resources and provide higher levels of service with greater efficiency and additional cost structure flexibility. Our evidence also indicates that hospital managers (MDs, nurses and CFOs) are not motivated by individual opportunism alone, and that goal congruence does not depend solely upon selecting the right performance measures and incentives to remove inefficiencies and moral hazards. We conclude that goal congruence based upon both strategy acceptance and reinforcing incentives may result in MCS that are less costly and more effective. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This research analyzes whether variable compensation is designed as an economically rational incentive to increase organizational performance, or whether it also responds to other factors such as the search for legitimacy. A case study demonstrates how the design of the variable compensation system, at both managerial and lower levels, takes into account the company's adoption of popular management practices that increase its legitimacy but not necessarily its performance.The results show that,in the design of their compensation policies, organizations do not always seek financial objectives, as agency theory maintains, but often have other social objectives such as the search for legitimacy, as institutional theory suggests. The management of incentives not only is used to align the interests of principal and agent, but also has a symbolic character, insofar as it signals that the company belongs to a particular social context.

Women corporate inside (executive) directors constitute an elite minority of leaders of large corporations. This study examines the characteristics of CEOs and boards of Fortune 1000 firms that had women who held the dual leadership positions of corporate director and executive officer in 1998 in order to determine whether firms with women insiders had substantially different characteristics than firms without. We find that compared with firms without women inside directors, firms with women inside directors were characterized by CEOs with longer board tenure, more family ties, and fewer director interlocks, and by boards that were larger, with more insiders, and that utilize a management Chair of the board. Corporate governance implications are drawn for the presence of women at the top of the executive hierarchy.

This paper investigates the effects of investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board of directors on their judgments. I hypothesize that investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board will be negatively related to their judgments of investment risk and positively related to the amount they are willing to invest. I also hypothesize that the association between effectiveness of the board and investment judgments will be moderated by investor type such that professional investors will be less conservative than non-professional investors. Forty non-professional investors and 33 professional investors participated in the experiment. Generally, the results of the study are consistent with the hypothesized effects. The results suggest that even in the context of sound financial performance, investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board are a key determinant of their investment judgments. This association is moderated by investor type and suggests professional investors are less conservative than non-professional investors. Such evidence is consistent with agency theory, "use of the house money" hypothesis and recent anecdotal scandals involving professional investors. Overall, the results provide evidence that investors are more confident in firms with effective corporate boards and support regulatory reforms strengthening corporate boards. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

I argue and found that the effectiveness of a firm's monitoring mechanisms to prevent managerial opportunism in acquisitions becomes more important under high environmental complexity and/or dynamism because of the increased information asymmetry between investors and top executives under these conditions. I also found that increased monitoring under non-complex and/or stable environments may be viewed negatively by investors, and that symbolic information about governance arrangements affects investors' evaluations of managerial opportunism in acquisitions. The results highlight the need for more research on factors that influence the explanatory power of agency theory. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Firstly, from Transaction Costs, Property Rights and Agency perspectives, the economic rationale of mutuals is analyzed, paying particular attention to MATEP's peculiarities and incentives in terms of competition, regulation and ownership. Subsequently, the effectiveness of governance mechanisms is discussed, showing that the status quo leaves excess power in the hands of the managers of these organizations.

Despite a decade since the inception of B2C e-commerce, the uncertainty of the online environment still makes many consumers reluctant to engage in online exchange relationships. Even if uncertainty has been widely touted as the primary barrier to online transactions, the literature has viewed uncertainty as a "background" mediator with insufficient conceptualization and measurement. To better understand the nature of uncertainty and mitigate its potentially harmful effects on B2C e-commerce adoption (especially for important purchases), this study draws upon and extends the principal-agent perspective to identify and propose a set of four antecedents of perceived uncertainty in online buyer-seller relationships - perceived information asymmetry, fears of seller opportunism, information privacy concerns, and information security concerns - which are drawn from the agency problems of adverse selection (hidden information) and moral hazard (hidden action). To mitigate uncertainty in online exchange relationships, this study builds upon the principal - agent perspective to propose a set of four uncertainty mitigating factors - trust, website informativeness, product diagnosticity, and social presence - that facilitate online exchange relationships by overcoming the agency problems of hidden information and hidden action through the logic of signals and incentives. The proposed structural model is empirically tested with longitudinal data from 521 consumers for two products (prescription drugs and books) that differ on their level of purchase involvement. The results support our model, delineating the process by which buyers engage in online exchange relationships by mitigating uncertainty. Interestingly, the proposed model is validatedfor two distinct targets, a specific website and a class of websites. Implications for understanding and facilitating online exchange relationships for different types of purchases, mitt gating uncertainty perceptions, and extending the principal-agent perspective are discussed.

The failure to document a consistent and robust relationship between executive pay and firm performance has frustrated scholars and practitioners for over three quarters of a century. Although recent compensation research has revealed alternative theoretical frameworks and findings that hold the potential to significantly improve our understanding of executive compensation, to date this diverse literature lacks theoretical integration. Accordingly, we develop a framework to organize and review these recent findings.

We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper investigates how governance mechanisms affect the ability of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to introduce strategic change. Previous research typically assumes that governance mechanisms operate independently of each other. Building on agency theory and insights from the literature on small firm governance, we hypothesize that governance variables related to ownership, the board of directors and the top management team all affect strategic change and that it is important to examine the interaction effects of these governance mechanisms. Using a longitudinal sample of over 800 SMEs, our general logic and hypotheses are supported by the analyses. We find that closely held firms exhibit less strategic change than do SMEs relying on more widespread ownership structures. However, to some extent, closely held firms can overcome these weaknesses and achieve strategic change by utilizing outside directors on the board and/or extending the size of the top management teams. Implications for theory and management practice in SMEs are discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Business groups are the primary form of managing large business organizations outside North America. This paper provides a systematic and integrative framework for understanding business groups. We argue that existing theoretical perspectives of business groups pay attention to four critical external contexts, each of which draws from a specific theoretical perspective: market conditions (transaction cost theory), social relationships (relational perspective), political factors (political economy perspective), and external monitoring mechanisms (agency theory). Business groups adapt to these external forces by deploying various internal mechanisms along two key dimensions: one focuses on the distinctive roles of the group affiliates (horizontal connectedness) and the other focuses on coupling and order between the parent firm and its affiliates (vertical linkages). Based on these two dimensions, a typology of business group forms is developed: network (N-form), club (C-form), holding (H-form), and multidivisional (M-form). Utilizing this model we provide research questions which facilitate an improved future research agenda. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.

Most research investigating the impact of board leadership structure as a corporate governance mechanism, on corporate performance has focused largely on either the Anglo-American context or the Asian experience and has come up with diverse conclusions. This study sheds light on the extent to which corporate leadership structure affects corporate performance by providing empirical evidence from a sample of Egyptian listed firms. The initial econometric results indicate that CEO duality has no impact on corporate performance. However, when an interaction term between industry type and CEO duality is included in the model, the impact of CEO duality on corporate performance is found to vary across industries, a result that is supportive of both agency theory and stewardship theory. In addition, when firms are categorised according to their financial performance, CEO duality attracts a positive and significant coefficient only when corporate performance is low.

Does CEO duality - the practice of one person serving both as a firm's CEO and board chair - contribute to or inhibit firm performance? Agency theory suggests that CEO duality is bad for performance because it compromises the monitoring and control of the CEO. Stewardship theory, in contrast, argues that CEO duality may be good for performance due to the unity of command it presents. The empirical evidence, largely from developed economies, is largely inconclusive. This article joins the debate by extending empirical work to the largely unexplored context of institutional transitions. Our findings, based on an archival database covering 403 publicly listed firms and 1,202 company-years in China, offer stronger support for stewardship theory and relatively little support for agency theory. Finally, we also call for a contingency perspective to specify the nature of conditions such as resource scarcity and environmental dynamism under which CEO duality may be especially valuable.

Challenging agency theory prescriptions for board composition, we contend that the boards of young firms that have recently gone public are best comprised of a majority of original top management team (TMT) members, rather than independent outsiders. We argue that such board members possess valuable tacit knowledge of the firms and their entrepreneurial visions and are in the best position to provide oversight. We additionally argue that outsiders should provide resources that firms' TMTs might use to execute their strategies, rather than monitor the TMTs. Our results from 1996-97 data on 524 initial public offerings support our contentions. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

This article provides a definition of corporate governance and highlights the challenges in adapting understanding of governance to the privately-held firm. We emphasize the need to develop the scope of governance in privately-held firms beyond the traditional agency theory focus in the financial economics literature relating to large publicly-listed corporations. There is a need to draw on and integrate an array of theoretical perspectives from both economics and other social science disciplines as well. We present a schematic model of corporate governance which places the contributions presented in the special issue in context and which serves as a guide to highlighting gaps in the research base. We review the principal issues relating to corporate governance in privately-held firms which relate to: governance in different organizational contexts (institutional context; the industrial sector within which the firm finds itself, the ownership context of the firm, and the stage within the firm's life-cycle); the scope of corporate governance; and other internal governance mechanisms to be considered We identify areas for further research on corporate governance in privately-held firms with respect to processes of governance, organizational contexts, assumptions about the owners, executive remuneration, financial reporting, the nature of the dependent variable relating to the expected outcome of different approaches to governance and various methodological issues. We suggest a need to develop governance codes for privately-held firms that are flexible enough to take account of the different types of governance needs of firms at different stages in their life-cycle.

We explore the impact of CEO tenure on returns to shareholders arising from acquisition announcements. Further, we consider the value added for shareholders when the board of directors is composed in such a way as to enhance vigilance. In the absence of a vigilant board, CEO tenure is positively associated with performance at low to moderate levels of tenure, and negatively associated with performance when tenure further rises to substantial levels. In the presence of a vigilant board, however, shareholder interests can be advanced even at high levels of CEO tenure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Board composition in large organizations has been subject to much empirical research, however, little attention has been focused on board composition in start-ups, and more specifically high tech start-ups. This lack of research is surprising given that many high tech start-ups have multiple equity stakeholders such as venture capitalists or public research organizations, such as universities. Given that high tech start-ups are commonly resource-poor these external stakeholders may play an important role in accessing critical external resources. Drawing on agency theory, resource dependence theory and social network theory we examine the tensions that exist between the founding team and external equity stakeholders in determining the presence of outside board members. In particular we focus on whether or not the outside board members have either complementary or substitute human capital to the founding team. We test our model on a sample of 140 high tech start-ups in Flanders. Our results indicate that high tech start-ups with a public research organization as an external equity stakeholder are more likely to develop boards with outside board members with complementary skills to the founding team.

Sumantra Ghoshal, in his recent Academy of Management Learning & Education article, argued that management theories currently taught in MBA programs are the causal factor in triggering (a), the recent wave of corporate scandals in the United States and (b), lack of theory building for contemporary management. He identified the dominance in graduate business education of agency theory as the primary culprit for these problems. In this essay I outline how a cognitive philosophy of science shift in the business school culture from Thomas Kuhn's normal science paradigm framework to Karl Popper's revolutionary science methodology would mitigate many of the dysfunctions Ghoshal catalogues. This position is based on published literature, contemporary trends in management theory, and teaching graduate courses in the administrative sciences. I also suggest that, if such a transition is not made, MBA programs will continue to lose both societal and organizational legitimacy. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

This paper presents a model for the governance of radical innovation (RI) efforts within the firm. A longitudinal study of 12 large established companies committed to develop and institutionalize a radical innovation capability are used to inform our work. Thus the firm, rather than the RI project, is the unit of analysis for this work. We draw on Agency Theory, Firm Level Governance, Stewardship Theory and Stakeholder Theory as well to enrich the model. We find that none of these theoretical frames adequately describes the issues faced by companies as they build governance systems to oversee high risk, high uncertainty innovation portfolios. A series of propositions is offered based on the data analysis and extant literature that address board composition, decision style and decision processes that, we believe, enhance a company's ability to generate and commercialize radical innovations.

This article examines the conditions under which the principal-agent model is self-activating/socially causal. We do so by exploring a principal-agent framework that allows for the possibility that rational agents may hold intrinsic preferences for autonomy in decision making and experience disutility from being monitored. Using a dynamic model of preference formation, we identify conditions under which the principal-agent model is self-activating in that, over time, the introduction of the model in an otherwise efficient monitor-worker relationship leads to the inefficient adoption of the agency model. We also examine the extent to which the agency model is robust when autonomy-preferring agents are introduced into the population.

Recent accounting scandals have brought focus on the role of management in financial statement manipulation. This focus on micro-behavior does not capture the complexities of earnings management. Taking an institutional rather than agency theory approach, earnings management is posited as a decoupled behavior. A behavior that results from not only agency-based motivations of self-interests, but also regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive legitimacy pressures. Conformity to the central logic of "maximizing shareholder value" found in the "US financial market" institutional field provides the context in which to explore earnings management as a decoupled behavior. Insights for earnings management include the blending of agency and institutional theory perspectives to gain a more complete understanding of the behavior and the positing of a continuum of earnings management conducive to this merger. Institutional theory benefits from exploring the nesting in multiple institutional fields. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Purpose - The purpose of the study is to explore the board of directors in leveraged buyouts (LBOs) as a distinct source of value creation and to conceptually investigate the going-private transaction via LBO as a response to deficient governance structures as well as the post-buyout board restructuring. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a review of the literature on LBOs boards, and relies on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to develop testable propositions. The work suggests that the board as a particular source of efficiency gains in LBOs warrants further empirical research. Research limitations/implications - The paper gives strong credence to the argument that boards represent a unique source of value creation in LBOs. Previous agency-theoretic work is complemented by focusing on the monitoring function of the board, but resource dependence theory introduced to suggest the importance of a strategic service and support function. The work is conceptual in nature and thus requires subsequent empirical testing to verify assertions set forth in this study. Practical implications - The paper shows that incentives of managerial equity participation and the discipline of debt are gradually losing their distinctiveness in today's buyout industry. To compete in an increasingly crowded environment, LBO specialists need to identify new sources of value to generate attractive returns for their investors. Originality/value - The paper extends the existing LBO literature by introducing resource dependent as a complementary framework. Given that the traditional LBO literature examines the discipline of debt and managerial ownership that explain their efficiencies, the role of LBO boards as a distinct value creation mechanism in buyouts is introduced.

The objective of this paper is to provide a more comprehensive view of corporate governance than that considered by the traditional agency literature predominately employed in auditing and accounting studies of governance. Specifically, we discuss three widely recognized additional theoretical perspectives: resource dependence, managerial hegemony, and institutional theory. Resource dependence is developed in the strategic management literature and focuses on the contribution of governance mechanisms as a vehicle to help a firm achieve or further its strategic objectives. In contrast with the agency and resource dependence perspectives which offer a functional view of governance, the managerial hegemony perspective views the board and its attendant committees as being under the control of management and hence could be potentially viewed as dysfunctional from a stakeholder viewpoint. Finally, institutional theory, developed in the sociology of organizations and organizational behavior literatures, suggests that it is necessary to understand the substance of the interactions between different governance parties and how these parties use at times symbolic gestures and activities to maintain their form to all relevant parties. Although the value of using multiple theoretical perspectives with respect to governance has been well recognized in the economics and behavioral literatures, this is the first paper that we are aware of that examines the effect of using alternative theories of governance on auditing issues that are influenced by the governance structure of a firm. In addition, we examine how these theories provide a useful basis for reconciling conflicting findings in the existing agency-based audit-related governance literature. Finally, we provide examples of how these alternative theories provide important new insights to issues in auditing research and practice.

Privatization research lacks an understanding of the scope and nature of informal service delivery relationships between nonprofits and local government. This article reports on a study of local service delivery partnerships in Georgia using survey and interview data. In addition to assessing the frequency of noncontractual partnerships, this study builds on B. Guy Peters's definition of public-private partnerships to delineate the control-formality dimensions of these partnerships more clearly. The agency theory notion that a trade-off occurs between formality and control is also tested. The findings show that most public-private partnerships involving nonprofits are led by government agencies, and they are only weakly collaborative in the sense of shared authority or resources. Often, community norms substitute for formal service agreements. The study concludes with suggestions for further research regarding trust and behavioral norms in public-private partnerships.

Peer monitoring, which occurs when individuals notice and respond to their peers' behavior or performance results, is an informal organizational control that has not been extensively studied. Agency theory suggests that peer monitoring should be associated with higher performance because it allows workers whose interests are aligned with those of the organization to encourage their peers to perform well and deters inappropriate behavior by increasing the chances that it would be detected. This paper considers two research questions. The first is, "What is peer monitoring?" We found two types of peer monitoring. Direct peer monitoring occurs when workers notice their peers' behavior or results and respond in a forthright way, such as correcting coworkers who make mistakes. Indirect peer monitoring occurs when workers gossip about or avoid poorly performing peers. The second research question is, "Is peer monitoring associated with higher work-unit performance?" We examined the effects of both types of peer monitoring on the performance of 67 theme park work units. We considered supervisory monitoring, task interdependence, and cohesiveness as moderators. We measured performance as the degree to which the work unit is free of employee behavior problems and found a positive main effect of direct peer monitoring. The effect was stronger when supervisory monitoring was low or task interdependence was high. Indirect peer monitoring did not have a main effect on work-unit performance, but when supervisory monitoring or cohesiveness was high, indirect peer monitoring was associated with lower performance. We discuss these results and suggest areas for future research. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

Foreign firms from emergent economies are increasingly seeking equity capital in developed economies like the United States. Utilizing institutional, signaling, and agency theories this research examines the legitimacy of foreign IPOs (initial public offerings) in the United States. Employing the population of foreign IPOs listed on U.S. stock exchanges between 1997 and 2004, it is demonstrated that firms from countries with governmental policies and institutional practices that protect the economic freedom of its citizens are significantly less underpriced than IPOs of firms originating from countries experiencing lower levels of economic freedom. The evidence further indicates that firms from emerging economies can overcome negative country perceptions associated with lower levels of legitimacy by increasing their international scope of operations prior to beginning the IPO process as well as by retaining acceptable levels of ownership in their respective firms.

This paper deals with different organisational forms of collaborative procurement and provides insight into when to use which form. Different forms from the literature are compared with empirical examples to give an overview of forms, which are then described in terms of strategy, skills and organisation. Whilst acknowledging variations, the paper distinguishes between two main forms: virtual networks and third-party organisations. Using empirical data and four theoretical perspectives (transaction cost economics, resource-based view, contingency theory, agency theory), the paper reflects on when which form can be used and presents an overall framework to help choose an organisational form.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue The relationship between board members and top executives is held central to corporate governance, yet studies of it are relatively few and our knowledge of its consequences is limited. This study aims to address how board-CEO relationships, in terms of power balance and social ties, contribute to the performance of new product introduction. It proposes a contingency view to highlight the context-dependent nature of such governance arrangements. Research Findings/Results Using survey and archival data in a sample of 198 industrial firms in Taiwan, this research finds that the two distinct types of board-CEO relationships relate curvilinearly to the performance of new product introduction. Furthermore, such universal relationships are moderated by market instability and board interlocks, respectively. Theoretical Implications: This study departs from the traditional agency view to an argument that fine-tuned board-CEO relationships, in light of sociopolitical and sociopsychological forces, and will serve as an essential enabling context for managerial risk taking. It demonstrates that research in this field should accommodate different theories to elaborate on the underlying tensions in the corporate governance and emphasize the merits of complementarity. Practical Implications: Acknowledging that good governance design softens managerial risk aversion, this study helps identify the governance conditions in which risk differentials between the board and CEO may align, and thus when exploratory efforts, in the form of new product introduction, are more likely to succeed.

In this paper I first review the basic tenets of agency theory and theory of managerial capitalism as well as some of the major research in these areas then suggest for areas for future research that go beyond the extant empirical work. First, I suggest that it would be useful to reconsider the basic nature of the agency relationship, taking into account that while equity holders can be considered the principal, the board of directors may be more realistically in need of agent-like controls. Second, the complementary or supplementary nature of the monitoring/incentive alignment relationship has been shown theoretically but the empirical evidence is equivocal and needs future investigation. Third, there has been very limited research on the construct validity of archival measures of the sort used in agency theory. This requires the use of methodologies outside those of the more conventional type used in agency theory (i.e., from economics and finance). Finally, agency theory development would profit greatly by more extensive use of research methods such as laboratory studies and survey methodology and the integration of concepts such as personality and control processes.

Achieving competitive advantage through a broader consideration of stakeholders of the firm is examined. The inclusion of other significant organisational actors such as managers and employees as stakeholders capable of creating competitive strategic advantage for the firm is considered. Findings indicate that competitive advantage within an economic perspective may be garnered by establishing a broader conceptualisation of stakeholders of the firm. It is concluded employees may be characterised as hybrid stakeholders, as they are a mix of residual risk bearers and input suppliers of strategically highly relevant resources and that ways of articulating employee voice is a key element of gaining competitive advantage. The aim of this paper is to analyse internationally operating modern public corporations from an agency theory point of view with the focus on the role of a suite of stakeholders including shareholders, managers and employees. The economic reasoning demonstrates that the employees' voice is an important component of business from a strategic perspective irrespective of the type of institutional environment present in any given country.

We examine the effect of non-mandatory corporate governance practices on a comprehensive set of audit judgments. We provide initial evidence on how auditors respond to corporate governance in an institutional environment where corporate governance is not mandated by law. Based on the agency and resource dependence theories, we hypothesise associations between corporate governance and auditors' judgments relating to client acceptance, risk assessments, and the extent and timing of substantive testing. Sixty Big 4 audit managers from Singapore are randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions comprising weak, moderate and strong corporate governance. Our results show auditors make more favourable client acceptance judgments when corporate governance is stronger. Clients with stronger corporate governance are assessed as having lower control environment risk. After controlling for control environment risk, we find that stronger corporate governance increases auditors' reliance on the client's internal controls and reduces the extent of substantive tests. When corporate governance is stronger, we observe that auditors conduct more substantive testing during the interim period compared to the year-end. Our findings suggest that audit strategies are responsive to the strength of a client's corporate governance.

Purpose - This paper aims at re-examining the predictions of agency theory with regard to the negative association between CEO duality (i.e. the Chief Executive Officer, CEO, serves also as the board chairman) and corporate performance. It also examines the role of other corporate governance mechanisms (board size, top managerial ownership and institutional ownership) as moderating variables in the relationship between CEO duality and corporate performance. Methodology/approach - This paper uses the financial statements for the year 2006 of most actively traded Egyptian companies to examine these predictions of agency theory. Moderated Regression Analysis is used to analyse the empirical data.

Agency theory has been the dominant framework for a theoretical conceptualization of corporate governance. According to this view, the governance problem of uncertainty about managerial behavior can be solved by assuming opportunistic behavior and setting up governance mechanisms to curtail opportunism. However, the adequacy of agency theory has recently been challenged because distrust-based governance mechanisms that are in line with the theory's recommendations have been ineffective to avoid managerial misconduct. Moreover, agency-based control and incentive systems have even been accused of being harmful. Stewardship theory has been proposed as an alternative approach. Building on a contrasting assumption about managerial behavior, this approach recommends trust-based governance designs that may, however, result in a one-sided and potentially disadvantageous system, too. On the basis of an in-depth analysis and critique of both theories this paper explores ways to either separate or combine the rival approaches. Due to shortcomings of these strategies a new perspective for the design of corporate governance systems is presented that opens the possibility of overcoming the theoretical tension.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual. Research Question/Issue: Post-acquisition director turnover is a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that needs to be examined beyond the agency lens. In this article, we examine the likelihood of non-executive director turnover in target firms following an acquisition. Research Findings/Result: Acquisitions present an interesting case where conflict of interests may arise between shareholders and directors. This study proposes that the likelihood of target non-executive director turnover depends on the factors that determine the performance of directors in their monitoring, advisory and social roles pre-acquisition and during the acquisition process. Theoretical Implications: While there are multiple studies examining the likelihood of turnover of executive directors (TMTs) following an acquisition, there is no systematic conceptual research explaining the likelihood of turnover of non-executive directors. We draw on three theoretical perspectives-agency theory, resource-based view and the social capital perspective to comprehensively investigate target non-executive director turnover post-acquisition. We further clarify the boundaries of these theoretical arguments concerning their implications for target non-executive director turnover. Practical Implications: One of the most important tasks for the newly formed firm post-acquisition is to build the new leadership team, including a new board. In view of the important roles directors take on in modern corporations, it is critical to understand how the new board should be constituted and what members of the target firm are more likely to join that new board.

In this paper I distinguish between the justificatory and explanatory roles of theory, and propose that the justificatory role played in the literature thus far by agency theory is subject to limitations. I therefore argue for the use of resource-dependence theory as the epistemological basis of the corporate governance domain knowledge system, and present an alternate model of corporate governance. Potential contributions of this alternate model are discussed.

In this article we analyse how board characteristics influence firm innovation. Firm innovation refers to basic innovation and entrepreneurial activities internal to a firm, such as the firm emphasis on new product development, innovation technology, and R&D investments. Drawing on agency theory, we developed hypotheses on specific board structural characteristics - i.e. board size, outsider ratio, directors' shareholdings, and CEO duality - and firm innovation. We tested our model on a sample of 301 large manufacturing Italian companies. We find support for our argument that - contrary to predictions of agency theory on CEO ownership - directors' shareholdings negatively influence firm propensity to innovate. Our results also suggest that board size may play a role in shaping firm propensity toward innovation.

Theory is fundamental to how we understand the empirical world, and cases present a wonderful opportunity to both learn from and challenge current theory. The author juxtaposes the specifics of the case of the Polish-based restaurant operator with current franchising theory to offer two propositions. The first, grounded in the dominant agency theory, suggests that franchising allows a company to expand without the expense of the personnel necessary to operate international units. The other, based on an emerging symbiosis perspective, proposes that franchisor and franchisee need each other to adapt an already successful operating system for the new home market. One possible reason that the Polish franchise failed may be based on inadequate autonomy allowed the Polish franchisee. (c) 2008 Cornell University.

Companies are increasingly sourcing services from third party providers on a global level. Nevertheless, the academic research on phenomena such as offshoring, international purchasing and the sourcing of certain specific categories is still scarce. Lydia Bals provides terminological clarity regarding the field of offshoring. She identifies different types of offshoring, concluding that the buy option of offshore outsourcing versus hybrid or make options is directly related to purchasing. Her in-depth analysis specifically focuses on the sourcing of marketing services. In this context, the investigations of purchasing/marketing integration provide a conceptual model of barriers to purchasing involvement in sourcing of services. Moreover, the author seeks to shed light on issues of providing incentives for advertising agencies from an agency theory perspective. The case study illustrates that the measures taken against an initially problematic situation in the purchase of advertising agency services correspond with the theoretically identified solution mechanisms.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: This review examines how gender diversity on corporate boards influences corporate governance outcomes that in turn impact performance. We describe extant research on theoretical perspectives, characteristics, and impact of women on corporate boards (WOCB) at micro, meso, and macro levels: individual, board, firm, and industry/environment. Research Finding/Results: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of WOCBs, incorporating and integrating research from over 400 publications in psychology, sociology, leadership, gender, finance, management, law, corporate governance, and entrepreneurship domains. In addition, we organized our findings to provide a new lens enabling the field to be readily examined by level and by theoretical perspective. The review indicates that WOCB research is about improving corporate governance through better use of the whole talent pool's capital, as well as about building more inclusive and fairer business institutions that better reflect their present generation of stakeholders. Theoretical Implications: With only one in 10 papers addressing theoretical development, the predominant perspectives are human and social capital theories and gender schema at the individual level; social identity, token, and social networks theories at board level; resource dependency, institution, and agency theories at the firm level; and institutional, critical, and political theories at the environmental level. We provide a short synopsis of findings at each level, and conclude with an outline of fruitful directions for future research. Practical Implications: There are increasing pressures for WOCBs from diverse stakeholders, such as the European Commission, national governments, politicians, employer lobby groups, shareholders, Fortune and FTSE rankings, best places for women to work lists, as well as expectations from highly qualified women who are likely to leave if they see no women board members. Rationales generally draw on the business case; however, the moral justice case is also used by those who seek a fairer gender balance in all aspects of society. From our review, the "Impact" section charts the effect of WOCB at all four levels of analysis. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the relationship between internal governance structures and financial performance of Indian companies. The effectiveness of boards of directors, including board composition, board size, and aspects of board leadership including duality and board busyness are addressed in the Indian context using two theories of corporate governance: agency theory and resource dependency theory. Research Findings/Insights: The study used a sample of top Indian companies taking into account the endogeneity of the relationships among corporate governance, corporate performance, and corporate capital structure. The study provides some support for aspects of agency theory as a greater proportion of outside directors on boards were associated with improved firm performance. The notion of separating leadership roles in a manner consistent with agency theory was not supported. For instance, the notion that powerful CEOs (duality role, CEO being the promoter, and CEO being the only board manager) have a detrimental effect on performance was not supported. There was some support for resource dependency theory. The findings suggest that larger board size has a positive impact on performance thus supporting the view that greater exposure to the external environment improves access to various resources and thus positively impacts on performance. The study however failed to support the resource dependency theory in terms of the association between frequency of board meetings and performance. Similarly the results showed that outside directors with multiple appointments appeared to have a negative effect on performance, suggesting that "busyness" did not add value in terms of networks and enhancement of resource accessibility. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The two theories of corporate governance, namely agency and resource dependence theory, were each only partially supported, by the findings of this study. The findings add further to the view that no single theory explains the nexus between corporate governance and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study demonstrates that corporate governance measures utilized in developed economies related to boards of directors have some synergies and relevance to emerging economies, such as India. However, the nature of business structures in India, for example the large number of family businesses, may limit the generalizability of the findings and signals the need for further investigation of these businesses. The evidence related to multiple appointments of directors suggests that there may be support for restricting the number of directorships held by any one individual in emerging economies, given that the "busyness" of directors was negatively associated with firm performance.

Family businesses (FBs) play a key role in the world's economies. Unfortunately, the current literature surfaces disparate understandings and conclusions concerning their conduct and performance. Much of that literature falls under two insightful perspectives, agency theory and stewardship theory, that conflict quite directly. The agency view, based in economics, maintains that families will pursue utility for themselves to the detriment of their public shareholders. By contrast, stewardship proponents, arguing from a psychological perspective, suggest that family owners will invest deeply in their enterprise, to the benefit of all. This study synthesizes the literature on each of these perspectives to derive core motivational assumptions and expected organizational outcomes. Then, by employing a third sociological perspective, it proposes to reconcile these opposing views by considering the social embeddedness of firms and their key actors within the institution of the family for different types of public family enterprises. It will argue that there is a need for such integration in order to better understand and permit accurate, context-based predictions across various kinds of family businesses and family business situations.

Using takeover protection as an indicator of corporate governance, this study examines how an exogenous shift in power from shareholders to managers affects corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Two competing hypotheses are entertained. The shareholder view predicts that stronger takeover protection will lead to a decrease in corporate attention to shareholders and non-shareholding stakeholders alike, as managers divert resources from share-holders to the pursuit of their private interests. The stakeholder view, in contrast, predicts that stronger takeover protection will increase corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Because catering to non-shareholding stakeholders contributes to the long-term value of the firm, managers will be more likely to attend to those stakeholders when relieved from short-termism triggered by the threat of hostile takeovers. Using a sample of 878 U.S. firms from 1991 to 2002, the study finds that an exogenous increase in takeover protection leads to higher corporate attention to community and the natural environment, but has no impact on corporate attention to employees, minorities, and customers. Additional analyses show that firms that increase their attention to stakeholders experience an increase in long-term shareholder value. These findings provide additional evidence that relief from short-termism is a likely source of the increase in corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders following the increase in takeover protection.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

Manuscript Type: Editorial Research Question/Issue: This essay identifies some key issues for the analysis of corporate governance based on the articles within this special review issue coupled with our own perspectives. Our aim in this issue is to distil some research streams in the field and identify opportunities for future research. Research Findings/Results: We summarize the eight papers included in this special issue and briefly highlight their main contributions to the literature which collectively deal with the role and impact of corporate boards, codes of corporate governance, and the globalization of corporate governance systems. In addition to the new insights offered by these reviews, we attempt to offer our own ideas on where future research needs to be targeted. Theoretical Implications: We highlight a number of research themes where future governance research may prove fruitful. This includes taking a more holistic approach to corporate governance issues and developing an inter-disciplinary perspective by building on agency theory while considering the rich new insights offered by complementary theories, such as behavioral theory, institutional theory and the resource-based views of the firm. In particular, future corporate governance research needs to be conducted in multiple countries, particularly in emerging economies, if we want to move closer to the journal's aim of producing a global theory of corporate governance. Practical Implications: Our analysis suggests that analytic and regulatory approaches to corporate governance issues should move from a "one-size-fits-all" template to taking into account organizational, institutional and national contexts.

Agency theory posits that the greater degree of control by those with decision-making authority, the greater the overall organizational performance. Conversely, entrenchment theory implies that at extremely high levels of inside control by those with decision authority, organizational performance decreases. Using a nationwide sample of 2,631 privately held and publically traded family businesses, we examined if the relationship of percent family ownership is an agency or entrenchment relationship and found the latter. Specifically, there was a statistically significant negative relationship between percent of family control and sales growth as well as a strong inverse relationship between percent of family controlling the top management team and all measures of financial performance.

The use of agency theory remains highly controversial among business ethicists. While some regard it as an essential tool for analyzing and understanding the recent spate of corporate ethics scandals, others argue that these scandals might not even have occurred had it not been for the widespread teaching of agency theory in business schools. This paper presents a qualified defense of agency theory against these charges, first by identifying the theoretical commitments that are essential to the theory (in order to distinguish between agency theory itself and certain incorrect interpretations that have been widely promulgated), and second, by specifying more clearly the different ways that agency theory can be used to analyze relations within the firm. The recommendation that follows from this analysis is that agency theory be used as a critical-diagnostic tool, to identify the points at which both firms and markets will be vulnerable to breakdown in the absence of moral constraint.

Manuscript type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper examines the relationships between initial public offering (IPO) underpricing, CEO duality, and strategic ownership in 12 Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Research Findings/Results: Using all IPOs from January 2000 until the end of July 2007, we document an average IPO underpricing of 184.1 per cent. Underpricing is higher in IPO firms that have CEO duality. However, strategic shareholders, such as corporations and other industry-related investors, are likely to play a monitoring role whereas underpricing is found to be lower in firms with both CEO duality and strategic shareholder ownership. Moreover, the negative relation between underpricing and strategic blockholding is greater for foreign strategic ownership than it is for domestic strategic ownership. Theoretical Implications: This paper examines the level and determinants of IPO underpricing in the MENA region. It provides evidence on the role played by foreign strategic owners in reducing agency conflicts and information asymmetries within an environment where firms may be affected by the cultural issues related to political ties and family involvement. Practical Implications: Our results contribute to the existing debate on the appropriate regulations for an effective and stable financial system in Arab countries. They offer policy-makers additional evidence on the positive impact of market openness to foreign shareholders. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose The goal of this paper is to provide a broad foundation for future research in the area of strategic sourcing. Design/methodology/approach The foundation is derived by drawing from various wellestablished organizational theories. Specifically, strategic sourcing was viewed from the perspective of institutional theory, resource dependence theory, network theory, systems theory, resource/knowledgebased views of the firm, transaction cost economics, agency theory, strategic choice theory, sociocognitive theory, and critical theory. Findings By viewing strategic sourcing through the lens of ten organizational theories, this research provides multiple insights into many interrelated strategic sourcing questions, such as when to make, buy or ally, how many and which suppliers, and how to manage sourcing relationships. The paper offers a rich and diverse foundation to foster future theorybuilding activities in sourcing and supply management research. Originality/value While some of these theory bases have been utilized, to some degree, in the supply management research, the paper offers a more holistic perspective of theoretical insights for strategic sourcing. Each of these organizational theories could be utilized as a foundation for future studies. Further, the paper offers competing and/or complementary theory bases to enhance possible insights into many strategic sourcing questions such as when to make, buy or ally.

We use agency theory to predict the influence of related and unrelated product diversification on a firm's level of debt financing. Further, we argue that the link between diversification and capital structure is moderated by the environment in which firms operate. Using SAS PROC MIXED, we fit a mixed-effects model to our unique six-year longitudinal dataset (1995-2000) of 245 publicly listed Singapore firms. Our data spans the period of the Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998). We find that firms pursuing unrelated product diversification take on less debt financing in stable environments, but more debt financing in dynamic environments. Using longitudinal structural equation modeling, we find a reciprocal relationship between a firm's product diversification strategy and its debt financing level. (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Entrepreneurs with firm-specific human capital represent both a potential source of competitive advantage and a threat to appropriate the rents that are ultimately generated by a new venture. This situation presents interesting agency and resource dependence challenges. While potential investors in these ventures will want assurances that their interests are protected, they will also want to ensure that these key entrepreneurs remain with the organization. Using agency theory and resource dependence theory, we examine the types of governance mechanisms that are implemented in firms going through an initial public offering comparing those ventures which indicate a dependence on these critical entrepreneurs versus those that do not. Our analysis reveals that ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs are associated with higher insider and outsider ownership by the board, greater start-up experience by the board, greater use of contingent compensation, and greater use of involuntary departure agreements.

This study investigates the relations of board structure, ownership concentration, and ownership type with the performance of banks operating in Turkey from an agency theory and resource-dependency perspective. We use financial ratios and established measures of board characteristics and ownership structure. Our results indicate that board size and duality do not significantly influence the returns on assets of Turkish banks. On the other hand, the tenure of board members is negatively related to performance. Our analysis of board composition reveals a curvilinear relationship with banks' performance, implying that boards composed of a majority of either insiders or outsiders enjoy high performance. Also, ownership concentration and ownership type do not influence firm performance. The results of the financial variables are robust in all models. Copyright (c) 2009 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

We propose a research agenda that can assist in developing a dynamic and comprehensive theory of boards of directors. It is based upon the concept of temporality, with time being organised around the life-cycle metaphor, and integrates research on agency theory, decision-making theory and resource dependence theory. We identify three key roles of boards of directors: 1) Monitoring and controlling top management 2) Involvement in strategic decision-making; and 3) Providing access to resources and networks. Our analysis suggests that boards perform all three roles, but that these roles change over time. We propose clear researchable questions for each stage of the organisational life cycle as well as the transition between the stages.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether anti-director laws and legal director liability rules affect the diligence of directors in setting the compensation of CEOs. The study uses a world-wide data set covering 27 countries for the period 1995 to 2005. Research Findings/Results: Controlling for a number of legal and economic determinants, we find that independent of managerial risk-aversion, CEO pay is always less generous under stricter anti-director rules and a stronger rule of law. Director liability rules are associated with more generous pay schemes. The results persist once we control for the presence of institutional investors and cross-listing in the US. Theoretical Implications: Our results suggest that there exists an agency conflict between shareholders and outside directors reflected in the degree to which directors act diligently when negotiating the pay contract with the CEO. However, this conflict may be alleviated by specific legal rules making boards more accountable to shareholders. Private measures of shareholder protection do not seem entirely capable of substituting for legal institutions. Practical Implications: Reducing managerial agency cost is commonly viewed as a desirable policy goal. We advocate the view that specific legal institutions that strengthen procedural rights of shareholders' voting on directors and the overall quality of the legal system help to achieve this goal. Director liability rules, however, appear to be ineffective for this purpose. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - The importance of top management commitment for the success of major change initiatives has been emphasized in the literature, while the role of boards of directors (the board) has been in less focus. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how the boards affect the sustainability of major organizational change. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on three case studies of the diffusion of total quality management (TQM), Toyota production system (TPS), and lean production (LP). Findings from these case studies are then compared to literature on management and organization and corporate governance. Findings - A TQM/TPS/LP transformation is a longterm process. In the case studies, top management commitment is crucial for the sustainability of the implemented change programs. However, a committed top management does not "last forever." The issue of sustaining change therefore falls back on the governance structure. If the board does not understand the essence of an organizational change, the risk is that top management is replaced with new leaders, who are given new directions by the board. Issues identified as important in order to create board commitment for sustainability of major organizational change are: board competence and experience, board meeting dynamics, board as a provider of critical resources, and the process of replacement of chief executive officers. The dominating agency theory within corporate governance also needs to be questioned and complemented by more recent theories such as the stewardship and the resourcedependence theories. Originality/value - This paper provides insights into the board's role in sustaining major organizational change. (c) 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

This paper analyzes the role of compensation methods in the process of fostering corporate entrepreneurship. Drawing on agency theory and expectancy theory, hypotheses relating compensation methods to employees' entrepreneurial behavior are empirically examined in the context of defense products firms aiming at encouraging their employees' innovations at the civilian markets. The results show that entrepreneurs prefer compensation that is related to the internal venture's performance. Managers' willingness to take on civilian projects is higher if they are assured that they will be personally compensated for the project's success. Surprisingly, the more entrepreneurial employees preferred staying in the defense market rather than converting to civilian markets. (c) 2009 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the governance structure of the firm undergoing a complete buyout cycle (reverse leveraged buyout). Its purpose is to empirically explore the evolution of corporate board structures as a unique source of value creation, in addition to the agency mechanisms of the discipline of debt and incentives of equity participation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors rely on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to develop sets of hypotheses that examine changes in the board composition of 65 R-LBOs and 65 matched continuing firms spanning a 25-year period (1979-2004). Findings: The empirical results reveal numerous insights about why R-LBOs go private, to what extent boards restructure during the buyout phase, and how those changes relate to firm performance. Taken together, the findings give strong credence to the argument that boards represent a supplemental source of value creation in the buyout process. Research limitations/implications: For scholars, the study presents a platform for further inquiry into the role of boards of directors in R-LBOs as well as the inclusion of resource dependence theory to inform on the phenomenon. Practical implications: The study helps to address this new source of value creation for practical interest. It offers a benchmark for buyout firms to compare their board characteristics by establishing linkages between pre-buyout deficiencies, post-buyout modifications, and post-SIPO performance. Originality/value: The results shift scholarly attention away from the structural governance tools to the group dynamics of the board. The findings call into question the restricted attention given by buyout researchers to leverage and ownership as value drivers by prompting a closer evaluation of the relationship between buyout board structures and related structuring of debt and managerial equity participation. Furthermore, the inclusion of the resource-dependency perspective alongside agency theory as an explanatory theory allows for a richer account of the LBO phenomenon and its sources of value creation.

During the 1980s and 1990s the argument that "maximizing shareholder value" results in superior economic performance came to dominate the corporate governance debates. In this paper, I outline the rationale for the shareholder-value perspective, and show that, rooted in agency theory, it lacks a theory of innovative enterprise. Hence it cannot be used to analyze the conditions under which the stock market supports or undermines the process of value-creation. To go beyond agency theory and its shareholdervalue perspective, I present a framework for analyzing the functions of the stock market in the business corporation and the influence of these functions on the social conditions of innovative enterprise. I then use this framework to explain why in the United States since the 1990s there has been a widespread trend in corporate stock repurchases, including a sharp acceleration in buybacks since 2003. Focusing on a list of the largest corporate repurchasers in the United States, I raise questions concerning the relation between stock buybacks and value-creating investments in the US economy as a whole. I conclude with a discussion of why companies do stock repurchases, and in particular whether they can be justified as a contribution to innovative enterprise. I argue that the ultimate justification for stock repurchases is the ideology of "maximizing shareholder value" - an ideology that works to the direct benefit of corporate executives who make corporate resource allocation decisions and who derive high levels of remuneration from munificent stock option awards.

This paper examines the relationship between corporate governance characteristics and corporate financial distress. There are two main theoretical factors of interest: the structure of the monitoring process, and the personal characteristics of non-executive directors (NEDs). The first approach is basically agency-theory oriented, and emphasises relationships that complicate proper control, such as dependents on the board (Jensen, 1993). The second approach refers to the resource dependency theory, which focuses on the quality of the director(s) involved (Hillman and Dalziel (2003). The relevant relationships are tested on a newly built database consisting of 52 listed companies in the Netherlands that became financially distressed in the period from 1993 to 2003 and a control sample of 167 listed companies. We collected data on NEDs such as age, education, dependency, other board positions (and chairmanships), workload, and the number of executive and non-executive board members. A positive relationship with financial distress was found to exist if the average workload of NEDs on the board was high, or if there was a foreigner on the board. If one of the NEDs has inside knowledge, this is negatively related to financial distress. As a final conclusion, the hypothesis originating in resource dependency theory, which is that the human characteristics of NEDs are important in avoiding financial distress, cannot be rejected with regard to the Netherlands as examined in the period from 1993 to 2003.

Corporate Governance relationships has become more relevant to the changed nature of the firm, the role of human capital has become very important in managing the firm in those environments where the source of competitive advantage is strongly based on knowledge and intangible resources as in the case of complex product systems industries. The important role of this intangible asset in managing the complex environment has amplified the incompleteness of the agency theory, changing the nature of the Corporate Governance relationships and highlighting the role of the human capital. This paper attempts to describe, using Problem Solving Behaviour approach, how the Corporate Governance relationships work in high competitive and complex environments as in case of the business aviation industry.

The implementation of teamwork has been growing steadily in the last decade. Companies suppose that the use of teams improves their performance and supports the achievement of their strategic goals. The high relevance of teams in the business world is reflected by an increasing literature on teamwork, team success and the management of teams. One central question concerning the management of teams is the design of pay systems, especially of performance-based pay systems for teams. This aspect has not yet been fully explored in the literature with regard to the agency problems that are associated with managing teams and teamwork. This paper aims to close that gap by exploring how performance-based pay systems for teams should be designed from an expanded agency theory perspective with regard to possibly arising agency problems.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: We examine the business case for the inclusion of women and ethnic minority directors on the board. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the number of women directors and the number of ethnic minority directors on the board and important board committees and financial performance measured as return on assets and Tobin's Q. Research Findings/Insights: We do not find a significant relationship between the gender or ethnic diversity of the board, or important board committees, and financial performance for a sample of major US corporations. Our evidence also suggests that the gender and ethnic minority diversity of the board and firm financial performance appear to be endogenous. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Reasonable theoretical arguments drawn from resource dependence theory, human capital theory, agency theory, and social psychology suggest that gender and ethnic diversity may have either a positive, negative, or neutral effect on the financial performance of the firm. Our statistical analysis supports the theoretical position of no effect, either positive or negative. Our results are consistent with a contingency explanation because the effect of the gender and ethnic diversity of the board may be different under different circumstances at different times. Over several companies and time periods, the results could offset to produce no effect. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The results of our analysis do not support the business case for inclusion of women and ethnic minorities on corporate boards. However, we find no evidence of any negative effect either. Our evidence implies that decisions concerning the appointment of women and ethnic minorities to corporate boards should be based on criteria other than future financial performance.

In this study, we view the contracts of top managers from an integrated agency theory-trust perspective, arguing that two conditions reflecting CEO risk bearing, top management team (TMT) behavioral uncertainty and CEO vulnerability, are negatively related to a CEO's perceptions of TMT benevolence toward him-/herself, which in turn influence the protective features of TMT contracts. Model tests on data from 122 family-owned firms in Spain support our hypotheses overall. Agency theory may be enhanced by accounting for a CEO's perceptions (as principal) of TMT benevolence and for the effect of those perceptions on contracts with TMT members (as agents).

This paper focuses on talent management failure by multinational enterprises (MNEs). It examines barriers to corporate advancement of talents located in subsidiaries and more specifically on promotion of talent already employed by the MNE to be part of the upper echelon management team at its centre. Drawing on agency and bounded rationality theories, we discuss the underlying causes of talent management failure in MNEs. At the subsidiary level, we draw on agency theory to delineate self-serving mechanisms displayed by subsidiary managers that might hinder effective talent management systems throughout the MNE. At the headquarter level, we use bounded rationality to explain how decision-making processes, and information top management teams use to make decisions about talent management results in overlooking talents at subsidiary level.

We argue that executives can affect firm outcomes only if they have influence over crucial decisions. This study explores the impact of CEO power or CEO dominance on bond ratings and yield spreads. We find that credit ratings are lower and yield spreads higher for firms whose CEOs have more decision-making power. To further investigate why bondholders are concerned about CEO power, we show that powerful CEOs tend to maintain an opaque information environment. Bondholders demand higher yields because it is difficult for them to monitor managers in firms with powerful CEOs. Taken together, the results suggest that bondholders perceive CEO power as a critical determinant of the cost of bond financing. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

There is a commonly held conviction among governance scholars and practitioners that increasing the number of non-executive directors may have beneficial effects on board practices. This view has gained momentum after each wave of scandals. Given the relevance of the issue in governance studies and practices, the aim of this paper is to investigate how independent, competent and incentivized non-executive directors should be according to governance scholars and board best practices. To answer this question, we conducted a review of the literature on non-executive directors. We then collected corporate governance codes developed worldwide at the end of 2005, and made a comparative analysis of their recommendations about the independence, the competencies and the incentives of non-executive directors. Our results show that (i) non-executive directors' independence is a commonly recommended governance practice, the meaning of which differs widely among countries; (ii) non-executive directors' competencies and incentives are not considered a governance issue to be regulated in detail; (iii) agency theory and the search for appropriate board demography tend to dominate the recommendations of governance literature and codes. Our findings have implications for both research and practice. (c) 2009 British Academy of Management.

We study the relation between stability of the nonprofit organization's environment and its board structure and the impact of this relation on organizational performance from the perspectives of both Agency Theory and Resource Dependence (Boundary Spanning) Theory. The impact of board characteristics on organizational performance is contextual. Specifically, we predict and show for a sample of U.S. nonprofits that board mechanisms related to monitoring are more likely to be effective for stable organizations, whereas board mechanisms related to boundary spanning are more effective for less stable organizations. We find that the two theories are complementary and address different aspects of nonprofit performance, but the results are statistically stronger and more often consistent with resource dependence than with agency theory. Overall, this study supports Miller-Millesen's (Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 32: 521-547 2003) contention that, because the nonprofit environment is often more complex and heterogeneous than the for-profit world, no one theory describes all tasks of nonprofit boards.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: This study examines the influence of firms' ownership structure on corporate reputation. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a panel of firms in Spain for 2000-2007, we found that ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholder erodes corporate reputation, whereas contestability of the main shareholder's power enhances it. Insider ownership shows a non-linear relationship with corporate reputation, with lower corporate reputation at low and very high levels of insider ownership. Finally, if the largest shareholder is either a pressure-resistant or a pressure-sensitive institutional investor, as opposed to other types of largest shareholder, corporate reputation is lower. This last finding markedly differentiates our sample of firms in Spain, a civil law country, from firms in common law countries such as the US and the UK, where studies have found a positive relationship between institutional investors and corporate reputation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Drawing on signaling and agency theories, our paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to analyze the influence of ownership structure on corporate reputation in civil law countries. Practitioners/Policy Implications: This study suggests that managers and directors should recognize how each characteristic of ownership structure influences the expectations of stakeholders. Low levels of ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholders, low differences in ownership concentration between first and second largest shareholders, and moderate levels of insider ownership are positive signals that should be communicated to foster corporate reputation. High levels of ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholders or high differences in ownership concentration between first and second largest shareholders impair corporate reputation and should be compensated by introducing corporate governance mechanisms that favor corporate reputation, such as increasing the number of independent directors or avoiding CEO duality.

It has been argued by researchers that agency theory has limitations as the underpinning theory for governance given its inability to recognize the wider environmental influencing forces impacting on organizations. This paper provides a case for incorporating a number of management-based theories to augment agency theory in recognizing these wider environmental influencing forces and the consequent extended governance paradigm it creates. Through a theory building approach that reviews and critically analyses the extant literature, a case is built to integrate four existing theories that complement each other to recognize these wider influencing forces. The paper argues that the proposed approach will narrow the theoretical practical gap in governance and will consequently have policy implications on governance guidelines. Further research is suggested to validate the approach with a wide range of real life organizational settings. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This article discusses how organizations exchange with one another in China, focusing on the type of organizational ownership and the form of governance mechanism. The theoretical foundation builds on institutional theory, resource dependence theory, agency theory, and evolutionary theory. Given the three main forms of organizations in China - state-owned enterprises, privately owned enterprises, and foreign-invested enterprises - we show how these organizations choose between two types of governance mechanisms, contracts and guanxi, to manage interorganizational exchanges. We then analyze the possible modes of interaction between organizational forms. We argue that the relative importance of guanxi is likely to decline or that guanxi will shift from being primary in some organizations to complementary in all organizations with the progress of market transition. This conceptual framework is expected to help provide the momentum for further theoretical exploration and empirical study in this area. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

We critique transformational leadership education in university business schools based on a literature review, a study of the websites of 21 leading business schools, and an analysis of two presentations to business school students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University by the former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. Our critique draws attention to the unresolved tension between two motivating ideas that underpin much teaching in business schools: collective interest ideas that permeate transformational leadership education; and self-interest ideas derived from agency theory. Transformational leadership tends to be depicted as a process by which leaders exert a 'top-down' influence over the activities of others, while simultaneously asserting that their organizations have a common purpose and pursue a collective interest. We highlight the risk that business schools are producing graduates who will attempt to appeal to common needs (guided by precepts of transformational leadership) but who will simultaneously enact contradictory performance management systems (guided by agency theory). We encourage business school educators in leadership to adopt approaches which are more critical, relational and reflexive. We suggest some general directions for an alternative leadership prospectus, based on followership, the promotion of critical upward communication within organizations, and the recognition of leadership as a contested, discursive and co-constructed phenomenon.

Combining a behavioral agency perspective with research on multiple-agency conflicts, this article examines factors affecting the implementation of equity-based incentive schemes in initial public offerings (IPOs). With a unique sample of U.K. IPO companies between the years 1998 and 2002, it shows that conditional (performance-related) incentive schemes are negatively associated with share ownership and board power of the IPO's founding directors. However, the retained ownership of venture capital firms is positively associated with the probability of conditional incentive schemes. Board independence weakly effects on the toughness of executive compensation. The article's interesting findings suggest a number of avenues for a future analysis of the governance development process in threshold firms. (c) 2010 Southern Management Association.

Much of the existing research in corporate governance has been directed at examining the consequences of board leadership structure on various organizational issues, with little to say about the determinants of this structure. By exploring either agency theory or stewardship theory, researchers provide contested conclusions regarding board leadership structure. The underlying premise of both theories is that 'one universal structure fits all'. However, the main argument of this paper is that the appropriate board leadership structure varies with some contextual variables and certain actors in a given environment. Econometric analysis demonstrates that board leadership structure varies with firm size, age and ownership structure. The implication of this result is that the assertion of both agency theory (CEO non-duality structure) and stewardship theory (CEO duality structure) may be valid under certain conditions. Thus, existing theories might need to be treated as complementary viewpoints, each of which draws upon a part of the whole picture, because depending on just one single perspective is more likely to result in misleading conclusions about the structure as a whole.

Due to the significant role of non-profit organizations in the development of modern societies, these organizations must adjust their boardrooms. Since traditional theories of corporate governance appear to be limited in explaining the changing non-profit world, we propose an extended model of governance that integrates the traditional arguments of agency theory with a cognitive dimension. Based on a sample of Spanish foundations, we present evidence on the effect of the board composition on foundations' organizational efficiency. We show that board size and independence do not have a definitive effect on the entity's efficiency. Instead, the knowledge diversity inside the boardroom and the active character of trustees have a positive influence on resource allocation. The cognitive dimension of the extended model of governance is critical to explaining how boards impact on organizational performance. (c) 2009 British Academy of Management.

Our research seeks to develop understanding of the factors explaining venture capital investment managers' attitudes towards investment in the unique context of academic spin-outs. We provide a novel integration of both VC fund characteristics and investment managers' human capital characteristics with a unique hand-collected dataset of 68 early stage VC investment managers in Europe. Attitudes toward academic spin-out investing are positively affected by the presence of public sector capital and by investment managers who are more intensively involved with the entrepreneur. Specific human capital in investment managers who had worked in an academic environment is more likely associated with investment in academic spin-outs. In terms of general human capital, financial experience is positively related while entrepreneurial experience is negatively associated with investment attitude towards academic spin-outs. There may be a need to facilitate the attraction of people from industry and investment banking into public VC funds in particular. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The dominance of agency theory can reduce our collective scope to analyse private equity in all its diversity and depth. We contribute to theorisation of private equity by developing a contrasting perspective that draws on a rich tradition of virtue ethics. In doing so, we juxtapose 'private equity' with 'public good' to develop points of rhetorical and analytical contrast. We develop a typology differentiating various forms of private equity, and focus on the 'take private' form. These takeovers are where private equity funds are used to buy all a firm's publicly listed shares. Take private deals reduce reporting requirements and lessen the amount of public scrutiny a firm comes under. They allow greater control of a firm's assets and resources but also have effects in terms of the wider social fabric. The 'public good' and virtue ethics offer an alternative basis for theorisation of these deals. This provides a needed contrast to accounts of private equity based on agency theory.

We conduct an experiment to examine how lending decisions are affected by lender perceptions of reporting and governance quality. We perform a set of experiments to determine whether lenders are sensitive to the quality of governance as measured by board composition along multiple dimensions, whether their perceptions of reporting reliability are a function of the strength of the board, and whether their lending decisions are then affected by their perceptions of reporting reliability. Study participants are a group of 62 professional lenders from Singapore, with at least three years of professional credit analysis and lending experience. We find that lenders are primarily sensitive to financial condition and the perceived reliability of financial reporting. While we also find that lenders are sensitive to board strength, further tests suggest lenders appear particularly sensitive to board strength only for relatively highperforming firms. We also find that the perceived reliability of the financial reports does not appear to be affected by board strength or by the applicant's financial condition. The paper discusses implications for policy making, practice, and research.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: We examine how various types of shareholder activists (such as pension funds and large blockholders) impact the relative use of equity incentives at the middle management level of the firm and compare this with the impact on CEO incentive alignment. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of 124 US technology firms over the period 1997-2001, we find evidence indicating voice activist shareholders, using communication pressure, are associated with the greater use of equity incentives, and higher total compensation at middle managerial levels, relative to exit activists, who exert economic pressure. The results for CEO equity incentives are similar. We also find that as the presence of institutional ownership siding with management (banks and insurance companies) increases relative to voice activists, the use of equity incentives at middle managerial levels declines. Results for CEO equity incentives are not the same. Theoretical/Academic Implications: In agreement with contingent agency theory, we predict and find evidence of differing governance mechanisms used by voice activists (e.g., public pension funds) and exit activists (e.g., large shareholders). Voice activists face a higher cost of monitoring managers as compared to exit activists, and thus they will advocate for the heavier use of equity incentive compensation at the middle managerial level. In agreement with a managerial power perspective, however, we also find the use of equity incentives for middle managers decreases as the proportion of institutional ownership siding with the CEO increases. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Shareholder activism plays a key role in aligning managerial interests below the CEO level; however, different types of shareholders have different economic and political interests in how equity compensation is shaped to achieve this. Exit activists use monitoring and voice activists substitute equity compensation for monitoring. Shareholders siding with management may also reduce the use of equity incentives for middle managers. These differing interests should be considered in crafting policy responses. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Recent research into the role of boards of directors has adopted a cognitive point of view rather than a traditional governance perspective rooted in agency theory (Charreaux and Wirtz, 2006). The present study examines the structural embeddedness of boards and the influence of networks of boards of directors on the adoption of corporate governance practices. More specifically, it focuses on two aspects of social capital, namely the cohesion between actors within dense and closed networks (Coleman, 1988), and openness within networks containing numerous structural holes (Burt, 1992). The main results of this study emphasize the crucial role of board's network openness in the adoption of corporate governance practices and the importance of the diversity of cognitive resources acquired by boards of directors within their social networks.

In this paper we use agency theory to present a process of the dichotomization of the Israeli workforce into two structures, each representing distinct organizational cultures. The first structure is the private sector, led by the high-tech industry; a model where the principal has strong control over the activities of the agent. The second is the public sector, an opposing model in which the principal has virtually no control over the activities of the agents and as a result, the effectiveness within this sector deteriorates. We argue that such conflicting systems cannot exist side by side without affecting each other and we suggest a role for human resource management (HRM) in future developments. Within the public sector it is the responsibility of the principal, the Israeli government, to gain more control over the agent and employ professional HRM systems for this purpose.

Decades of research on corporate boards of directors resulting in diverse and often inconsistent findings have not dampened scholarly interest in the topic. Instead, researchers are attempting to more effectively model the board-firm relationship. One such modeling approach considers the power of the board in relation to top management. Drawing on upper echelons thinking (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) and the concept of managerial power (Finkelstein, 1992), this conceptual study develops the notion of board power in relation to CEO duality. Based on a framework composed of structural, ownership, expertise, and prestige power of the board, the study develops several propositions predicting the impact of board characteristics on a key aspect of managerial power - the appointment of the CEO to the position of board chair. This work contributes to scholarly understanding of the role of agency theory in explaining corporate governance phenomena by extending upper echelons thinking to the study of boards.

Theoretically, business networks can be defined and characterized based on diverse perspectives, such as sociology, psychology, economics, technology, organizational theories or the field of strategy. This thoughtful article is the result of exploratory research from an analytical-critical perspective of a theoretical nature and proposes a complementary and interdisciplinary theoretical interaction to analyze and characterize business networks, based on theoretical work by different authors on resource dependence theory, transaction costs theory and network theory, in the institutional context of agency theory. The main contribution of this theoretical development is the possibility to analyze not only the structure but also the dynamic of business networks. The proposal includes the conceptual construction of a definition of business networks, a reflection on the impact of the levels of analysis of business networks, and finally the selection and relationship between the variables resulting from the theoretical interaction for their characterization. The theoretical result of this research will make it possible to characterize diverse business networks in any sector in practice.

While the process of pursuing an initial public offering (IPO) provides new capital with which new ventures might pursue significant opportunities, research suggests that many IPO firms decrease in value subsequent to the new offering. Using an agency perspective, we argue that the IPO process itself may not only raise direct governance costs (due to increased monitoring and bonding), but may also create a distraction for managers who need to remain focused on the strategy to effectively use a large infusion of capital from the IPO. Likewise, we argue that governance participants, especially board members, will be distracted by the work necessary to take the firm public and, as such, may not be focused on the strategic monitoring necessary for continued firm's viability. This lack of monitoring may also allow managerial opportunism to be more prevalent, especially given the large amount of capital available to managers once the IPO is completed. Accordingly, we argue that excessive governance costs (both direct and indirect) may be associated with the IPO process and subsequent IPO firm performance.

Modern corporations have been widely accused of promoting values of managerial autonomy that can result in managerial waste and opportunistic behaviour, leading organizational theorists to suggest the adoption of alternative organizational forms that should normatively and structurally limit such autonomy. However, this mixed-methods study of an alternative organizational form - income trusts (1995-2005) - finds that income trusts were also characterized by excessive managerial autonomy. Managers strategically used the income trust form in discretionary ways such as by providing little information on important decisions to external parties, limiting investors' right to oppose managerial actions and retaining firm earnings to a great extent. Thus, the article concludes that alternative organizational forms do not necessarily promote an ethical business culture since they are unable to overcome deeply institutionalized values of managerial autonomy.

The literature on technology innovation adoption and diffusion is vast. In this chapter, we organize and summarize some of the major perspectives from this body of literature, contrasting various theoretical perspectives on how innovations are adopted and shaped by organizational processes and structure. We first introduce the technology acceptance model, and innovation diffusion theory; and then we categorize viewpoints about organizational innovativeness. Drawing from this framework, for our case study background we introduce adaptive structuration theory, redefining some of its conceptual relationships in "structuration agency theory," putting primacy on the actions of agents and the means by which they operate through and around institutional structures. We then present a case study example of an expert decision support system, and we conclude with a discussion of implications for managers and entrepreneurs. (c) 2010, IGI Global.

This study investigates the relationship between strong firm environmental performance and board characteristics that capture boards' monitoring and resource provision abilities during an era when the natural environment and the related strategic opportunities have increased in importance. The authors relate the proxy for strong environmental performance to board characteristics that represent boards' monitoring role (i.e., independence, CEO-chair duality, concentration of directors appointed after the CEO, and director shareholding) and resource provision role (i.e., board size, directors on multiple boards, CEOs of other firms on the board, lawyers on the board, and director tenure). The authors provide evidence consistent with both theories of board roles. Specifically, consistent with their agency theory-driven predictions, the authors find evidence of higher environmental performance in firms with higher board independence and lower concentration of directors appointed after the CEO on the board of directors. Consistent with resource dependence theory, they show that environmental performance is higher in firms that have larger boards, larger representation of active CEOs on the board, and more legal experts on the board. Their findings are generally robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. These findings have implications for managers, firms, shareholders, and regulators who act on behalf of shareholders, if they are interested in influencing environmental performance.

This paper provides a foundation for future marketing research on sustainability through the application of nine prominent organizational theories. Specifically, we consider the implications for sustainability offered by transaction cost economics, agency theory, institutional theory, population ecology, resource dependence theory, the resource-based view of the firm, upper echelons theory, social network theory, and signaling theory. We consider how each theory can help researchers to better understand the ways that firms engage in sustainable marketing and business practices, and we develop insights that emerge from simultaneous examination of complementary or competing theoretical perspectives.

In this paper, we contribute to the agency and corporate entrepreneurship literatures by focusing on board antecedents of research and development (R&D). Some researchers in this stream find outside directors negatively influence R&D spending, yet popular opinion suggests boards should be composed of outsiders, and at the same time, firms should be innovative and entrepreneurial. We begin to address this conflict by extending agency theory and incorporating resource dependence views in order to explore the influence of a wider range of director characteristics on R&D spending, a precursor of innovation and entrepreneurial activity. Our empirical results demonstrate that aspects of directors' human and relational capital (e.g. education, entrepreneurial finance experience, technical experience, and interlocks) significantly influence R&D spending. Our findings illustrate that boards can be configured to improve efficiencies, thereby reducing R&D spending, and/or to augment R&D spending. They reveal the merits of considering inside and outside directors separately and show how the independence (i.e. inside/outside status) of directors shapes the effect of their human and relational capital on R&D spending.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to develop and test a theoretical model of the determinants of Islamic banks' social disclosures. In testing the hypotheses, the level of social disclosure in Islamic banks' annual reports is gauged based on a benchmark derived from Islamic principles. Design/methodology/approachApplying the principles of systems-oriented theories such as political economy, legitimacy and stakeholder theories, as well as agency theory, hypotheses linking Islamic social disclosure and its determinants are developed. The sample comprised 47 Islamic banks in 14 countries and the data related to the dependent (Islamic banks social disclosures) variable are collected mainly from the annual reports, while data for the independent variables (determinants) are collected from various sources. Regression analysis was conducted to test the hypotheses. FindingsCorporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure by Islamic banks varies significantly across the sample. According to the regression results, variation is best explained by the "influence of the relevant publics" and the "Shari'ah (SSB supervisory boards) corporate governance mechanism" variables. Using alternative variable measures, the regression results suggest that "level of social and political freedom" and "the proportion of investment account deposits to total assets" are also significant determinants of Islamic banks' CSR disclosure. Research limitations/implicationsThe major limitation of this paper is the small sample size of only 47 Islamic banking institutions. Future studies may expand the sample size used here. Practical implicationsThe results indicate the significance of the SSB as a governance mechanism that may increase the CSR disclosure of Islamic banks. Thus, from a policy perspective, bodies that regulate Islamic banking should consider mandating the SSB for all "Islamic banks". Originality/valueThis research is the first to provide an a priori basis for CSR disclosure of Islamic banks and to test using empirical data. The findings of this research should be of significant value to regulators, shareholders and deposit holders of Islamic banks. In a more general context, this paper is one of a few that has operationalised Gray et al.'s conception of "levels of resolution of perception" and empirically tested the concept using non-traditional organisations (Islamic banks) in a non-Western context. This adds further credibility to systems-oriented theories in explaining CSR disclosures of non-Western organisations operating in non-Western cultures.

Purpose: This paper aims to construct a comprehensive theoretical framework for interpreting voluntary IC disclosure practices by organizations. Design/methodology/approach: Four most-commonly used theories in the area, namely agency theory, stakeholder theory, signalling theory, and legitimacy theory, were integrated in terms of the interrelated concepts relating to voluntary IC disclosure. Findings: The constructed theoretical framework includes three concepts: to reduce information asymmetry; to discharge accountability to various stakeholders; and to signal organizational legitimacy and excellence (or superior quality) to society, which are seen as motivations for organizations to disclose their IC on a voluntary basis. Research limitations/implications: The framework ignores some other theoretical perspectives which are also relevant to voluntary IC disclosure; the framework is not justified by any empirical evidence. Originality/value: This research is the first attempt to construct a comprehensive theoretical framework for the voluntary disclosure of IC; the constructed framework can be employed as a theoretical foundation for future empirical studies in relation to voluntary IC disclosure.

This paper offers a new explanation of the gender pay gap in leadership positions by examining the relationship between managerial bonuses and company performance. Drawing on findings of gender studies, agency theory, and the leadership literature, we argue that the gender pay gap is a context-specific phenomenon that results partly from the fact that company performance has a moderating impact on pay inequalities. Employing a matched sample of 192 female and male executive directors of U.K.-listed firms, we corroborate the existence of the gender pay disparities in corporate boardrooms. In line with our theoretical predictions, we find that bonuses awarded to men are not only larger than those allocated to women, but also that managerial compensation of male executive directors is much more performance-sensitive than that of female executives. The contribution of attributional and expectancy-related dynamics to these patterns is highlighted in line with previous work on gender stereotypes and implicit leadership theories such as the romance of leadership. Gender differences in risk taking and confidence are also considered as potential explanations for the observed pay disparities. The implications of organizations' indifference to women's performance are examined in relation to issues surrounding the recognition and retention of female talent.

Whether voluntary or mandatory in nature, most recent corporate governance codes of best practice assume that board structural independence, and the application by boards of outcome-based incentive plans, are important boundary conditions for the enforcement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) pay-for-firm-performance; that is, for optimal contracting between owners and executive agents. We test this logic on a large Australian sample using a system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach to dynamic panel data estimation. We find that Australian boards exhibiting best practice structural arrangements - those chaired by non-executives and dominated by non-executive directors at the full board and compensation committee levels - are no more adept at enforcing CEO pay-for-firm-performance than are executive-dominated boards. These findings suggest that policy makers' faith in incentive plans and the moderating influence of structural independence per se may be misplaced. Our findings also hold significant implications for corporate governance theory. Specifically, the findings lend further support to a contingency-based understanding of board composition, reward choice and monitoring; an approach integrating the insights afforded by behavioural approaches to Agency Theory and by social-cognitive and institutional understandings of director outlook, decision-making and behaviour.

Little research has examined the performance implications of the parent-child relationship post spin-off. Although the parent provided oversight of the child prior to the spin-off, effects of post spin-off links to the child remain unclear. Applying transaction cost and agency theories, our study of 142 firms spun-off between 1986 and 1997 examines how oversight and ownership by the parent firm influence stock market performance post spin-off. We find that while child firms benefit from some links to the parent, having too many links is negatively related to performance. The findings suggest that there is a balance between having too much parental involvement and not enough. Our study extends understanding of post spin-off child firm performance and provides valuable insights for both parent and child firms. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study uses organizational theory to explore why nonprofit organizations conduct evaluations and how they use evaluation information. According to rational choice theory, managers of nonprofit organizations will conduct evaluations to make sure they are making good decisions about how to improve their services and achieve their goals. Yet, according to data gathered about the experiences of 31 nonprofit organizations, this assumption about the evaluation practices of nonprofits rarely holds true. Rather, other organizational theories, such as agency theory, institutional theory, resource dependence theory, and stewardship theory, which make different assumptions about how organizations operate and how managers behave, provide a more accurate description of why nonprofits engage in evaluation and how they use evaluation information. The findings from this study are important because they help to identify strategies that would encourage nonprofit organizations to use evaluation in more productive and meaningful ways.

In the slipstream of several large-scale corporate scandals, the board of directors has gained a pivotal position in the corporate governance debate. However, due to an overreliance on particular methodological (i. e. input-output studies) and theoretical (i. e. agency theory) research fortresses in past board research, academic knowledge concerning how this important governance mechanism actually operates and functions remains relatively limited. This theoretical paper aims to contribute to the promising stream of research which focuses on behavioural perspectives and processes within the corporate board, by delving into one of the research areas perhaps plagued most by these predominant approaches: board leadership. In adopting a team perspective on the board of directors our study goes beyond traditional board leadership research, which has turned a blind eye on actual leadership dynamics, by examining leadership processes and behaviours inside the board team. Specifically, we develop a conceptual framework addressing a novel and ethical approach to team leadership within the board, i. e. shared leadership, which has previously been demonstrated to result in performance benefits in various other team settings.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study examines the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries maintain active boards of directors. Active boards are in this study defined as boards that perform tasks beyond fulfilling local legal requirements. We focus on both monitoring and service roles. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a sample of 83 foreign subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is a world mandate subsidiary, which has worldwide responsibility for a product line and performs a broad scope of value-added activities. Moreover, a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is larger relative to the multinational enterprise (MNE), if it has a higher level of local responsiveness, and if its past performance is poorer. Additionally, the presence of an active board in a foreign subsidiary is related to other control mechanisms deployed in the subsidiary. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results highlight the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries are likely to maintain active boards. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that agency theory and resource dependence theory are relevant and complementary in the analysis of active boards in foreign subsidiaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that an active board may be a control mechanism to govern foreign subsidiaries and an instrument to deal with the external environment. Corporate governance regulators may consider developing governance recommendations that emphasize the importance of subsidiary boards in the oversight of foreign subsidiaries.

Although discretion among employees at organizations' lower levels seems to be increasing, it is uncertain whether this is a desirable HRM policy. To understand this issue better, this study tests competing organization theory predictions about the performance consequences of middle managers' perceived discretion. Discretion is defined as the freedom of action or decision authority available in managing subordinates. Survey data from a multinational, European sample of research and development (R&D) units were used to assess the effect of managers' perceived discretion on unit performance. The results show that a combination of ecology theory and strategic choice theory best predicts the relationship between discretion and unit performance. Greater perceived managerial discretion was linked to increased unit performance in a relationship moderated by managerial experience and limited by unit size. These findings have implications for HRM theory and practice, particularly regarding policies related to empowerment and leadership development. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study attempts to highlight the paradoxical aspects of top management power contests within customer firms that outsource information technology (IT) work. Intraorganizational power theory forms the overarching theoretical basis for this study. The focus is on the antecedents and consequences of the relative power of business executives (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer) versus IT executives (Chief Information Officer, Head of IT) in the governance of IT outsourcing. Evidence from a field survey supports the existence of a paradox. When a firms financial performance has been poor and the firm did not have a sizeable IT workforce, the business executives give themselves greater power and sideline the IT executives. Paradoxically, rather than leading to positive consequences, such power play weakens outsourcing performance. Outsourcing performance is best when power is solely with the IT executives group, a close second best when power is divided between the two groups (joint decision making), and worst when it is solely with the business executives group. Overall, when it comes to the outsourcing of IT work, business executives might find reasons to justify increasing their own power and reducing the power of IT executives, even though this can ultimately be detrimental to outsourcing performance. These findings lend credence to case studies and practitioner articles that have reported such occurrences. Managerial relevance statement: Under pressure due to their firm's poor performance, business executives often blame IT executives by labeling in-house IT as a cost burden. IT executives are sidelined in decisions related to IT outsourcing due to suspicions that IT executives would be overprotective of their turf. Here, business executives might argue that they are acting in the interest of their firm. Paradoxically, findings suggest that an increase in dominance by business executives leads to a decrease in outsourcing performance. Hence, IT executives need to make a strong case with various stakeholders that they deserve considerable power in the governance of IT outsourcing. (c) 2011 IEEE.

This paper examines the interrelations among ownership, board and manager characteristics and firm performance in a sample of 54 firms listed at the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE). These governance characteristics, designed to minimize agency problems between principals and agents are operationalized in terms of ownership concentration, ownership identity, board effectiveness and managerial discretion. The typical ownership identities at the NSE are government, foreign, institutional, manager and diverse ownership forms. Firm performance is measured using Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Dividend Yield (DY). Using PPMC, Logistic Regression and Stepwise Regression, the paper presents evidence of significant positive relationship between foreign, insider, institutional and diverse ownership forms, and firm performance. However, the relationship between ownership concentration and government, and firm performance was significantly negative. The role of boards was found to be of very little value, mainly due to lack of adherence to board member selection criteria. The results also show significant positive relationship between managerial discretion and performance. Collectively, these results are consistent with pertinent literature with regard to the implications of government, foreign, manager (insider) and institutional ownership forms, but significantly differ concerning the effects of ownership concentration and diverse ownership on firm performance.

The non-profit sector of the US economy is a special class of entities with an expansive array of organizations and activities dedicated to the common good and well-being of others. Even though this sector has constructed creative and forward thinking initiatives, obstacles remain which interfere with the accomplishment of significant achievements. In order to stay competitive, non-profit organizations are constantly assessing their current capacity to deliver unique needed services. Today, many umbrella associations of non-profits have implemented accreditation and certification programs intended to improve organizational contribution to member organizations. Throughout the sector, non-profit organizations are now seeking to become more ethical, accountable and credible in the eyes of stakeholders. Guided by institutional and agency theories, the research reported herein is designed to offer preliminary insights regarding the organizational and economic implications of pursuing accreditation. Technological enhancements in this context are also examined. (c) 2011 Eastern Academy of Management All rights reserved.

This article considers the 'obvious' relationship between human capital (HC) and agency theory (AT) with two goals in mind. First, to show how principal-agent theory (PAT) - the AT variant most understood by agency theory - clarifies HC as a way of describing individuals in the organizational context. Second, to explore how PAT's own shortcomings illuminate possibilities implicit but underexplored in the HC literature; for while a workplace relationship between PAT and HC seems obvious, it is conceptually complicated. The article begins with a review of the two concepts' history and the research programs from which they emerged. After considering the PAT-HC interaction, it shows how HC might contribute to the theory of the firm. Many see the firm as a socioeconomic context in which HC and agency issues collide under management's direction as other forms of capital enter the mix. (c) Oxford University Press 2011.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to compare the governance structures of two distinctive governance forms&colon; the family firm and the leveraged buyout &lpar;LBO&rpar;. The paper also explores the relative performance of these two organizational forms over the course of the economic business cycle. Design&sol;methodology&sol;approachThe paper provides a theoretical treatment of the family firm and the LBO using the stewardship perspective and agency theory. The analysis anticipates the board structure for each organizational form and relates family firm and LBO governance to performance over the business cycle. FindingsFrom a conceptual treatment, the family&hyphen;owned concern exhibits board characteristics reflecting the longer&hyphen;term orientation of the firm, with boards empowered to include non&hyphen;economic, as well as economic, goals. LBOs are structured to maximize shareholder value over a shorter time horizon. LBOs may take advantage of expansionary environments whereas family firms may be better prepared for economic down&hyphen;cycles. Research limitations&sol;implicationsThe paper takes a holistic approach to contrasting two organizational forms that fit their respective theoretical frames and compares some of their more salient governance characteristics and performance over the business cycle. Practical implicationsManagers and boards can structure governance to manage the business cycle. Stakeholders can selectively engage firms that portray vital governance characteristics for their benefit and may also pressure boards and top management to make necessary governance improvements. Originality&sol;valueThe paper offers an introductory comparison between family firms and LBOs in terms of governance and managing the firm over the business cycle. This paper makes the case that some organizational forms are better suited to certain types of economic climates. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study examines if the CEO duality influence the firm economic performance in Bangladesh and the moderating effects of board composition in the form of outside independent directors. While doing so, it examines the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance during the pre appointment of outside independent directors and post appointment of outside independent directors (the role of other corporate governance mechanism as moderating variable). The finding is that there is there is a negative (non-significant) relationship between CEO duality and firm performance before appointment of outside independent directors in the board. However, independent leadership structure and firm performance is found to be positively related following the acquisition of resource (outside independent directors in the board) supporting the 'resource dependence theory'. The findings of this study partially support the 'agency theory' and 'resource dependence theory' but do not support the stewardship theory. This study contributes to the literature on CEO duality in the context of less a developed country.

Drawing on Agency Theory this article investigates the relationship between board size and European firms' performance. The focus is on the implicit differences between financial and non-financial firms. In particular the paper addresses the following questions: does board size influence firm performance? Is financial intermediaries' corporate governance different from that of non-financial companies? The study analyses the governance of the largest listed European companies which make up the Eurotop 100 index. Companies come from 12 different countries and are subject to different regulatory and self-discipline codes. Referring to the Eurotop index the focus is on the relation between the overall size of the board of directors and the level of performance measured as Tobin's Q and Return on Assets. Diverging results emerge depending on the typology of the firm. In particular, results suggest that for non-financial companies large boards negatively influence firm performance, whereas financial intermediaries seem to be different because of the non-relation between their board size and performance.

Purpose: Reward research has focussed on level (what individuals are paid) and structure (relationship between different levels of reward). Less emphasis has been given to reward mix decisions, i.e. the relative proportions of each element making up overall reward. This paper seeks to examine the determinants of reward mix. Design/methodology/approach: Interview based research with reward consultants as key organisational observers and participants in reward mix decision making. Findings: Benchmarking has led to the development of reward mix norms. Organisations are under pressure to conform to these norms, moderated by leadership beliefs, the occurrence of events and the extent to which organisations' change capability can overcome strong institutional forces. Research limitations/implications: The results question agency theory based explanations of reward mix determination and point towards resource dependence and institutional theory perspectives being more suitable theoretical frameworks. Practical implications: The model developed allows reward managers to consider how the moderating variables, to the dominant mimetic pressure faced, could be manipulated for their firm to allow greater differentiation of the reward mix. Originality/value: Academically the work contributes to a programme of research into reward determination from a constructionist perspective and aims to provide greater theoretical robustness to the subject. Practically, the findings may prompt practitioners to think more consciously about the drivers of their firm's reward mix. Policy makers may use the stronger theoretical base for understanding the determinants of reward mix choices and the extent to which organisational free choice and institutionally determined choice influence final choices in reward policy decision making.

Performance assessment in profit and not-for-profit organizations has been on the agenda for scholars and practitioners for the last thirty years or so. Despite this effort we still do not have a comprehensive model of organizational performance for all kinds of organizations. This paper aims to contribute to this field by presenting findings from a constructive and interpretative investigation carried out in public organizations at the local level. The research presented here aims to identify the dimensions of performance that would address stakeholder interests in public organizational performance. Data were collected through semi structured interviews and analyzed using content analysis. The theoretical framework is based on resource dependence, institutional theory, agency theory and social network theory. Evidence from the investigation indicates that stakeholders assess public service performance on criteria of efficiency, effectiveness and equity. This paper provides a practical and theoretical contribution by suggesting ways of assessing performance in public organizations, which can contribute to strategic planning by setting milestones related to stakeholder expectations and by defining the dimensions of stakeholders' assessments of the performance of public service organizations.

Combining insights from the agency theory and sociopolitical perspectives, this study examines the extent to which factors such as ownership structure, CEO power, and firm performance influence firms' adoption of board independent reform advocated by shareholder activists. Event history analysis using extensive data on 1083 Standard & Poor's 1500 companies from January 2002 to December 2004 shows that firms with more powerful CEO were less likely to adopt supermajority-independent boards, while both poorly performing firms and large firms were more likely to adopt such board structure. We also find that higher institutional blockholder ownership increased the likelihood of the adoption in firms managed by less powerful CEOs, while external non-institutional blockholder ownership decreased the likelihood of the adoption.

We challenge critics of agency theory who suggest that agency theory's value does not extend outside a narrow context dominated by egocentric agents seeking only to maximize wealth at the expense of the principal. Instead, we argue that agency theory's flexibility allows for its application to a variety of non-traditional settings where the key elements of agency theory, such as self-interest, information asymmetry, and the mechanisms used to control agency costs can vary beyond the narrow assumptions implied in traditional agency-based research. We suggest that extending agency theory to diverse settings using a deductive approach can be accomplished by formally recognizing and incorporating the institutional context surrounding principal-agent (P-A) relations into agency-based models. Thus, criticisms that agency theory fails to acknowledge the social context in which P-A relations occur provides not a barrier but an opportunity for extending our understanding of P-A relations to a variety of diverse contexts.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the influence of firms' ownership structure on their technological innovation performance. First, we have examined whether ownership concentration positively influences technological innovation performance. Then we have investigated the primary reasons for the results derived from the first stage of our analysis by circumstantially exploring the impacts of four different ownership types. Research Findings/Insights: Using five sets of cross-sectional data, consisting of 301 Korean firms, we found that ownership concentration does not have a significant effect on firm technological innovation performance. However, some ownership types (e.g., institutional and foreign) do have a positive effect. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Drawing on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective, our paper is the first to consider a comprehensive treatment of the effect of ownership types on innovation in an emerging country, in particular in contrast to previous studies that have focused on advanced economies. Since only partial predictions suggested by agency and resource dependence perspectives were supported, it appears that neither theory adequately captures the ownership-technological innovation performance relationship. Thus, we suggest that future research should explore the question through a different theoretical lens to better understand the impact of ownership types. We suggest that transaction cost economics can be another path to approach the phenomenon. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that managers should recognize how each characteristic of ownership structure (types) influences the building of firm-specific capabilities for innovation. Policy makers and managers should be aware of the impact of the complete range of ownership types on technological innovation performance when they implement corporate governance reform with greater effectiveness. It also suggests that successful technological catch-up and innovation not only require policies for upgrading technology capabilities, but also the setting up of a suitable supporting ownership structure that favors innovation of firms in emerging countries. We suggest that successful technological catch-up and innovation require a supporting ownership structure. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: The paper aims to explain how agency theory can be used to inform our understanding of the dynamics surrounding supply chain behaviours and relationships. Design/methodology/approach: A structured review of the literature using a three-stage refinement process is used. The articles were sourced through online databases and keyword classifications, such as "agency theory", "principal-agent relationships" and "supply chain management". The search initially identified over 86 articles. After further screening these were reduced to 19 for final assessment and comparison. Findings: Despite agency theory's prevailing descriptive and predictive qualities there is scarcity in its application to the SCM discipline. The authors posit that agency theory provides valuable insights for relationship engineering within supply chains where social, political, legal and behavioural dynamics dominate. Practical implications: It is a critical task for managers to understand and mitigate abnormal behaviours across the supply chain. Agency theory serves this need by providing them with a useful tool to respond to transaction cost dilemmas through contractual and non-contractual remedies. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies that examines the current state of agency theory application in the SCM literature and suggests potential avenues for future research.

Purpose: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, the study aims to link board demographic diversity and independence to corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from various sources for a sample of 475 publicly traded Fortune 500 companies between the years 2007 and 2008. Findings: It is found that board gender diversity is positively related to institutional and technical strength ratings, while board racial diversity is positively related to institutional strength rating only. Both the proportion of outside directors and CEO non-duality were negatively associated with institutional and technical weakness ratings. Research limitations/implications: The sample was predominantly large, publicly traded national and international corporations, which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Management personnel should be cognizant of how board configurations and leadership structure may influence their corporate reputation for social responsibility. Efforts should be made to foster a group dynamic that is conducive to effective board functioning. Originality/value: Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between board characteristics and corporate social performance. This study contributes to the literature by examining such associations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The prevalence of ownership concentration in Asian firms presents a challenge to the influential agency theory-based understanding of the role of corporate boards. In this paper we develop and test hypotheses about board attributes and firm performance that reflect Asian institutional conditions. We present the first meta-analysis of the relationship between board attributes and performance of Asian firms using a varied set of meta-analytical techniques on a database of 86 studies covering nine Asian countries. First, we find that board structure and composition preferences are influenced by the identity of the concentrated owner. Second, consistent with US data, we find very limited evidence of a direct relationship between board attributes and firm financial performance in the Asian context. Third, we find that the relationship between board structure and composition and firm performance is mediated by the revealed strategic preferences of Asian firms specifically by the level of R&D investment.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: In this paper we discuss three assumptions of agency theory: (1) conflicts of interest between principal and agent, (2) nature of risk, and (3) the proposed internal mechanisms to reduce agency costs. We review criticisms of agency theory's pessimistic assumptions of human behavior and its simplistic view about individual risk preferences to argue how the context may influence both the interest and mechanisms for aligning interest of principals and agents. Research Findings/Insights: We draw on alternative theoretical perspectives from behavioral and organizational sciences to describe circumstances under which honesty, loyalty, and trust in agents' behaviors are possible and also the development of cooperative rather than contentious relationships. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study explores the boundary conditions of traditional agency theory in the hope of extending agency theory outside its current contextual boundaries. In doing so, we provide a more robust and exhaustive view of the economic exchange between principals and agents. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to managers about how intrinsic incentives may provide an alternative mechanism of control over agents' behavior to extrinsic incentives prescribed by traditional agency theory. Indeed, intrinsic incentives of personal satisfaction and identification with organizational objects, combined with implicit social obligations and reciprocity may, under certain circumstances, provide stronger restraints on agent opportunism than the use of traditional extrinsic rewards in the form of incentive alignment.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: To what extent can group faultlines and their potential value-destroying effects be detected on corporate boards? Task-related attributes of the type of directorship, education, board tenure, and financial background of board members are considered as directors' characteristics that give rise to the faultline phenomenon. The impact of task-related faultlines on firm performance as well as the moderating effects of busy boards, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) tenure, executive directors' (EDs) compensation structure, and the average non-executive directors' (NEDs) involvement in board committees are examined. Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel of FTSE 350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find a strong negative effect of task-related faultlines on firm performance. Further exploration of the moderating effects demonstrates that the condition of a busy board and CEO tenure exacerbate the negative effects of faultlines. At the same time, the executive pay contingency is found to have a remedying effect on boardroom cohesiveness, whereas the involvement of NEDs in board committee work is not likely to make the adverse effects of board faultlines less pronounced. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the arguments of social identity theory, this study shows that task-related faultlines on corporate boards have strong negative value-creating implications. The positive moderating impact of the executive compensation structure renders support to agency theory predictions about executive incentive alignment. This work also underlines the usefulness of the concept of faultlines in the corporate governance literature, because unitary boards, where NEDs and EDs share board responsibility, exhibit pre-existing factions, similar to top management teams of family-controlled firms and teams managing international joint-ventures. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This research points to the importance of a careful selection process of directors by nomination committees. It also underlines the role for active leadership on boards, who should be aware of available strategies to ameliorate the negative consequences of board schisms, such as accentuating superordinate board identity and/ or informal meetings.

Purpose: Recently, an increasing number of Internet users have begun to purchase various products, both secondhand and new, from online auction websites. However, some Internet users are still hesitant to purchase products from these websites. Moreover, the factors affecting male and female users' intention to shop on the websites may be different. Past studies have indicated that uncertainty is a major determinant of online shopping behaviors and may have different effects on men's and women's purchase intentions. Therefore, to explore the differences, this study seeks to propose a research model based on uncertainty and agency theory. Design/methodology/approach: This study included members of the Yahoo! and PChome online portal sites in Taiwan as research subjects. A web survey was conducted, and data were collected from a total of 313 bidders of online auctions. The casual model was validated using partial least squares (PLS) techniques. Findings: Gender moderated most of the relationships in the research model. The analysis results showed that the factors influencing men's and women's uncertainty are different. In addition, uncertainty has stronger influence on men's intention to purchase products from online auction websites. Practical implications: This study contributes to a theoretical understanding of the factors that promote men's and women's intention to purchase products from online auction websites. From a practical perspective, insights provided by this study can help online auction service providers understand buyers' concerns and eliminate the sources of the uncertainty. Originality/value: The primary value of this paper lies in providing a better understanding of male and female behaviors on online C2C market, and investigating the gender differences in the factors that influence the consumers' purchase in online auctions.

We use agency theory to investigate the influence of CEO dominance on variation in capital structure. Due to agency conflicts, managers may not always adopt leverage choices that maximize shareholders' value. Consistent with the prediction of agency theory, the evidence reveals that, when the CEO plays a more dominant role among top executives, the firm adopts significantly lower leverage, probably to evade the disciplinary mechanisms associated with debt financing. Our results are important as they demonstrate that CEO power matters to critical corporate outcomes such as capital structure decisions. In addition, we find that the impact of changes in capital structure on firm performance is more negative for firms with more powerful CEOs. Overall, the results are in agreement with prior literature, suggesting that strong CEO dominance appears to exacerbate agency costs and is thus detrimental to firm value.

Recent perspectives on community investments suggest that they are opportunities for firms to create value for shareholders and other stakeholders. However, many corporate managers are still influenced by a widely held belief that such investments erode profits and are therefore unjustifiable from an agency perspective. In this paper, we refine and test theory regarding countervailing forces that influence community-based firm performance. We hypothesize that high levels of available slack will be associated with higher community-based performance, but that this relationship will be moderated by three important governance variables: board independence, investment fund ownership, and CEO ownership. We find support for our hypotheses in longitudinal study of a large sample of U. S. corporations. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This study draws on agency and stewardship theory to evaluate the relationship between alternative governance regimes (founder versus non-founder CEO) adopted at the time of going public on post-IPO economic outcomes in the market for corporate control. We find that the presence of founder CEOs reduces the likelihood of post-IPO change of control but enhances target IPO firm wealth by increasing acquisition premiums. Additionally, we examine whether measures of CEO power over the board moderate the relationship between founder management and target IPO firm wealth. Our results suggest that CEO duality is the most effective instrument of CEO power available to founder CEOs to positively influence target firm wealth. Further, we find that while founder CEOs utilize power derived from CEO duality to increase acquisition premiums, non-founder CEOs use board leadership power to expropriate shareholder wealth.

We investigated the effect of financial incentives on performance in a professional organization. Whereas agency theory treats tangible rewards such as money as a potentially powerful motivator for improving performance, the professional control perspective posits that the motivational effects of financial incentives will depend on the intended recipients attitudes toward the incentives relative to their professional values. The study setting was a large network of physician practices that adopted a financial incentive program to improve physician performance in the management of diabetic patients. Consistent with agency theory, performance did improve following the introduction of the incentive. However, consistent with the professional control perspective, physicians' psychologically based attitudes toward the incentive program regarding its impact on their own work autonomy and the importance of the performance goals moderated the effect of the incentive on performance. Study findings indicate that agency theory and professional control are complementary theoretical perspectives for understanding how professionals will respond to the imposition of performance-related financial incentives. In terms of practice, pay-for-performance programs aimed at professional organizations should be designed to take into account the values and goals of an organization's professionals to maximize the effect of financial incentives on performance.

This paper investigates the effect of new governmental regulations on corporate Boards of Directors (BODs). We have reviewed the literature pertaining to agency theory and resource dependency theory, both of which have been assumed to explain the actions of BODs. We examine the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory regarding both the structure and actions of BODs in times of governmental regulatory change. We then describe four historical events in which radical changes were required by certain governmental regulations, and discuss responses by BODs to each event, and present a discussion of these responses and how they adhere to or stray from the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory. We conclude the paper with recommendations for the direction of further study.

This article examines how funders and the nonprofit organizations they support view current feedback practices and explore the similarities and differences in their perspectives. A survey of funders and nonprofit service providers in a six-county area in south-central New York State found that funders value feedback as a way to verify that funded activities have been completed and to assess outcomes, whereas providers use feedback to improve service and to ensure that their organizations are responsive to clients. Some funders were uncertain about how providers use feedback, some providers were uncertain about how funders use it, and some respondents in both categories were not confident about the capacity of their own organizations to use feedback information. Many funders and providers discuss feedback results and implications with each other, but funders and providers collaborate less in other aspects of the feedback process. These findings have implications for theory and practice and for future research. (c) 2012 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper investigates the impact of corporate board diversity on the financial performance of Nigerian quoted firms using a panel data of 122 quoted Nigerian firms. The aspects of board diversity studied comprise board nationality, board gender and board ethnicity. The Fixed Effect Generalised Least Square Regression is used to examine the impact of board diversity on firm performance for the period: 1991-2008. The results show that gender diversity was negatively linked with firm performance, while board nationality and board ethnicity were positive in predicting firm performance. The study provides insights for practitioners and policy makers on the need to view the board as a strategic resource in line with the resource dependency theory instead of viewing the board solely from agency theory perspective.

Purpose: This paper seeks to examine the differences between executives and investors in the perception of determinant factors in executive compensation. Design/methodology/approach: From a survey instrument comprised of archival executive compensation determinant items, a factor analysis is performed to examine the construct determinant perceptions unique to executives and non-executive investors. Findings: The authors find differences in factors between executives and non-executive investors in a manner expected by agency theory. Non-executive investors place greater weight on factors related to performance and less weight on human capital factors, while executive investors place greater weight on human capital factors in determining executive compensation. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited in that the sample may not be representative of the population of chief executive officers or shareholders in the USA. Practical implications: Differing factors suggest that there is a misalignment of measures desired to be the foundation of executive compensation. The differing measures used to potentially motivate agents (executives) by principals (investors) results in an agency cost. Originality/value: The authors have documented a difference between executives and investors in factors desired to determine executive compensation. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This article analyses the appointments of outside directors to family firm boards within a sample of 423 observations (year/firm) regarding Italian publicly listed companies. The aim is to test predictions which suggest that efficient performance of control and service tasks by outside directors has positive effects on a company's capacity to raise capital and to grow. Unlike agency theory, which affirms that independents are efficient when performing functions of control, this article suggests that the adoption of outside directors who are also independent has no effect. The results of this research demonstrate that outside directors who have close ties with banks maintain valuable social capital with bankers in periods when such social capital is threatened by large investment policies requiring a great amount of bank financing.

There is currently intense debate in academic circles regarding the principles that have long sustained traditional economic theories in the teaching of business management. One of the most controversial questions being discussed is the concept of human nature as driven primarily by self-interest. Profit maximization and governance mechanisms in order to protect shareholders' interests have become the essence of all good business management practices. This article proposes a change in direction towards a broader and, at the same time, more realistic perspective with respect to the individual's values within the sphere of the teaching of business management.

This paper examines the process of delivery of HR practices within Multinational Companies (MNCs). Neo-institutional, resource-based and agency theories are used to explore whether devolvement of HR to line managers is attempted in MNCs. Issues of agency between HR specialists and line managers are found to be a significant barrier to devolving HR within the sample organisations. A higher level of divergence in perception about the delivery and resourcing of devolvement is found to be negatively correlated with perceived subsidiary performance. The analysis is based on a multi-respondent and a multi-unit method which enables comparisons between HR specialists and line managers (over 700 respondents) and comparisons between the domestic and foreign subsidiaries (over 140 organisations and 429 units). The interaction of institutional resource-based and agency factors is extremely complex and requires further investigation. (c) 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The paper deals with development of a general theory of the firm. It discusses the demand for such a theory, reviews existing approaches to its generalization, and offers a new variant of general theory of the firm based on the contract theory. The theory is based on minimization of opportunistic behaviour determined by the material structure of production (a classification of ten structural factors is offered). This framework is applied to the analysis of three boundaries problems (boundaries of the job, boundaries of the unit, boundaries of the firm) and five integration dilemmas (vertical, horizontal, functional, related, and conglomerate).

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reconcile alternative managerial views regarding self-serving behavior in organizations: while some propose that such behavior is commonplace and detrimental to performance, and suggest policies to counteract such conduct, critics contend that such policies generate distrust and diminish performance. The authors integrate elements from agency and interactional justice theories, and hypotheses that managerial attitudes not related to self-interest can influence behaviors often attributed to the desire to curb self-interest, and vice-versa. Design/methodology/approach - The authors employ structural equation modeling based on survey data from 387 team-leaders from both Brazil and the USA. Findings - An asymmetric relation is found in the aforementioned theoretical "cross-talk:" managers concerned with self-interest tend to devise policies solely focused on curbing self-interest, while managers concerned with justice not only adopt justice-enhancing practices but also certain incentivizing agency-related practices which jointly increase performance. Research limitations/implications - By proposing and testing theoretical interactions between agency and justice theories, support is found for both enthusiasts and critics of self-interestedness, but pointedly they occur in different domains. Practical implications - The results suggest that managers should foster interactional justice, promoting incentivizing agency-related behaviors that may be interpreted as justice-seeking, while avoiding those that send a message of distrust. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first empirical papers directly addressing the ongoing debate raised by Ghoshal and others on the merits of managerial theories based on the assumption of self-interest.

This present work is an exploratory analysis of network governance models that are characterised by widespread distribution of decision-making and control, auditing and supervisory functions in company structure, frequently through stakeholder engagement in the management system. In the study, we verify the way in which NG can involve stakeholder representatives in the governance bodies and in the decision-making process, also preventing opportunistic behaviour of management, according to the stakeholder-agency theory. A case study of network governance is presented regarding the Spanish cooperative Eroski - a self-governing organisation, with direct participation by representatives of the various stakeholder categories in the main governing bodies. In the conclusions, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the network governance system and its implications for theory and practice and we describe an incremental approach, on an entirely voluntary basis, for implementing this governance model in other corporations, including non-cooperative ones.

This paper presents a critical analysis of the choice and design of executive pay incentive scheme arrangements implemented at the time of a company's initial public offering. Using a unique sample of 311 entrepreneurial companies over a five year period ( 1998-2002) it discovers that 172 companies implement executive share option schemes for the first time at their initial public offering. Taking this sub-sample, the paper evaluates and analyses the strategic choices made with regard to incentive pay schemes by the board of directors at this crucial time in a company's development. It finds that company's choices are split between schemes that have performance targets linked to reward and others that are contrary to the guidelines of the UK's Corporate Governance Code and best practice. Furthermore, it shows company characteristics that affect schemes and elaborates on the configuration of incentive schemes in respect of three critical elements: the performance target, comparator, and target level requirement for the shares to vest. In light of this, it proposes strategic reasons as to how these schemes might be set for initial public offerings and proposes that explanations for implementation are not underpinned by traditional agency theory but linked to a resource based view of the firm.

Several unique characteristics of ventures distinguish them from public firms and lead to distinctive monitoring issues. In this article I develop a theoretical framework that links the attributes of the venture and the board composition with venture board monitoring and its implications for firm performance. Contributing to the strategy literature on corporate governance, the framework offers counterintuitive deviations from how agency theory is typically conceptualized, highlights that an unexpected "principal problem" could emerge as the separation of ownership and control is reduced, and presents novel insights about the interdependence between agency theory and resource dependence theory. This framework also adds to the research on entrepreneurial firms by complementing the extant emphasis in the literature on resource provisioning and by offering a richer view of key actors through opening the black box of strategic action in ventures. More broadly, by focusing on an underexamined but important context beyond public firms, this article highlights rich opportunities for developing a contingency theory of corporate governance.

This study explored sport governance practice from the lived experience of one informant spanning a 30-year period in the governance of two sport organisations (basketball and cricket). Hermeneutic phenomenology, the methodological framework used for this study, seeks to grasp the everyday world, and draw insight and meaning from it. The method involves a series of in-depth interviews with one research participant, supplemented by document analysis. Interviews were analysed using an interpretative process which blended the world views of both the participant and researchers. The participant lived through an era of increasing professionalisation within sport. His narrative, which tapped into his governance expertise at state, national and international levels, provides insights into the transition from an amateur to a commercial culture, referred to in this paper as 'two worlds colliding'. From this narrative, three related themes were identified and labelled, 'volunteer and cultural encounters'; 'structural encounters'; and 'adversarial encounters'. In drawing on hermeneutic philosophy, and highlighting that which has been hidden from view, direction for future research and practice within the sport governance domain is offered. These directions invite scholars to think about future sport governance research as it relates to federated structures and how collaborative governance theory can sharpen the focus in this domain.

We develop the concept of stakeholder salience to account for stakeholders who should matter to the firm, even when managers do not perceive them as important. While managers are responsible for attributing salience to stakeholders, they can overlook or ignore stakeholder importance because of market frictions that affect managerial perceptions or induce opportunism. When this happens, corporate financial and social performance can suffer. Thus, we propose that the perceptions of organizational and societal stakeholders should also codetermine the salience of the focal stakeholder to the firm. We also propose that stakeholder dialogue can reduce the impacts that market frictions can have on managerial perceptions of stakeholder interests that should matter to the firm. Finally, we discuss how the refined conceptualization of stakeholder salience might have better predictive validity, be more normative, and make instrumental and normative stakeholder theory more convergent.

We investigate the relationship between firm governance and the board's position in the social network of directors. Using a sample of 133 German firms over the four-year period from 2003 to 2006, we find that firms with intensely connected supervisory boards are (1) associated with lower firm performance, and (2) pay their executives significantly more. We interpret these results as evidence of poor monitoring in firms with directors who are more embedded in the social network. In both cases, simple measures for busy directors that were used by other studies in the past fail to show any significant pattern. The findings suggest that the quality and structural position of additional board seats may play a bigger role than simply the number of board appointments. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This study examines if Chief Executive Officer (CEO) duality reduces the firms' agency cost in Bangladesh. The agency costs are measured as two efficiency ratios: 'expense ratio' and 'asset utilization ratio'. The finding is that, there is no significant relationship between CEO duality and agency costs. These findings imply that, duality may have given the CEOs enormous powers; it may have reduced the check and balance or board's ability to exercise the governance (monitoring) function, which is not helpful to enhance firm efficiency. This study contributes to the global debate on CEO duality and provides a new avenue of knowledge on CEO duality and firm efficiency in the context of an emerging economy.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between audit committee expertise and financial reporting quality. Since the Sarbanes Oxley Act, 2002, there has been growing interest in the research concerning audit committee expertise, especially as the Security Exchange Commission requires firms to identify their audit committee financial experts. Based on two theories, the resource dependence theory and agency theory, the study examines the association of audit committee experts with financial reporting quality, proxied by earnings management. Samples involved 2008 financial data of 300 firms that were ranked by highest market capitalisation. In total, four types of expertise are developed based on academic qualification, professional qualification and work experience. Presence of non-accounting experts and accounting experts is significant to reduce the magnitude of earnings management. Other than that, leverage and firms size are also found to be significant. The findings show RDT is prevalent in accounting or auditing domain, where there is evidence showing directors bridge firms with external resources such as expertise and experience. Subsequently, contribute to the mainstream accounting literature that the resource dependence theory is also vital in explaining situations where directors' expertise and knowledge are involved.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper uses unique Danish data to examine whether non-executive directors draw on both direct and indirect ties in the network of interlocking directorates to impact auditor choice, and whether this impact has consequences for audit fees. Research Findings/Insight: The paper finds clear evidence that non-executive directors draw on their networks to impact auditor choice, and evidence that clients pay an audit fee premium when non-executive directors are connected to audit firms outside the focal company. The relationship between non-executive directors and auditors is well established in Denmark and exhibits features that currently emerge in international debates and regulations. Therefore, the national context offers an interesting setting for empirical evidence of whether international aspirations are likely to be realized. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Audit-related corporate governance research has predominantly adopted the agency theory paradigm and has only drawn on alternative theoretical perspectives to a limited extent. We draw on the literature about board interlocks and social network theory in order to develop a study that aims to increase our understanding of the non-executive director-auditor relationship and the role that board networks have in governing auditor choice decisions. The study identifies interlocks as an infrastructure for differentiation in the audit market and determines that such differentiation is associated with an audit fee premium for audit firms. The findings indicate that personal experiences with auditors are shared among non-executive directors and that audit attributes other than low cost audit, auditor size, and industry specialism, are important in the audit market. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings support continued efforts to strengthen the relationship between non-executive directors and auditors. Our findings also indicate that board interlocks may constitute a mechanism that mitigates the audit market failure that arises because of a lack of auditor differentiation.

This work reports on an investigation of the dynamics of governance over breakthrough innovation within Fortune 1000 firms. The primary research question investigates the boundary of agency theory within the firm. Using agency and stakeholder theoretic perspectives, the study tests the hypothesis that innovation will thrive in firms that combine a board of directors operating in accordance with a high agency theoretic focus in addition to an innovation governance board operating deeper within the firm that employs a strong stakeholder theoretic orientation in its behavior. The model is tested with data from 98 large firms. Results suggest that the relationship between board of directors' behavior and the firm's overall innovativeness is mediated by innovation decision-making boards that (1) promote projects that are breakthrough in scope, (2) incorporate input of diverse constituencies within the firm, (3) exhibit patience with financial results, and (4) engage in frequent, informal interactions with project teams. Firms exhibiting high board of director agency orientation in combination with loyalty to mandate, patient financial capital disposition, inclusiveness, and project team interaction as described above for innovation governance board decision-making prove to be the most innovative as measured by external indicators. For firm innovativeness, consolidated managerial power and behavior is frequently present at the upper levels of the firm, but must be broken down at deeper levels of the firm. This research offers implications to innovation decision-makers as to how to proceed if the intent is to offer commercializably successful breakthrough innovations.

The philosophy of science offers two different perspectives on how empirical findings contribute to knowledge accumulation. The "law-statement" perspective interprets contributions to the extent that empirical research confirms or refutes general axioms of theory. Alternatively, the "model-theoretic" perspective recognizes contributions from models that improve scholars' ability to represent the world of managers. Management scholars often have limited awareness of the philosophical tradition underlying the model-theoretic perspective, and, consequently, useful contributions from improved models of important phenomena may be overlooked. Drawing on model-theoretic philosophy, we identify three ways in which empirical research contributes to theoretical knowledge without necessarily verifying or falsifying theoretical axioms, through the grafting, contextualizing, and repurposing of representational models. We provide examples of each by focusing on studies investigating incentive alignment. Finally, we discuss how the model-theoretic perspective contributes to an ongoing discussion about improving theoretical precision in management research. (c) Academy of Management Review 2013.

This study has extended existing research on CEO power, pay structure, and firm performance, offering models based mainly on agency theory and managerial power theory, and testing hypotheses using data from 112 companies across a five-year span (2001-2005) in computer-related industry groups in the United States. The results indicated that power from executive directorship positively impacts a firm's return on assets and return on equity, and that CEO power from duality negatively impacts CEO long-term pay and total pay, while CEO power from tenure positively impacts CEO long-term pay and pay leverage, and composite power negatively impacts short-term pay. Evidence for CEO pay as a mediator between CEO power and firm performance revealed that CEO short-term pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance but negatively impacts its market value, regardless of which source of power is being controlled. CEO total pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance, with power from CEO duality, directorship, or composite power being controlled. Hence, and in general, CEO pay fails to significantly mediate the relationships between CEO power and firm performance. The contributions include a multiple-perspective study of CEO power, compensation, and firm performance to comprehensively discover each of their respective relationships. This study has further extended the debate over agency perspectives with stewardship perspectives to fill knowledge and theoretical gaps. Thus, evidence-based findings provide boards of directors with practical knowledge for sound governance with another avenue for future research in corporate governance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Based on an analysis of Swedish press material covering two corporate scandals, this paper reveals the institutional logic propagated by the Swedish press pertaining to large shareholders and the relationship between this institutional logic and the attribution of blame for the scandals to shareholders by the press. Research Findings/Insights: The results reveal an institutional logic with a clear notion of what constitutes a "real owner," which is reminiscent of an understanding of ownership and control prevalent in the literature before the emergence of agency theory. Real owners are associated with moderation of management, responsibility, long-termism, and legitimate influence in the firm. In response to scandals, this institutional logic leads the Swedish press to question the "realness" of an existing controlling shareholder or, if no controlling shareholder exists, to blame the problem on the absence of a real owner. Theoretical/Academic Implications: It is important to understand the institutional logic propagated by the press to see how the media functions as a governance mechanism, since a given institutional logic leads the media to "name and shame" in specific ways. The institutional logic propagated by the Swedish press differs from what previous research has indicated is prevalent in the US, suggesting that the media as a governance mechanism has different effects in different countries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper illustrates the importance of understanding prevalent informal norms when predicting effects of corporate governance reform and suggests that these informal aspects are highly path dependent.

Publicly traded Chinese firms recently reformed their ownership structures by converting non-tradable shares, which constituted two-thirds of shares outstanding and were held largely by the state, into shares that could trade on domestic exchanges. To facilitate this reform, tradable shareholders were compensated with stock grants from non-tradable shareholders. Our analysis focuses on the level of compensation, the compensation ratio, the ratio of new tradable shares granted to tradable shares outstanding before the reform. Contrary to the predictions of asset-pricing models, most firms set the compensation ratio around 0.3. We explain this surprising convergence using institutional theory. In doing so, we analyze the power and interests of all relevant actors - not just owners, but also state regulators, executives, and other agents - and draw on insights from resource-dependence and agency theories. We find strong evidence of coercive and mimetic isomorphism, but no evidence of normative isomorphism. Because our dependent variable is continuous (a ratio), we are able to show that the mimetic effects we observe cannot be attributed to coercion or norms. Thus, we not only explain an empirical puzzle, we also advance institutional analysis of isomorphism by clearly distinguishing three isomorphic forces that have been conflated in much previous research.

Electronic channel affiliates are important online intermediaries between customers and host retailers. However, no work has studied how online retailers control online intermediaries. By conducting an exploratory content analysis of 85 online contracts between online retailers and their online intermediaries, and categorizing the governing mechanisms used, insights into the unique aspects of the control of online intermediaries are presented. Findings regarding incentives, monitoring, and enforcement are presented. Additionally, testable research propositions are presented to guide further theory development, drawing on contract theory, resource dependence theory and agency theory. Managerial implications are discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

By integrating agency, stewardship and resource-dependency perspectives, this paper associated three characteristics of the board of directors - outside directors, insiders' equity ownership and leadership duality (Executive Officer also being the Chairman of the Board) - with bank's financial performance in Lebanon. Using a panel model, and after controlling for endogeneity problems, we examined 54 listed and unlisted banks from 2005 to 2010. Our results implied that the presence of outside directors on the board and the leadership duality have no statistical impact on performance. It seems that severe regulations by the Lebanese monetary authority act as an external governance mechanism. On the contrary, insiders' ownership promotes convergence of the interests of managers/shareholders and shapes the performance of banks. Our findings may well urge Lebanese bankers and regulators towards further development and implementation of governance practices to enhance the performance and the stability of one of the pillars of the Lebanese economy.

Corporate governance research based on agency theory has been criticized for being "under-contextualized," and for evaluating various governance practices independently. To address both criticisms, we take a configurational approach and show how firm-level governance practices interact with informational asymmetries associated with a firm's industry. By examining foreign Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) that have chosen to list on London stock exchanges, we demonstrate that an assessment of the firm-level corporate governance configurations is incomplete without taking into account the firm's industry affiliation. Our use of fs/QCA underscores the possibilities configurational approaches have in advancing theories of corporate governance. (c) Copyright 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Referring to the dual nature of "good" theories in social and management sciences, this article claims that the same theory might generate both good and bad practices, in rational and moral terms. To illustrate this argument, it relies on the positive agency theory case and on two related practices: stock-options, and the carried interest technique which is supported by the private equity organizational structure. This article concludes that management theory and practices may be decoupled. (c) 2013 Lavoisier. All rights reserved.

CEO duality-the practice of a single individual serving as both CEO and board chair-has been the subject of academic interest for more than 20 years. In that time, boards' use of CEO duality has fluctuated and the scholarly conceptualizations of the phenomenon have become more complex. As such, the need to understand CEO duality has only increased with time. We review and integrate the disparate literature on this topic so that future attempts to study it will benefit from a more complete understanding of the knowledge already produced. We review the demonstrated antecedents and consequences of CEO duality, pointing out that while much work has been done in this area, much remains that we do not understand. Finally, we offer new theoretical, methodological, and contextual directions that researchers could explore to extend knowledge about CEO duality. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Considerable attention has been focused on the ways in which emerging market firms can obtain and mobilize the knowledge and resources required for innovation. Innovation is a particular challenge in emerging markets because of inadequate external institutions. In this study, we focus on the importance of ownership structure, and in particular on ownership type diversity and ownership concentration. Using transaction cost and agency theories embedded in an emerging market context, we argue that ownership structure provides an important mechanism by which firms can assemble and direct the resources necessary for innovation in the context of inadequate external institutions. Specifically, we hypothesize that ownership type diversity improves innovation performance and that increasing ownership concentration has the same effect, but only up to a point. Using a panel dataset of 487 and 475 Chinese listed companies during 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 respectively, we find supportive empirical evidence for our hypotheses. Our findings also suggest that ownership type diversity is a more important factor in explaining innovation performance than ownership concentration, although most of the extant literature focuses on the latter.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

Family ownership has been recognized as an important determinant of corporate strategic choices; however, little research investigates the effects of family ownership and corporate governance on internationalization in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper utilizes agency theory and the resource-based view to analyze the relationships between family ownership, institutional ownership, and internationalization. Using a sample of Taiwanese SMEs, the finding of a positive family ownership-internationalization relationship suggests that family ownership may encourage internationalization. The interaction of family ownership and institutional ownership is positively related to internationalization, suggesting that SMEs with high family ownership are more likely to internationalize as institutional ownership increases.

This study focuses on the relationship and identity changes within and between a project team and its organization following top management intervention in the context of a large international construction project. The study follows the project-as-practice orientation, examining the actions and behaviors of the project team through participant ethnography in the "praxis" of the project site over its entire duration. The longitudinal case allows the examination of the way the transition process established a new governance culture undermining the initial trust-based one and changed it from a virtual absence of mechanisms toward far more potent mechanisms of control, monitoring, and punishment. Simultaneously, the initial stewardship relationships and collectivist identity of the project team shifted toward agency relationships and individualistic identity. The triggers for the transformation process were identified as CEO succession, project failure, top management intervention driven changes in governance mechanisms, and perception of organizational betrayal of the project team.

Purpose - This paper aims to develop a framework of connotative meanings afforded to the term "corporate governance". Design/methodology/approach - An examination of academic publications from 1985-2012 containing the term "corporate governance" was conducted. The articles are sorted into the theoretical constructs that influence the contemporary connotative meaning of corporate governance. Findings - That a combination of a weak definitional base coupled with strong motivational forces have aided the development of competing theoretical perspectives of the meaning of corporate governance. The dominant meaning is written from an agency theory perspective. Research limitations/implications - Theoretical analysis was restricted to articles found in academic journals published since 1985. Practical implications - This study provides a very useful analysis into the connotative meanings and theoretical bases used by academic writers in the study of corporate governance. Originality/value - This paper provides an updated and developed analysis to the theoretical dimensions that underpin the contemporary use of the term "corporate governance".

Microfinance Institutions provide financial services to poor people. Governance of these organizations is important so that they can operate efficiently and sustainably. This study analyzes the influence of stakeholders (donors, employees, customers, and creditors), on board structure (board size and CEO duality), and on organizational performance. We use a global data set of 379 microfinance institutions from 73 countries, collected from rating organizations. Supported by stakeholder theory, agency theory and resource dependence theory, we find stakeholders to be important and have various influences on microfinance institutions. We find donors to be associated with small boards, non-duality and better performance. Employees are associated with large boards, while customers are associated with duality and good financial performance. Creditors opt for duality and better social performance. Implications and areas for future research are discussed. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

We examine how CEO power affects the extent of analyst coverage. CEO power can influence a CEO's incentives to disclose information. The amount of information disclosed by the CEO in turn influences the information environment, which affects financial analysts' incentives to follow the firm. Consistent with this notion, we show that firms with powerful CEOs are covered by fewer analysts. In addition, the evidence shows that firms with more powerful CEOs experience less information asymmetry. Powerful CEOs are well insulated and have fewer incentives to conceal information, resulting in more transparency. The information provided to investors directly by the firm substitutes for the information in the analyst's report. As a result, the demand for analyst coverage is lower. Our results are important because they show that CEO power affects important corporate outcomes such as corporate transparency and analyst following. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Agency theory is one of the most important foundational theories in management research, but it rests on contestable cognitive assumptions. Specifically, the principal is assumed to hold a perfect (correct) theory regarding some of the content of the agent's mind, while he is entirely ignorant concerning other such content. More realistically, individuals have some limited access to the minds of others. We explore the implications for classical agency theory of realistic assumptions regarding the human potential for interpersonal sensemaking. We discuss implications for the design and management of rewards, and trace implications for value creation in principal-agent relations. (c) 2014 European Academy of Management.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an extensive and critical overview of the theoretical perspectives used in the accounting disclosure literature including economic theories, political and social theories.
Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews and discusses in details the positive accounting theory (PAT), agency theory, signalling theory, political economy theory (PET), stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory and contingency theory to identify the situations suit each of these perspectives.
Findings - The main finding shows that there is no universal theory applicable for all situations or societies. For example, PAT is probably used when a corporation believes that its primary responsibility is to use its resources and engage in activities designed to maximise its profits. On the other hand, the PET seems to better explain why some corporations appear to respond to government or public pressure for information about their social impact. The agency theory provides the required framework to evaluate accounting choices and disclosure decisions in market-based studies.While the legitimacy theory seems to be more suitable for multinational corporations working in developed/democratic countries, the stakeholder theory seems to be most suitable for multinational corporations working in developing/dictator countries; whereas a corporation can manage its stakeholders. The contingency theory supports our main finding that different theories are required for different situations, as it clearly indicates that management's preferences of reporting practices are related to the nature of environmental and organisational constraints rather than their relative income effects.
Originality/value - The paper contributes to the limited body of literature concerning the accounting disclosure theories and to identify the main theoretical perspective that can be used in the accounting disclosure research. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how information sharing practices influenced inter-firm relationships. This was done specifically in relation to bulk commodity supply chains, due to the pre-existing power asymmetries in the system. Design/methodology/approach - This research was conducted using an interpretivist, inductive approach. The intention was to gather a wide range of data and then explore the data to see which themes emerged, rather than focusing on collecting data relevant only to specific themes. Findings - The key findings of this research focused around the difference between creating situations of compliance or collaboration in a supply chain context. This suggests that by understanding the relationships that exist between organisations, those in procurement and supply chain management roles will be able to better understand and manage the nuances of their supplier relationships. Research limitations/implications - The study is focused on a supply network specifically configured to facilitate sourcing and distribution of bulk grain. As such the findings need to be understood within the constraints of this context. Practical implications - Reliance on coercive power in an institutional change process is shown in our study to create a situation of compliance rather than of collaboration. Reliance on a different type of power, such as referent power, would be more successful in creating a situation of collaboration. Social implications - The sourcing and distribution of bulk grain is fundamental to food distribution in a developed economy. Our study provides a set of propositions indicating where managers can focus to more effectively manage these flows. Originality/value - The definition of the "agent" also provided an interesting point of comparison. This research found that the ultimate definition of the "agent" changes and can be linked to the institutional differences in ownership within a supply chain. This suggests the potential to redefine the way that Agency theory is discussed. The notion that the "agent" is dynamic and is likely to be the "agent", "caretaker" and more at the same time suggests the potential for the traditional definition of the agent to be challenged.

Professional institutions are increasingly confronted by fiscal constraints and political pressures to improve and increase their accountability in a competitive consumer-driven market. Accordingly, the need to ensure efficiency and accountability is of strategic importance. This article reports on a qualitative study of medical professionals that assessed the utility of financial incentives and external control methods derived from agency theory to ensure accountability of professionals. The authors argue that approaches derived from stewardship and institutional theories can extend the principal-agent perspective to sustain greater social and ethical accountability.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA.

This study analyses whether or not the effect of board independence on a firm's strategic performance is moderated by family involvement in ownership and control. Moderation of the board's size and the independent director ratio are tested under quadratic specifications. The effect of CEO duality with family involvement on long-term sales growth is also measured. The empirical analysis is conducted in the Southern European context using a sample of publicly traded firms that have concentrated ownership structures. The main findings indicate that when nonlinearities are considered, family involvement moderates the relationship between the independent director ratio and firm performance. The optimal proportion of independent directors is lower in family businesses than in non-family ones. However, the results fail to support nonlinearities for board size. We find positive linear relationships between both board size and CEO duality with firm performance, which are not moderated by family involvement.

Purpose: This paper aims to focus on governance theories and practice variables in Not-For-Profit Service Organizations. The research answers two questions: what the prevalent governance practices of Not-for-Profit Service Organizations (NPSO) are, and whether there is a crossover among NPSO governance practices and For-Profit-Organization theories in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire to the 285 organizations within the defined parameters obtained a 18 percent response. Data were collected regarding the boards' predominant roles in the organizations' governance activities, the top executives' predominant roles in the organizations' operations and their interrelationship with the boards, and the boards' most common meeting agenda topics. Findings: The findings prove that governance models in NPSO are mostly driven by Agency Theory (52 percent of the sample). Stewardship and Resource Dependence Theories also contribute to existing governance models (28 percent), while some of the organizations have developed Hybrid Models (20 percent) drawing from the various theories. Research limitations/implications: The limited number of organizations participating in the research does not allow a generalization. However the diversity of organization types and sizes within the scope do provide a panoramic view of the not-for-profit service sector. Practical implications: Having proved that there is a crossover of governance practices among For-Profit and Not-for Profit Organizations, this research opens the door to the evaluation of many other existing or potential crossovers in governance and other management elements. Originality/value: This research is novel in its approach to look for similarities rather than differences between For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Organizations. The approach allows both sectors to learn from each other and seek for fresh improvement alternatives. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

The study investigates the moderating effect of CEO (Chief Executive Officer) duality and CEO ownership on the relationship between organisational slack and firm performance. Through reviewing relevant literature on organisational slack, agency and stewardship theories, this study develops hypotheses on the relationship between organisational slack and firm performance and the moderations of CEO duality and CEO ownership. On the basis of a large data of Chinese firms, this study finds that there is a positive relationship between organisational slack and firm performance, and the moderating effect of CEO duality is positive, whereas that of CEO ownership is insignificant. The findings not only improve the understanding on the performance implication of organisational slack but also indicates that stewardship theory is more powerful than agency theory in China.

The paper aims at identifying impact of corporate governance variables i.e. board structure (board size, board independence, board activity and board busyness) and ownership structure (foreign promoters holding, institutional shareholding and CEO duality) on financial disclosures made by the Indian firms. Using cross sectional data of 325 listed firms for the financial year 2009-10, we compute financial disclosure score (using 171 checklist points) based on disclosure requirements of accounting standards. We find average disclosure score of 73%, maximum and minimum being 100% and 46% respectively. Our finding support agency theory in terms of monitoring role of board since board size is found to be significant however we do not find any influence of board independence on the disclosures. The study also supports resource dependency theory in terms of outside directorship which might provide exposure to different corporate environment, brings diverse perspectives and knowledge to the directors and this in turn leads to improved disclosures. We also support the notion that having foreign promoter shareholding improves disclosures. (c) 2014, Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

This study investigates a link between corporate governance and ownership structures on firm performance of 293 companies listed on the Main and Second Board of Bursa Malaysia from 2000- 2006. A dynamic panel system generalized method of moment technique is applied to control the endogeneity effect. After controlling for size, gearing, industry and time, this study finds significant positive relationships between institutional and foreign shareholdings using both market and accounting performance measures. These results imply their positive roles in constraining any opportunistic behavior of management. Interestingly, role duality (positions of Chairman and CEO were the same person) was observed to be negatively related to both performance measures, thus supporting the recommendation by Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG). However, contrary to agency theory and MCCG, firm performance decreases with the increase in proportion of independent directors in the board. (c) 2014, Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

This study investigates the valuation effect of board characteristics in corporate Joint Venture (JV) investments. Despite the prevalence of a board's involvement in JV decisions in practice, extant literature is mute concerning how the board adds value to JV outcomes. Investigation into board contribution in JVs is insightful due to executives' self-serving behaviors that may underlie their JV pursuits and boards' resource provision that may mitigate critical JV challenges. The former (latter) sheds light on the board's monitoring (advisory) role in a firm's JV engagement. Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study investigates the value of representative board characteristics underscored by these two theoretical perspectives. Our results show that the two conventional board measures, board size and outside director ratio, do not have a significant explanatory power. In contrast, director experience associated with JV decisions and gained from within relevant industries are found to positively impact JV outcomes. Moreover, both board meeting frequency and director ownership have favorable moderating effects on the strength of the experience-value relationship. However, these two variables per se do not independently determine a JV's value. Our research results indicate the importance of taking an integrative view to the investigation of board effectiveness, a perspective which has long been neglected in board research. The findings of the present study contribute to the mixed findings of extant studies on board influence from an uninvestigated domain, JV. (c), 2014, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

Low labor costs and market access are no longer competitive differentiators; increasingly companies are looking to design and develop new products and services as a crucial source of competitive advantage. As the pressure to innovate increases, so does the tension between shorter-term exploitative development and longer-term exploratory innovation activities. We explore this tension using interview data from software SMEs and venture capitalist firms who invest in technology-driven companies. Findings indicate that, despite firm's having established solid innovation plans, short-term exploitative demands crowd out their longer-term exploration innovation during the development phase. Agency and resource dependence theories are used to start to explore some of the reasons for this shift. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

This Chapter aims at analysing the role of the incentive and rewarding mechanism in the loose coupling PMS. Thus, it firstly identifies the purposes of the incentive and rewarding mechanism in the PMS, namely motivation, information, and recruitment and retention. After a brief introduction to the incentive theories, the discussion starts from the investigation of the incentive and rewarding process, which is composed of three main phases; the selection of the performance measures to be used in the assessment phase, the assessment and its frequency, and the model selection. Finally, the last sections provide theoretical and practical insights into the assessment of the incentive and rewarding mechanism and the dysfunctional effects resulting from the use of biased incentive and rewarding mechanisms.

In the last decade regulatory pressure includes appeals that corporate elites should reduce their multiple directorships to a minimum. The functionality of this governance mechanism is suggested by agency theory. The embeddedness view counter-argues that social relationships matter for the effectiveness of corporate governance. In particular for ill-structured tasks like stock price valuation social networks solve fundamental coordination problems in markets by reducing the risks of market exchange, by establishing a common base of recognition and by getting actions and blocking actions. For the Swiss banking sector this article shows that the social embeddedness of corporate elites reduces the volatility of stock prices. With respect to regulatory pressure against multiple directorships it recommends a more balanced view. While for investors and stakeholders certain amounts of stock price volatility are surly desirable, exorbitant fluctuations of stock prices - like in financial crises - are definitely not. Social embeddedness should therefore be considered by economic and financial theory: it does prevent the misspecification of regulatory proposals and incentive regimes.

Although studies about the determinants of CEO compensation are ubiquitous, the balance of evidence for one of the more controversial theoretical approaches, managerial power theory, remains inconclusive. The authors provide a meta-analysis of 219 U.S.-based studies, focusing on the relationships between indicators of managerial power and levels of CEO compensation and CEO pay-performance sensitivities. The results indicate that managerial power theory is well equipped for predicting core compensation variables such as total cash and total compensation but less so for predicting the sensitivity of pay to performance. In most situations where CEOs are expected to have power over the pay setting process, they receive significantly higher levels of total cash and total compensation. In contrast, where boards are expected to have more power, CEOs receive lower total cash and total compensation. In addition, powerful directors also appear to be able to establish tighter links between CEO compensation and firm performance and can accomplish this even in the face of powerful CEOs. The authors discuss the implications for theory and research regarding the determinants of executive compensation. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

This research investigates the relationship between board gender diversity and firm financial performance in the context of a transitional economy characterised by an underdeveloped corporate governance system. Using a sample of 120 publicly listed companies in Vietnam covering a 4-year period from 2008 to 2011, we examine this relationship in a dynamic modelling framework, which controls for potential sources of endogeneity. We find that board gender diversity appears to have an effect on firm performance. This finding remains robust when alternative proxies for gender diversity are employed and is consistent with the perspectives of agency theory and resource dependence theory. The number of female directors in the boardroom also matters, supporting the view that if female board representation affects firm outcomes, this effect is more pronounced when the number of female directors increases. It is observed, furthermore, that the marginal positive performance effect of board gender diversity ceases when the percentage of female directors reaches a breakpoint of about 20%. This finding suggests that there is perhaps a potential trade-off between the costs and benefits of board gender diversification. Our findings significantly contribute to the growing literature of non-US based studies, by providing robust empirical evidence from a transitional economy in East Asia. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, the relationship between ownership concentration and financial performance of companies in Singapore and Vietnam is investigated in a dynamic framework. By focusing on two different types of national governance systems (well-developed vs. under-developed), we observe how the relationship is moderated by the national governance quality. We find that the performance effect of concentrated ownership persists in these markets even after the dynamic nature of the ownership concentration-performance relationship is taken into consideration. Our finding supports the prediction of agency theory about the efficient monitoring effect of large shareholders in markets with highly concentrated ownership. In addition, we find that national governance quality does matter when explaining the ownership concentration-performance relationship. The positive effect of concentrated ownership on performance of firms operating in the under-developed national governance system (Vietnam) tends to be stronger than that in the well-established system (Singapore). This finding is consistent with the argument that ownership concentration is an efficient corporate governance mechanism which can substitute for weak national governance quality. Econometrically, our findings still hold even after controlling for dynamic endogeneity, simultaneity, and unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity, inherent in the corporate governance-performance relationship.

Organizational performance can be enhanced by effective project benefit generation. Although it identifies the project owner as the single point of accountability for the realization of project benefits, the literature does not comprehensively discuss this role in the project governance model, nor the management approaches that can support this role. Based on principal-agent theory and a control-trust-risk approach, we have conducted an empirical study across various managerial contexts. Results suggest that trust of the project owner in the project manager is more effective in a turbulent environment, whereas more control by the project owner of the project management process is a superior management approach in a more stable project setting. Finally, a project governance model is introduced and the management role of the project owner is discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

Internationally, disclosures related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy usage have increased dramatically due to trends toward increased sustainability reporting, growing concerns about climate change, and the introduction of new legislation and taxes. Audit committees, management, internal auditors, external auditors, and other stakeholders all have a potential role in relation to GHG disclosures. Our study addresses the role of internal auditors. We conducted 29 interviews with senior audit committee members, senior accountants, in-house internal auditors, and partners specializing in internal audit from the major accounting firms. These interviews allowed us to gain insights into the present role of internal auditors in GHG/energy reporting, the factors explaining internal audit's role, and the future role of internal audit. In addition, audit committee members describe their present involvement in GHG/energy reporting. We consider the consistency of our findings with three corporate governance theories (agency theory, institutional theory, and resource dependence theory). Although our results support the importance of effective monitoring consistent with agency theory, no one theory fully explains our results. (c) 2015, American Accounting Association.

This study examines the influence of board independence on firm agency cost among listed firms in Bangladesh, which feature concentrated ownership and high insider representation on corporate boards. This study uses three measures of agency cost: the 'expense ratio', the 'Q-free cash flow interaction' and the 'asset utilization ratio'. The finding of the study is that board independence can reduce the firm agency cost only under 'asset utilization ratio' measure of agency cost. These findings are robust to several robustness tests. Furthermore, the non-linearity tests suggest that the benefit of outside independent directors is generally plausible as a factor controlling agency costs in the case of a medium level of board independence. Overall, these findings do not reject the validity of agency theory, supporting the Anglo-American orthodoxy promoting outside independent directors as good monitors.

Prior studies of IPO underpricing, mostly using agency theory and single-country samples, have generally fallen short. In this study, we employ the knowledge-based view (KBV) to explore underpricing across 17 countries. We find that agency indicators are insignificant predictors, board of director knowledge limits underpricing, and external knowledge both substitutes for and complements internal board knowledge. This third finding suggests that future KBV studies should consider how internal and external knowledge states interact with each other. Our study offers new insights into the antecedents of underpricing and extends our understanding of comparative governance and the KBV of the firm. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Over the past decade, expectations for more effective oversight of risks by boards of directors have significantly increased. These expectations emanate from stock exchanges, regulators, credit rating agencies and other key stakeholders. Proponents of enhanced risk oversight argue that an increased understanding of enterprise-wide risks provides strategic benefit by helping the board and management identify and manage risks that may impact the achievement of strategic objectives while at the same time helping the board monitor the extent of risk-taking on the part of management in their desire to meet these objectives. In response to these growing expectations, some boards have asked management to explore implementation of a more holistic, top-down approach to risk oversight widely known as enterprise risk management (ERM) while others have not. Institutional theory would suggest that a number of organizations implement minimal elements of ERM for symbolic reasons, lacking substance in risk oversight. In contrast, agency theory would suggest that boards embrace explicit and robust risk oversight activities to monitor management's risk-taking actions, and resource dependence theory would suggest that they also do so to help the organization achieve strategic objectives. Little is known about the way in which boards and management organize their processes and the impact of those processes on the level of ERM adoption. More importantly, little is known about the extent to which ERM is perceived to provide strategic benefit to those organizations that have invested in developing a robust ERM process. Based on data gathered from 645 survey responses from executives of organizations spanning a number of industries and sizes, we find that organizations with greater ERM maturity are significantly more likely to have taken steps to formally engage the board and senior management in specific risk oversight tasks (consistent with agency theory), and certain board and management risk practices are associated with perceptions that ERM provides strategic advantage (consistent with resource dependence theory).

In many business schools, the field of strategic management has been elevated to the same status as more traditional subject areas such as finance, marketing and organizational behaviour. However, the field is rather unclearly delineated at present, as a result of the heavy usage of borrowed theories, a phenomenon we discuss in this article. For strategic management to become a legitimate subject area, truly at par with the more conventional fields taught in business schools, we recommend much stronger selectivity when borrowing theories from other areas of scholarly inquiry than management, as the foundation of empirical work. We propose a new model consisting of seven quality tests to assess whether proper selectivity is being applied when 'importing' concepts from other fields than management. Our perspective has major implications both for future, evidence-based strategic management research and for the field's key stakeholders such as strategy teachers, practitioners and policy makers - who rely on research outputs from strategy scholars.

Agency theory predicts that incentives will align agents' interests with those of principals. However, the resource-based view suggests that to be effective, the incentive to deliver must be paired with the ability to deliver. Using Fortune 500 boards as an empirical context, this study shows that the presence of directors who lack top-level experience but own large shareholdings is negatively associated with firm value, an effect that increases in the number of such directors. Firm value rises after such directors depart from boards, with the greatest increases occurring when many of these directors leave. While agency theory highlights the importance of the right incentives being in place, this research suggests that this can be ineffective if the right resources are not also in place.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide insights into the understanding of the relationship between board involvement and corporate performance within the context of developing countries. Design/methodology/approach - A number of aspects related to board involvement, including board's shareholdings, frequency of board meetings, availability of independent board committees, board size, CEO duality, and CEO is being a promoter, were examined in order to explore their influence on corporate performance measured in terms of earnings per share. The study mainly draws on agency theory, and is supplemented by resource dependence and stewardship theories. Multiple regression analysis is utilized to analyze the data gathered from a sample of 212 publicly listed companies in 20 industries in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings - Among the aspects of board involvement considered, board's shareholdings, board meetings frequency, independent committees, and CEO duality showed a positive influence on corporate performance. However, two other aspects, namely CEO being a promoter, and the size of corporate boards showed a negative effect. The findings also suggest that the use of multiple theories, rather than depending on a single theory, is more effective in understanding the relationships examined in this study. Further, the study highlights the need to be cautious in utilizing the theories that are more applicable to matured western economies when analyzing issues relating to developing countries. Originality/value - This study makes an original contribution to corporate governance literature by examining the relationship between board involvement and corporate performance in a developing country, namely Sri Lanka. The study also adds to the existing literature by utilizing multiple theories to examine the issue under investigation. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - Drawing upon the resource dependence theory, the purpose of this paper is to examine how the board capital diversity influences the explorative innovation of firms, attempting to resolve the inconsistent empirical findings of the effect of outside directors on firm's R&D strategy. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of Korean manufacturing firms which consider R&D capability to be one of their core competencies, the study uses negative binomial model to test the influence of board capital diversity on explorative innovation. Findings - Results support the value of moderate level of board diversity hypothesis by demonstrating that board capital diversity shows an inverted U-shaped relationship with explorative innovation. The results also suggest that CEO ownership positively moderates the relationship between board capital diversity and firms' innovative performance. Originality/value - Mainstream research has focussed on the directors' monitoring role based on agency theory, overlooking the more positive resource provision role. Taking on the concepts of board capital and exploration, the study introduces the notion that outside directors should be selected with a view as vehicles for bringing in valuable expertise and social linkages for the firm's explorative innovation.

Objective - The purpose of this work is to examine the influence of ownership concentration on the funds allocated to CSR in Brazilian firm. Design/methodology/approach - Econometric models have been estimated, with an index of CSR as the dependent variable, and ownership concentration as the explanatory variable, together with relevant control variables suggested in the literature (profitability, leverage, growth opportunities, and firm size). A Brazilian CSR database has been built using data extracted from two different sources, one relative to CSR data and another that provides ownership structure and financial data. CSR policy is proxied by an index obtained as the ratio between funds directed to social action (employee relations, external social actions, and environmental action) and net sales. Findings - The findings indicate that CSR is positively influenced by firm ownership concentration in Brazil. Practical implications - The positive influence of ownership concentration on CSR may be an indication that large controlling shareholders of Brazilian firm may be considering CSR as an effective way to improve the image and reputation of the firm and its owners. This belief may be stimulating CSR projects and their disclosure in Brazil. Originality/value - This work is an additional contribution to the debate about the role played by ownership structure on CSR. Taking into account that the central point of Stakeholder Theory is a firm's concern with all its stakeholders, the research builds on Stakeholder and Agency Theories by assessing the influence of large controlling shareholders on a firm's social concerns.

This paper examines the influence of top management team (TMT) pay structure characteristics (such as pay dispersion, long-term variable pay, and short-term variable pay) on corporate social performance (CSP) based on upper echelon theory and agency theory. The analysis using a large panel sample of US public firms reveals that long-term oriented and egalitarian TMT pay structure has a positive influence on CSP. In addition, the negative influence of short-term variable pay on CSP becomes stronger as the pay difference among TMT members becomes greater. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings will be discussed. (c) 2015 The Braybrooke Press Ltd.

This chapter provides a synoptic description of the main theories that see inter-organizational relationships as coordination and control issues: the Transaction Costs Economics theory, the Agency theory and the Resource Dependence theory. These three theories share the idea that inter-organizational relationships are founded on opportunism and bounded rationality, and that organizations seek to control the critical aspects of their business network interactions in order to pursue their goals. These three theories are often considered as complementary in literature, since they often provide opposite predictions in similar cases. Scholars interested in e-marketplaces and in the inter-organizational impacts of the Internet have mainly focused on the Transaction Costs Economics theory so far; this theory has undergone important evolution and hybridization processes, and is then more thoroughly described than the other two in this chapter.

Purpose - This study aims to develop a theoretical model that specifies the most important factors hypothesised to facilitate reciprocal knowledge transfer between nationals and non-nationals in the context of workplace quotas. Design/methodology/approach - Expatriate labour is viewed as a form of contingent employment that provides firms with ready access to experienced and specialised knowledge. We argue that in a knowledge economy, the successful use of workplace quotas for nationals depends on effective management of both nationals and non-nationals. By drawing on scholarly contributions in the areas of strategic management, agency theory, knowledge management and absorptive capacity, this paper consolidates extant knowledge and proposes a new framework aimed at developing a more integrated agenda for future research. Findings - Three broad categories are posited as strategic enablers to effective knowledge management. First, senior leadership has a direct role in developing appropriate policies, promoting transparency and fostering a culture of trust and an indirect role through the establishment of incentives. Second, the influence of incentives on both knowledge management and process improvement is addressed. Third, the characteristics of each group with regard to qualifications, motivation and receptivity are discussed. Optimally, these factors work in concert to build competencies that ultimately satisfy customers and meet organisational goals. Originality/value - There is a gap in scholarly research that explicitly links important organisational and management concepts to the study of expatriate-national interactions. This article contributes to understanding how policy makers and leaders can strengthen the transformative forces that will drive successful development of human capital.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the association between corporate ownership structures and audit fees paid to external auditors by Malaysian companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. This study focusses on the extent of the auditor's reliance on the client's internal control inasmuch as the corporate ownership structures are varied, and, ultimately, affect the audit fees. Design/methodology/approach - This study applies the agency theory in formulating three hypotheses that guide the results analysis. By employing a multi regression model for a sample of 345 Malaysian companies listed on Bursa Malaysia, this study examines the relationship of ownership structure, namely, managerial ownership, foreign ownership and government ownership with audit fees using data for 2010. Findings - The results show a significant positive relationship between audit fees and firms with larger foreign ownership and government ownership but no significant relationship with firms with higher managerial ownership. This study contributes recent evidence concerning the relationship between corporate ownership structure and audit fees. Practical implications - Regulators may consider ownership structure on the standards or regulation setting in order to be practical and operationalized in line with the impact associated with different ownership structures. The practitioners may also design appropriate methodologies and procedures for the different ownership structures for high-quality service and to standardize the risk mitigation process. Social implications - The ownership structures have different influences on the audit fees, as well as complexity of the firms and their profitability. Originality/value - The study looks upon certain percentages of ownership structures, and how they affects audit fees, firms complexity and profitability. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to draw on agency theory (AT) to develop and validate a scale to investigate customers' loyalty towards salespersons under agency problems. Especially with credence services, customer-salesperson relationships are beset by problems that stem from personal differences and conflicts of interests. Design/methodology/approach - The context is financial investment services in Indonesia. Following Churchill's (1979) procedure, initial qualitative surveys generated a pool of 44 items for the three AT asymmetries of risk, goal and information. Expert panel validation and exploratory factor analyses of a dataset (n = 429) confirmed a four-dimensional structure of 30 items. Finally, confirmatory factor analyses using a second dataset (n = 299) tested the effects of the four asymmetries on customer loyalty, and how the effects are moderated by customer trust and relationship duration. Findings - Overall, agency problems negatively influence customer loyalty. Information asymmetry has two discriminantly distinct dimension, quality and timeliness. Low trust amplifies the effects of all asymmetries, whereas relationship duration reduces the effects of only risk asymmetry. Comparison with a three-factor model shows that the four-factor scale is superior. Research limitations/implications - Service firms desiring long-term customer relationships need to be cognisant of potential asymmetries created by salespersons, and develop initiatives to minimise potential fallouts from each asymmetry. These include proper alignment of compensation structures, accurate and timely communications of product information, and matching risk profiles between customers and salespersons. Regular customer feedback regarding perceived asymmetries would also help early problem detection. Finally, the findings would inform the development of policy matters and industry best practices. Originality/value - Besides contributing to the small stream of research that applies AT to marketing, this study is the first to develop and validate an AT scale that incorporates all three asymmetries.

Understanding the value the right chief executive officer selection and tenure choices can bring to an organisation is under researched in legal jurisdictions such as Australia where there is strong separation of the role of the chief executive officer and chairperson. The chief executive officer is the key organisation strategist and plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategy as well as keeping the board of directors informed of the work of the executive team. This paper reviews and synthesises the corporate governance literature to develop the argument that a chief executive officer's professional development background and work context will impact his or her ability to favourably influence organisation performance. A series of research propositions of interest to a range of stakeholders inside and outside the organisation are developed drawing on a number of corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory, stewardship theory). This conceptual paper develops a substantial future empirical research agenda. (c) 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

Board of director member diversity has an impact on the functions each director successfully provides. Appropriate and necessary board member capabilities differ between small and large firms. Although these differences seem apparent, current research has favored studies related to large firms and neglected those related to board member needs of small firms. Grounded in Agency Theory and Resource Dependence Theory, the following manuscript theoretically suggests that firm size moderates the relationship between board member diversity and the two primary functions (monitoring and the provision of resources) of board members. Furthermore, small firms can enhance performance through appropriate member composition in differing ways than large firms. (c) 2015, Small Business Institute. All rights reserved.

This study analyzes the relationship between board size and economic-financial performance in a sample of European firms that constitute the EUROSTOXX50 Index. Based on previous literature, resource dependency and agency theories, and considering regulation developed by the OECD and European Union on the normative of corporate governance for each country in the sample, the authors propose the hypotheses of both positive linear and quadratic relationships between the researched parameters. Using ROA as a benchmark of financial performance and the number of members of the board as measurement of the board size, two OLS estimations are performed. To confirm the robustness of the results the empirical study is tested with two other similar financial ratios, ROE and Tobin's Q. Due to the absence of significant results, an additional factor, firm size, is employed in order to check if it affects firm performance. Delving further into the nature of this relationship, it is revealed that there exists a strong and negative relation between firm size and financial performance. Consequently, it can be asseverated that the generic recommendation "one size fits all" cannot be applied in this case; which conforms to the Recommendations of the European Union that dissuade using generic models for all countries.

We study the relationship between the types of issuer and the contents of the governance codes in the new-institutional theory, using a global sample of over 70 national governance codes. We hypothesise that the code recommendations are influenced by the isomorphic pressure to embrace new social practices, exerted by the different types of issuer. The findings show that codes issued involving multiple stakeholder groups and organisations in hybrid committees are more likely to: 1) include recommendations that take into account multiple political and social institutional demands; 2) adapt the mainstream agency-theory-based governance model to the national setting. Overall, the policy-making negotiations among different stakeholder groups in the local institutional setting appear to be determinant in shaping the recommendations of the code and in improving the promotion of good governance among firms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically investigate the relationship between the types of issuer and the contents of codes, in a global sample.

This study examines the association between corporate governance mechanisms and corporate disclosure in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Hypotheses based on agency theory and organisational power literature are developed and tested on 85 firms listed in Dubai and Abu Dhabi stock exchanges. The study also runs multiple regression tests on two sub-samples (46 financial firms and 39 non-financial firms) in order to provide a richer analysis for the empirical findings. Overall, the results show that the extent of firms' disclosure is positively associated with the number of board committees, debt finance, firm size and firm profitability, while it is negatively related to CEO power. This study's findings direct policymakers attention to the importance of: the composition of the board, the optimal size of the board, governing the type of knowledge required for board members, and revisiting the level of foreign ownership in UAE firms.

The purpose of this study is to examine the empirical relationship between insider ownership and firm performance. Based on resource dependence theory, this study argues that the positive convergence-of-interests effect and the negative entrenchment effect can coexist in various industrial settings. Fixed-effect panel data regression models are applied to a sample of 1,156 effective observations. To reflect the contextual role of resources, we defined industrial settings along with industrial complexity and firm scale dimensions. The empirical results supported our research hypotheses, showing that insider ownership exerts a positive effect on firm performance in a high-complexity and large-scale setting, but a negative effect in a low-complexity and smallscale setting. The results of this study imply that contextual fitness must be deliberately considered to determine effective regulations of corporate governance. In addition, this study contributes a new aspect to related discussion, which synthesizes conflicting theoretical arguments by introducing the contextual role of resources. (c) 2015, CIBER Institute.

The intellectual underpinning of much contemporary executive pay practice is to be found in agency theory, made famous by various scholars in the 1970s. Yet standard agency theory has been found wanting in various respect and has been criticised for supporting pay practices which may have contributed to the financial crisis. The Economic Psychology of Incentives proposes a revised theory of agency, drawing on ideas from behavioural economics and built on more robust assumptions about human behaviour than the standard principal-agent model. Incorporating evidence from a unique empirical study of executives from around the world, the book explains the mechanisms which link the performance of an individual senior executive, the performance of other executives who are part of the same top-management team, and corporate performance. The book proposes new design principles for executive pay, but also explains the difficulties in changing current executive pay practices. (c) Alexander Pepper 2015.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore product adoption beliefs and actions of a large retail food organization with both corporate-owned stores and privately held franchise stores. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used a case study approach involving survey data collection from 190 corporate-owned and licensed retail outlets that were members of a large, single organization. Ordinary least squares regression and mean differences (t-tests) were used to test the data. Findings were elaborated upon based upon structured interviews. Findings - Corporate-owned retail outlets invested heavily in food safety innovation, while franchised retail outlets pursued minimal investment to retain product flexibility. The level of adoption is contingent upon ownership structure, as well as institutional forces emanating from the corporate environment, the customer, and peer organizations. Research limitations/implications - The findings offer greater insight into methodological issues associated with measurement of new product adoption in particular. The authors have shown that it is critical for researchers to clarify the level of analysis of the study. Quantitative survey analysis revealed both safety and economic motivations to be desirable issues in product adoption considerations. However, when quantitative and qualitative results were combined, very different outcomes were realized as ownership structure differences appear to dominate product adoption decisions. Therefore, when conducting plural organizational form research, the data gathering efforts must be carefully undertaken to ensure that critical drivers of phenomena explored are not overlooked. Practical implications - Adoption of new product adoption involves the complex interplay between ownership structure/control, economic cost/benefit, managerial choice, and societal norms. Often, organizational research relating to adoption of new processes and innovations collects individual-level data. However, this study shows that adoption decisions occur at multiple levels and that the ownership/structural context must be considered. Social implications - The study has implications from social innovation/responsibility perspectives. Recent press regarding food safety has put pressure on food processing establishments to consider methods of reducing food safety breaches. No doubt, this has alerted the consumer to potential risks in food processing and influenced their preferences in favor of food safety innovations. Nonetheless, perceptions of the importance of "safety" can be interpreted in a variety of ways, leading to differingcourses of action. Interviews with corporate-level executives revealed that they preferred both corporate-owned and franchised retail outlets adopt case ready (CR) meats to stem safety concerns. Yet, this aspiration diffused throughout the organization differently. Originality/value - Multiple organizational structure forms operating within the same organizational entity, or "plural form" organizations, offer unique opportunities for examination. Applying various theoretical lenses, including agency theory, the resource-based theory, and institutional theory, the authors offer rationale for why different structural types within the same corporate entity may differ in their beliefs and actions concerning product safety, cost, and adoption.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore post-acquisition compensation management and examine how the two most commonly used theories to explain CEO stock option exercise, agency theory and CEO overconfidence, expect CEOs to manage their stock options following an acquisition. Design/methodology/approach - Using logistic regression analysis, the authors investigate whether CEOs are more or less likely to exercise options following an acquisition, and the effect which CEO tenure and acquisition history may have on option exercise. Findings - The results suggest that CEOs are more likely to exercise options following an acquisition. The authors also find that CEO tenure and acquisition experience are both linked to an increase in option exercise. Research limitations/implications - The findings suggest that future research should expect agency effects to outweigh overconfidence effects when considering CEO stock option exercise behavior within the post-acquisition firm context. Practical implications - This paper advises directors and shareholders about whether agency concerns or overconfidence are of greater concern and how CEO tenure and past acquisition history may influence post-acquisition CEO stock option exercise behavior, offering information valuable in designing effective corporate governance. Originality/value - This paper is among the first to explore how CEOs manage their options following an acquisition and finds that CEOs are more likely to exercise stock options following an acquisition. Post-acquisition compensation management is an important, though overlooked, consideration in improving acquisition performance. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The problem of managerial control and the concept of corporate governance have long been the subject of researches, often linked to widely known organizational theories (transaction cost theory, agency theory ...). But it seems that these analyzes, especially because they are too focused on relations with the shareholders and neglect the examination of "managerial discretion", can only incompletely account for the status and the actual behavior of top managers. The author proposes to follow various paths to overcome this situation by enriching the narrow approaches that are dominant today. (c) 2015, Lavoisier.

The Arthasastra of Kautiliya is an important Indian text on governance dating back to 300 BC. Since its rediscovery in 1905, the book has inspired many authors to interpret and to analyze its contents, as well as to discuss its importance for management today. In the present paper, it is shown that basic assumptions on agency theory are presented in this early work. These include assumptions on organization, about people and on information. It is suggested that information, control and incentives should be used in combination to make it likely that agents support the objectives of their principal. Environmental conditions seem to have influenced the choice of instruments. For instance, high-risk levels of business operations at the time called for relatively more control than for offering incentives. (c) 2015, Taylor & Francis.

In the last few decades, policy makers around the world have focused on corporate governance reform since the Asian financial crisis and scandals in the United States such as the Enron debacle. In addition, there is no doubt that banks have significant position in the welfare of any economy. Corporate governance involves in how banks' businesses and affairs are governed by its board of directors that raises a fundamental question of how this could affect banks' financial performance. The focus of this research is to investigate the relationships between some of the corporate governance variables that are related to the board of directors on the financial performance of these banks working in the Egyptian market. Thirteen banks that are listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange were selected with data collected for the period from 2011 till 2013 which is the post Egyptian revolution era. Research analyses adopted in this study are descriptive, correlation and regression analyses to test the research hypotheses. Findings of this research provide evidence that some of these variables such as board independence, foreign board members ratio, women board members ratio and board educational ratio have significant effect on the financial performance of these banks; however, board size and CEO qualities do not have any significant effect on banks' performance. The research reaches some implications that are important to different stakeholders on practical and academic levels. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All right rserved.

Accounting standard-setters suggest a normative framework to measure value creation. They are opposed to the fact companies try to escape this framework, as they fear confusion and a lack of comparability among users. This paper aims to highlight value creation representation and to identify the determinants of its disclosure. At first, we interview a sample of companies' managers to identify the information disclosed on value creation. Then, a quantitative study examines the determinants of information disclosed on the value creation in the Annual Report of 84 SBF120 index firms in 2010. Three disclosure scores are used to consider the presentation, visibility and recurrence disclosures. Thhey are then aggregated into a global score. Thhe results show that performance, leverage, ownership structure, cross-listing and firm's size are determining factors. However, the influence of these variables depends on the dimensions of disclosures.

Based on a survey and content analysis of 462 peer-reviewed academic articles over the period 1990-2014, this article reviews theories related to the external drivers of corporate social responsibility (CSR) (such as stakeholder theory and resource-dependence theory) and the internal drivers of CSR (such as resource-based view [RBV] and agency theory) that have been utilized to explain CSR. The article discusses the main tenets of the principal theoretical perspectives and their application in CSR research. Going beyond previous reviews that have largely failed to investigate theory applications in CSR scholarship, this article stresses the importance of theory-driven explanations of CSR and the complementarity of different theories. The article demonstrates that the current mainstream theorizing of CSR is dominated by theories related to the external drivers of CSR and is less developed with regard to the internal dynamics. The article outlines several productive avenues for future research: the need for multi-theory studies and more research at multiple levels of analysis, particularly at the individual level of analysis. It suggests that CSR scholarship can benefit from combining theoretical insights from a range of established theoretical lenses such as institutional theory and RBV, and can gain new insights from theoretical lenses such as Austrian economics and micro-level psychological theories.

Resource dependence theorists argue that boards of directors with political capital can benefit focal firms by reducing uncertainty and providing preferential resources. Here, we develop theory regarding the downside of board political capital. The problem of principal-principal agency is evident in many parts of the world, and we argue that board political capital can further exacerbate it by enabling large blockholders to undertake more appropriation of firm wealth. Further, we explore how this enabling effect is moderated by ownership-, industry-, and environment-level contingencies. We find empirical support for our arguments using 32,174 directors in 1,046 Chinese listed firms over the period 2008-2011. Our study sheds light on new ways in which resource dependence and agency theories can be integrated to advance the extant research on board governance and corporate political strategy.

This study looks at the relationship between project governance and project success from an agency theory and stewardship theory perspective. For that project governance was operationalized respectively as a) the extent of shareholder versus stakeholder orientation and b) the extent of behavior versus outcome control, both exercised by the parent organization over its project. A cross-sectional, worldwide online survey yielded 254 usable responses. Factor and regression analyses indicate that project success correlates with increasing stakeholder orientation of the parent organization, while the types of control mechanisms do not correlate with project success. Results support the importance of stewardship approaches in the context of successful projects.

This study takes a conceptual theory building approach to develop a framework for managing supplier sustainability risk-the adverse impact on a buying organization from a supplier's social or environmental misconduct. Using anecdotal evidence and the literature, we present four distinct risk management strategies that supply managers adopt: risk avoidance, monitoring-based risk mitigation, collaboration-based risk mitigation, and risk acceptance. Drawing on agency and resource dependence theories, we study how the interactions of two key risk management predictors-that is, the supply managers' perceived risk and the buyer-supplier dependence structure-affect supply managers' strategy choice. Specifically, we propose that a collaborative-based mitigation strategy, involving direct interaction and solution development with the suppliers, is selected by supply managers in a high perceived risk-buyer dominant context. In a low perceived risk-buyer dominant context, however, a monitoring-based mitigation strategy is preferred. When the buyer and the supplier are not dependent on each other and there is a low perceived risk, the supply managers accept the risk by taking no actions, whereas in a high perceived risk-independent context the supply managers would avoid the risk by terminating the relationship with the supplier. We conclude the study by describing the theoretical contributions and managerial implications of the study as well as the avenues for future research. (c) 2016 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.

The ownership of corporations has been studied in multiple disciplines and using diverse theoretical frameworks for several decades. Despite a wealth of research, both research gaps and contradictory findings are common. This is partly due to the fragmentation of the foci of individual studies. We synthesize the work done to date through a content analysis of 145 articles and 523 effect size estimates. On the basis of this review, we develop an integrated perspective to understand how institutional, government, family, executive, and board ownership affect a variety of firm outcomes. We conclude by offering new theoretical and contextual directions to better understand the role of ownership in shaping firm outcomes. (c) 2016, (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates whether the existence of a separate risk committee and risk committee characteristics are associated with market risk disclosures. It also tests whether the role of a risk committee in affecting market risk disclosures varies for different firm life cycle stages. Research Findings/Insights: Using 677 firm-year observations of financial firms from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries during the years 2007-2011, we find that firms with a separate risk committee are associated with greater market risk disclosures, an effect that is more pronounced for mature-stage firms. Furthermore, findings suggest that risk committee qualifications and size have a significant positive impact on market risk disclosures. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study complements the corporate governance literature by incorporating agency theory, legitimacy theory, stakeholder theory, and the resource-based theory to provide more robust evidence of the impact of a separate risk committee and the firm life cycle on market risk disclosures. Our results support the monitoring effect of a separate risk committee and suggest that a separate risk committee can improve "firm-level corporate governance" in the GCC countries characterized by a poor informational environment. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Findings from this study provide evidence that the existence, qualifications, and size of risk committees may be used as a channel to improve the disclosure level, suggesting a policy prescription for regulators and policymakers. Investors may also find these results useful in forming their own expectations about firm-level risk disclosures. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Agency theory-grounded research on boards of directors and firm legitimacy has historically viewed CEO power as de-legitimating, often taking this fact for granted in theorizing about external assessors' evaluations of a firm. With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be. Data from 151 U.S. semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms over a 10-year period generally support our predictions. (c) 2016 Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose - Theories develop over time and are influenced by both events and people. Looking primarily at the applications between contracting principal-agent relationships, the purpose of this paper is to explore how agency theory emerged from a number of economic and social developments. In doing so, the authors explain how this once dominant theory comes up short regarding varying realms of entrepreneurship as well as with multiple modern business phenomena. Design/methodology/approach - The authors first present a brief overview of agency theory. Second, the authors identify major events and people and address how they impacted the development of agency theory. Third, the authors provide insights on agency theory across three contexts (strategic entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, and family business). Implications, limitations, and future research directions are then offered. Findings - The authors provide a deeper understanding of agency theory, thus broadening its underpinnings and enabling readers to more readily understand why agency theory is limited in its explanation of certain and modern business phenomena. The authors find that some of the seminal influences to agency theory are quite dated which has limited its explanatory power in terms of the modern day business and with more recent disciplines such as entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications - The authors are limited by their choices of major events that influenced agency theory at the expense of not being able to include everything that may have impacted the theory over time. These limitations, however, are offset by the research implications. As the authors highlight the underpinning of agency theory, the authors subsequently provide scholars and practitioners with five primary boundary conditions, each of which are in need of attention for agency theory to maintain relevant explanatory power. Originality/value - A deeper understanding of agency theory can be gained by looking at its underpinnings. By presenting numerous principal-agent conflicts and demonstrating areas in which it has fallen short (i.e. entrepreneurship and more recent business phenomenon), we shed light on the obstacles agency theory must overcome in order to maintain its position as a prominent theory.

Previous studies report inconsistent findings regarding how board monitoring influences firms' research and development (R&D) intensity. This study uses agency theory and resource dependence theory to argue that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between these two constructs. By using board capital theory, the present study also postulates that this curvilinear relationship varies depending on the firm- and industry-specific human capital of outside directors. 467 firm-year observations collected from a randomly selected sample of large public firms from high-tech industries between 2005 and 2010 largely provide empirical support for these arguments. The findings contribute to the corporate governance literature by refining the understanding of the costs and benefits associated with board monitoring. The curvilinear relationship reported herein may also help reconcile prior inconsistent findings. The results also contribute to board capital theory by emphasizing the role of outside directors' firm-specific human capital in the context of R&D investments. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of the audit committee (AC) independence, financial expertise, internal audit function, audit quality and ownership concentration on earnings quality (EQ) and, consequently, ascertain whether the AC's independence and financial expertise has a moderating effect on the relationship between internal audit function and EQ. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample is 508 firms listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia (formerly known as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) for the years 2009 to 2012. EQ was measured using two modified Jones models of discretionary accruals. Findings: The findings reveal that the independence of AC and investment in internal audit function, as well as the Big4 audit firm, are related to greater EQ. Ownership concentration is found to be associated with lower EQ. The study provides evidence that AC's independence moderates the relationship between internal audit function (investment in and sourcing arrangements of internal audit function) and EQ. It also shows that AC's financial expertise moderates the relationship between sourcing arrangements of internal audit function and EQ. Practical implications: This study extends the prior related literature by examining the AC's independence and financial expertise as moderating variables on the relationship between internal audit function and EQ. Social implications: Policymakers might use the findings regarding EQ in relation to governance practices, to recognize the important roles played by the AC's independence and financial expertise on the effectiveness of internal audit function with EQ. Originality/value: This study uses the agency theory and resource dependence theory to provide empirical evidence on the impact of internal audit function and AC on EQ in the ownership concentration environment.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in the association among the board of directors, audit committee effectiveness and the cost of debt between the family- and non-family-owned companies in the Sultanate of Oman. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a panel data set that has multiple observations on the same economic units. Each element has two subscripts: the group identifier, i (68 companies listed on the Muscat Securities Market), and within the group index denoted by t, which identifies time (2005-2011). The regression model of this study is based on the random effects model, which, according to the Hausman and Breusch-Pagan (LM) (Breusch and Pagan, 1980) tests, is an appropriate model. Findings - This study finds that the association between a board of directors' effectiveness and cost of debt is negative and significant for the full sample and non-family firms. This relationship, however, is weak and not significant for family firms. Additionally, this study indicates that audit committee effectiveness has a significant effect on the cost of debt based on the full sample and family firms, but is not significant for non-family firms. Originality/value - This study examines firms in the Sultanate of Oman, where family ownership control is common. Based on a framework conceptualized according to the agency theory, using data from Oman enables a comparison between family and non-family firms with respect to the effect of the board of directors' and audit committee's characteristics as a composite measure. This composite measure captures their combined effect on the propensity of the cost of debt. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The purpose of this paper is to determine and test the effect of CEO profile including behavioral biases and demographic traits on the level of real-based earnings management (REM) in European innovative firms. Drawing on the literature on behavioral theories of leadership, neoclassical agency theory, prospect theory and signal theory, literature is developed, and hypotheses are generated, regarding CEOs attitudes toward manipulations and innovations. Data from a sample of 190 European firms and 460 CEOs spanning the years 2000-2014 are used to test the model using panel data and multiple regression. We split the total sample in two sub-samples according to the R&D intensity. Firms with high R&D intensity are considered more innovative. Not surprisingly, we find that managerial psychological and demographical traits are positively and strongly associated with REM in more innovative firms. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We tested the organization-level effects of manager pay-for-performance practices on nonmanagement employee turnover within the context of agency theory and equity theory-two frameworks commonly applied to understand compensation policy and practice. We also propose an alternative theoretical perspective that predicts that managerial pay-for-performance policies may strain the employment relationship and increase nonmanagement employee turnover, unless there are HR practices that train and incentivize managers to treat employees well. We compare these alternative models to establish how well each framework explains the observed effects. Agency theory and equity theory receive limited empirical support in our lagged panel data set of organizations, whereas broader empirical support is established for the strain effect of manager pay-for-performance on the employment relationship. We discuss the implications of our findings for compensation theory, research, and practice. (c)2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Recent studies have criticized MBA programs for their association with self-serving behavior, although there is little empirical research to establish the firm-level consequences of that relationship. We explored whether MBAs versus non-MBAs in a sample of celebrated CEOs of major U.S. companies--thus CEOs who have achieved and had opportunity to exploit their fame--were more apt than their counterparts to engage in self-serving behavior that benefits them but disadvantages their companies. We assessed this behavior via the pursuit of costly growth strategies, an inability to sustain performance, and the capacity to obtain superior private benefits in compensation. Our analysis of 444 star CEOs celebrated on the covers of major business publications confirmed that an MBA education either fosters or is related to such behavior among these executives.

Recent analyses of U.S. public family firms (PFFs) show that family firms outperform other forms of organization. However, scholars call for more studies to determine why PFFs outperform the market. High performance work systems (HPWSs) reflect the extent to which an organization adopts and implements a strategic approach in HRM practices and could be why PFFs outperform. Using the stewardship perspective, agency theory, and the resource-based view of the firm, this study empirically examines the relationship among family governance oversight, HPWS, and performance at PFFs. Using a sample of 159 Taiwanese public firms, the empirical results indicate that independent directors on the board and the level of family member board participation associate with HPWS adoption. Adopting HPWS also mediates the effect of independent directors and subjective firm performance. This finding has both theoretical and practical implications. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we examine how board characteristics, such as the independent director ratio, board size, and the number of interlocks, influence the investment of slack resources into research and development (R&D) by a firm. Both the agency theory and resource dependence theory predict a positive influence of independent director ratio on the financial slack-R&D investment relationship. However in the case of board size and number of interlocks, resource dependence theory argues for a positive moderating effect, while agency theory predicts a negative effect. The hypotheses are tested on the seven-year panel data of 172 firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry, an emerging economy, high technology industry. We find broad support for the resource provisioning role of the board of directors, which is attributed to the emerging economy context of the Indian pharmaceutical industry, where firms face high levels of opportunity but lack resources to make use of them effectively.

On the basis of agency theory and resource dependence theory, as well as other corporate governance literature, it is predicted that board composition measured as the ratio of non-executive to executive board members and the number of directors on a firm's board can be positively related to firm performance. This study seeks to test the predictions of this body of theory and to investigate the form of the empirical relationships among these effects. In so doing, this study tests theory that relates these variables in the context of a developing country, using data from South Africa's Johannesburg Stock Exchange, over a seven-year period, 2006-2012.

This study aims to investigate the influence of board interlocking in income smoothing practices in public companies with shares traded on the BM&FBOVESPA. To achieve this objective we adopted a sample comprised of 58 Brazilian companies included in the Bovespa index. The study is classified as empirical and analytical and uses as a proxy for income smoothing a metric called the "smoothing factor" (SF), obtained through the factor analysis technique using the metrics EM1 and EM3 from Leuz, Nanda and Wysocki (2003). As independent variables we employed indicators of social network analysis. From a theoretical point of view, the study is relevant and innovates in making the connection between the resource dependence theory, the agency theory and board interlocking. In practical terms, the study shows the effects of the constitutive elements of corporate social networks, arising from the board interlocking structure, on income smoothing accounting practices. Regression with panel data using fixed effects showed that the constituent elements of corporate social networks tend to influence the practice of smoothing in the sample used. The results of the study show that companies that share board members with other organizations which smooth their results tend to adopt this organizational practice more easily, which can be explained by: (i) companies causing variations in performance due to operational decisions or financial reporting choices; and (ii) managers making use of discretionary practices in the reporting of profits.

In this study we are concerned with understanding Israeli entrepreneurs' selection criteria in choosing a venture capital (VC) firm. Our primary aim was to investigate how startup experience impacts entrepreneurs' trade-offs between resource-related criteria and criteria related to the conditions of the deal. Hypotheses are drawn from agency theory, the resource dependence perspective and extant VC research. Data is gleaned from interviews with 144 Israeli entrepreneurs that are either in the process of acquiring VC or have recent experience of raising it. Hypotheses are tested with ordinal logit models. Results demonstrate that there is a negative relationship between startup experience and the importance entrepreneurs attach to valuation, and that the importance attached to a VC firm's network and reputation moderates this relationship. In addition, the importance attached to a VC firm's network moderates the relationship between startup experience and the importance assigned to contractual terms. Furthermore, results indicate that while inexperienced entrepreneurs attach more importance to valuation than experienced ones, they tend to emphasize it less when they seek to gain access to a VC firm's network of contacts. Entrepreneurs are shown to be more concerned about valuation when they approach less reputable VC firms, particularly if the entrepreneur has substantial startup experience.

This paper examines the effects of board quality on the relationship between corporate bankruptcy and nomination committee effectiveness. We argue that the proportion of outside directors, a proxy of board quality, arguably captures the extent of board control and resources. Based on dataset from 1835 firm-year observations for 98 bankrupt and 269 non-bankrupt UK listed non-financial firms between 1994 and 2011 and using the agency and resource dependence theories, we predict and find that nomination committee effectiveness negatively affects corporate bankruptcy and that board quality mitigates the negative effects. The results lend support to the notion that firms benefit from board quality in terms of outside directors' ability to monitor CEO on behalf of shareholders and also provide advice, counsel and legitimacy to the firm. This study extends the present research on corporate bankruptcy by providing evidence on the impact of board quality and nomination committee effectiveness on UK corporate bankruptcy.

The audit committees, as a part of the internal corporate governance mechanisms, play an important role to enhance the financial reporting quality. The busyness of audit committee members of a firm in boards and committees of other firms can affect its independent functioning, ceteris paribus. The current study examines, first, the association between multiple directorships of audit committee members and quality of financial reporting in India, second, whether endogenously determined busyness limits of busyness of the audit committee members provide better insights than those exogenously mandated by regulators. The study finds that endogenously determined busyness limits of sub-samples and the full sample explain the association between multiple directorships of audit committee members and financial reporting quality in a better way than those stipulated by regulators. Further, a lower (higher) level of busyness of audit committee members enhances (deteriorates) financial reporting quality of firms. (c) Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study assesses the link between nomination committees' presence and size as well as male directors on nomination committee and gender diversity in Ghanaian boardrooms. We use a dataset of 25 listed and 20 unlisted Ghanaian firms for January 2006 to December 2012; nine years after the Ghana Government endorsed an Affirmative Action Plan to achieve 40% representation of women on all boards by the year 2000. We employ probit and logit regressions to test our hypotheses. Listed firms and financial institutions are more likely to have more gender diverse boards. By contrast, we have no evidence to support the link between board gender diversity and board size, firm age, firm size, firm ownership, board composition and nomination committees' presence and size as well as male directors on nomination committee. Overall, our results raise questions on the appropriateness of the continual use of both the agency and resource dependency theories in explaining board gender diversity in developing economies' perspective.

This paper employs agency theory and resource dependence theory to explore relationships between Australian national sport governing bodies and commercial tour operators. These relationships produce domestic and international travel packages to major sport events and can provide commercial revenue to sport governing bodies. The research identifies agency challenges inherent in the relationships and how these are managed by sport governing bodies. Findings indicate that while sport governing bodies and tour operators interact to generate revenue, the two parties have divergent attitudes toward risk, particularly risks associated with pursuit of profit. The sport governing bodies manage interaction with tour operators through control of event tickets, a perishable and finite resource. The research contributes insights into the challenges confronting sport governing bodies attempting to diversify revenue into commercial sport tourism, as well as the underexplored role of sport bodies in facilitating major event tourism.

Committees on a board of directors are now subject to recommendations by regulations in practically all jurisdictions. At the same time, scholarly work on the topic has escalated since the mid-1990s. In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

This paper proposes to investigate the postulations of renowned agency theory and shareholder value (SHV) in relation to corporate governance (CG) attributes. SHV is of a great concern to the shareholders of firms. SHV have been investigated by numerous studies of CG but with inconsistent empirical evidence. This study will focus on investigating the impact of CG attributes on SHV measured by Tobin's Q or return on both equity and assets. The paper conceptualized four attributes (Separate leadership, proportion of Independent director, independent chairman, independence of nomination committee) from CG mechanism in relation to SHV in companies listed on BURSA Malaysia. This is a conceptual paper which proposes to investigate the relationship between SHV and separate leadership, SHV and proportion of independent director, SHV and independent chairman, SHV and independence of nomination committee in the context of Malaysia. The proposed study has value for Malaysian government, policy makers, corporate boards, stock exchange and shareholders by highlighting the distinct impact on SHV and its relation with separate leadership, proportion of independent director, independent chairman, and independence of nomination committee.

During the past 20 years, a rich but diverse body of theoretical and empirical work has accumulated on information technology outsourcing (ITO). Researchers have studied ITO from over 20 theoretical perspectives - including theories from economics (e.g., Transaction Cost Economics, Agency Theory), strategy (e.g., Resource-Based View, Resource Dependency Theory), sociology (e.g., Relational Exchange Theory, Social Capital Theory, Innovation Diffusion) and natural sciences (e.g., Punctuated Equilibrium Theory) (Barney, 1991; Eisenhardt, 1989; Ekeh, 1974; Gould and Eldredge, 1977; Nahapiet and Ghosal, 1998; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978; Rogers, 1983; Williamson, 1991). By appropriating so many theories, researchers have tested a large number of relationships between independent and dependent variables. Because of this diversity, findings from the overall body of empirical ITO literature have been difficult to summarize, analyse, and evaluate succinctly.

Agency theory, despite its influential normative prescriptions, has been subject to a long-standing critique from management scholars for being theoretically inconsistent and empirically unsubstantiated. The article examines how agency theory is rooted in contractarian theory of the firm that by and large renders extant corporate law irrelevant and instead emphasizes the auxiliary benefits of the market (i.e. financial markets). What is addressed as 'the market for corporate control', based on the ceaseless pricing of the shares and bonds issued by public firms, is portrayed as a more effective mechanism for disciplining managers and monitoring the corporate system than corporate legislation and court ruling. This argument, derived from elementary neoclassic economic theory, turns a blind eye to the historical roots of corporate law and overstate the ability of the, e.g., shareholders to assess managerial decision-making on basis of information available in the market. Ultimately, agency theorists and contractarians, in their pursuit of free-market capitalism, seek to disconnect the corporate system from the authority and regulatory control of the state.

When organizational leaders undertake sustainability-related initiatives, they are concerned with whether or not their key stakeholders perceive their organization and its actions to be legitimate. In this chapter, legitimacy is defined, the types of legitimacy are described, the benefits of being seen as legitimate and having a positive reputation are discussed, and actions used to manage legitimacy are reviewed. Communication helps manage perceptions of the legitimacy of industries as well as individual organizations. Message credibility is important. Standardized communication directed simultaneously toward multiple internal and external stakeholders is discussed (i.e., annual public meetings, websites and sustainability reports, reporting frameworks, certifications, and architecture such as LEED-certified office buildings). Best practices are provided. The chapter reviews stakeholder theory and discusses the need to adapt messages to engage different stakeholders. In addition, theories or theoretical concepts highlighted include population ecology theory, resource dependency theory, institutional isomorphism, agency theory, normative discourse, the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion, actor-network theory, speech act theory, attribution theory, visual rhetoric, narrative theory, and organizational co-orientation theory. Interview data drawn from a variety of organizational types illustrates the applicability of theory and research. Organizations represented include Tyson Foods; WasteCap Nebraska; Missoula Sustainability Council; Ecotrust; the Neil Kelly Company; the Arbor Day Foundation; Aspen Skiing Company; the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville; the City of Boulder; Sam's Club; Assurity Life Insurance; Heifer International(r); the Natural Resources Defense Council; the University of Colorado, Boulder; and the University of Colorado, Denver.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a model explaining the roles of right-hand person and the factors contributing to the successful relationship between the top executive and the right-hand person. Design/methodology/approach - In-depth qualitative case studies are conducted. Longitudinal observations, interviews with six right-hand persons and the top executives in three organizations are conducted to test the propositions of the model. Findings - Results indicate that different types of congruence between the top executive and the right-hand person are required when the right-hand person is performing the roles of an implementer and joint decision maker. Research limitations/implications - This study extends the leadership literature by investigating the phenomenon of right-hand person of the top executive, which has seldom been studied systematically or scientifically. It provides insights and serves as a stepping stone for future research in this area. One key limitation is that it is a qualitative study with limited samples under investigation. Practical implications - Practical implications concerning how to build up a successful relationship between the top executive and the right-hand person can be drawn from the proposed model. Insight concerning how to collaborate between the top executive and the right-hand person can be drawn from the in-depth case analyses. Social implications - The phenomenon of right-hand person is not limited to business organizations. The collaboration between the key decision maker and his chief assistant should be applicable to other contexts such as non-government organizations. Originality/value - To the best of the knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates the right-hand person phenomenon in the literature. As the right-hand person of the top executive can have important influence on organizational performance, the study may serve as the stepping stone for further understanding of this important phenomenon.

This chapter describes a theoretical framework that can be used to understand the impact of board gender diversity on board effectiveness and firm performance. It highlights four key theories: agency theory, resource dependency theory, gender role theory and upper echelons theory. The chapter reviews the arguments in the corporate governance literature for greater female boardroom representation. It deals with the ethical case and it considers the business case. The former is concerned with the principle that there should be no discrimination in the workplace, while the latter focuses on the benefits that women bring to the boardroom by drawing from a broader talent pool of directors. The chapter reviews the possible costs associated with an increase in the gender balance of boards. It concludes with an evaluation of the evidence, both positive and negative, concerning the effectiveness of greater female boardroom participation in improving business performance.

This paper attempts to presents a literature review on Agency Theory and its relevance in understanding the relationship between Government and the HEIs. It discusses the general aspects of the theory and also reviewed some previous studies that have applied the theory. Theories as we know help us to accomplish many important outcomes in academia. They help us to organize our thoughts and ideas about the world and also help us generate and explain relationships, complex or otherwise, between individuals or among groups. Theories also help us improve our predictions and expectations about people, groups or organizations, while at the same time giving us a better understanding of the world around us. Attempt has also been made to relate the application of the Principal - Agent theory to Higher Education, especially public universities with regards to their governance and funding. It is a well-known fact that Governments provides the greater part of funds required by the public universities. In this case therefore the Government has some expectations on these universities, especially with regards to the utilization of the funds provided and also the need for accountability, as the funds so provided, is tax payers' money and must therefore be accounted for. The theory is also expected to provide a useful framework for performance funding procedures in the public universities. Copyright (c) 2016 International Business Information Management Association

Stakeholder has been a common word in managers' and practitioners' vocabulary since R. Edward Freeman published his landmark book in 1984. Since then, the concept has also been employed in the public sector domain as a means for depicting the sort of stake public organization actors are able to impose upon both administration and policies. As public organizations worldwide were very influenced by managerialistic thoughts over the last three decades or so, managers increased the adoption of practices that focused rather on efficiency than effectiveness. Due to the importance of the understanding of the environment upon decision-making, other theories of resource dependence, institutionalism, advocacy coalition framework, social network, agency theory, urban regime theory, so on and so forth were adopted. In this chapter we present evidence collected from local government organizations through case studies in order to ascertain the importance and depiction of a whole set of stakeholders capable of influencing the decision-and policy-making processes within public organizations. At the end of the chapter, we provide evidence on the utility of a model constructed to reduce the complexity of stakeholder identification and engagement for public organizations. Focusing on the governance concept we contend that public managers need to engage in relationships with stakeholders as the only way to make public organizations more effective and local communities more engaged and proactive.

Manuscript type: Empirical Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically determine whether the one-rule-fits-all approached adopted by the Nigerian Securities Exchange Commission in terms of the separation of board chairman form the CEO promotes firm performance irrespective of the firms' ownership structures, in Nigerian with strong dominance of family owned firms. Design/methodology/approach: The study is restricted to firms quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Pooled data for 18-years period 1994-2011 were collated from published annual reports and statement of accounts of 91 ownership dispersed firms and 72 ownership concentrated firms. Two equation system Ordinary Least Square multiple regressions were used to estimate the relationship between firm financial performance and CEO duality along ownership structures in Nigeria. Findings: The findings of the study showed that while board duality was negative in predicting the financial performance of ownership dispersed firms; same cannot be said of ownership concentrated firms (family owned firms) as duality was found to be positive in predicting financial performance. Research Limitations/Implications: Paucity of substantial local literature on institutional perspective of agency constitutes the major limitation of this study. Although, this study is meant to close this gap, the implication is that foreign theoretical and empirical literature standpoint constitutes the bulk of the review, which may not explain reasons for any identifiable local trends in Nigeria. Practical Implication: The study reveals the importance of taking into cognizance, institutional perspective of agency theory in solving the excess power assigned to the board of directors, especially for family owned firms, where the family members have strong incentive to monitor the managers. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the institutional perspective of agency theory from Nigerian institutional perspective. The study revealed the importance of accommodating individual country specificities in draft corporate governance laws. (c) 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

From the Agency Theory point of view, the role of the board of directors is critical for supervision as well as for the control performed over management, preventing opportunistic behavior by shareholders in general and particularly by controlling shareholders against minority shareholders. Some corporate scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Nortel Networks and AIG, among others) have led to a growing interest on the quality of corporate government because all of those failed firms showed failures in their corporate governance. The delimitation of board functions and the identification of new good practices that allow them to perform their role properly and efficiently is one of the main challenges for governments and regulators in order to ensure their control mechanism duties, whilst restoring the confidence of decision-makers (investors and creditors). In fact, scholarly literature on the subject has linked board performance to different issues (for instance: board structure, nomination practices, diversity, experience and training, internationalization, incentives, remuneration, or board committees). Below is a review of the principles, practices and proposals arisen at the international context to improve board of directors' practices. The purpose of this overview is to point out the main challenges for the future in this regard. (c) 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

Multinational corporations (MNCs) are facing increasing pressure on two fronts - the demand for more transparency and disclosure and the need to implement good corporate governance practices. This paper develops several testable hypotheses that address these issues based on agency theory and stakeholder management approach arguments. As such, the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs and firm-level governance structures are discussed. CSR is measured using Transparency International's study on the disclosure practices of the world's largest MNCs. Links between board size, board independence, and duality are explored. The results indicate that board independence and board size are strongly and positively related to several CSR practices. In addition, extractive industries have a significant and positive impact on the level of CSR activities. Policy and managerial implications related to these findings are also discussed.

Research summary: Cash can create shareholder value when used for adaptation to unfolding contingencies, but can also reduce value when appropriated by other stakeholders. We synthesize arguments from the behavioral theory of the firm, economic perspectives like agency theory, and the value-creation versus value-appropriation literatures to argue that the implications of cash for firm performance are context-specific. Cash is more beneficial for firms operating in highly competitive, research-intensive, or growth-focused industries that are typical of contexts requiring adaptation in the face of uncertainties. Conversely, cash is more detrimental to performance in firms that are poorly governed, diversified, or opaque, as are typical of contexts where stakeholder conflicts, information asymmetries, or power imbalances can encourage value appropriation by other stakeholders. Managerial summary: Cash can create shareholder value when used for adaptation to unfolding contingencies, but can also reduce value when appropriated by other stakeholders. While cash-rich firms have higher performance on average, with those in the 75th percentile having a market-to-book value 15 percent higher than those in the 25th percentile, we find that the performance benefits of cash depend on the context. Cash is more beneficial for firms operating in highly competitive, research-intensive, or growth-focused industries that are typical of contexts requiring adaptation in the face of uncertainties. Conversely, cash is more detrimental to performance in firms that are poorly governed, diversified, or opaque, as are typical of contexts where stakeholder conflicts, information asymmetries, or power imbalances can encourage value appropriation by other stakeholders.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine the impact of Shari'ah supervisory boards (SSBs) on the performance of Islamic banks (IBs). It also tests whether SSBs' attributes affect the performance of IBs. Based on a sample of 1, 803 Islamic bank-year observations from 82 banks in 15 countries over the period 1993-2014 and controlling for factors known to affect bank performance, this study reveals a robust and significant positive relationship between SSBs and Islamic bank performance. This study also shows that the characteristics of SSBs affect the performance of IBs. This research reveals how SSBs influence the performance of IBs, as well as the processes and roles SSBs use to ensure Shari'ah compliance in business transactions. Design/methodology/approach - The purpose of this study design is to relate SSB presence, size and diversity to financial performance using three techniques. The first technique is a multivariate data analysis that analyzes data arising from more than one variable. The second technique is a clustered regression (clustering by bank), which corrects for serial correlation and produces unbiased t-statistics. Because this sample is drawn from panel data, it is expected serial autocorrelation of the independent variables and error term within banks. In cases where within-company correlation exists, t-statistics based on average regression coefficients from year-by-year regression are upwardly biased and potentially severe (Peterson, 2009). Therefore, this study uses a technique that agrees with Stock and Watson (2002), who show that the standard method of calculating heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors for the fixed-effects estimator generates inconsistent variance estimates. Thus, using the clustered regression is consistent with the fixed-effects estimator. The third technique is a two-stage least-squares regression that helps build an instrumental variable for robustness tests purposes. Findings - The findings suggest that large corporate boards and large SSBs are more efficient in dealing with different monitoring and advisory roles than small SSBs. Consequently, this suggests that increasing the size of corporate boards and SSBs should improve monitoring and advisory functions, management behavior and organizational performance. Research limitations/implications - It is possible that there is an upper limit to this benefit, however; we do not explore this limit, which therefore provides opportunities for additional research. Because Shari'ah compliance relates only to a rational legal framework of negative screening relegated to interest prohibition and limiting uncertainty. The interest prohibition and limiting uncertainty have not been investigated between the two samples due to data unavailability. In addition, limited accounting-based measures of financial performance may not accurately portray IB performance; hence, an additional market measure is implemented, which is Tobin's Q. Practical implications - Ultimately, these findings could help IBs improve their financial results by enhancing their internal and external governance mechanisms (Walsh and Seward, 1990). They provide a basis for developing larger, more diverse SSBs that are more focused on complying with Shari'ah and corporate governance. The results also have significant policy implications for improving firm-level corporate governance versus improving country-level institutional factors. Both views have their advocates. However, it is very difficult to reform the legal system in a short time. Still, this study shows that struggling IBs have a way to improve their corporate governance and simultaneously improve their financing environment. Originality/value - This research contributes to the literature on the effects of SSBs on IBs' organizational financial performance, processes and roles. It is the first to examine empirically the underpinnings of how SSBs affect organizational financial performance via agency theory and contingency theory. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

The recent financial crisis has brought to the forefront the need for companies to effectively manage their risks. In this regard, one approach that has gained prominence is enterprise risk management (ERM). Importantly, little is known about the link between ERM and the financial reporting process. This link is critical, because it is imperative that financial reporting adequately depicts the financial status (e.g., valuations, estimates) and associated risks of a company as revealed by ERM. Additionally, from an auditing perspective, ERM affects the risks of misstatement, which should impact audit planning. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to examine the experiences of audit partners, CFOs, and audit committee (AC) members ("the governance triad") on the link between ERM and the financial reporting process. To determine whether members of the governance triad focus on monitoring, strategy, or both, we also examine their definition of and experiences with ERM with respect to agency and/or resource dependence theory. To address these issues, we conduct semistructured interviews of experienced individuals that form the governance triads from 11 public companies. There are three major findings from our study. First, importantly, all three types of participants see a strong link between ERM and the financial reporting process. Second, despite recognition of the broad nature of ERM, the predominant experiences of the actual roles played by triad members center on agency theory, while resource dependence may be relatively underemphasized by all triad members. Finally, CFOs and AC members indicate that auditors may be especially underutilizing ERM in the audit process, suggesting an "expectations gap.". (c) CAAA

This study relies on environmental stewardship, a stakeholder-enlarged view of stewardship theory, and institutional theory to analyze the relationship between CEO compensation and firms' environmental commitment in a worldwide sample of 520 large listed firms. Our findings show that environment friendly firms pay their CEOs less total compensation and rely less on incentive-based compensation than environment careless firms. This negative relationship is stronger in institutional contexts where national environmental regulations are weaker. Our findings have important theoretical meaning and practical implications. Results show that CEOs do not necessarily act opportunistically; rather some of them may be willing to act as stewards of the natural environment and accept a lower, less incentive-based compensation from environment friendly firms. This study also provides evidence of the important influence of the institutional context in setting-up CEO compensation as the relationship is stronger when national environmental regulations are weaker. Our findings question the universal validity of agency theory in explaining CEO compensation. Compensation based on pecuniary incentives might be less indicated to motivate CEOs who feel rewarded by playing a stewardship role for environment friendly firms. When designing compensation for CEOs, compensation committees and external compensation advisors should consider psychological and institutional factors that might affect CEO motivation.

The relationship between HRM and well-being has received a significant amount of research attention; however, results are still contested. Our study addresses this phenomenon in the Higher Education sector. We specifically investigate the association between performance management and the perceived well-being of academic staff. Our research finds that the application of a directive performance management approach, underpinned by agency theory ideas as evidenced by a high reliance on performance measures and targets, is negatively related to academics' well-being (i.e. the more it is used, the worse people feel). In contrast, an enabling performance management approach, based on the learnings of stewardship theory, emphasising staff involvement, communication and development, is positively related to academics' well-being. We also find the positive relationship between enabling practices and well-being is mediated by how academics experience their work (i.e. their perceptions of job demands, job control and management support). These results indicate that current trends to intensify the use of directive performance management can have consequences on the energy and health of academics, which may influence their motivation and willingness to stay in the profession. This research suggests that an enabling approach to managing performance in this context, may have more positive effects. (c) 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine whether there is any improvement in the extent and quality of corporate social responsibility disclosures (CSRD) in Malaysia between 2011 and 2014 and to determine the factors that influence the extent and quality of CSRD in these two years. Also, this study examines the methods of disclosures and the items that largest Malaysian companies addressed. Design/methodology/approach - A self-constructed CSR is utilised to measure the extent and quality of CSRD in the annual reports of the top 71 Malaysian companies listed in Bursa Malaysia for the years 2011 and 2014. Multiple regressions along with their associated toolkits for data verification and diagnostic tests are used to assess the improvement in CSRD between 2011 and 2014 and the factors that affect CSRD. Findings - Results show a slight increase in the extent and quality of CSRD between 2011 and 2014. With regards to the factors influencing CSRD, only awards are found to be significant in determining the extent and quality of CSRD either in 2011 or in 2014. Board size, ownership concentration, independent non-executives and return on assets influence both the extent and quality of CSRD in 2011. Director ownership and firm size determine the extent and quality of CSRD in 2014. Government ownership only influences the extent of CSRD in 2011. Research limitations/implications - Some traditional limitations are found to be considered in future research, such as the use of annual reports as the only source of CSRD information. Results support the legitimacy theory that assumes that Malaysian companies disclose CSR information as a reflection of the incidents that happen in that environment of the firm without ignoring the role of the government in pushing those companies towards being socially responsible by issuing regulations, or in motivating those companies by introducing awards and giving fiscal facilities. Practical implications - The results help the policymakers to introduce more awards in some domains that were less addressed by Malaysian companies and also to examine the causes behind the non-influence of the new Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG 2012) on CSRD. Originality/value - The study can be considered as one of the limited empirical studies that assess the changes in CSRD before and after the issuance of MCCG 2012 in Malaysia.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

Board leadership has always been conceptualized as a tradeoff between two desirable yet mutually exclusive organizational attributes. Classical organization theory prescribes unity of command, achieved by combining the chief executive officer (CEO) and board chair positions; in contrast, agency theory prescribes independent monitoring, achieved by separating the CEO and board chair positions. Extant theory does not acknowledge the possibility that a compromise might exist between these competing theoretical prescriptions, one which might reduce their mutual exclusivity. Such a compromise has emerged in practice, however: the lead independent director. In the present research, we initiate theoretical exploration of this compromise between the prescriptions of agency theory and classical organization theory, addressing the questions of when a board will choose to appoint a lead independent director, who among the independent directors will serve in the position, how lead independent director appointment will impact firm performance, and whether this compromise is a permanent solution or a stepping stone to a more extreme outcome. Analysis of S&P 1500 firms from 2002 to 2012 reveals that lead independent director appointment reflects balanced power on the board, impacts firm performance positively under the right conditions, and generally becomes institutionalized as a permanent governance structure.

Taking a combination between agency theory and resource dependence theory, we point out that directors' capital may have an effect on R&D strategies. A sample of both high-tech and low-tech industries for the period 2007-2011 is used. The results indicate that, regardless of the type of industry and the specific expertise on R&D intensive companies, board members with multiple directorships influence R&D corporate strategies. The resources acquired by directors through their experience and connections positively influence R&D intensity, but only if directors can carry out their monitoring activity adequately. This evidence implies a step forward in the understanding of the role of board of directors in corporate strategy, thus having significant implications for academics, companies and regulators, which are both theoretical and practical.

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

Conventional agency theory typically focuses on a unidirectional problem, in which an agent behaves opportunistically against the interests of a principal. Yet, this conceptualization is too limited to fully describe all aspects of principal-agent relationships. This article presents a more comprehensive framework explaining a potential three-directional problem--that is, (i) agents behave opportunistically against the interests of principals, (ii) principals behave opportunistically against the interests of agents, and (iii) relationships between agents and principals representing confluence of interests affect the interests of third-party stakeholders. The article provides evidence of these problems, describes their unique characteristics, and outlines implications for society. It concludes with a discussion focusing on the implications of the proposed framework for purported governance solutions, the ongoing debate between shareholder and stakeholder views of the firm, and business practices.

In this study we introduce a justice perspective to examining the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards over the allocation of firm residuals that ultimately determines CEO compensation. Framing CEO pay as the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards focuses attention on the power of CEOs to increase their share of firm residuals in the form of increased compensation, and the diligence of boards of directors to constrain CEO opportunism. Framing this negotiation through a theory of justice offers an alternative perspective to the search for pay-performance sensitivity. We predict and find that as board diligence in controlling opportunism declines and CEO power increases, CEOs are increasingly able to capture a larger portion of firm residuals relative to shareholders. This finding supports critics who charge that CEO pay violates norms of distributive and procedural justice. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Purpose: Presently, one of the major governance issues faced by management and shareholders of organizations is the gender composition of the boards of directors and audit committees. This study aims to examine the impact of gender diversity in audit committees on the accuracy of management earnings forecasts disclosure in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample comprises 190 Malaysian companies issuing IPOs that transformed into public companies during the period 2002-2012. Earnings forecasts accuracy (quality) is proxied by absolute forecast error and the study model is developed based on the frameworks of the signalling theory, the agency theory and the resource-dependence theory. Findings: The study proposes that female directors introduce a set of specific features in the boardroom that serve to improve investor protection and efficient monitoring of management. However, findings reveal an insignificantly positive relationship between gender diversity in audit committees and absolute forecast error, which shows that more female directors in audit committees could translate into more errors and less accuracy in earnings forecasts. Practical implications: Considering the recent regulatory developments that encourage the number of women on the board of directors, the findings obtained have significant implications for policymakers. The study findings can also be invaluable to investors, investment analysts, market players and researchers. Originality/value: The composition of the board of directors and audit committees in terms of gender plays a significant role in the promotion of effective corporate governance practices. This study is one of the pioneering studies that examines the advantages of gender diversity in the board of directors. It is also the first study to extend IPO literature by investigating the role of gender diversity in audit committees in the enhancement of accurate management earnings forecasts included in the IPO prospectuses.

This paper investigates the relationship between decision making power of chief executive officers (CEOs) and corporate capital structure in the context of emerging market characterized by deep collectivism and less prescriptive regulatory and legislative environment. Using a sample of 297 firms listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange SMEs Board from 2009 to 2013, it finds a hump-shaped association between CEO power and leverage suggesting a strong nonlinearity between these two variables. Furthermore, the results show that the entrenchment effect of CEO power on firm leverage becomes more fiercely in state-owned firms. Our findings are robust to alternative calculation procedures for the CEO power index and to alternative estimation techniques. The shareholders and policy makers might leverage our findings to improve the performance of CEOs in the Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Motor carriers' operational safety affects multiple stakeholders including truck drivers, motor carriers, insurance companies, shippers, and the general public. In this article, I devise and test theory regarding motor carriers' longitudinal performance for three classes of safety behaviors linked to carriers' accident rates--Unsafe Driving, Hours-of-Service Compliance, and Vehicle Maintenance--tracked by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration as part of the Compliance, Safety, and Accountability (CSA) program. Specifically, I draw on core concepts from sociological agency theory and resource dependency theory to devise middle-range theory that generates never-before-tested hypotheses regarding carriers' longitudinal safety performance for these classes of safety behaviors after the start of the CSA program. The hypothesized predictions are tested by fitting a series of multivariate latent curve models to four years of panel data for a random sample of 484 large, for-hire motor carriers operating in the United States. The empirical findings corroborate the theoretical predictions and remain after robustness testing. These findings have important implications for scholars, motor carrier managers, procurers of motor carrier transportation services, and public policy makers.

Performance appraisal interviews remain central to how employees are scrutinised, rewarded and sometimes penalised by managers. But they are also often castigated as ineffective, or even harmful, to both individuals and organisations. Exploring this paradox, we highlight the influence of agency theory on the (mal)practice of performance appraisal. The performative nature of human resource management increasingly reflects an economic approach within which its practices are aligned with agency theory. Such theory assumes that actors are motivated mainly or only by economic self-interest. Close surveillance is required to eliminate the risk of shirking and other deviant behaviours. It is a pessimistic mind-set about people that undermines the supportive, co-operative and developmental rhetoric with which appraisal interviews are usually accompanied. Consequently, managers often practice appraisal interviews while holding onto two contradictory mind-sets, a state of Orwellian Doublethink that damages individual learning and organisational performance. We encourage researchers to adopt a more radical critique of appraisal practices that foregrounds issues of power, control and conflicted interests between actors beyond the analyses offered to date.

Purpose: Using a contingency approach, the purpose of this paper is to study how organizational factors (such as the organizational life cycle, firm size, firm ownership concentration and firm technology) determine the relative importance of the monitoring and provision of resources roles provided by board members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights the importance of contingency factors in carrying out board's roles using a sample of 579 European firms registered in the STOXX Europe 600 index. The authors used a longitudinal analysis for the period from 2002 through to 2011. Findings: The results show that the monitoring role is more relevant for companies that are large, are operating at the mature and stagnant stages, have a dispersed ownership and are low-technology. However, the provision of resources role is more relevant for companies that are in the growth and stagnant stages, and have a concentrated ownership. Originality/value: The traditional analysis that relates the board's structure and composition to the board's roles focuses on determining what board should be the best. It plays little attention to analyzing which organizational factors affect the importance and presence of monitoring or resource dependence roles. In this regard, this work adds significant insights to agency theory and resource dependence theory as, with a contingency framework, the research aims to find what functions the board needs to develop in order to get better firm performance.

Contract farming (CF) agreements are presently being restructured to form part of more complex Inclusive Business (IB) set-ups. Additional instruments, alongside CF, are implemented to overcome the challenges of CF and to adapt to the policy environment in which the different stakeholders operate. This paper develops a theoretical framework that gives insight into how these complex entities are structured and operate in a developing country context. This theoretical analysis takes a holistic approach by adopting elements of existing theories to form a new critical research paradigm: (i) Resource Dependence Theory to incorporate the wider operating environment in which the two cases operate, (ii) Transaction Cost Economics to explain the internal efficiency of the different models, and (iii) Agency Theory to account for the safeguard mechanisms. This new framework is then tested on two complex IBs that aim to integrate smallholder farmers into the commercial value chain, but which have each implemented a different institutional set-up developed around CF arrangements. It finds that a high dependence by the offtaker in the first case study stimulates a higher level of commitment and investment by this stakeholder in the contract arrangement. In turn, this increases the asset specificity aspect, which then requires safeguards to ensure the smallholders adhere to the contractual agreement. A higher dependency in this particular study also resulted in a higher number of smallholders being engaged in the contract, requiring mechanisms to efficiently monitor and coordinate them.

We combine agency theory with the law and finance approach to analyze how the legal protection of investors and the corporate ownership structure affect corporate investment in research and development (R&D). We use information from 956 firms from the five most R&D-intensive industries in 19 developed countries. Our results show that better protection of investors' rights by the institutional environment has a positive influence on corporate R&D. We also find that corporate ownership concentration works as a substitute for legal protection. This finding means that R&D investment of the firms in the countries with poor legal protection increases as ownership becomes more concentrated. Our results also show that the identity of shareholders has a relevant effect: Whereas banks and nonfinancial institutions as shareholders result in lower R&D, institutional investors as shareholders increase corporate investment in R&D.

The authors also observe that financial expertise on the AC is not related to corporate insolvency. These associations are robust to different specifications, while after controlling for board composition, board size, the number of board meetings, CEO duality, financial and firm characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The study's approach has two main limitations: neglect of small and medium private unquoted firms and more regulated corporate governance environment. Practical implications - The findings lend support to the continual use of the agency theory as an explanation in understanding the role of the analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of the AC in reducing the likelihood of insolvency. Social implications: The findings support continued efforts to strengthen boards' ACs in the wake of high profile insolvencies. The findings will assist regulators and firm management to design appropriate ACs (e.g. independence) and processes (e.g. number of meetings). Originality/value: The authors provide empirical evidence on the impact of the AC on firm insolvency in the UK context, an important but neglected area in research.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of internal corporate governance mechanisms on the capital structure decisions of Chinese-listed firms. Design/methodology/approach - Using a large and more recent data set consisting of 2,386 Chineselisted firms over the period from 1998 to 2012, the authors use different statistical methods (OLS, fixed effects and system GMM) to analyse the effects of firm-specific and corporate governance influences on capital structure. Findings - The authors find that the proportion of independent directors and ownership concentration exert significant influence on the level of Chinese long-term debt ratios after controlling for firm-specific determinants and split share reforms. Further analysis separating the sample of this paper into state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privately owned enterprises (POEs) suggests that ownership concentration in the hands of the state leads to decrease in debt ratios. Research limitations/implications - The finding implies that concentrated ownership in the hands of the state appears more efficient compared to their private counterparts in their monitoring role. Originality/value - This paper extends prior literature, which has concentrated disproportionately on firm-specific influences on capital structure, to the effects of within-firm governance mechanisms on capital structure decisions. The paper contributes to the agency theory-capital structure discourse in an emerging country context where corporate governance system appears weak. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Currently, it is commonly accepted that the not-invented-here syndrome (NIHS) refers to internal resistance against external knowledge, and that it has devastating consequences on innovation performance (IP). Nevertheless, studies on organisational practices that neutralise NIHS are incipient. Moreover, it is accepted that innovation capabilities (ICs) are perhaps the organisational routines with the highest positive influence on IP. In this study, based on the organisational routine framework and agency theory, we propose a model in which ICs (i.e., client-focused, marketing-focused, and technology-focused ICs) have a confounding effect on an NIHS-IP relation. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the proposed model with survey data from a sample of 161 service firms. We find that (1) NIHS influences IP negatively, and (2) ICs weaken NIHS-IP relation, practically turning it null. Finally, this paper provides insights for researchers and managers regarding a possible overestimation of the negative effects of NIHS on the literature.

Purpose - The objective of this study is to understand the linkages among executive compensation, corporate governance and performance of the Indian family and non-family firms. Further, the study also analyzes the level of shareholding pattern of the Indian family firms on their performance and the executive compensation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have collected panel data of the companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The data set consists of 284 companies (both family and non-family) for the period 2005-2014. The authors have made use of a dynamic panel data model with generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation to formulate the hypotheses and used fixed-effects regression model to check the robustness of our findings. Findings - The authors find support for the agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory in the paper. Specifically, variables related to executive compensation, corporate governance (board size, proportion of independent directors on board, chief executive officers duality and other directorships held by the executive directors outside the company), firm performance (Tobin's Q), leverage and shareholding pattern of the family are significant in this study. Practical implications - The study has practical implications for all stakeholders of the family and non-family firms, especially in the emerging market economies. It can be used as a reference guide by various other stakeholders of the family firms, viz., customers, educators, tax authorities, government and society. Originality/value - The authors confirm that their research is original and provides valuable insights on the Indian family firms. The authors study cross-holding of directorships, inter alia, in the Indian family business groups. As most of the previous studies in the Indian context ignored this important aspect, this study is unique in nature. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

For a long period of time, researchers from the corporate governance field have been interested in finding out what drives companies' performance. The present study identifies five attributes of boards - size, age, female representation, proportion of non-executive directors, and chairman-CEO duality - in an attempt to link these to diversification strategy and financial performance. These relations are investigated using archival sources of data for a sample of 56 publicly traded companies from an emerging economy. The results are consistent with other studies performed abroad and at the same time offer new theoretical and managerial perspectives on the issues analyzed. The findings offer some valuable insights into the decision of corporate diversification at both theoretical and managerial level. The results provide support for both managerial hegemony and agency theory. Board members have little involvement in the strategy-making process as this is most often an attribute of managers, where as the existence of more members without executive responsabilities is a determinat of superior company performance.

Some business ethicists view agency theory as a cautionary tale - a proof that it is impossible to carry out successful economic interactions in the absence of ethical behaviour. The cautionary-tale view presents a nuanced normative characterisation of agency, but its unilateral focus betrays a limited understanding of the structure of social interaction. This article moves beyond unilateralism by presenting a descriptive and normative argument for a bilateral cautionary-tale view. Specifically, we discuss hat swaps and role dualism in asymmetric-information principal-agent relationships and argue that the norm of reciprocity can function as a moral solution to agency risks in adverse-selection and moral-hazard problems. Our bilateral cautionary-tale formulation extends the normative boundaries of agency theory, while leaving the fundamental economic assumptions of agency theory intact.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine an association between board demographics and corporate performance using a sample of Pakistani firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange in the 2014 year. Design/methodology/approach: This study is unique in that corporate performance is examined using a mixture of performance measures: accounting-based measures (return on assets), market-based measures (Tobin's Q, earnings per share, and total return) and economic profit measures (economic value added). Findings: The results of this research show a significant positive relationship between board size, minority representation on the board and the appointment of a family director and enhanced firm performance. However, contrary to expectations, the authors also find that instead of adding value, the appointment of independent directors to Pakistani firm boards negatively impacts firm value. Originality/value: This study adds to a growing body of empirical evidence that suggests that agency theory-based corporate governance recommendations adopted in developed economies may not be relevant to emerging economy firms.

In this study, the effect of ownership structure characteristics namely government ownership, foreign ownership and institutional ownership, upon non-financial Omani firms performance (ROA) for the years 2012-2014 was examined. To achieve the study objective, the researcher obtained 81 sample firms in order for the above relationship to be tested. Sampling was taken from the firm's annual reports for three years. A total of 243 firms were selected, 81 for each year. For the purpose of testing the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, multiple regression analysis was employed. The study aims to fill the gap in extant literature regarding the ownership structure-firm performance relationship in Oman, a developing nation. The findings showed a positive and significant relationship between government ownership and foreign ownership, and firm performance (ROA). Some recommendations for future studies were provided prior to concluding the work.

Although innovation is central to a firm's success and a top priority for most technology managers, firms commonly report disappointment that innovation outcomes do not match their original plans. This paper examines the difference in intended innovation and realized innovation using an exploration/exploitation framing. Its focus is on changes to defined innovation plans that occur after planning phases end. Extant literature and field research form the basis for hypotheses that are then tested using a large scale survey of an entire population of small and medium-sized high-technology enterprises (SMEs). Findings of compromised exploration in favor of exploitation, during the development phase, is quantified. Firms divert resources away from novel emergent exploration and into existing product development, thereby undercutting innovation plans. Intended innovation, established during the planning stages, is found to be compromised. Our hypotheses, that agency and resource dependence underpin a shifting between explorative and exploitative development, have support. The paper's theoretical contributions include the application of novel agency and resource dependence perspectives onto innovation. It informs ambidexterity research by indicating where, how much, and why erosion in the balance of exploration/exploitation occurs and provides new avenues for research into low innovation outcomes.

Conflicts of interest represent an increasing problem in organizations, given the expansion of stakeholder concerns, needs, and expectations. Existing remedies to address these conflicts largely involve aligning management incentives with the interests of investors, or recusing parties with special interests from the decision-making effort. Both focus on a dyad between the primary stakeholder and the decision-maker. However, increasingly complex situations involving multiple stakeholders exist. The added complexity of considering multiple stakeholders heightens uncertainty that can facilitate the pursuit of self-interest. Ironically, a potential remedy may involve ensuring the presence of competing interests. A review of military procurement suggests that competing interests can mitigate self-interest.

This chapter introduces stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory. Stakeholder theory suggests organizations must be accountable not only to investors but also towards a multiplicity of stakeholder, whose expectations and interests can affect or be affected by the organizations' actions. We provide an overview of the descriptive, normative and instrumental approaches to stakeholder theory, along with a classification of stakeholders and a comparison with agency theory. We then define the concepts of legitimacy and social contract, outline the main literature on legitimacy theory and compare it to stakeholder theory. Finally, we discuss both stakeholder and legitimacy theory in the context of Behavioural Accounting Research and provide suggestions for future research.

This study develops a combined agency-resource dependence perspective and applies it to the study of interlocking directorates. It suggests that interlocking directorates may exert either a positive or a negative effect on subsequent firm performance, depending on the firm's relative resources, power imbalance, ownership concentration, and CEO ownership. A test on a sample of 145 Italian companies provides support for hypothesized effects. This study suggests that integrating agency and resource dependence theories provides a higher-order explanation of firm performance and helps advance both agency and resource dependence theories.

This paper investigates whether the characteristics of boards of directors and audit committees and the formation of the latter are associated with firm performance. Agency theory suggests that well-governed firms perform relatively better than their poorly-governed counterparts. However, resource dependency theory suggests that a board with more insider directors could have more expertise on how to better operate the firm, thus contributing to better firm performance. Using a sample of firms publicly traded on the Athens Stock Exchange during 2008-2012, we find that those having large-sized boards performed better, but firms having more independent board members performed poorly. We also find that firms with small-sized boards and those with boards having more independent members are more likely to form audit committees, but we failed to find any association between audit committee characteristics and firm performance. In addition, we do not find a negative relation between board independence and future firm performance. These findings suggest that boards of Greek firms take more active role in advising than monitoring. These findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, corporate managers, and investors, in general, and particularly, those in emerging markets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Based on a large international sample, we examine the effects of CSR on the cost of equity under different levels of investor protection. In countries where investor protection is strong (poor), our results show that the cost of equity falls (rises) when a firm invests in CSR. Our findings are robust to alternative variable definitions, sample selection, analyst forecast bias, and various methodological specifications. We also demonstrate that the investor base channel is able to explain different outcomes regarding the relation between CSR and the cost of equity, and we derive implications for both financial practice and public policy.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the impact of board characteristics on the financial performance of listed firms in Tanzania. Board characteristics, including outside directors, board size, CEO/Chair duality, gender diversity, board skill and foreign directors are addressed in the Tanzanian context by applying two corporate governance theories, namely, agency theory and resource dependence theory. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses balanced panel data regression analysis on 80 firm-years observations (2006-2013) from annual reports, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 key stakeholders. The study uses also a mixed methods approach and applies a convergent parallel design (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011) to integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Findings: It was found that in terms of agency theory, while the findings support the separation of CEO/Chairperson roles, they do not support outside directors-financial performance linkage. With regard to resource dependence theory, the findings suggest that gender diversity has a positive impact on financial performance. Furthermore, the findings do not support an association between financial performance and board size, PhD qualification and foreign directors. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of board-performance link and provides academic evidence to policy makers in Tanzania for current and future governance reforms. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the literature by providing new and original insights that, within a developing setting, extend current understanding of the association between corporate governance and financial performance. This is predicated, also, on the use of uncommon mixed methods approach. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We complement the resource-based view of the firm with agency theory in order to explore the link between R&D intensity and degree of internationalization of firms affiliated to Indian business groups. Results from the two-stage least squares panel regression estimation indicate research intensity is positively associated with the firm's degree of internationalization. The relationship is strengthened by the concentration of ownership by family and affiliated business group firms, the board of directors' professionalization, the wedge between voting and cash-flow rights, and the board interlocks of professional directors; but weakened by the board interlocks of family directors. Implications are discussed. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper aims to provide a twofold empirical comparison: first, a comparison between the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on agency costs proxies and firm performance measures, and second, this comparison was used before and after the 2008 financial crisis, capturing two different economic states. Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression methods were applied to two data sets of non-financial firms incorporated in the FTSE ALL-Share index over the period 2005-2011. Findings: The results provide evidence that not all mechanisms lead to lower agency conflicts and/or higher firm performance. Ownership identity has a significant impact and the role of the governance mechanisms changes with the changes in the economic conditions surrounding the firm. Research limitations/implications: The results lend support to the notion that forcing a certain code of practice on firms to follow could compel them to move away from conflict reduction governance structures. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a comparison of empirical evidence for the impact of board characteristics and ownership identity on agency costs and firm performance by using a comprehensive set of corporate governance mechanisms. This comparison challenges the prior studies that use performance as an indirect proxy for lower agency costs. Additionally, it compares the impact of the governance mechanisms during two different economic conditions. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to integrate conventional corporate governance (CG) mechanisms into the Islamic banking framework in order to examine their impact on Islamic banks (IBs) financial performance (IBFP) within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) context. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a sample of 22 full-fledged IBs operating in the GCC countries over an 11-year period from 2005 to 2015. Using panel data approach, the paper develops an empirical model consists of five CG mechanisms and three control variables. The model parameters are estimated using feasible generalized least squares framework. Findings: The results show that five internal CG mechanisms have statistically significant relationship with IBFP, measured by Q-ratio. Insider shareholding is found to be positively associated with IBFP, while institutional and government shareholdings are found to be negatively related to Q-ratio, the results being consistent with the agency theory, strategic alignment theory and property rights theory, respectively. Moreover, the results reveal that large board size and CSR engagement negatively influence IBFP, once again lending support to agency theory and trade off theory, respectively. The control variables, namely, leverage, size and age are also found to have a statistically significant relationship with IBFP. Practical implications: IBs are urged to ensure transparency in the provision of innovative products fundamentally in contrast to conventional banking products as well as cater to the untapped markets by weaving Islamic values into the existing CG fabric, as a feasible solution to remain competitive. Originality/value: The paper examines the relationship between internal CG mechanisms and financial performance of listed and non-listed full-fledged IBs operating in the GCC countries.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of Islamic banks (IBs) product and services disclosure (PSD). Design/methodology/approach: A computer-based content analysis is run upon the annual reports for a sample of 78 IBs operating in 11 countries from 2004 to 2012 to find the number of product and services statements. The levels and trends of PSD are identified. A regression analysis to identify the factors affecting PSD in IBs is also used. Findings: The findings suggest that there has been a significant improvement of PSD over time. The results show a positive association between PSD and Shariah board size, board size, chief executive officer (CEO) tenure, duality in position, blockholders and investment account holders. However, they show a negative association between PSD and institutional ownership. In addition, it appears that board independence does not affect significantly banks' PSD. It is also found that the bank performance, bank age, leverage, listing, adoption of international financial reporting standards, adoption of Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions and country transparency index have a positive effect on the PSD. Originality/value: This study offers an original contribution to corporate disclosure literature by being the first to develop and investigate PSD for a large sample of IBs during a long period of time. It links P&S with bank corporate governance characteristics. The findings have many important policy implications. More specifically, this paper encourages regulators in the studied countries to improve corporate governance mechanisms in their Islamic banking systems through the optimization of ownership structure, CEO's characteristics and the board's characteristics, to promote PSD. Moreover, the findings support the theoretical predictions of the generalized agency theory. This study's empirical evidence enhances the understanding of the corporate social responsibility disclosure environment in general and the PSD environment in particular for IBs. This study is the first one that measures PSD in the annual reports for a large cross-countries sample of IBs during a long period of time. It is also the first one that links PSD with IBs corporate governance mechanisms. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Board size is an important dimension of corporate governance. The purpose of this study is to propose and test indirect effects of organization size on organizational performance via board size, in the context of industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study's predictions were tested in 288 medium and large organizations listed on the Australian Securities Exchange using archival data. Findings: The findings of this study suggest the following: organization size is positively associated with board size and this relationship is stronger in manufacturing organizations; board size is positively associated with performance and this relationship is conditional on industry; and organization size has an indirect effect on performance via board size, and this indirect effect is also conditional on industry. Research limitations/implications: The results provide some support for the resource dependency theory, agency theory and contingency theory. Practical implications: The findings suggest that directors should take into account the effects of board size and industry to provide a more precise assessment of the board's performance. Originality/value: It predicts and tests the pioneering moderating effect of industry (manufacturing vs services) on the organization size-board size, board size-organizational performance and organization size-board size-organizational performance relationships.

While academic researchers continue to debate the effect of board independence in increasing performance, its efficacy could also be reflected in whether firm performance is made more stable. Board governance activities are a constellation of actions aimed at managing agency costs and ensuring the viability of a company over time. The efficacy of such actions would, therefore, be reflected in a distal outcome, specifically, in lower firm performance variability. Boards that can control agency costs and limit both underinvestment and overinvestment would reduce a firm's deviation from its mean performance trajectory. Using a longitudinal sample of publicly traded companies in the United States, we find that board stability, board resource provision, and CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability. Board independence is not associated with performance variability. With increasing board independence, greater board stability and greater CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability, however, greater board resource provision is not associated with performance variability.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to set a research agenda so that future conceptual and empirical research can improve the understanding of why CEO pay and CEO performance are decoupled. Design/methodology/approach: The paper compiles and adds to many of the explanations provided by this special issue's nine commentaries regarding why CEO pay and CEO performance are decoupled. These explanations were grouped into two categories: economic (e.g. marginal productivity theory, agency theory and behavioral agency model) and social-institutional-psychological (e.g. CEO individual differences and characteristics and CEO-organization interactions). Moreover, new analyses based on additional data were conducted to examine measurement-related explanations for the observed pay-performance decoupling. Findings: Results based on alternative measures of pay and performance confirmed, once again, the existence of pay-performance decoupling. Research limitations/implications: This paper will stimulate research pitting theoretical explanations against each other to understand their relative validity in different contexts. Practical implications: The paper informs ongoing efforts to link CEO pay to performance. Social implications: The paper also revisits the decoupling of CEO pay and firm performance from a normative and value-based perspective (i.e. regarding whether pay and performance should be related). Originality/value: The paper clarifies that the articles in this special issue largely concluded that CEO pay is decoupled from CEO performance. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines if the effort of financially linked independent (FLI) directors enable firms to reemerge from bankruptcy, a major organizational crisis. Using a sample of 307 bankrupt U.S. firms with instrumental variables regression methodology, I find that the efforts of these directors are critical for firm reemergence. FLI directors' efforts increase the likelihood of reemergence as well as improve access to financial resources. In contrast, I do not find any evidence that non-FLI directors' efforts are associated with reemergence. I also find that resourceful but uninvolved directors are not helpful for firms trying to navigate their way out of bankruptcy. My study highlights (a) the changing nature of roles played by directors in various lifecycle stages, (b) the greater importance of resource provisioning over monitoring during reemergence, and (c) that efforts of FLI directors, and not others director categories, matter for reemergence. Overall, my study extends research that suggests directors' motivation may cause differential firm outcomes and provides evidence that directors do not always put in their best effort on behalf of their firms. This, I suggest, has profound implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

This study illustrates how control-ownership wedge impacts the monitoring role of the corporate board through the quality of audit services in Turkey. Turkey has made essential amendments in the field of external audit in order to enhance the quality of the financial report and integrate its own capital market with that of the EU. It would be of interest to examine the influence of these changes on clients' demand for high quality audit. The agency theory is integrated with the resource dependence theory to show that boards possess distinct incentives and ability to demand high quality audit to monitor management activities. Logistic regression and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) were used for regression estimations. The results indicate that board demographics, cognitive and structural diversity of board of directors, audit committee characteristics and audit quality are complementary and control-ownership wedge weakens the relationship between them which is an unfavorable outcome for minority shareholders. Thus, this study proposes that regulators should increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance in Turkey to accommodate the unique features of wedge firms and provide a protected environment for minority shareholders.

Agency theory suggests that CEOs view dividends unfavorably because dividend payouts deprive them of the free cash flow they could otherwise exploit. Using Bebchuk, Cremers, and Peyer's (2011) CEO pay slice (CPS) to measure CEO power, we find that an increase in CEO power by one standard deviation decreases the probability of paying dividends by 17.48%. For dividend-paying firms, a rise in CEO power by one standard deviation reduces the size of dividend payouts by 5.91%. Share repurchases, however, are not influenced by CEO power, although they too take away the free cash flow from the CEO. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This article analyses the relationship between CEO succession events and German firms' internationalization processes, which is represented by the degree of internationalization (DOI) growth and internationalization rhythm. Based on a theoretical framework combining elements of agency theory, institutionalism and upper echelons approach, we propose a longitudinal model to examine the relationships of both process variables with the number of CEO changes and succession type (internal vs. external succession), respectively. The results of our study of 102 German firms over 23 years (1990-2012) show an inverted U-shaped impact (no impact) of the number of CEO changes (succession type) on the DOI growth and a positive (negative) monotonic effect on the rhythm of internationalization.

Purpose: This paper aims to assess the risk reporting practices extent to which firm's and corporate governance characteristics explain risk-related disclosures (RRD) motivations across two European Latin countries (Portugal and Spain). Moreover, drawn on elements of agency, legitimacy, resources-based perspectives and institutional theory, this study also intends to assess whether the influence of corporate governance mechanisms on risk reporting is mediated by strategic/institutional legitimacy interests. Design/methodology/approach: From a sample of 60 non-finance Portuguese and Spanish companies with securities traded on the Euronext Lisbon stock exchange market and on the Madrid stock exchange market, respectively, at December, 2011, the Corporate Governance reports and the "risk/risk management" sections of the Management reports included on consolidated annual reports for 2011 were manually content analysed, according to prior literature. Further, multiple linear regressions were used to assess the potential relationships between corporate governance mechanisms and risk reporting. The paper's theoretical framework draws on elements of agency, legitimacy, resources-based perspectives and institutional theory. To understand the risk reporting practices of Portuguese and Spanish non-finance listed companies, the paper conducts a content analysis of 60 consolidated annual reports for 2011. Findings: Results indicate that visible companies, operating in a country with a weaker legal environment, and during periods of financial distress disclose more discretionary RRD, basically to contextualize their negative outcomes. Some corporate governance mechanisms were crucial to improve risk information. Originality/value: The paper goes beyond prior literature work and assesses whether the theoretical framework grounded on agency, legitimacy, resources-based perspective and institutional theory is suitable in explaining RRD in an under-researched setting (European Latin countries, such as Portugal and Spain, with low agency costs and different corporate governance models). Moreover, the analysis embraces a wider and homogeneous range of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms and uses a period in which both countries were severely affected by a sovereign debt crisis with negative impacts on company's liquidity and financial risks. A research setting like this has not been studied hitherto. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact that PhD scientists serving on the board of directors of firms conducting hard science have on the R&D-based innovative performance of the firm. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are built upon extant theory, and they are tested using two-stage least squared regression that control for the endogenous nature of board composition. Results are robust to alternative specifications. Findings: This analysis shows that firms with higher numbers of PhD scientists on the board generate superior innovative output and more efficient monitoring; PhD board members with denser professional networks are more valuable as board members. Practical implications: This paper provides practical advice to innovative firms on how to create a governance process that simultaneously improves monitoring and boosts the innovative performance. Originality/value: This study is the first one to suggest that innovative firms can improve R&D monitoring and boost innovative output at the same time, and the first to investigate the role that PhD scientists can serve on the board of firms engaging in hard science.

This study examines the effects of family firms on the corporate social performance of Korean firms and analyses how their effect varies depending on the presence of family CEOs or chaebols. Based on the agency theory, we find that family firms exhibit lower corporate social performance. In particular, there is no difference in the performance of related stakeholders, such as society, consumers, environment, and employees, compared to non-family firms, but corporate governance registers as low performance. We further find that family firms managed by family CEOs show lower corporate social performance, whereas chaebol firms show higher corporate social performance.

For decades, the economic theory of the firm referred to as agency theory has dominated business research and education in the United States. Although agency theory has been influential in accounting, finance, and managerial economics, it lacks informal and nonfinancial controls. Douglas E. Stevens resolves to enhance this theory through the incorporation of social norms. Drawing on historical context related to the firm, the theory of the firm, and social norm theory related to the firm, he demonstrates the importance of social norms in the formation and development of free-market capitalism and the firm. He also describes the latest theoretical, experimental, and archival evidence to exhibit the growing body of research that incorporates social norms into the theory of the firm. These foundations enable Stevens to create a comprehensive roadmap of agency theory that will have strong implications for practice and public policy. (c) Douglas E. Stevens 2019.

This article develops theory about an agency problem affecting the strategic human capital (SHC) of the firm. It proposes three categories of SHC-related choices managers must make that imply a trade-off between near- and long-term performance. Dispersed shareholding, firm coverage by securities analysts, and their practice of publishing quarterly earnings forecasts are argued to entail a bias in management incentives, shifting the balance in this trade-off toward near-term performance. To restore the balance, securities analysts would need to distinguish transitory from recurring effects of SHC-related choices in their valuation models (e.g., treating certain labor cost savings during cyclical downturns as transitory). Restoring the balance would also require them to anticipate long-term effects in their long-term earnings forecasts (e.g., long-term positive effects of retaining employees with valuable skills during cyclical downturns). The article discusses specific transitory cost effects and long-term effects they could potentially take into account. The skills and incentives needed by analysts to account for such effects are argued to vary across firm segments. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Scholars and shareholder activists have raised concerns about directors serving on multiple boards simultaneously. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 experienced diverse South African directors to investigate the causes and consequences of overboardedness. Interviewees identified the limited talent pool and board diversity targets as the main causes of overboardedness (or interlocking as it is also called). In line with the busyness hypothesis, poor meeting attendance by overboarded directors was highlighted by some participants. However, others claimed that director interlocking could offer invaluable access to social networks and resources, lending support to the experience hypothesis. Director busyness should hence be considered on a case-by-case basis. (c) 2018, The Author(s).

Public services have been subjected to processes of deregulation, competition, and privatization in many countries worldwide. One popular reform has involved focusing on competitive procurement. This context, where public and private organizations jointly deliver the service in a dyad, makes the market orientation of public services highly complex. The main elements of market orientation-intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination and responsiveness- have shown themselves to be valid and of significance in both the private and public sectors. Nevertheless, the empirical context of the public sector involves a complexity that has been poorly addressed in market orientation research. In this study, we research the Swedish public transport industry and survey buyer and provider organizations in order to determine how market-orientated activities are approached in public-private service dyads. We present three theoretically-underpinned relationship types - buyer dominated, provider dominated and collaborative - which we suggest as having implications for market-oriented activities. A survey of public transport authorities' (buyers, n = 48) and operators' (providers, n = 49) market orientation activities reveals the concurrent prevalence of characteristics from all three relationship types, as both parties try to dominate the relationship while also engaging in collaborative efforts. Drawing on our theoretical framework and our empirical results, we conclude that there are legitimate differences in the perspectives of buyers and providers, and that these differences, if acknowledged and properly managed, can provide valuable resources in the development of a joint market orientation in complex public-private settings.

This article empirically examines the occurrence of price-oriented maverick buying (MB) during supplier selection, in a direct purchasing process context. Drawing on agency theory, maverick buying, and total cost of ownership (TCO) literature, the statistically significant existence of price-oriented MB is investigated and the purchasing manager (PM)-related factors that influence such noncompliant behavior are determined. A discrete choice experiment is designed to simulate a TCO-based supplier selection process in which an established purchasing framework agreement stipulates PMs not necessarily be price-oriented (i.e., select suppliers primarily based on lowest price), and then models PM choice behavior in the supplier selection process (SSP), utilizing a conditional logit model (CLM) to determine PM compliance to the established purchasing framework agreement and identify if price-oriented MB exists. Statistical tests utilizing comprehensive primary and secondary data are then conducted to determine if correlational relationships exist between PM-related factors and PM price-orientation. Results indicate that three PM-related factors bear a significant correlational relationship to PM price-orientation. (c) 2016 Decision Sciences Institute

Despite the increasing number of studies on corporate governance, the study of what is understood as ''good'' corporate governance and how this ''quality'' is measured has not been extensively approached; thus, what constitutes good corporate governance remains unsolved. To examine the substance of corporate governance quality, we undertake an interpretative analysis of this concept. We conclude that the deep meaning of corporate governance quality is anchored to the theoretical lens adopted to approach it and that agency theory represents the mainstream method employed in this task. Our results question the validity of agency-based metrics of corporate governance for the two following reasons: the endogeneity problem they embed and the agency Universalist approach that does not capture the holistic complexity of corporate governance at a firm level. To tackle such limitations, we propose the behavioural approach to fully capture the substance of what makes 'good' corporate governance and to measure it.

This study aims to advance research on local market initiative, a form of subsidiary initiative that emanates from new opportunities in the local marketplace. Given that market-seeking MNCs in China face particular pressures stemming from local market conditions, China is particularly relevant research site to examine the concept. Drawing on agency theory, resource dependence theory and the resource based view of the firm and using survey data from 75 subsidiaries of German manufacturing companies in China, the effects of subsidiary autonomy and entrepreneurial culture on local market initiative are analyzed. The results provide evidence that both subsidiary autonomy and the presence of an entrepreneurial culture are associated with local market initiative. This research has major implications for MNCs and their market-seeking subsidiaries abroad and its designated focus on local market initiative constitutes a milestone in subsidiary initiative research.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of independent non-executive directors (INEDs) in Malaysian public listed companies (PLCs), other than the control role prescribed by agency theory and reformatory documents such as the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research design, consisting of face-to-face interviews with 27 company directors of Malaysian-owned PLCs, was instigated. Findings: The interviews revealed that INEDs do more than just monitor their executive counterparts. Apart from the control role, INEDs of Malaysian companies provide a conduit for mitigating uncertainties in the environment and perform invaluable services to the host companies. Research limitations/implications: This research utilized interviews. Generalizations may be an issue when interviews are used as the method of inquiry. Also, the sample is not random as access to many of the interviewed directors depended on recommendations. In addition, respondents were consciously selected in order to obtain various board positions that include independent and non-independent directors. Originality/value: There are limited studies using qualitative research design in investigating INEDs' performing other roles apart from the control role of the board in developing countries. Many of previous studies and literature in this area of corporate governance were predominantly based upon experiences of western economies. (c) 2018, Hairul Azlan Annuar.

This study aims to examine the relationship between gender diversity and real estate companies' performance in Malaysia, whereby in 1985, the Government of Malaysia formulated a National Policy on Women as a guide for women's participation. Panel data analysis was used to examine the gender diversity and real estates' performance in an unbalanced panel of 549 observations for the years 2012-2015. The authors utilised an agency theory to inform the discussion of this paper's findings. This study finds that the woman directors in the real estate companies are dominated by family-companies. The existence of block holders enhances the firm governance by monitoring the board activities which in turn increase their effectiveness and efficiency that lead to a higher firm performance. Both the managerial ownership and the institutional investors are significant in determining the firm's performance. The reason may be due to higher ownership controlled by managerial and investor which makes them have a say in a company and try to pursue their objectives rather than the stakeholders' interests. The findings have contributed to the body of knowledge especially on the women participation in Malaysia, and their contributions. Gender diversity does not destroy the firm performance; in fact, Malaysian companies should focus on the right combination of men and women on the board, rather than the presence of at least a woman on a board of directors. The findings outlay the scenario of women's involvement in the real estate companies in Malaysia. There is a positive direction for women's involvement in the board, but it is still a long way to go. Very limited studies delved on gender diversity and real estate companies in Malaysia, even though there is a policy by the Government on women involvement in Malaysia. (c) 2018.

A theoretical framework for the motivation of intellectual capital disclosure of NPOs is developed based on links between six theories. According to literature the theories most frequently used for research into this topic of IC measurement and reporting were agency theory, legitimacy theory, resource-based view, and stakeholder theory. These theories are introduced in light of IC reporting of NPOs to facilitate a transparent and comprehensible choice of a theory applied. Additionally, since legitimacy theory is part of institutional theory, and resource-based view and resource dependency theory are based on the same assumptions, these theories are presented as well. Since each of the presented theories provides valuable answers to the question as to what motivates NPOs to disclose their IC, a table offers an overview on the key perspective of the six theories while a graph highlights the links between the theories. As a result stakeholder theory and resource dependency theory are utilised as the theoretical framework for the analysis of the data collected to address the research questions.

Research Summary: We analyze power relationships in subsidiaries of multinational corporations. We explain how despite many advances in the literature, there is still an unresolved debate with respect to the critical question of whether subsidiary power is loaned or owned. We develop an overarching framework that encompasses both agency theory and resource dependence theory as the two pillars to understand decision-making by managers in subsidiaries. We propose that agency theory applies more when the subsidiary's decision rights are "loaned" by headquarters, while resource dependence theory applies more when the subsidiary "owns" its decision rights. We also explain how subsidiary evolution integrates the arguments of these two theories. Agency appears to apply earlier while resource dependence is more relevant at later stages. Managerial Summary: We provide a framework that helps address the challenges of managing power relationships in subsidiaries of multinational firms. Traditionally, studies have proposed to explain these relationships using either agency theory and the idea that subsidiary managers need to be controlled by headquarters or resource dependence and the idea that subsidiary managers can chart their own path. We solve this conflict by proposing that agency theory applies when the subsidiary's decision rights are "loaned" by headquarters, while resource dependence theory applies when the subsidiary "owns" its decision rights. We also explain how the analysis of subsidiary evolution integrates the arguments of these two theories as agency seems to apply earlier in the evolution of the subsidiary while resource dependence seems to apply at a later stage.

The internationalization of firms has led to boards becoming more international as well. In this study, we investigate the consequences of board internationalization. In particular, by drawing on research on language and board dynamics, we identify theory-based reasons why board internationalization could increase, or decrease, earnings management practices. We use agency theory, stressing how board internationalization may positively or negatively affect monitoring quality of boards. Next to agency theory, we use theories explaining how language differences in the boardroom complicates communication and how differences in language structures (referred to as linguistic relativity in the literature) affect directors' perception and detection of earnings management practices. Using a sample of 3249 firm-year observations representing 586 non-financial listed Nordic firms during 2001-2008, we find that the presence of non-Nordic foreign directors on the board is associated with significantly higher levels of earnings management. Our analysis indicates that this effect is driven by language-related factors, as well as by the level of foreign board members' accounting knowledge. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd

The purpose of this study consists in analyzing the existing literature on international business from all the research papers published in Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS) during the period of time comprised between 2000 and 2015. The authors apply bibliometric methods to that end -in particular, document citation and co-citation analyses (DCAs)- so that they can try and identify the main research lines within the aforementioned scientific field or domain; in other words, the 'intellectual structure' of the discipline examined. Social networks analysis was also used to carry out the representation or visualization of such structure or knowledge base. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the research undertaken, since the study field still keeps its characteristic diversity and interdisciplinarity or the need to integrate a variety of theoretical frameworks or approaches into the development of a widely-accepted theory about the field under study become evident. Amongst these theories would be the new institutional theory, the strategic theory or perspective or others such as the transaction cost theory or the agency theory, applied to the context of internationalization and to the field of international business, on whose integration the future development of this field may largely depend.

Prior research has advanced classical agency theory to account for various characteristics of headquarters (HQ)-subsidiary relations in the multinational corporation (MNC). In an attempt to contribute to this line of research, in this paper, we propose and test an agency model for HQ-subsidiary relations inside the MNC. Drawing on classical agency assumptions, we develop a baseline hypothesis that links informal controls (i.e., socialization), HQ-subsidiary goal conflicts, and the HQ's use of formal controls (i.e., behavioral controls). We subsequently introduce an important boundary condition, which reflects subsidiaries' internal agency relations with subsidiary CEOs as second principals. More specifically, we argue that the baseline relationship only holds under low levels of second principal power. To test our model, we employed a unique study design with three parallel surveys addressing the agents and the two principals involved in 131 agency relations within one MNC. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: Recent research has proposed the position of a project owner as the individual accountable for realizing target benefits. However, there is a lack of understanding in the literature of this role - in particular, the specific responsibilities of the project owner that can enhance benefits realization and operations performance. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The paper identifies these responsibilities in practice through two studies - a qualitative study, which includes interviews with senior executives who fund projects, and an in-depth longitudinal case study, which describes a company that continuously realizes the benefits from its projects. Findings: The results suggest that a project owner should have 22 key responsibilities across four project phases and that an operations manager is often the most suitable candidate to fulfill this role in operations improvement projects. When performing these project responsibilities effectively, operations managers enhance benefits realization and operations improvement. Finally, the paper proposes five hypotheses for future research. Originality/value: Based on agency theory, the paper increases our knowledge of the role of the project owner in practice. This new knowledge can enhance the realization of target benefits from projects and ensure a smooth transition from the project to the operations environment. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Interlocking directorates, in which companies are linked by the directors that serve on their boards, exist globally. It is an expression of hegemonic power exercised by the elites of a society, and has been studied with great interest by organizational sociologists, management scholars and financial economists. The interest emanates from the effect that interlocks have on wealth creation and distribution, and from the perspective that interlocks can tell us how elites in a society are networked. Although diverse theoretical perspectives have informed the research on interlocking directorates, this review shows that the Anglo-American perspective dominates. This dominance is notable not only in the volume of Anglo-American studies, but also in theories employed by international studies. For example, most international studies use agency theory to investigate the welfare implications of interlocks, but many countries do not use the Anglo-American legal regime, which is the basis for agency theory. This paper expands the theoretical basis of the review to include class hegemony and resource dependence, to articulate better the causes and consequences of interlocks in the international context. The paper also extends theory by showing that institutions have an important influence on interlocks, so that the latter can be welfare-depleting in one institutional setting, while welfare-enhancing in another. The review concludes by discussing the implication for future research. (c) 2018 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The extant literature reports mixed and inconclusive findings concerning the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance. To provide incremental insight, this paper aims to investigate whether the bi-directional relationships among managerial ownership, board independence and firm performance are determined. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a data set consisting of 9,302 firm-year observations of Australian listed companies during 2005-2015 and a three-stage least squares simultaneous equation model to test the bi-directional relationships. Findings: The results indicate that both managerial ownership and board independence inversely affect firm performance and vice versa. In addition, board independence is negatively correlated with managerial ownership and vice versa. Practical implications: The convergence-of-interests hypothesis can be achieved by manipulating managerial ownership through making contingent payments. Board independence, as a voluntary regime in Australia, can provide additional flexibility to corporate decision makers. Originality/value: This study provides additional evidence by using the convergence-of-interests hypothesis vis-a-vis the entrenchment hypothesis to examine the relationship between managerial ownership and firm performance, and tests the association of board independence and firm performance using the explanation of agency theory vis-a-vis stewardship theory.

The prime objective of this study is to investigate the legitimate role of corporate boards and corporate social responsibility on the performance of Malaysian listed companies during 2006-2017. Elements of corporate boards include board size, board independence and board diversity, whereas corporate social responsibility (CSR) dimensions constitute marketplace, environment, community and workplace. Both accounting-based (return on assets [ROA], return on equity [ROE]) and market-based (earnings per share [EPS]) performance measures have been employed for measuring performance. Pooled ordinary least squares method (OLS) and multiple regressions are used to estimate the dataset. Findings reveal larger board size and higher board independence positively affect firm performance and significantly legitimise the board role in firms. However, the presence of women on Malaysian corporate boards does not legitimate the performance due to their lower percentage on board, hence insignificantly affecting firm value. Additionally, out of four CSR dimensions, only marketplace is positively and significantly related to EPS and negatively and significantly related to ROA. Conversely, environment, community and workplace are insignificantly related to all performance measures, leaving firms in a questionable legitimate state. This study embraces support from agency theory, resource dependence theory, legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory. However, this research raises questionable insights for regulatory bodies and academicians in the form of corporate legitimacy. (c) 2019 Institute of Public Enterprise.

Corporate boards are responsible for ensuring that managers enact policies that are in shareholders' best interests, and managers are responsible for implementing strategies that are not only profitable but also responsive to changing legal and societal demands and the resource needs of the firm. In this paper, we use the theoretical lenses of corporate social responsibility (CSR), the resource-based view, and agency theory to investigate the relationship between corporate governance structure and the implementation of supportive lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) policies. We analyze 10,233 firm-year observations and 1,594 unique firms, and our results demonstrate that LGBT-supportive policies are positively associated with firm performance. We also offer new insight into why not all firms adopt such policies. We exploit the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as an exogenous shock that increased board independence, and our difference-in-difference estimation shows that firms forced to raise board independence in 2002 were less likely to invest in LGBT-supportive policies. Results suggest that human resource management (HRM) policies can be guided by CSR and resource-based views in the pursuit of wealth maximization, but agency conflict may also be a concern for external majority boards. We discuss implications for HRM research practice and corporate governance regarding LGBT policies in organizations. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We examine whether compensation committee existence (CCX) and compensation committee effectiveness (CCE) are associated with CEO pay-performance alignment, using data drawn from a sample of Australian listed companies. We find that compensation committee existence and effectiveness are positively associated with CEO pay-performance alignment. Further, our results show that the relationships hold for the pre- and post-GFC (Global Financial Crisis) periods but not for the crisis period. This evidence supports the prospect theory argument that in times of macroeconomic crisis, uncontrollable factors external to the firm constitute a firm's reference point for making executive remuneration decisions. These results are robust to alternative measures of firm performance and CEO cash compensation as well as tests of endogeneity. Overall, our evidence suggests that compensation committees contribute to addressing agency problems pertinent to contemporary corporate governance practices. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This paper aims to examine the moderating effect of Shariah Supervisory Boards (SSBs) on the relationship between board size, Chief Risk Officer (CRO), and risk-taking of 24 Islamic banks (IBs) in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei from 2010 to 2015. This approach integrates the arguments of agency theory and resource dependence theory. The results of panel regression indicate that the appointment of a CRO as an executive board member reduces credit risk, implying that the appointment of a CRO as a risk expert in IBs enhances the management of risk and monitoring of risk-taking activities. Further, larger board is likely to reduce insolvency risk when an SSB has higher percentage of members with supervisory Shariah experience. Next, this study observes that larger SSB size and a higher percentage of members with Shariah supervision experience moderate the relationship between the CRO and insolvency risk. Overall, this study highlights the important role of board size, CRO and SSB in the risk-taking of Islamic banks, which have received little attention in the extant literature.

This study aims to examine the direct and moderating effects of the chief executive officer's (CEO) decision horizon and the board governance on a firm's entry into new technological fields, respectively. In a sample of 1727 firm-year observations for 156 Taiwanese firms in the semiconductor and optoelectronics industries for the period of 2003-2014, we found that the longer the CEO decision horizon, the more eager the focal firm is to enter new technological fields. Such a relationship is also strengthened by board power characterized by boards dominated by more outside directors, but weakened by board homogeneity of industry background. The configurational analysis further reveals that board homogeneity outweighs board power in reducing the positive influence of the CEO decision horizon on technological entry. This study not only contributes to the behavioral agency theory by infusing and testing CEO decision horizon to enhance predictions of the incidence of entering into new technological fields, but also reveals the contextual influences of board governance on executive risk taking. In addition, this study cautions against drawing a simple governance solution in support of a firm's technological entry. We point out different governance arrangements in which the CEO decision horizon will encourage more active technological entries in an environment of incessant changes. (c) 1988-2012 IEEE.

This chapter provides a critical narrative literature review with the aim of answering the following research question: What are the main theoretical perspectives in the academic literature on integrated reporting? We analysed the academic papers published on international accounting and finance journals from January 2000 to September 2017, focusing on 62 articles that explicitly refer to one or more theories. We found that 28 different theories are mentioned and the most used are stakeholder theory, institutional theory, legitimacy theory, impression management theory, and agency theory. We also presented an embryonic draft of a conceptual model, structured in four components: theories of the firm, purposes and users, types of integrated reporting, and value creation and distribution. We deem that this draft should be developed in future research to achieve a comprehensive conceptual model, inclusive of all explored theories and able to support future academic research, practice, and policies.

We argue that vertical interlocks in Chinese state-owned business groups are important mechanisms for coordination and information exchange between the apex firm and affiliated firms, and that they are also mechanisms for government owners of the business groups to exercise control. By combining resource dependence theory with elements from transaction cost economics and agency theory, we propose that the need for interlocks increases the higher the level of government ownership. The central government is therefore more likely to use vertical interlocks than the provincial governments, which again are more likely to use vertical interlocks than the municipal governments. We develop three hypotheses based on these arguments. A regression analysis of a hand-collected data set finds strong support for our hypotheses. Our results shed light on coordination and governance issues within the state-owned sector in China and on an important means for mitigating these issues used by the government owners and firms affiliated with state-owned groups.

This paper offers a fresh perspective on executive compensation by offering a new paradigm for choosing executive compensation structure based on environmental factors and firm size. This new perspective uses agency theory as a theoretical foundation. The availability of information, primarily information related to the agent, has typically been of utmost concern in the compensation selection process. However, a predominant focus on cognitive or behavioral information of the agent neglects the relative importance and impact of environmental forces in this process. This study evaluates the composition of the compensation contract using fluctuating environmental dimensions as the primary determinant. Specifically, we examine environmental munificence, dynamism, and complexity and the influence of varying levels of each of these variables and their interaction on the optimal choice of compensation contract utilized for both large firms and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This externally focused view of compensation contract creation underscores the significance of environmental factors in determining contract selection while also acknowledging the necessity of principals utilizing information related to both the agent and the environment. Furthermore, we argue that top executive compensation structures for large organizations and non-adaptive SMEs should differ from those of adaptive SMEs.

The paper aims to evaluate the combination of strategies that influence the success of New Technology Based Firms (NTBFs) located in isolated areas with resource constraints. We utilize the Kauffman Firm Survey to construct a subset of 224 firms operating in primary metal manufacturing industries and who are located in non-thriving areas. We focus on the impact of technological strategy, in the form of Inward Technology Licensing (ITL), combined with financial strategy, in the form of increased financial slack. Using a negative binomial-specification technique to model these relations, we find that ITL positively impacts internal innovation in the firm and this relation is strengthened by the presence of greater financial slack. This positive impact of financial slack supports the behavioral theory of the firm rather than agency theory in that financial slack enables further innovation rather than stifling it. This research confirms the importance of resource acquisition, suggesting that entrepreneurs may utilize external sources of knowledge in an effort to build a favorable situation when facing the challenges of location. Finally, by presenting evidence showing the compatibility of a financial strategy with a knowledge strategy (ITL), this study emphasizes the importance to entrepreneurs of choosing the proper combination of varying strategies.

Moral hazard can hinder both the realization and the effectiveness of research and development (R&D) supply relations. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no empirical studies investigating the determinants of moral hazard under the specific circumstances of R&D supply relations. Based on a study on 104 cases, this article will help to fill that gap. The results not only confirm information asymmetries as determinants, as predicted by principal-agent theory, but also reveal surprising effects of additional factors. Thus, we show that the general explanation of moral hazard needs to be adapted to the specifics of a concrete exchange situation. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study confirms that a firm's size in the previous year significantly increases board of director compensation in the current year, while the number of directors and the firm's capital expenditure significantly decrease it. On average, 31.2% of restaurant firms overcompensate their board of directors, while 33.8% pay less than the expected amount of compensation to their board of directors. However, contrary to public concern, this study argues that the amounts of over- and under-compensation are negligible in proportion to the directors' total compensation, and thus the issue of over- and under-compensation may not pose a serious problem in the restaurant industry. In particular, the amount of overcompensation has a positive effect on firm growth and capital investment, but does not substantially decrease firms' operational and financial performance. The amount of overcompensation can even have a positive influence on financial performance, although the effect is not statistically significant. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Scholars argue that the agency theory has some limitations as the sustaining theory of governance. It is its inability to distinguish the wider stakeholder influencing forces effecting on organisations. This paper delivers a concise picture incorporating other management-based theories to supplement agency theory in distinguishing the wider stakeholder influencing forces as well as the consequential extended governance standard it creates. Yet, for developing the theory building approach it has reviewed and critically examined the existing literatures. Furthermore, a circumstance is built to assimilate four existing theories that supplement each other to distinguish the wider stakeholder influencing forces. Finally, further studies have been recommended to certify the approach with wide-ranging real life institutional settings.

Purpose: Motivated by agency theory, this paper aims to explore the impact of bank diversification and bank independency on the likelihood of bank failure. The effects of corporate governance (ownership and board structures) are also examined. Design/methodology/approach: Logistic regressions are used to explore the role of corporate governance on bank failure risk. This sample covers 608 banks from eight European countries. Findings: The results suggest that the well-documented finding that diversification and bank independency may increase bank failure risk does not persist under strong corporate governance mechanism. Thus, to reduce the bank failure risk, diversification should be strongly monitored by the management to avoid excessive risk-taking by shareholders. Originality/value: The approach used in this study differs from that used in previous studies from certain perspectives. First, unlike most previous studies that focused on the relationship between bank performance and bank diversification, the impact of income and asset diversification on bank failure is tested. Also, the impact of a combined effect of diversification and corporate governance variables on bank failure is tested. This allows the control for different ownership and board variables as factors that would potentially affect the likelihood of bank failure. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Ownership structure proves to be one of the major factors affecting company accounting and market-based performance. The current study explored the direct ownership structure characteristics-performance relationship, with the former including government ownership, foreign ownership, and institutional ownership. The target sample of the study comprised of Omani non-financial firms examined in a three-year period. In addition, the study explored the moderating role of audit quality on the relationship between ownership structure and ROA, while considering the role of leverage as a control variable. The OLS regression was adopted to examine the direct government, ownership, foreign ownership and institutional ownership relationship with ROA, whereas the Hierarchical Multiple Regression was adopted to examine audit quality role as a moderating variable on the direct relationships. The obtained results revealed a significant and positive relationship between government ownership and foreign ownership and ROA, but an insignificant one between ROA and institutional ownership. The results also did not support the examined moderating role of audit quality on the above direct relationships. Towards the end, the study enumerated recommendations for future work. (c) 2019 KIIE

In this paper, we provide an overview of six types of research efforts, all of which are concerned to a significant extent with issues relevant to managers who are trying to effect and maintain control in complex organizations: * principles of management; * cybernetic control theory; * agency theory; * psychological research on control; * contingency research (large data base sociological research); * case (and small sample) sociological research. One purpose of this paper is to show the parallels that exist among these types of research. Then, for purposes of comparison and contrast, we discuss the above types of works in terms of three criteria that we believe are useful both for deriving practical control-related findings and for having confidence in those findings. The first criterion is the extent to which organizational context variables are included in the research. The second is the clarity of the linkage between control variables and the achievement of organizational goals. The third is the reliability of evidence offered in support of the findings. Through this review, we hope to provide both an historical perspective for researchers new to the field and our views on opportunities for the integration of existing and future research. (c) A.J.

While prior work has investigated the impact of (a) ownership structure and (b) board gender diversity separately on corporate environmental performance, researchers have not studied the potentially important relationship between ownership control and female board diversity in influencing corporate environmental performance jointly. We do so in the context of majority ownership in family-controlled and dual-class firms whose motives and influence are theoretically different from that of the firm's minority shareholders. Drawing on resource dependency, socioemotional wealth theory, and secondary agency theory, we hypothesize that majority family owners and dual-class owners likely choose women directors to help advance their personal preferences for environmental corporate social responsibility. Our empirical tests utilizing 2,755 U.S. firm years over the 2010-2015 show that, as hypothesized, these two majority ownership types interact with board gender diversity to positively influence corporate environmental performance.

Research question/issue: Using a multitheoretic view of boards, this study examines the impact of boardroom gender diversity (BGD) on voluntary intellectual capital (IC) disclosure in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses in China--the world's second-biggest economy, which is moving from a planned economy to a market-oriented one. Furthermore, this study also investigates the impact of family ownership on the relationship between BGD and IC disclosure in the Chinese environment, which is characterized by less-developed corporate governance mechanisms. Research findings/insights: Based on a comprehensive content analysis of Chinese IPO prospectuses between 2009 and 2017 and measuring disclosure index at 78 dimensions under six broad categories of IC, the empirical results document (a) a significant positive relation between BGD and IC disclosure--in line with resource dependence theory, (b) a significant negative impact of female independent directors on IC disclosure--opposite to agency theory predictions, and that (c) the BGD-IC disclosure relationship is generally stronger for firms with two or more women on boards--in line with critical mass theory in China. Finally, this study also reveals that family ownership has adverse impacts on the BGD-IC disclosure relationship. These results are robust to a battery of sensitivity analyses. Practitioner/policy implications: This study provides positive capital market implications of BGD through enhanced IC disclosure in IPO prospectuses. In doing so, the study has important implications for regulators and top management teams in devising policies concerning female representation on boards and voluntary disclosure of IC to inform the market participants of the true value of the company.

Intellectual capital is an important tool for strengthening a firm's competitive advantage and helping it achieve its medium- and long-term financial objectives. Currently accepted accounting principles do not outline strict rules and regulations for intellectual capital disclosure. However, the advent of integrated reporting offer firms an innovative tool to disseminate this information. Although previous research has analysed the intellectual capital found in integrated reports, no studies have analysed the board of directors' role in intellectual capital disclosure policies. This study uses agency theory to analyse the effect of board characteristics on intellectual capital disclosure quality (ICDQ) in the context of integrated reporting. To this end, it develops a new scoring system to measure ICDQ. The results, based on a sample of 130 international firms operating in different sectors, show a positive relationship between board size, independence, diversity and activity with ICDQ.

Purpose: The purpose of this research is to examine whether board gender diversity reduces the agency costs of firms in the context of Chinese listed firms. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a large sample of 23,340 firm-year observations of Chinese listed companies during 2004-2017. The authors use ordinary least squares regressions as the primary methodology with a wide range of methods to control for endogeneity and to check robustness, including the fixed-effect method, instrumental variable approach, lagged gender diversity measures, propensity score matching, Blau index, Shannon index and industry-adjusted measures of agency costs. Findings: The evidence reveals that the participation of female directors in corporate board reduces agency costs, which correlates with conflicts of interest. Moreover, gender-diverse boards are more effective in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), in which agency issues are more severe. Female directors also provide better monitoring roles in more-developed areas. Finally, corporate boards that have a critical mass of female directors have a greater tendency to reduce agency costs as compared to their token participation. Overall, all findings support the validity of agency theory. Practical implications: This study shows the economic benefit of female directors in the boardroom by reducing agency costs and by improving firms' governance structure. Regarding the government, which is gradually introducing board gender diversity policies, this study provides valuable pragmatic information for Chinese regulators on this issue. Originality/value: This study extends the literature by providing evidence that gender diversity in boardroom matters for shareholders' wealth maximization. It provides novel evidence that a critical mass of female directors is more effective in reducing agency costs compared to a single female on the board, and that the effect of gender diversity varies in relation to ownership structure and region.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it aims to investigate the dynamic impact of board composition (board size, board independence and board diversity) on independent corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices (marketplace, environment, community and workplace). Second, it tends to examine the mutual effect of board composition and CSR practices on organizational returns (return on assets and Tobin's Q) of 631 Malaysian PLCs listed on Bursa Malaysia during 2006-2017. Design/methodology/approach: The dynamic model (system GMM) provided by Arellano and Bond (1991) and Arellano and Bover (1995) is used for estimations that control for potential dynamic endogeneity, reverse causality, unobserved heterogeneity and simultaneity problems. Findings: Findings reveal weak linkage between board composition and CSR practices where only board diversity is found to be positively linked to marketplace practices of CSR. Further, the mutual impact of board composition and CSR practices on organizational returns suggests board size be positive and board independence to be negative with Tobin's Q. Board diversity is negative with ROA and positive with Tobin's Q. Conversely, CSR practices indicate marketplace practices are positive and community practices are negative with Tobin's Q, environment practices are insignificant with performance, whereas workplace practices are positive with ROA and negative with Tobin's Q. Practical implications: This research is practically considerable for Bursa Malaysia, Securities Commission Malaysia, policymakers, stakeholders, investors and managers. For academia, the theoretical linkages between agency theory, resource dependence theory, resource-based view and stakeholder theory are highlighted. Moreover, methodological underpinnings are also novel for academicians as well as for practitioners. Originality/value: The paper uncovers multiple aspects: first, it elaborates the dynamic relationship between board composition and CSR practices; second, it examines the combined effect of board composition and CSR practices on company's accounting and market gains; finally, the study controls for dynamic endogeneity that is the main econometric problem for CG-CSR-performance relationships.

Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to the existing capital structure and board structure literature by examining the relationship among corporate governance, ownership structure and capital structure. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a panel data of 595 firm-year observations from a unique and comprehensive data set of 119 Chinese real estate listed firms from 2014 to 2018. It uses fixed effect and random effect regression analysis techniques to examine the hypotheses. Findings: The results show that the board size, ownership concentration and firm size have positive influences on capital structure. State ownership and firm profitability have inverse influences on capital structure. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that better-governed companies in the real estate sector tend to have better capital structure. These findings highlight the unique Chinese context and also offer regulators a strong incentive to pursue corporate governance reforms formally and jointly with the ownership structure. Finally, the results suggest investors the chance to shape detailed expectations about capital structure behavior in China. Future research could investigate capital structure using different arrangement, conducting face-to-face meetings with the firm's directors and shareholders. Practical implications: The findings offer support to corporate managers and investors in forming or/and expecting an optimal capital structure and to policymakers and regulators for ratifying laws and developing institutional support to improve the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms. Originality/value: This paper extends, as well as contributes to the current capital structure and corporate governance literature, by proposing new evidence on the effect of board structure and ownership structure on capital structure. The results will help policymakers in different countries in estimating the sufficiency of the available corporate governance reforms to improve capital structure management.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate governance of Oman's financial sector companies. Intellectual capital has been found to successfully contribute to the economic wealth creation of firms in germane literature. Unfortunately, financial statements do not necessarily capture and reflect the contributions of intellectual capital, thereby leading to an information asymmetry between companies and users of financial statements. The research also investigates the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital efficiency across various financial subsectors. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports available on Muscat Securities Market for 31 listed financial sector companies for the period 2012 to 2016 and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Intellectual capital is measured using Pulic's efficiency measure of value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). Corporate governance individual components such as board characteristics, audit committee characteristics and ownership structure are presented as independent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that board size and frequency of audit committee meetings have a significant association with the intellectual capital efficiency of Oman's financial sector. VAIC and human capital efficiency of banks are also significantly influenced by most of the corporate governance mechanisms; however, other subsectors do not report such findings. Corporate governance of banks in comparison to other subsectors effectively engages in utilizing the potential of intellectual capital efficiency. Agency theory and resource dependency theory find limited support as a result of this study. The GMM results are not robust to the alternative instruments. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small as the study is limited to the listed financial sector of Oman. Future studies can be extended to include all of Oman's or GCC's listed companies. Additionally, the intellectual capital is measured using the construct of VAIC which suffers some limitations and can be overcome using other tools such as content analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that Oman's regulators can create an awareness strategy on highlighting the importance of intellectual capital for companies (board of directors and managers), investors, debtors and creditors. Further, Oman's Capital Market Authority and Muscat Securities Market need to strengthen the regulations related to intellectual capital. Originality/value: This study extends intellectual capital and corporate governance literature by presenting the research outcome for Oman's financial sector. It is useful for Oman's financial sector companies to direct corporate governance measures for driving value creation of firms through the management of intellectual capital efficiency.

This study examines the relationship between corporate non-financial disclosure ratings, the Italian Legislative Decrees 231/2001 and 254/2016, and three outcomes of Italian listed firms: performance, risk and agency cost. Based on stakeholder-agency theory, this study conceptualizes the role of firms' non-financial disclosures in reducing asymmetric information and agency costs between managers and broad stakeholders. Utilizing the Standard Ethics Rating (SER) as a measure of firms' non-financial disclosure rating, this study finds that SER ratings are positively related to firm value and are negatively related to firms' risk and agency costs. This study also provides evidence that the adoption of Italian Legislative Decrees 231/2001 and 254/2016, along with external verifications from the SER of firms' non-financial disclosure, has a positive impact on firm outcomes. Corporate managers and investors should recognize the value added from regulations that foster non-financial disclosures and ratings issued by an independent rating agency (e.g., Standard Ethics) as they both enhance firm performance and reduce risk and agency costs.

Purpose: This study aims to draw on the resource dependence theory to synthesize the conflicting arguments as well as commonalities of the agency and stewardship perspectives on the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 212 large-scale publicly listed companies representing 20 sectors in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings: The research results based on all of 212 publicly listed companies in Sri Lanka show, in support of the agency theory, that CEO duality exerts a negative effect on firm performance when the CEO is equipped with additional informal power. Conversely, CEO duality exhibits a positive effect on firm performance when board involvements are high, a finding that supports the commonalities of the agency and stewardship theoretical perspectives. Practical implications: By examining the governance practices and concepts in an Asian developing economy, this study provides insight into the power dynamics between the CEO and the board of directors in managerial contexts that are largely different from those in western countries. Originality/value: This study expands the theoretical underpinning of corporate governance research by identifying the performance implications of CEO duality within the broad context of the resource provision of the board of directors and the informal power of CEOs.

This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the relationship between corporate governance mechanism and firm performance among Shariah-compliant firms using an integrated theoretical framework. This study is carried out on the top 200 Shariah-compliant firms listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2017. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the researchers employ generalized least squares and random effect with robust and clustering standard error models to estimate the impact of ownership structure, board independence, board competence, firms' characteristics, and debt structure on firm performance as measured by the firm's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The findings show that ownership concentration has a statistically positive effect on firm performance. Having an external Chair and independent board members with an educational level beyond a bachelor's degree also have a positive effect on firm performance while CEO duality has a statistically negative impact instead. Insider representation has a positive impact on firm performance but when these inside board members are also the owners, the impact turns negative. Furthermore, the statistical significance of holding a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and other type of qualifications imply the need for board members to have greater knowledge in order to positively influence ROA and ROE. This is the first study to examine the influence of corporate governance mechanism on firm performance using a multi-theoretical approach in the context of Shariah-compliant firms. The interaction terms of elements in agency theory, stakeholder/resource-based theory, and stewardship theory are used as pre-conditions to the direct effect of these regressors on firm performance.

The effectiveness of the well-known corporate governance practices may not be universal due to fundamental differences in the environments under which firms operate. By using hand-collected data from all the non-financial firms listed on the unexplored East African frontier markets (i.e., Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda), we examine the effect of board characteristics on the performance of firms. Our results show that board size has a negative and significant effect on firm performance. The presences of foreigners and civil servants on the board play positive roles on financial performance, where the agency and resource dependence theories apply. Further, we find that board members with higher education also contribute to firm performance. These findings still hold when we consider the 2008-2009 financial crisis period. Overall, we show that in a business climate where ownership is largely dominated by few shareholders, the conventional governance mechanisms do not work effectively. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Innovation contributes to a firm's long-term competitive advantages but also involves significant risk and uncertainty. As agency theory predicts, CEOs are self-interested and risk-averse, and thus are reluctant to engage in innovation investments. However, the extent to which CEOs are self-interested and the mechanisms through which self-interested CEOs affect firm innovation have not been empirically tested. To fill this gap, we propose that CEOs possess a mix of both self-preserving and other-regarding motives, and build a mediation model in which CEO values affect firm innovation via firms' long-term orientation. Based on a three-phase (from 2014 to 2016) survey of 436 Chinese manufacturing firms, we find that CEOs with high self-regarding values reduce innovation efforts and performance by damaging a firm's long-term orientation. Moreover, CEO tenure, CEO duality, and environmental uncertainty weaken the relationship between CEO values and firm innovation via long-term orientation. Our study enriches the innovation literature by extending the basic assumptions of agency theory and by providing empirical evidence to determine whether and how self-regarded CEOs affect firm innovation.

Stakeholders expect focal firms to improve their environmental performance. While firms may be able to accumulate the environmental expertise needed to achieve this goal internally, doing so may require significant time and resource commitments. Alternatively, buyer firms can leverage their suppliers' existing environmental expertise and gain access to such expertise when they purchase products and services from these suppliers. The purpose of this study was to develop and test theory regarding under what conditions suppliers' environmental expertise influences a buying firms' procurement spend with these suppliers. We ground our study in transaction cost economics and agency theories and empirically test our hypotheses using a unique buyer-supplier dyadic data set. We find that buyer firms are willing to increase their overall business spend with suppliers that have strong environmental expertise, particularly when the buyer firms are more profitable and have higher levels of absorptive capacity. However, we find the opposite effect when the buyer firm's executive compensation is linked to the firm's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Likewise, we also find that the buyer firm's environmental concern ratings negatively moderate the relationship between the supplier's environmental expertise and the buyer's procurement spend with the supplier.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of royal family members on firm performance of publicly listed companies in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: Using 491 firm-year observations of non-financial publicly listed firms in Saudi Arabia's stock market between 2009 and 2013, the study employs, besides others, the advanced econometric technique GMM-system estimator. This allows the dynamic nature and control of the endogeneity problem to be accounted for in corporate governance and firm performance. Findings: The main result is that the attendance of royal family members at board meetings negatively influences firm performance but does not have an influence on firm value. The results also show that firms with many independent royal family members on the board of directors have better firm performance and firm value. In addition, firms with a high number of royal family members presenting on the board have better firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study offers guidance to assist the further investigation of the SA Royal Family's BoD membership either in SA or in other monarchy countries. It is interesting to compare these results in order to further understand the different effects that the Royal Family's BoD membership have in such countries. This study's results suggest that independent members of SA's Royal Family on the BoD have some influence on firm performance in both the short and long term. Thus, policymakers should encourage the members of SA's Royal Family to become more involved in firms' BoDs. Practical implications: This study offers guidance for further investigation of royal family members in the region or in other monarchy countries. It will be interesting to compare these results. The study suggests that royal family members on the board have a partial influence on firm performance, especially the independent ones. Thus, the policymakers should encourage more involvement of independent royal family members on the board. Social implications: Foreign and minority investors, who invest in SA's publicly listed firms, should note that when independent members of SA's Royal Family are on the BoD their investment will benefit from the reduced risks and uncertainty. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study undertaken to investigate empirically the influence a royal family's presence on the board of directors has on firm performance. This study is based on both theories, namely the agency theory and resource dependence theory. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The aim of this paper is to bring together some of the foundational and recent literature interlinking corporate governance and the leadership role of the board of directors. Strategic leadership is widely assumed to be a responsibility that defaults to the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). However, in practice, what most CEOs do is strategic management rather than strategic leadership. While strategic management does share key aspects of strategic leadership CEOs are expected to prioritize the managerial side over the leadership side. This is just one of the situations in which the boardroom assumes the leadership role. This paper discusses how boards of directors conduct the process of strategic leadership in their organizations. In recent years there has been an increasing interest among scholars to understand how boards strategize from a behavioral point of view. This growing interest has resulted in the development of various typologies regarding boards' involvement in the strategic leadership processes.

This study aims to investigate the relationship of board quality, audit quality and audit report lag on firm performance of manufactured Saudi's listed companies. The framework of the study is developed based on the predictions of agency theory and resource dependence theory that board quality, audit quality and audit report lag are associated with the firm performance. This study used 180 observations for the periods ranging from 2015 to 2017. The board quality is measured by two independent variables; board size and board meetings, audit quality is measured by the auditor brand name, the audit report lag is measured by the year-end to the date of the auditor's report, and firm performance is measured by the ROA and ROE. Using the pooled OLS Regression, the results show that out of four hypothesized independent variables, only audit quality has a significant and positive association with firm performance and audit report lag has a negative and significant association with firm performance. Importantly, the study suggests that regulators, especially Saudi stock exchange, should mandate companies to disclose all relevant information related to board and audit in a transparent and timely manner, and increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance practices. For companies, this study proposes that they should emphasize more on enhancing the role and the quality of their board of directors and the audit quality issues, as this enhancement may positively influence their performance.

Michael Jensen made a name for himself in the 1970s-1990 s with his 'agency theory' and its application to questions of corporate governance and economic policy. The effects of his theory were acutely felt in the pedagogics of business studies, as Jensen lent his authority to combat all attempts to integrate social considerations and moral values into business education. Lately, however, Michael Jensen has come to defend quite a different approach, promoting an 'integrity theory' of management learning. Jensen now rather aspires to empower students to give authentic expression to their personal values in their professional lives, and he sees the main function of management studies in assisting them in this effort. This article reconstructs the transformation of Jensen's outlook, drawing on Jensen's theories as an exemplar of wider trends in the current literature on management learning, away from a decidedly 'mechanistic' and towards a more 'humanistic' pedagogy of management. Jensen's case serves to highlight developments that might make for better preconditions for the appreciation of business ethics on part of business students. On closer inspection, though, it appears that his remaining within a positivistic framework ultimately impedes the kind of progress Michael Jensen envisions for business studies.

Research Question/Issues: Most extant literature implicitly equates obtaining information through board interlocks to acting on the information. We investigate triggers that help to translate the information into action. In addition to exposure to the information by board interlocks, we suggest that the self-interest of the individuals who create these ties and hierarchical power of interlinked firms determines the likelihood of taking actions of adopting new practices. Research Findings/Insights: Using the action of adopting two distinctive governance practices, stock option pays or board reform, we find that sent ties and received ties affect the adoption decisions differently. Whereas sent ties reflect managerial interests, received ties derive power from a hierarchical relationship between the focal firm and the interlinked firm. Such differential nature of sent and received ties drives a differential result in terms of adopting two distinctive governance practices. We also find support for different moderating effects of firm performance on the impact of sent and received ties. Theoretical/Academic Implications: In this study, we incorporated the self-interest of executives with sent ties to prior adopters and the power of directors who establish ties with prior adopters that are hierarchically positioned. By doing so, this study paints a more fine-grained picture regarding underlying mechanisms by which information gained through ties is translated into action. This provides important insights for both agency theory and resource-dependency theory. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Hierarchical board ties are not a unique phenomenon in Japan. We often find such ties in business groups in China, India, Korea, and some European countries. Establishing board interlocks among subsidiaries in a business group is an important governance resolution for controlling the whole business group. Hence, our findings that the ties carry not only information but also agent's interest and hierarchical power should be taken into account when a business group designs board interlocks.

This paper explores the development and articulation of the agency and stakeholder theories of the firm and their corresponding logics of shareholder wealth maximisation and stakeholder interest optimisation. We note how these two perspectives have been viewed as diametrically opposite normative, instrumental and descriptive theories, despite efforts by some authors to find common ground. Each has served as a basis for firm governance. We explore the relationship of the agency and stakeholder theories to the conceptualisations of the roles of boards of directors, and how both theories hold value in understanding two board functions/roles: control/monitoring roles and service roles (which covers both resources and strategy).

The performative power of mainstream economic theories (notably agency theory and transaction cost economics) has been criticised by researchers within management studies. The latter blame these theories for creating 'bad' management in real-world organisations and call for their removal from business schools. This paper questions this line of criticism. It argues that mainstream economic theories have condoned more than created 'bad' management. It also questions whether 'bad' management can be negated by ousting these theories from business schools. Rather it is argued that 'bad' management has deep roots within organisations - specifically, it reflects on how organisations are run by and in the interests of capital owners. The possibilities for securing comparatively enlightened or 'good' forms of management are seen as necessarily limited by capitalist ownership relations. The paper argues that the transformation of management will require wider reforms in - and importantly beyond - business schools. (c) 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

How should managers deliberate, and how do we teach them to do so? How one evaluates managerial decision making will partly depend on what conception of the corporate function one endorses. Agency Theory and its accompanying shareholder conception of the corporate function has long dominated management. Voices in management learning have called for a change, but we argue that such change has been hampered by the lack of a theory of managerial deliberation, which is compatible with the alternative stakeholder conception of the corporate function. Here, we develop a novel theory of managerial deliberation: one that is suited to stakeholder theory. We argue that if genuine ethical deliberation is to become prevalent within management, then we must conceive of managerial deliberation as a creative, yet rational, learning process, while we assure that this process is adequately constrained to allow for managerial accountability. By taking inspiration from modern philosophical theories of deliberation, we provide such a theory of rational managerial deliberation. Copyright of the Academy of Management, All Rights Reserved.

In this study we examine the effect of boardroom social capital, defined as the aggregate benefits from the social networks of outside directors, on director compensation. Using a large panel of nine thousand firm-year observations for the period 2007-2013, we find that boardroom social capital is positively priced. Further analysis shows that firms pay a premium for networked directors. Firms that have suffered adverse events such as a bad merger, performance declines, or dividend cuts, pay a higher connection premium. We determine that well-connected directors perform important board roles and hold multiple directorships. Overall, our results are consistent with an efficient contracting explanation for boardroom pay. (c) 2019

The number of unicorns, startups valued over $1 billion, has steadily risen over the past decade. The abnormally high valua-tion of a unicorn from investors is based on their potential to disrupt a market and create a new paradigm. With this as the back-drop, this piece asks the question, what theoretical tools do we have to understand unicorns? Specifically, we explore agency theory. We argue that if principals and agents agree on the goal of disruption, then perhaps the agency problem that does occur in unicorns is beneficial, not a cost. Further, we argue that the principals of unicorns do want agents to take higher than normal risks with their investment to disrupt a given market. From this phenomenon, we introduce the concept of agreeable moral hazard and its use in the unicorn setting. Not only does the concept of agreeable moral hazard provide theoretical implications for future research, but it also highlights the need for more research to test existing theory on the unicorn population.

Organizational transparency has become a prominent concern for the nonprofit sector as it expands globally. Transparency is important to organizational accountability, which may be indicated by how nonprofits allocate their resources. In this study, we examine the relationship between nonprofits' transparency and their resource allocation to programs, administration, and fundraising. Our study focuses on China, where a nascent nonprofit sector is playing increasingly significant roles in social development while facing public trust challenges. Based on Agency Theory and Resource Dependence Theory, we propose two hypothesized frameworks that link transparency to resource allocation, and use the 2013-2015 China Grassroots Organizations' Transparency Survey data (n = 370) to test this relationship. Our results suggest that nonprofits with higher transparency allocate more resources to programs rather than administration, a possible result of the current public scrutiny of nonprofit accountability in China. Our findings provide implications for nonprofit practitioners and future research about the significance of organizational transparency, particularly in emerging nonprofit sectors.

This study examined the strategic planning process used in U.S. public company boardrooms, with a particular focus on companies that used board-level Strategic Planning Committees (SPCs) as opposed to those that engaged the full board in strategic planning oversight (which we call "strategic planning overall" or "SPO" firms). Based on interviews with 8 SPC members and 12 directors from SPO firms, we found a number of similarities in SPC and SPO processes, as well as a number of key differences. Overall, it is clear that there often can be a fundamental tension between management and directors with respect to the responsibility for strategic planning. There also can be significant information asymmetries arising from agency theoretic assumptions requiring board independence and arms-length interactions. Organizational scope may, within limits, constrain these assumptions. Such conditions increase both resource and information processing demands on the board, creating a need for greater formality in the board's strategic planning processes. These demands increase the need for paradoxical approaches that can accommodate greater flexibility in board-management interactions. The paradox lies in the board's ability to simultaneously meet and balance agency theoretic, resource dependence based and information processing demands. The contrasting organizational logics that are in play result in paradoxes that influence whether and in what form a board-level SPC should be constituted. The evidence suggests that constituting and structuring SPCs to embrace more collaborative interactions between the board and management could be helpful in dealing with the contrasting requirements and tensions that arise in certain firms. Embracing paradoxes and modifying governance approaches to include collaborative interactions with management may also help in ensuring that the board's strategic planning processes are equipped to deal with the challenges that confront the organization. Ultimately, individual company directors will need to determine whether and in what form a board-level SPC would add value to their governance structure and processes. Our interview-based evidence suggests that firm size and director experience are important considerations in the choice of how the board should oversee strategy. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Adopting agency and resource dependence approaches, board gender diversity's interactions with three mediating organizational variables are evaluated against four organisational performance measures. Partially supporting agency theory and resource dependence theory, the results suggest that board gender diversity are only positively associated with sales to fixed asset ratio and sales per employee ratio. The BGD's effects at the organisational level are mediated distinctly by firm size, ownership structure, and industry nature respectively, and by the multivariate interaction among these variables. The results of this paper support the findings of other studies that found a partially significant link between the board gender diversity and the firm's performance. Decision-makers in society and politics, therefore, need to be aware of the empirical evidence indicating that stimulating organisational environment may need to be configured before the valuable outcomes of gender diversity can be achieved.

Numerous studies have investigated whether regulation substitutes for or complements internal governance. The results have been inconclusive due to their over reliance on agency theory and extensive use of demographic proxy variables to real board activities. We empirically investigate the relationship between government performance evaluation (GPEs) and internal monitoring by SOE boards in the context of Korean state-owned enterprises (SOEs), overcoming the limitations of existing empirical studies. This analysis is enabled by data collected from the 1,525 board minutes of 170 Korean SOEs. Our prior expectation is a substitutive relationship. First, the similarity of GPE and internal monitoring by the board makes the relative cost of internal monitoring more expensive. Second, GPEs only reward managers, leaving outside directors unpaid. The empirical results are consistent with our expectation, and indicate that even in heavily regulated SOEs, internal imperatives outweigh institutional pressure. Hence, policy makers should carefully design GPEs so as not to crowd-out the potential benefit of internal monitoring by SOE boards. (c), Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore why different directors feel different levels of accountability toward board tasks. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a reflexive three wave data and analysis process culminating in a rich data set of 49 interviews with Australian directors and 15 h of boardroom observations. Findings: Differences in role identification lead directors to perceive their accountability differently resulting in wide variation in levels of firm specific knowledge, eventually affecting their breadth of contribution to board tasks. Research limitations/implications: Researchers should question the application of traditional governance theory (such as agency theory) if it fails to account for individual differences in intrinsic self-interest. Practical implications: Selecting board members for their functional knowledge alone may not always produce optimal outcomes for the board and firm. Board induction processes and ongoing director training are important tools to inform and remind directors of their role and accountabilities on a board. Originality/value: This paper establishes that the strength of directors' identification with either the director role or expert role affects what they feel accountable for, the development of firm specific knowledge and long-term efficacy as a director.

Against the background of legal amendments and society's call for more gender-specific equality, this article examines the relationship between gender diversity in the supervisory board and its monitoring effectiveness. We test the aforementioned relationship based on agency theory and resource dependence theory and on the basis of several company-fixed panel regressions. The underlying panel data comprises 1500 supervisory boards of 132 companies listed in HDAX and SDAX between 2015 and 2017 (396 company years). Gender diversity is operationalized through different diversity metrics, and monitoring effectiveness is measured by excessive board compensation. The results indicate that a higher representation of women on the supervisory board (shareholder representatives and all members) is accompanied by lower excessive compensation and thus better monitoring effectiveness. In contrary, we cannot find a relationship between gender diversity of employee representatives or all members of the compensation committee and monitoring effectiveness. After international research has already dealt occasionally with this context, it is now being tested for the first time in the context of the dualistic corporate governance-system to what extent gender diversity in the supervisory board and the remuneration-related monitoring effectiveness are linked. Our paper argues that greater gender diversity, regardless of socio-political considerations, can be beneficial for companies' corporate governance and thus contributes to the discussion about the impact of the statutory gender quota.

Two divergent theories emerge from the literature on CEO duality. The agency theory advocates that a dual CEO negatively affects corporate performance, because it compromises the monitoring and control of the CEO, whilst the stewardship theory suggests the contrary effect due to the unity of command it presents. For a sample of 26 non-financial listed Portuguese firms from 2002 to 2016, this study draws on agency and stewardship theories to evaluate the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance, proxied by Tobin's Q. Using ordinary least square (OLS) and two stage least squares (2SLS) techniques to control potential problems simultaneity between CEO duality and firm performance, the author finds a negative relationship between CEO duality and Tobin's Q. This suggests that investors perceive no value in having a concentration of power with a dual leadership structure. Therefore, this study recommends that the positions of chairman and CEO should be separated for listed Portuguese firms. (c) 2020 by IGI Global.

The field of corporate governance can to a large extent be traced back the aftermath of the Great Depression 1929. The problem which led to the crash of the stock market was described as a division between control and ownership. The problem was described as managerialism. The thesis of managerialism inspired agency theory which has been synonymous with corporate governance theory. The theory focuses on the shareholder perspective and the importance of maximizing profits. Although corporate legitimacy has become a more important concept within institutional theory, it has had limited influence on the corporate governance discourse. That is, however, likely to change as the importance of the stakeholder perspective is growing. To align corporate governance with stakeholder perspective and strive for corporate legitimacy will have profound effects on the role of boards and corporate governance.

Thus this study explores CEO duality by using quantile regression, which estimates the CEO duality at different performance level of the firm, as classical OLS method explores relation at conditional mean of the two variable .The study uses both the accounting measure (EPS,ROCE& ROE) and market measure (P/BV and PE) to provide robust measure for relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. The results are mixed both positive and negative and only some models are significant, supporting the agency theory and negating the organisation theory. Finally, this paper contributes to the literature of corporate governance-CEO duality and firm performance substantially through the quantile regression method and comprehensive measure of firm performance in the Indian context.

We critically review the literature on state-owned multinationals to clarify previous arguments and guide future studies. The content analysis of prior research reveals that state-owned firms differ from private firms in their internationalization: they are motivated by national strategic objectives, select more challenging countries, and use acquisitions more intensively despite adverse market reactions. The analysis also reveals conflicting predictions on the level of internationalization; some studies find that state-owned multinationals internationalize more while others find the contrary. We introduce one solution to these conflicts by classifying theories into two camps based on the balance between the costs and benefits of state ownership. One camp suggests a disadvantage of stateness (agency theory, resource dependence theory, and neo-institutional theory). Another camp promotes an advantage of stateness (economic development, resource-based view, and institutional economics). We conclude by outlining three promising relationships in the study of these firms: (1) relationships internal to state-owned multinationals and the balancing of stakeholder demands; (2)relationships between state-owned multinationals and government and the influence of the political system; and (3) relationships between home and host country governments and the impact of their dynamics on state-owned multinationals.

Corporate governance is being acknowledged by almost all kinds of business communities and firms as an ultimate driver to improve the firm financial performance. This study examined the association between corporate board structure and corporate financial performance using a dynamic panel model. Principles of corporate governance deliver an explicit board structure for the purpose to facilitate the board members, which helps in making good decisions. The board of directors consists of the CEO, the chairman, the internal directors, and the external non-executive directors to work for the shareholders. This study undertakes different corporate governance attributes including non-executive directors, board size, and CEO duality and examines its effect on firm performance. The dynamic panel model is used, and preestimation and postestimation tests were conducted for the validity of the model. This study found a significant effect of board size, CEO duality, and non-executive directors on firm performance. The findings show that most of the governance variables are endogenous by nature. Results are consistent with agency theory. This study provides the theoretical and empirical evidence and applies a superior model (dynamic panel model) to better explain the association between corporate board structure and corporate firm performance in listed firms.

Purpose: This study explores the levels of and trends in corporate environmental disclosure (CED) among a sample of Sri Lankan listed companies from 2015 to 2019. Furthermore, this article examines the firm-level determinants of CED, including corporate governance (CG) mechanisms, in Sri Lanka from a multi-theoretical perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 205 firm-year observations, this paper distinctively applies a panel quantile regression (PQR) model to examine the determinants of CED in Sri Lanka. This method was supported by estimating a two-step generalized method of moment (GMM) model to tackle any possible existence of endogeneity concerns. Findings: The authors' findings indicate an increasing trend in CED practice among the sampled companies (i.e. 41 firms, the only adopters of the GRI framework) in Sri Lanka from 2015 to 2019. However, it is still considered at an early stage compared with other developed counterparts. Furthermore, this study suggests that board size, board independence, board meetings, industry type, profitability and firm size are positively associated with CED level. In contrast, and consistent with our expectation, CEO duality is negatively attributed to the disclosed amount of environmental information in the Sri Lankan context. Research limitations/implications: The authors' empirical evidence reiterates the crucial need to propagate and promote further substantive CG reforms, mandating CED in Sri Lanka. Originality/value: The authors' findings provide much-needed insights for indigenous companies, operating across similar emerging economies, to understand how CED can be incorporated into their reporting process based on the GRI framework in order to enhance their firm value, reduce legitimacy gaps and mitigate other operational risks.

Growing evidence suggests that gender diversity on boards of directors is important for corporate governance and overall organizational effectiveness. Yet, progress in increasing female board representation has been slow. Prior studies have focused primarily on either the role of organizational characteristics in board gender composition or the role of national institutions as predictors of female board representation across countries. In this study, we integrate psychological theory related to implicit biases and agency theory, with institutional theory, to propose that the national context for gender equality moderates the extent to which characteristics of organizational leadership relate to female board representation. We conduct a meta-analysis of 158 samples encompassing 60,648 organizations across 36 countries to test our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the importance of the national context for gender equality as a boundary condition for understanding the relationship between organizational leadership characteristics and female board representation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for increasing the representation of female directors across countries. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This study examines the effects of executive gender diversity (EGD) and board gender diversity (BGD) on hotel financial performance in China based on the framework of the gender role, agency, and resource dependence theories. This research documents a negative effect of EGD and no significant effect of BGD on hotel financial performance. Moreover, the effect of EGD on hotel financial performance captured by return on equity (ROE) exhibits a U-shaped curve, with the profitability measure bottoming out at 21%. Our analysis also shows that a critical mass of 40% of EGD serves as a positive moderator for the EGD-ROE relationship. Beyond this point, gender-balanced executive groups evade negatives rooted in the gender role theory, enjoy positives drawn in the agency and resource dependence theories, and generate superior financial performance compared to all-male executive groups. This research offers important implications for human resource management and policy and regulation formulation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

This paper comprehensively reviews the current body of international accounting literature regarding advisory/monitoring committees and corporate outcomes. Specifically, it synthesizes, appraises, and extends current knowledge on the (a) theoretical (i.e., economic, accounting/corporate governance, sociological and socio-psychological) perspectives and (b) empirical evidence of the observable and less visible attributes at both the individual and committee levels and their link with a wide range (financial/non-financial) of corporate outcomes. Using the systematic literature review method, 304 articles from 59 journals in the fields of accounting and finance that were published between January 1992 and December 2018 are reviewed. The main findings are as follows. First and theoretically, agency theory is the most dominant applied theory/studies with no application of theory at all (descriptive), while the application of integrated theoretical frameworks is lacking in the reviewed articles. Secondly, the existing empirical evidence focusses excessively on (a) monitoring instead of advisory committees and (b) observable rather than less visible committee attributes. Thirdly, scarcity of cross-country studies along with methodological limitations relating to measurement inconsistencies, insufficiency of variables, and dominance of quantitative studies, among others, are identified. Finally, promising future research avenues are outlined. (c) 2021 Board of Trustees, Vernon K. Zimmerman Center, University of Illinois.

Using a database of 56 studies on corporate governance in the banking industry that were published between 2007 and 2019, this study performs a meta-analytic review to examine the impact of board governance on bank performance. We investigate how board size, CEO duality, outside directors, and female directors on board play a role in determining bank performance. Variations in the relationship between board governance and bank performance that attribute to moderating effects of potential moderators, including the system of corporate governance, bank performance measures, the definitions of governance variables, publication quality, and endogeneity concerns, are also encapsulated. Our study shows that bank performance is positively associated with larger boards and a high proportion of outside and female directors, supporting the resource dependence theory. We find that the moderating variables considerably alter the link between board governance and bank performance. The study offers ways to enhance board effectiveness by enforcing governance practices in the banking systems based on each countries' legal and institutional framework and suggests reconsidering mandates for smaller boards and duality on boards of banking firms.

In view of integration and development, compliance with regulations on information disclosure has important implications for users. Corporate social responsibility disclosure (CSRD) is an increasing concern of the community and society. CSRD always poses many challenges for the profitability of banks. The article uses the ordinary least square method to examine this relationship and employs time-series data of five years from 18 Vietnamese listed banks from 2015 to 2019. The analysis is informed by Jensen and Meckling's Agency theory, Freeman's Stakeholder theory, and Dowling and Pfeffer's Legitimacy theory. The study results show that, with the CSRD dependent variable, return on assets (ROA) and net interest margin (NIM) have an opposite influence, but return on equity (ROE) has no effect on CSRD, while on the profitability dependent variable, CSRD has a different influence from ROA, ROE, and NIM. To enhance the relationship between CSRD and profitability, Vietnamese listed banks need to comply with CSRD as well as demonstrate responsibility to the community and society. Managers need to have clear development policies and strategies to ensure both profitability and responsibility regarding social and community activities. The State Securities Commission of Vietnam should enforce strict sanctions, conduct inspection, and complete evaluation criteria for Vietnamese listed banks.

While CEO compensation is seen as influencing firm performance, the intervening mechanisms that govern this influence have remained largely unexplored. Using the agency and expectancy theories, this paper attempts to open the "black box" between CEO compensation and firm performance and empirically tests the intervening effect of CEO risk-taking behavior on this relationship. Specifically, we hypothesize that CEO compensation indirectly influences firm performance through its direct effects on CEO risk-taking behavior. Results based on data collected from 204 U.S. manufacturing firms revealed a strong, positive relationship between CEO option pay and a firm's strategic risk, stock returns risk, and income stream risk. Results also showed that firm strategic risk, measured by R&D expenditure, mediates the CEO option pay-firm performance relationship, sometimes fully and sometimes partially, depending on which type of performance is being examined.

In this paper we exploit the complementarities between agency theory and resource dependence theory to investigate the influence of regulatory monitoring on financial reporting quality in the higher education sector. Our setting is U.K. universities. Using 14 years of data over the period 2002-2015, we find that financial reporting quality, (proxied by discretionary accruals), improves with the intensity of monitoring and resource dependence (proxied by the proportion of funding from regulators/funding bodies). However, this positive influence is mitigated in the presence of a pre-discretionary deficit, a proxy for the threat of regulatory intervention. A net benefit from monitoring remains for those universities with low levels of regulated funding but in those where there is high dependence the monitoring benefit is reversed and a pre-discretionary deficit is converted to a small reported surplus. Both agency and resource dependence theories offer explanations for these findings. Agency theory predicts increased financial reporting quality with increased monitoring and also a reduction in financial reporting quality to avoid costly regulatory intervention. Resource dependence theory predicts that both these effects will increase with increased dependence on resources from a key provider. These findings extend our theoretical understanding of financial reporting quality of universities, contribute to the limited literature on financial reporting quality in the not-for-profit and public sectors, and contribute to the exploration of the use of alternative theoretical frameworks in the domain of public sector accounting.

Purpose: The main objective of the study is to ascertain the level of independence and the effectiveness of the Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) members of Islamic banks in Bangladesh. This is because only SSB members are empowered to oversee and certify the overall business functions of Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach: This paper implements qualitative case research approach to explore the research objective in the context of Bangladesh. We applied purposeful and snowball sampling tactics for selecting respondents. By using a semi-structured questionnaire and face-to-face interviews, we collect data from SSB members, central bank executives and experts in Islamic banking and Shariah governance. Findings: The study finds that majority Islamic banks' SSB's positions are similar to the Board of Directors (BOD) of the banks. Next, this study finds that in recruiting/selecting SSB members, some banks do not follow the guidelines of the central bank. This study finds mixed evidence regarding the independence of the members of the SSB. Most of the respondents opined that SSBs do not have power; in some cases, members of SSB are not independent and seeming powerless as BOD selects and recruits them. In contrast, they are dependent on management in respect of strategy implementation. Research limitations/implications: The study significantly contributed to the national and global regulatory bodies by identifying an important governance determinant of Islamic banks that is the independence of SSB members, which is highly important for both Shariah functions, and to enhance the trust level of the stakeholders. This study makes a theoretical contribution by documenting the violation of stakeholder theory and agency theory in recruiting SSB members by BOD's choice. The lack of SSB members' independence has an impact on Shariah legitimacy of the Islamic banks which is contradictory with the notion of legitimacy theory. This study recommends the central bank to ensure the independence of the SSB and central bank should take initiatives to develop an environment for the Islamic banking sector. Originality/value: This study extends the literature of corporate governance relating to Islamic banking and financial institutions. More specifically, this paper explores the necessity of independence of members of the monitoring body (here SSB), an important constituent of governance, to ensure high-quality governance and transparency in reporting to increase diverse stakeholders' trust/confidence. The absence of independence of SSB in performing their functions contradicts with the agency, stakeholder and legitimacy theory, which is inconsistent with global evidence, that demands further investigations.

Although innovation can be a critical source of competitive advantage, research has found that debt can erode management's willingness to invest in R&D. In this article, we employ a stakeholder bargaining power perspective to argue that this effect is most pronounced when the firm's bonds are concentrated in the hands of bond blockholders. Furthermore, we contend that the temporal orientation of bondholders influences this relationship. Specifically, while it is commonly assumed that bondholders have a limited temporal orientation that induces them to focus on short-term value appropriation, we argue that some bond blockholders adopt a long-term temporal orientation. This orientation, in turn, makes them more inclined to support long-term value creation for the firm in the form of enhanced investments in R&D. Moreover, while agency theory suggests that there is an inherent conflict of interest between shareholders and bondholders, our results suggest that the temporal orientation of investors (i.e., both shareholders and bondholders) matters much more than whether they invested in the firm's equity or its debt.

Since the early 2000s, Sino-foreign equity joint ventures (JVs) have declined sharply as a predominant strategy for multinational enterprises (MNEs) to enter and operate in China. We study one of the contributory factors, foreign buyout, and its performance implications. By applying incomplete contract theory and an agency perspective, we provide micro evidence that superior post buyout performance is observed in converted wholly-owned subsidiaries (WOSs) with efficiency-seeking operations and subsequent CEO succession. The findings extend our understanding that ownership per se does not guarantee performance improvement. Instead, it is the alignment between ownership and the owner's inputs, and between ownership and the owner's managerial control, that give rise to performance improvement. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Given that nonprofits embrace diverse perspectives when adopting performance measurement, one key area of scholarly attention is understanding what leads nonprofits to embrace different performance measures. In this article, the author combines agency theory, resource dependence theory, and neo-institutional theory to explore how performance measures of nonprofits are associated with prominent organizational contingencies. Based on survey data from California nonprofits (n = 143), the regression results demonstrate that the adoption of performance measurement is not only influenced by external institutional pressures but also is associated with task characteristics and environmental uncertainty of nonprofits. This study helps nonprofits' stakeholders to better understand why nonprofits choose to adopt certain measurement dimensions. (c) 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We examine the extent to which outsider chief executive officers (CEOs) influence corporate financial leverage policies. We define an outsider CEO as one who appears in the reporting year and became CEO either immediately upon joining or within 3 months of joining a firm. There are arguments in the literature that the selection of an outsider CEO can either increase or decrease financial leverage. We investigate this issue using 11,118 Australian firm-year observations from 1216 firms listed during the period 2001-2015. Our findings suggest that, in the short-term after their appointment, outsider CEOs reduce firm dependence on debt. This result is robust to several additional tests and four measures to minimize endogeneity concerns. However, with an increase in their tenure at the firm, outsider CEOs revert to greater dependency on corporate debt. After supplementary analyses, we determine that the outsider CEOs short-term strategy of reducing financial leverage involves using cash reserves and restricting dividends to reduce existing debt. Instead, outsider CEOs finance capital expenditure projects thus providing a positive signal to the market that such CEOs are more creditworthy. Our results also suggest that outsider CEOs exercise more control over financial leverage when they have specialist attributes. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Research Question/Issue: On the basis of a dynamic interrelation between the assumptions of agency theory and stewardship theory, this study seeks to make sense of disobedience at the highest corporate level. Departing from a processual view in order to better understand how loyalty plays a critical role in the relationships between a CEO and his/her principal, we propose a conceptualization of the options open to a top executive in disagreement with the principal. We view the relationship from "below" by primarily taking the CEO's perspective, resulting in a more complex view on how "duty" is perceived and acted upon by the CEO. Research Findings/Insights: We use the rich and abundant archives left behind by the CEO of a large French firm. We had access to over 50,000 pages of documents that allowed us to follow the CEO and his relationships with his principals, at times from day to day. We found two competing loyalties (loyalty to the principal--agency theory--and loyalty to the organization--stewardship theory) that gradually become independent of each other, triggering different responses in terms of "exits" from the relationship with the principal. This particular dynamic in which the CEO acted as a guardian of the overall purpose of the organization enabled the emergence, development, and consolidation of a disobedience process that over the years contributed to the well-being of his firm as well as to the social changes occurring in France at that time. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This longitudinal study extends the corporate governance literature by offering a process-oriented approach, quite rare in this stream of research, and a more dynamic view of how agency theory and stewardship theory interact. Then, by providing empirical support for the idea that the disobedience process can protect and allow an organization to first evolve positively over time and eventually contribute to social improvements, our study proposes a form of responsible stewardship. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers important insights for executives, directors, and shareholders on how to make sense of, and in the long run potentially benefit from, disobedience at the highest corporate levels.

Scholars endorsing the embeddedness outlook call for directors' greater engagement in the strategic management process. In contrast, scholars endorsing the control outlook argue that directors should focus on fulfilling their fiduciary duty of supervising top executives. Based on the behavioral-agency theory, this paper outlines a conduct outlook on boards. Recognizing the benefits of directors' participation in the strategic management process, we hypothesize that it may boost directors' satisfaction with firm's performance, strategic planning, and strategy. This could lead to cognitive entrenchment and spur inertial tendencies. Structural equations modeling analysis of the data from a survey of 367 Canadian directors supports the hypotheses. These findings add knowledge to latest research on the advantages vs. disadvantages of activist boards. (c) 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The purpose of this study empirically investigates the influence of corporate governance structure on the firm's financial performance of the alcohol beverage industry in the United States. Secondary financial data were collected for the U.S.-based alcohol beverage firms. Bivariate correlation and fixed-effects model analyses were performed to examine the proposed impacts. A two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression analysis was subsequently performed to examine the endogeneity. The analysis outcomes support the finding that certain corporate governance attributes significantly affect the financial performance of alcohol beverage firms. Theoretically, the findings reaffirmed the financial impact of industry-specific corporate governance structures (i.e., stewardship versus agency theory, and integrated traits of hospitality, retail, and distribution of the alcohol industry). Managerial implications are suggested in terms of the alcohol industry's specific corporate governance models, such as the balance among common stock ownership, executive tenure, board-size increase, and levels of control by outside board members. As a relevant sector (e.g., festival) of the hospitality and tourism industry, corporate governance of the alcohol beverage industry has never been empirically nor theoretically studied. The governance attributes in this study are compared between stewardship and agency theory and provide a better understanding of alcohol beverage industry firms' corporate governance structure.

This chapter focuses on the interactions between mezzo and micro levels of analysis: i.e. it discusses the firm-employee relationship in terms of the clashes of interests and identities. The results from my empirical study demonstrate that the clashes in interests within and across levels of analysis and the related multilevel narratives trigger identity work at the level of the individual. I thus first discuss how agency theory, which deals with the principal-agent relationships, conflicts about priorities by different parties to these relationships, and the related power struggles, can inform the impact of multilevel narratives on assignment outcomes for inter-employee, inter-assignee, inter-entity, and firm-employee collaboration (see Sect. 10.1). Since role transitions, social categorisation, and identity work are featured more prominently in the study, these are the focal part of my theorising and, as such, the primary theoretical contribution of the empirical study. In the second part of the chapter (i.e. Sect. 10.2), I therefore discuss how my findings contribute to role (transition), social categorisation, and social identity theories by showing the particularities of role transitions, social categorisation, and identity work for international assignees (and to a limited extent their colleagues and business partners) and their implications for international assignment management in the context of emerging market firms.

The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship between government and public sector universities in the perspective of agency theory and propose a theoretical framework that will highlight the various aspects of the principle and agents. In this perspective government plays a main role as principal while public sector universities are as agent and this relationship is known as agency theory. This relationship normally has two major issues such as goal conflicts and information asymmetries. Correspondingly, in this review paper, systematic approach and content analysis approach have been adopted. The reviewed literature revealed that the government provides performance based grants to the public sector universities so government have pursued some expectations from public sector universities like accountability and transparency of the funds. Similarly, it has been highlighted that to verify the relationship between government and public sector universities in the context of agency theory because there is a sheer need to conduct empirical research studies.

This study aims to examine the role of supervisory board on internationalisation of Indonesia's listed companies. Based on the agency theory, supervisory board may improve the international company performance through company oversight. Specifically, this study investigates the effect of supervisory board composition, size, and expertise on international performance. The sample of this study is 61 manufacturing listed companies from 2012-2016 periods. The result shows that supervisory board composition has a positive and significant relationship with the company internationalisation. While, supervisory board size and expertise have no effect on company internationalisation. In addition, the company age and leverage also contribute to the internationalisation of companies.

Purpose: We examine how the net share purchases of top executives of acquiring firms, specifically the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Operating Officer (COO), can impact shareholder perceptions of a merger and acquisition (M&A) around the announcement time. Design/methodology/approach: Regression tests using the post-announcement cumulative returns as the dependent variables, and CEO and COO net purchases as independent test controlling for the net purchases of all other insiders, COO and CEO ownership, exercised options, unexercised exercisable options, merger type, pre-announcement firm size, past performance, industry growth, industry instability, year and industry fixed effects. The regression tests are used for various sub-samples (i.e. non-contemporaneous events, duality, operational complexity, economic conditions). Findings: We find that overall shareholders value the COO's net purchases before the announcement but not those of the CEOs. If the COO is also the CEO, then executive buy-ins appear to have a negative reaction from the shareholders. When the firm has many business segments or when the announcement is made in an economic recession, the COO's net purchases do not have a positive influence on the shareholders. Originality/value: We are the first to provide evidence that investors pay attention to the COO around M&A announcements. In the age of celebrity CEOs, who can instantaneously change the stock price with one press release, having another executive that can shape the opinion of investors can diversify the agency risk.

This study examines the relationship between the board of directors and cash holdings before and during the global financial crisis. We focus on the main demographic characteristics of the board: CEO duality, independent directors, and board size. Employing a sample of listed Italian industrial firms over the period 2003-2013, our empirical findings show the different behaviors of the members of the board of directors in determining cash holdings in normal conditions and during a crisis. In normal periods, in line with agency theory, a vigilant board--characterized by a high proportion of independent directors--reduces cash holdings. Diversely, the presence of CEO duality and larger boards increase cash holdings. In times of crisis, members of the board of directors abandon their monitoring duties or opportunistic behavior and become more participative to help the firm to survive. The results suggest that the effects of the board of directors' characteristics are contingent on a firm's external environment.

Conventional wisdom leads to assert that good governance may underpin bank performance while bad governance destroys stability and soundness. We run a factor analysis to synthesize 23 bank board characteristics of the Eurostoxx banks into seven key features: independence, size, dedication, tenure, corporate governance quality, external perspective, competence, and diversity. We then use multiple regression and find that independence and board and committees size are the most relevant characteristics for banks risk-taking and in line with the agency theory, our results show that independence increases the solvency of banks, and size reduces it.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the nexus between gender-diverse boards and cost of debt in the developing economies context. Specifically, the authors examine whether firm size moderates the relationship between female board representation and cost of debt, regardless of the industry type. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use panel data from 17 non-financial listed Ghanaian firms over the period 2007-2017, ordinary least square, two-stage least square and generalised method of moments estimations to test the hypothesis. Findings: The authors find that board gender diversity is positively related to cost of debt. Further evidence suggests the interaction of firm size and board gender diversity displays a negative association with cost of debt. Practical implications: The study evidence suggests larger non-manufacturing firms with gender-diverse boards attract lower cost of capital in an environment with lax enforcement of rules and regulations in corporate governance. Social implications: Lenders consider the size and industry of firms in pricing debt. This has implications on UN Goal 5, highlighting that shareholders of larger non-manufacturing firms benefit immensely from board gender diversity in the context of debt. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the board gender diversity and cost of debt literature by demonstrating that firm size and industry type matter in the developing economies context.

Purpose: The study aimed to examine the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on the performance of Egyptian firms listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX) between 2014 and 2016. Design/methodology/approach: We relied on agency theory and resource dependence theory to generate testable hypotheses and capture the empirical findings. We regressed various performance measures (Return on Assets; Asset Utilization Ratio, Tobin's Q) regarding governance mechanisms (institutional ownership, managerial ownership, board size, board frequent meetings, the presence of non-executive directors and female directors) while controlling for firm size, leverage, years of listing and market share. The study uses ordinary least square (OLS) and two stages least square (2SLS) regression analysis to address the possible endogenous impact of the firms' ownership structure. Findings: Board gender diversity, the managerial ownership and frequent board meetings positively influence the Egyptian firms' efficiency measured by assets utilization, while the institutional ownership and board size have negative effects. When using Tobin's Q, the managerial ownership shows a negative effect while institutional ownership and board size present positive effects. When using 2SLS regression, findings remained stable whereas non-executive directors showed a significant negative association with assets utilization. Practical implications: Policy makers are recommended to draft policies related to limiting the number of board members, diluting the government's indirect ownership of firms, empowering women in boardrooms and developing the skills needed for non-executive directors. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, our study is one of very few that address firms' performance after a period of political instability accompanied by a greater role for females in the boardrooms of Egypt.

Purpose: This study aims to explore the moderating role of board gender diversity (BGD) in the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms (i.e. board size, board independence, chief executive officer (CEO) gender, CEO duality and ownership concentration) and firm risk-taking. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 192 non-financial publicly traded Italian firms over 2014-2018, this study tests the proposed research hypotheses and assess the moderating effect of BGD. Findings: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study finds a significant relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm risk-taking, which is significantly moderated by BGD. BGD accentuates the negative effect of board size, independent directors, CEO gender and CEO duality on firm systematic risk and attenuates the positive impact of CEO duality on firm unsystematic risk. The results, which are consistent with the risk-reduction effect of BGD, are robust to the use of alternative measures of firm risk-taking. Practical implications: Women's presence on corporate boards plays a critical role in the board's involvement in risk-taking. Hence, investors and stakeholders should consider women on corporate boards as a crucial risk-mitigating factor. Originality/value: This paper contributes to our knowledge on risk management by demonstrating the moderating role of BGD while relating corporate governance mechanisms and firm risk-taking.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between board gender diversity and private firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the association between board gender diversity and private firm performance by estimating pooled multivariate regressions using an unbalanced panel data set of 115,253 firm-year observations. Findings: The authors find that younger, less busy and local women directors enhance private firm performance. Firms with 40% or more women directors report triple the economic benefits compared to boards with at least 20% women directors. Considering firm size, women directors significantly increase small firm profitability, and the effect is more pronounced for high-risk firms. Greater board gender diversity enhances small firm performance as the monitoring role of women directors benefits the firm even in the presence of busy men directors. Consistent with the agency theory framework, the authors find that women directors improve small firm profitability in the presence of agency costs. Research limitations/implications: Due to the lack of availability of data about private firms, many factors are not directly observable. The analysis uses accounting-based performance measures that may be subject to managerial discretion. Nevertheless, the authors report highly significant results using cash-based performance measures that substantiate the overall findings. Practical implications: The results of the present study point to the need for private firms to increase board gender diversity and consider women director busyness, age, nationality and firm size when making board director appointments. Originality/value: This study adds to the scarce existent literature investigating private firms. The results contribute to the understanding of gender-diverse boards as well as the attributes of women directors that enhance private firm performance. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The CSR program is one of the efforts made by the company to have a positive impact on the community as a result of the company's operational activities. Furthermore, the CSR programs that have been implemented provide information to shareholders that can be used to assess the firm's future survival. This study aims to scrutinize the CSR and GCG's effects on firm value as well as verify if profitability either strengthens or weakens CSR and GCG on firm value. Research design, data and methodology: To attain this purpose this study used Stakeholder Theory, The Signaling Theory, The Legitimacy Theory, and The Agency Theory, the authors used a quantitative research method, and this study's population was manufacturing companies listed on the IDX (Indonesian Stock Exchange) in 2017-2019. Employing a purposive sampling method, 31 companies were obtained. Thus, the data were tested employing the multiple linear regression method with Moderated Regression Analysis (MRA) utilizing SPSS. Results: This research's results indicated that CSR affected firm value, and managerial ownership influenced firm value. Meanwhile, GCG, as measured by institutional ownership, did not impact firm value. In addition, profitability could moderate CSR and managerial ownership, but profitability could not moderate institutional ownership. (c) 2022 by the Author(s).

This study examines the impact of gender diversity on sustainability growth, and moderating role of family ownership in an emerging economy, Pakistan. We employed 3730 firm-year observations, comprising of 307 non-financial firms listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange, over a period 2008-2020. Using framework of agency theory, resource dependence theory and social identity theory, we report that gender diversity results in higher sustainable growth in our sample firms. Further, our results indicate that due to strong identification of family owners with their firms, their presence positively moderates this relationship. Overall, we report that despite of a weak corporate governance mechanism, the presence of female directors and family owners results in higher firm growth and low agency conflicts, which serve as positive signals for the investors. Our study provides empirical support to mandatory appointment of female directors on boards and urge the policymakers to focus on capacity building of female workforce.

Building on agency and resource dependence theories, we study the relationship between the value of initial public offerings and the extent of board independence, which we find to be an inverted U-shape: beyond a certain threshold, board independence becomes excessive. Consistent with agency theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced when ownership and control rights are separated. Consistent with resource dependence theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced in companies with higher industry diversification and less pronounced when the roles of the CEO and president of the board of directors are separated.

This paper aims to systematically review the existing studies of corporate governance with organisational performance in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and put forward theories, research methods, topics, and variables that emerge from the review. The systematic literature review is based on 42 peer-reviewed journal articles on the topic written by reputable academics on the Science Direct Database focused on corporate governance, board characteristics, and ownership structure. This study's conceptual framework is based on agency theory, which is the most widely used to analyse corporate governance (Fama & Jensen, 1983; Jensen & Meckling, 1976). The majority of results show a positive correlation between corporate governance and organisational performance (Pucheta-Martinez & Gallego-Alvarez, 2020) with agency theory being the most utilised theory of choice (Bergh, Ketchen, Orlandi, Heugens, & Boyd, 2019; Panda & Leepsa, 2017). This paper undertakes a significant thorough systematic review of corporate governance with firm performance and the Fourth Industrial Revolution literature. It gives an 11-year review with a reference index from 2011 to 2021, useful for both academics and professionals. This study recommends more evidence-based systematic reviews for different aspects and within different regions. It is further recommended to expand geographical spread across all continents to cover corporate governance area and to improve studies related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and its impact on corporate governance. Lastly, it is recommended that more studies that look at the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on corporate governance and firm performance should be performed. (c) 2022 The Authors.

The COVID-19 outbreak is a black swan event that has uncovered the delicateness of global supply chains and business architecture. Underpinned by the agency theory and institutional theory, a proposition for business continuity in the highly regulated pharma industry is presented in this paper. A cross-sectional quantitative study was carried out on a sample of 102 pharma supply chain executives in Malaysia. The primary data were gathered by administering a self-administered questionnaire and analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The result reveals that supply chain orientation directly influences supply chain resilience. Also, introducing collaborative regulation as a mediator in this relationship shows partial mediation. The notion of collaborative regulation as a behavioral governance mechanism is relatively new, thus, presenting interesting opportunities for further exploration of the subject matter.

Purpose: This study draws on resource dependence theory (RDT) to explain a board's governance function in the United States (US) nonprofit healthcare industry. Specifically, while various nonprofit research studies have appealed to agency theory (AT) to explain the monitoring role of an outside board, RDT offers an alternative explanation that emphasizes an outside board's resource gathering role. Design/methodology/approach: In drawing on the nonprofit GuideStar database, a fixed effect (FE) panel estimation was conducted on a sample of 230 US Non Profit Healthcare Organizations (NPHCOs). This panel estimation examines the relationship between the composition of an outside board and an NPHCO's revenue and public support performance. Findings: A key finding of this study is that the composition of an outside board involving its' number, compensation and gender impacts an NPHCO's revenue and public support. Research limitations/implications: This study shows that the composition of an outside board impacts an NPHCO's ability to gain access to external resources. As NPHCOs face increasing pressure to seek external forms of revenue support, this study suggests that boards should favor a larger number, compensation and female representation of outside members. Practical implications: The composition of an outsider board can offer external sources of revenue support that lower the poor's requirements for financial assistance and thus affirm an NPHCO's identity as a charitable organization. Originality/value: As an NPHCO's identity as a charitable organization is dependent on serving the medical needs of the poor, an outside board not only introduces a resource gathering function that is absent in the monitoring explanations of AT, but that this resource gathering function is important to affirming this identity.

As a result of recurring natural disasters caused by climate change, firms are under enormous pressure to reconsider their environmental footprints. However, whether or not investors reward firms' climate change actions remains a topic of considerable debate. Using a sample of S&P 500 companies over the period 2005-2020, we hypothesise and find a significant negative relationship between climate change actions and the cost of debt, indicating that investors indeed reward corporate climate efforts in the form of lower cost funds. This relationship exists in both environmentally sensitive and non-sensitive industries and remains negative and statistically significant even after controlling for the impact of the ongoing pandemic (COVID-19). The findings are robust to the use of alternative measures for our variables, alternative estimation methods and after controlling for endogeneity issues. We interpret our findings within the decision-usefulness and stakeholder-agency theories that suggest that non-financial information on firms' environmental performance is becoming increasingly important when borrowers' creditworthiness is assessed. Our study offers important regulatory and academic policy implications. (c) 2022 The Authors. Business Strategy and The Environment published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Nonprofit accountability research has garnered much attention in recent years, greatly expanding our understanding of the field. Yet, this focus has resulted in a complex and oftentimes fragmented body of research, which has made it difficult to navigate and effectively study nonprofit accountability. To address this concern, this article uses characteristics of accountability and articulates the dynamic interaction between the various accountability dichotomies found in the literature through a theory-based typology. In summary, this article argues that a narrow conception of accountability, focused on resource dependence, public interest and agency theories, can be seen as a functional process ("how") to meet the imposed requirements ("for what") of upward principals ("to whom"). In contrast, a broad conception of accountability, focused on stewardship, democratic, and stakeholder theories, can be seen as a strategic process ("how") to provide information that is based on felt responsibility ("for what") to downward stakeholders ("to whom").

Previous corporate governance research has paid little attention to the role of chief executive officer (CEO) labor markets in controlling CEO behaviors because the CEO labor market has been considered inefficient. With the increasing mobility of top executives across firms, however, the potential of CEO labor markets to serve as an external disciplining force has been growing. In this study, we argue that CEOs will be more pressured to engage in desirable behaviors as the CEO labor market becomes more efficient. Using a longitudinal sample of S&P 1500 firms in high-technology industries in United States from 2011 to 2019, we found that CEOs tend to increase R&D investment as CEO labor market supply increases. We also found that the tendency is greater when external CEO succession is more frequent in the market. Our results demonstrate that CEO labor markets have the potential to function as an effective external governance mechanism. Copyright (c) The Author(s), 2022.

India has recently witnessed a set of banking frauds, pointing toward the possibility of loose corporate governance mechanisms in the banking sector. The present study aimed to evaluate the composition of the board of directors in terms of the corporate governance parameters to assess whether they impacted the performance of the listed Indian banks. The hypothesis for the same was formulated based on the agency and the resource dependency theory. The study made use of the 34 public as well as private sector banks listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange 500 for a period of 12 years (2010-2022). The analysis was conducted using the STATA software's fixed-effect panel data regression model. The results suggested that board size, percentage of women directors, and percentage of independent directors on the board of banks impacted the financial performance of these banks. The study shed light on the mechanism and ways to improve bank performance using corporate governance parameters. It makes valuable contributions to the literature on corporate governance and shall be helpful for both managers and policymakers in formulating regulatory guidelines.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the significance of board gender diversity (BGD) on the firm's intellectual capital (IC) performance of 272 Indian firms listed on the National Stock Exchange during 2007-2019. Considering the recent regulatory amendment by the Indian regulatory system (Security Exchange Board of India, 2018) which mandates at least one female independent directors on boards of all listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on theories and literature reviews, hypotheses were developed. This paper uses the proportion of female director on board and proportion of female independent directors to measure BGD and modified value-added intellectual coefficient (MVAIC) methodology to measure firms' IC performance. Two-step system-generalised method of moment panel data regression analysis has been employed to identify the variables that significantly affect IC performance. Findings: This paper finds female representation on boards has a significant impact on MVAIC; capital employed efficiency shows the strongest association with female directors on board, followed by structural capital efficiency and human capital efficiency, while relational capital efficiency shows no significant effect. The results further demonstrate that female independent director has a significant but negative impact on IC. Research limitations/implications: As the study is limited to the listed firms of an emerging economy with a mandatory female quota for boards. Thus to increase the generalizability of findings, future research can be extended to include all listed and non-listed firms from another emerging economy with a mandatory female quota. Practical implications: From the practical perspective, this study bridges the gap between theory and practice in terms of providing a deeper understanding to the policymakers and Indian regulatory bodies like the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Securities Exchange Board on the importance of including female members on board as a vital contributing factor for leveraging firm's intangible performance. Originality/value: Using resource dependency theory and agency, this study extends the literature on IC efficiency and female representation on boards by presenting the research outcome for Indian listed firms. This paper, addressing the recent changes introduced by Indian regulators and using the female independent directors on board, is amongst the first attempts to assess the relevance of BGD and IC performance. This issue has still not been discussed and analysed by researchers in India. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Multinational corporations (MNCs) are considered as dispersed structures of power, in which diverse headquarters (HQ)-subsidiary power relationships collectively influence performance and management. Yet, few studies have accounted for the subsidiary portfolio characteristics shaped by the entire set of differentiated HQ-subsidiary power relationships, and little is known about their effect on the performance and management decisions of MNCs. Drawing on agency and resource dependence theories, this study investigates how the power structure of the MNC, or the pattern of power distribution in the subsidiary portfolio, affects MNC performance and expatriate utilization. Results from a comprehensive panel of Korean MNCs show that the degree of power concentration in the subsidiary portfolio has inverted U-shaped relationships with MNC performance and the use of expatriate control. However, the results also reveal that these relationships vary between manufacturing and downstream subsidiary portfolios. These findings suggest that the structural characteristics of the subsidiary portfolio are important determinants of MNC performance and management. This study opens an important new avenue for international business scholarship by explicitly conceptualizing the MNC as a portfolio of differentiated subsidiaries and by examining the consequences of the subsidiary portfolio characteristics.

Board director independence is critical to achieving and maintaining control to address the agency theory-based issue of interest misalignment between the principal (the organization) and the executives (agent). However, theoretical and empirical research and strategic risk considerations have brought into question the role or relevance that director independence plays in these control task and agency theory domains. We ask, using a quantitative survey method, whether board activity-based applications of independence may be associated with the service task of the board, namely its resource dependence mission. Our findings suggest that the resource dependence duty of the board may be positively associated with some autonomous activities, and yet other activities might be driven primarily by normative practices. Based on this, we suggest that a theoretical scope beyond and greater than agency theory may be needed when reassessing the role of director independence.

We study how a regulator (Securities and Exchanges Commission; SEC) responds to IPOs that have a higher political profile. We find that IPOs with issuers (intermediaries) that actively pursue political strategies receive more (less) SEC comment letters than IPOs without such actors. Cross-sectional analysis reveals that the IPO's political environment moderates the relationship between social pressure for more corporate transparency and SEC scrutiny. Additional tests indicate that the political activities of issuers (intermediaries) contribute to a less (more) efficient IPO process. Overall, our findings suggest that politically active intermediaries have stronger incentives to accurately portray the IPO financial reporting environment than politically active issuers because they have greater reputational and political capital at stake; quite simply, the former have more to lose. We draw out the implications for theory, in terms of agency and reputation. (c) 2022 Crown copyright.

Purpose: While there is an increased demand from various corporate stakeholders on the need for public companies to have risk management frameworks as well as a stand-alone risk management committee to mitigate risks and simultaneously improve performance, this study investigates the effects of the risk management committee attributes on firm performance, and the role of board size is highlighted on this relationship in Malaysian listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: Both accounting- and market-based performance measures have been used for measuring performance. A dynamic model using the generalized method of moments (GMM) has been employed to control for potential endogeneity, simultaneity and unobserved heterogeneity. Findings: The findings reveal that risk management committee attributes such as size, independence and meetings negatively affect book-based performance measures and positively affect market-based performance measures. Moreover, board size positively moderates the risk management committee attributes and performance relationship. The study embraces the predictions of agency theory and resource dependence theory. Practical implications: The findings are practically significant for Bursa Malaysia, Securities Commission Malaysia to assess the compliance of the Corporate Governance Code (MCCG, 2017) and for academia to further explore significant relationships in other emerging economies. Originality/value: The paper contributes to multiple aspects: first, it studies the impact of risk management committee attributes on firm performance; second, it investigates the moderating effect of board size on RMC-performance relationship; in the end, the study employs dynamic modeling for estimation process to avoid dynamic endogeneity considered a main econometric problem for CG-performance relationships.

Based on the Resource Dependence Theory (TDR) and the Agency Theory (TA), this research aims to analyze whether there is a relationship between the number and type of directors (construct board of directors) concerning indicators of financial performance of the company based on ROA, ROE, Net Profit Margin, Income Per Employee, and Beta or Systematic Risk (construct financial performance). Using the innovative and suitable method for small samples, PLS-SEM, authors create a theoretical model based on literature review and a measurement model that operates based on multiple and simultaneous correlations between the selected variables. The results show the conformation of two constructs and denote a statistically significant relationship between them. It has the limitation of being an exploratory and transversal analysis. The study is original in applying the statistical method to the field of corporate governance and finance and in the selection of variables. It is concluded that the proposed theoretical model is efficient in studying the constructs in companies. (c) 2022 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas. All right reserved.

The current study evaluates how gender diversity impacts the stock price, whether on the audit committee, commissioners, or directors, using firm size as the moderating variable. A total of 240 secondary data samples were derived from 24 publicly listed banking institutions from 2012-2021. The multiple regression and moderated regression analysis used to process the sample research was considered the most suitable for this study. The statistical test in the first model showed that the existence of women executives on the board of directors impacts the stock price. This first model result is in line with the research by Baez, Baez-Garcia, Flores-Munoz, and Gutierrez-Barroso (2018). The gender diversity in the composition of commissioners and audit committees showed that it had not impacted the stock prices. Furthermore, the directors and audit committees affected the stock price in the second model. This result is in line with the research by Qayyum et al. (2021) that demonstrated that the women officers on a company's board could lower crash risk in stock price. Contrarily, the variable in this second model, the board of commissioners, did not impact the stock price. Thus, the second model noticed that firm size, as moderating variable, weakened the impact of the audit committee on the stock price. The current study contributes to the literature concerning the impact of gender diversity in company officers' levels on the stock price. Future researchers can use other samples from other emerging markets countries. Further investigations are urged to broaden the context of the study to achieve more enriched findings.

Following its 40th anniversary and more than three decades after its introduction to the strategic management literature, agency theory remains the predominant theory of corporate governance. In this paper, we examine affect, an underexplored dimension in principal-agent relationships. Using the CEO-board of directors relationship as a context, we develop a theoretical lens that explains how interpersonal affect underlying relationships between CEOs and directors of boards shapes behavior in ways that deviate from traditional agency theory predictions. We discuss how the incorporation of an affective perspective advances principal-agent research by revising agency theory's assumptions concerning human nature and behavior and suggesting new research directions. By acknowledging a central role of affect, we connect existing behavioral approaches to organizational agency and advance our understanding of socioemotional foundations of principal-agent tensions, problems, and agency costs.

The growing number of corporate scandals globally highlights the importance of effective corporate governance mechanisms. Many of the corporate governance frameworks that are rooted in the agency theory advocate the election of independent non-executive directors, an independent chairperson, and a lead independent director. Shareholder voting on the election or re-election of directors (hereafter referred to as 'director re-elections') has been largely unexplored in South Africa--a country widely recognised as a pioneer in the corporate governance field and yet marred by several corporate scandals in recent years. In this study, an unbalanced panel data set was thus constructed comprising voting outcomes and board-level characteristics of companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2020. Significant positive relationships were noted between shareholder voting opposition to director re-elections and both board size and board tenure. Shareholders who cast opposing votes mainly did so because of their concerns about the lack of director independence, at board, committee, and nominee level. The findings of this study were explained in the context of the agency, stakeholder, stewardship, and resource dependence theories. It is recommended that nomination committees use more robust selection criteria for directors. Shareholders are also encouraged to vote more actively on director re-elections to monitor these monitors. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

Managers could opportunistically misuse corporate social responsibility (CSR) to obfuscate earnings management (EM) by reporting more CSR activities that eventually accomplished stakeholders' advocacy as their demands on CSR are satisfied. Likewise, sensitive industries have a higher commitment to CSR to appease their stakeholders' adverse reactions to the nature of their business. This study examines the relationship between EM and sensitive industries on CSR (proxied by the quality of CSR disclosure) and the moderating role of sensitive industries in the relationship between EM and CSR. Employing multiple regression analysis on Malaysian public listed companies for the year 2016, this study finds an insignificant association between EM and CSR, a positive association between sensitive industries companies and CSR and sensitive industries moderate the relationship between EM and CSR. This study offers practical implications for companies to strengthen their corporate governance mechanisms and for investors to cautiously evaluate the companies' ethics.

The objective of this study is to examine the role that the specialized committees, created within the board of directors, and the auditor play in relation to the hiring of a non-financial information assurance service and in relation to the choices of the assurance provider for such non-financial information. Specifically, this study analyses the effect of the independence and specialisation of the audit committee, the existence of a CSR committee, and the reputation of the financial auditor associated with its classification as Big4. The results indicate that those responsible for financial information do not show interest in contracting an assurance service, especially if it is realized by an accountant provider, except that the information is standardised according to the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and the contracted service is comparable to the financial audit standards, has assurance for a reasonable/high level, and is carried out according to the ISAE3000 standard.

The alignment among multiple stakeholder benefits is a valuable performance indicator for the benefits generated by a firm for various stakeholders. Our research seeks to augment stakeholder-agency theory with an institutional perspective to analyze how national institutions affect stakeholder benefit alignment. We suggest that the current development of stakeholder-agency theory has overlooked the alignment of different stakeholders' benefits and the external institutional contexts as critical determinants in ensuring such alignment. We conceptualize stakeholder benefit alignment as a positive relationship between different stakeholder groups' benefits, and propose an institutional framework grounded in relative stakeholder salience. Using this framework, we argue that stakeholder benefits are better aligned when national institutions enhance the ease of withdrawal, legal protection, and private enforcement for intrinsically less salient stakeholders, and when a long-term oriented culture characterizes a society. We found supportive evidence by employing a meta-analytic approach based on 530 correlations from 94 primary studies representing 23 economies. Our study adds new insights to the stakeholder-agency literature by conceptualizing and quantitatively examining the degree of alignment across different stakeholder benefit dimensions, focusing on national formal and informal institutions as boundary conditions.

Using a cross-sectional dataset comprising 749 firms from 13 countries in Asia Pacific markets, this study examines the effect of board monitoring effectiveness (BME) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP). This study also investigates how BME and the country's legal system, and BME and CEO non-duality leadership interact to influence CSP. The results reveal that BME positively affects CSP, suggesting that strengthening board monitoring effectiveness will lead to a greater drive towards firms' sustainable business conduct. This study also finds that firms from countries with civil law system and firms practicing CEO non-duality leadership would enhance the impact of BME on CSP. Additionally, the effect of BME on CSP is more pronounced among non-duality firms operating in countries with civil law regime. The findings are consistent and robust to two different measures of CSP. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The purpose of this study is to gauge the efficacy of theories of corporate governance in alleviating bankruptcy in the Indian context. The study uses logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard model on a sample of 680 firm observations. Two-stage least squares regression is employed to mitigate endogeneity issues. Main results support agency theory in terms of CEO non-duality, low CEO compensation, and concentrated ownership variables, and defend resource dependence theory with respect to large board size and high directors' attendance, for precluding bankruptcy. Internal and external governance mechanisms are more favourable in 5 to 3 years and 1 to 2 years prior to bankruptcy, respectively. The predictive power of governance models is found to be better than of financial models in 5 to 4 years prior to bankruptcy. Combined models involving both governance and financial variables outperform standalone governance or financial models and are most accurate in the fifth year preceding bankruptcy. Additional tests show that the time availability of independent directors holds more importance over their resourcefulness in the initial years of distress. This study has a few key takeaways for stakeholders, companies, and regulating bodies. It is suggested that regulators enforce CEO non-duality and necessitate a minimum number of board meetings to be attended per year by the directors. This is one of the first studies to develop a corporate governance model on bankruptcy in the Indian context since the enactment of its new bankruptcy code.

Despite the nonprofit sector's significance in economic contribution, workforce, and social impact, it faces unique innovation hurdles and is not well positioned for sustainability, growth, and prosperity. However, with only a partial, disconnected view from the extant research, we do not understand the relationship between boards and nonprofit innovation for growth. To address this problem, we conducted a systematic literature review drawing on 27 studies published since 2000 to provide a first-in-field and comprehensive integration of disparate, mono-factorial research. We conceptualize a new, multifactorial model that depicts a blend of board composition, relations and practice factors, and organizational and environmental characteristics that influence nonprofit innovation for growth.

How private firms can overcome their unique governance challenges remains an important but understudied topic. Using novel data on more than 28,000 private firms in India from 1988 to 2017, we examine whether private firms can improve their survival prospects by having board interlocks with public firms and, specifically, interlocks whereby a public firm director subsequently joins the private firm's board. In our data, we found a U-shaped relationship between the number of incoming board interlocks and the probability of private firm exit. We also found that board interlocks formed by public firm directors of public firms audited by Big Four companies improve private firms' survival more than other interlocks, consistent with the notion that such interlocks improve monitoring at private firms. Overall, our study points toward the importance of considering the role of incoming board interlocks when explaining private firm survival. (c) The Author(s) 2023.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of ownership structure variables on the performance of Saudi listed firms. Design/methodology/approach: The impact of ownership structure variables on firm performance is examined using fixed effects and dynamic panel generalised method of moments regression approaches for 70 listed firms over the period 2016-2021. Ownership structure variables are captured by examining government, institutional, insider, foreign and family ownership, and firm performance is gauged in terms of the accounting-based measures of return on assets and the return on equity and the market-based measures of Tobin's Q and the market-to-book ratio. Findings: The results show that government, institutional, insider and foreign ownership all positively affect both accounting and market-based performance measures, whereas family ownership exerts a negative impact across the models. The findings support resource dependence theory, agency theory and alignment effects arguments. Practical implications: The findings have significant implications for Saudi regulators in their effort to improve domestic capital market efficiency and investor protection, while also highlighting the need for a corporate governance code to safeguard minority shareholders. The results demonstrate that government, institutional, insider and foreign ownership exert an important impact on firm operational and market performance. Originality/value: This study expands the literature by examining how ownership structure variables affect performance in an interesting developing country corporate context.

This study aims to provide a bibliometric review (Zupic & Cater, 2015; Hallinger, 2019) of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base. This paper is guided by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and based on the Scopus index for determining and extracting data. A total of 1,661 articles from 1983 to 2021 are included. The USA, the UK, and Australia are the leaders in the literature. A significant gap exists for further research from developing and non-Western settings. We identified authors with the highest citations (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Kose John), the most prominent authors based on the citation for each document (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Igor Filatotchev), and the most highly cited documents (--Higher market valuation of companies with a small board of directors||, Yermack, 1996; --Disentangling the incentive and entrenchment effects of large shareholdings||, Claessens et al., 2002, and --Boards: Does one size fit all?||, Coles et al., 2008). Besides, the review reveals an intellectual structure of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base in three schools of thought: agency theory, firm value, and boards of directors. Our findings provide an overview of top-influential research for new scholars and enable us to identify highly cited theoretical foundations quickly. (c) 2023 The Authors.

This paper examines the relationship between board capital attributes and corporate social responsibility disclosure (CSRD) quality and how CEO power moderates the association between board capital attributes and CSRD quality. Using a cross-sectional sample of 114 firms, we find that directors' experience and directors' interlocking have positive impacts on CSRD quality while directors' political ties have a significant negative impact on CSRD quality in Saudi firms. Contrary to our hypotheses, we find no support for the impacts of directors' education, directors' expertise, and board nationality on CSRD quality. Moreover, we find partial support for the moderation effects of CEO power. Overall, we theoretically highlight the roles of resource dependence theory and agency theory in enhancing CSRD quality.
