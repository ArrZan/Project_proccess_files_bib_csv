The absorption of the micronutrients B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn by banana (Musa sp.) cultivar "Prata Anã" explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog supplemented with BAP (3.5 mg/L) and sucrose (30 g/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after the inoculation. The experiment was arranged on a completely randomized design with three replications. Concentration of the micronutrients in the medium and in dry matter of the whole propagule and in the rhizome, pseudostem and leaves was also evaluated. Absorption of Mn was approximately constant during all the period of the experiment, while the other micronutrients had their higher absorption observed on the first 20 days. At the end of the experiment concentrations of B, Zn, Mn and Cu in the medium were 52, 61, 77 and 78%, respectively. These results point out that it is possible to reduce the concentration of these micronutrients on the basic medium MS for banana explants culture.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between vegetative and productive characteristics of banana tree (Musa spp) cv Prata-Anã (genomic group AAB) differently managed from the conventional system. The experiment was carried out in an orchard with five years old banana plants spaced by 3,5 x 2,0 m, in the Fazendas Reunidas FFL Ltda., at Cristais Paulista, São Paulo, Brazil. The experiment was a split plot under a completely randomized design with three replicates, being the main treatments constituted by: M1 - daughter-plant without the mother-plant whose stem was cut after flowering; M2 - daughter-plant and mother- plant conventionally managed until harvest. The sub plots were constituted by twelve periods of selection of the daughter-plants (February 2002 to January 2003). The pseudostem diameter and the bunch weight of all plants and the vegetative period of the daughter-plants were evaluated. The statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the stem diameter of the daughter-plants and mother-plants. The stem diameter of the mother-plant was positive correlated with its bunch weight. However the stem diameter of the daughter-plant not was correlated with its bunch weight. The vegetative cycle and the pseudostem diameter of the daughter-plants were negatively correlated. The Plant management (M1 and M2) and the selection of periods daughter-plant did not affected the correlations evaluated in this study.

An investigation about the genetical diversity among eleven banana diploid genotypes using nine agronomical characteristics and sixteen microsatellite markers was implanted at Embrapa Cassava and Tropical Fruits, Cruz das Almas (BA), Brazil. The generalized distance of Mahalanobis indicated the presence of genetic diversity. The genotypes were grouped into tree clusters. Among the investigated characteristics, the plant height, number of bunch's, number of fruits per bunch and pseudostem exhibited high contribution towards genetic divergence. The average number of alleles per primer was 7.51, with a total of 120 alleles identified. The average similarity among the all diploid was 0.44, range from 0.29 up to 0.60. New parental combinations can be identified with base of the divergence between these diploids, contributing for development of new improved diploids preventing the narrow genetic base and creating new genetic variability for selection.

The salinity is a common factor of abiotic stress that seriously affects the agricultural production where it is found. One of the strategies to promote reincorporation of salinity areas and the productivity increasing consists in development and selection of tolerant genotypes, which allows parental identification for crossings. This research aimed to identify the salinity tolerance among banana diploid genotypes to be used in future works of genetic improvement to saline soils of Brazilian northeast region. Nine banana diploid genotypes (AA) were evaluated for growth variables as leaf area, height, diameter of pseudostem, leaves number, weight of fresh and dry matter. During 21 days, the plants were treated with 0 and 100 mM of NaCl, in an entirely randomized experimental delineation with three repetitions. After 21 days, the determination of fresh matter weight was released using analytic balance. The attainment of the each plant dry matter weight from foliar limbo, pseudostem and root+rizome was carried out through drying in greenhouse at 65°C until constant weight. The Tjau Lagada genotype, which suffered minor reduction of leaf area, can possibly show a higher production despite other genotypes analyzed in this study. The genotype 0116-01, presenting a greater salinity tolerance, could be used in future crossings providing genes to be incorporated in productive cultivars by improvement programs which aims the adaptive cultivars to Brazilian northeast saline soils.

Under some cultivation conditions, excessive growth of the pseudostem of banana plants can be considered a limiting factor, and thus, the use of growth regulators can constitute a valid alternative. This work aimed to evaluate the action of paclobutrazol on the growth of the pseudostem of banana plants and other characteristics of their development. An experiment was installed with five paclobutrazol doses (0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5; and 2.0 g of a.i. plant-1) combined with two banana plant cultivars ('Prata Anã' and 'FHIA-01'). Paclobutrazol did not affect the number of days from planting to flowering, total leaf area and leaf emission rate. However, it increased leaf permanence on the plants and sucker number, reduced the foliar area of the leaves emitted after its application and provided an average reduction in pseudostem height of 26%.

To estimate the demand of micronutrients for the banana plants (Musa spp.), it is essential to know the amounts of dry matter and micronutrients accumulated in the plant and exported by the bunch. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of dry matter and micronutrients by six banana varieties under irrigation. Plants of Grande Naine, Pacovan, Pacovan- Apodi, Prata-Anã, Terrinha and Gross Michel varieties grown in double rows, with a density equivalent to 1,666 plants per hectare were sampled. At harvest four plants of each variety were selected for sampling of mother-plant, which was divided into rhizome, pseudostem, petiole, leaf blade, stalk and fruits. The plant parts were weighed to determine the fresh weight of each part and a sample of about 700 g of each part was collected to determine dry weight and contents of micronutrients. The samples were washed quickly with tap water and later with distilled water and placed in a greenhouse for pre-drying and afterwards conditioned in paper bags were put in an oven of forced circulation of air for obtaining the dry matter and subsequent determination of the contents of B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. The varieties Pacovan, Prata Anã e Pacovan Apodi accumulated greater amounts of dry matter and micronutrients, when compared to the varieties Grande Naine, Gross Michel e Terrinha, observing the following decreasing order of accumulation and export of micronutrients: Mn > Fe > B > Zn > Cu.

Brazil is the second world producer of banana, however, the expansion of the banana crop has many difficulties, as the lack of suckers in amount and quality, necessary for implantation of new banana plantations. The objective of this research work was to evaluate the influence of the pseudostem pruning with elimination of the apical meristem of the rhizome and of doses of nitrogen and boron on the production and growth of banana suckers. The experiment was carried out at Centro de Formação de Tecnólogos-UFPB, state of Paraíba. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with four blocks and nine mother plants by experimental unit, being two useful plants. The evaluated factors were doses of N (0 to 240 g plant-1) and of B (0 to 2, 2 g plant-1) combined by the use of the experimental matrix 'Central Composite', originating nine treatments, applied with pruning and without pruning of the mother plant pseudostem. The data were submitted to the analysis of variance and regression. In the plants with pruning, it was reduced the sucker number, which presented smaller growth, on the other hand, it increased the concentration of total chlorophyll. For the production of 'Pacovan' banana suckers, it is recommended the pruning of the mother plant pseudostem with elimination of the rhizome apical meristem and the application of N.

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of organic manure for five crops, on growth and yield characteristics of banana 'Prata-anã'. The experiment was installed in Botucatu, SP, Brazil, in November 2002 with conventional plants spaced 2.5 x 2.5 m. Plants were fertilized with organic compost produced with sawdust and manure, properly composted, which provided the following treatments: 0, 43, 86, 129 and 172 kg of compost per plant. The compost rates were calculated according to the potassium content in the compost. In 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, at blooming, the pseudostem circumference and the plants height were evaluated, as well as the number of living leaves per plant. At harvest, the bunch weight, the number of fruits per bunch, the number of hands per bunch, the bunch weight of the 2nd, the number of fruits in the 2nd bunch, the fruit length and diameter were evaluated. The organic compost rates did not influence the plant growth. However, concerning the crop cycles it was observed a decrease in the leaves number from the second cycle on, and also changes in plants height and pseudostem circumference. In this study, where the K2O rates ranged from zero to 394 g per plant, the bunches of higher weight were obtained with the two higher amounts of compost, which indicates that economically, the dose of 129 kg compost per plant, which corresponds to 290.5 g of K2O per plant, is the best to be recommended.

The fertilization with micronutrients is poorly studied for banana production, especially boron (B) application, which affects the development of apical meristems. This experiment aimed to study responses of B fertilization with different rates and application methods in banana plant 'Grande Naine'. The experimental design was in randomized block and factorial scheme with three rates (0.85, 1.70 and 3.40 g plant-1) and three fertilizer application methods (soil, leaves and tiller hole chopped) and a control, without B application, using boric acid as the source of B. Treatments effects were evaluated by B availability on soil, plant grown, plant nutritional status and by the yield. Treatments effects were submitted to variance analysis and when significant it was adjusted by regression equations. The B application on soil and in the leaves increased this micronutrient content in topsoil (between 1.0-1.5 mg kg-1, with the highest rate of the nutrient) and a corresponding increase up the soil layer to 20-40 cm, as a result of leaching. The contribution of foliar fertilization increasing the content in the soil was due to the washing and by draining the fertilizer solution from the leaves to the soil surface. Moreover, there was no effect of B availability in the soil when the fertilizer was applied in the tiller hole chopped (~0.3 mg kg-1 of B). It was also verified that there were no effects of B application on banana plant growth (height and pseudostem diameter) at the blooming stage. In leaf samples, collected each 15 days, it was observed that when the micronutrient was applied in the tiller hole chopped, leaf B concentration was higher and lasted up for one month. However, in the last foliar sampling (at blooming) it was observed that there was no effect of application methods on leaf B concentration (~20 mg kg-1). There were no effects of fertilization in yield according to rates and application methods of B, but the application on the tiller hole chopped promoted an increased accumulation of this micronutrient in the bunch due to the applied rates. Under the conditions of this experiment, it can be concluded that B application did not influenced the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' according to the rates and application methods of this micronutrient.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Anã' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Anã' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Anã' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Anã' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Anã' cultivar.

Ten diploid banana genotypes (Musa spp.) were evaluated with regard to salt tolerance, abiotic stress which limits the productivity of the crop. The plants were grown during 21 days, in a nutrient solution with and without the addition of NaCl (0 and 100 mol m-3). Growth variables including leaf area, fresh and dry biomass, biomass allocation and growth rate were analysed. The experiment was implemented in a completely randomized design in factorial (10 × 2) arrangement and three replicates per treatment. Salinity caused in most genotypes reductions in almost all variables. Genotype Lidi stood out by having better adaptation to saline stress in all measured biometric variables with the ability to maintain, under stress, the fresh and dry biomass (leaf blade, stem, pseudostem + root), leaf area, and absolute growth rate among others. The relative production of dry biomass of shoots was more than 70%, characterizing this as a tolerant genotype and promising to be integrated into breeding programs. Genotypes Ouro and Tungia, in turn, showed reduction of absolute growth rate and relative dry biomass production (less than 50%) were characterized as sensitive to salinity.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield and the cycle of banana trees treated with paclobutrazol (PBZ). We tested five doses of PBZ (0.0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5 and 2.0 g plant-1), applied on the soil around 'Prata Anã' and 'FHIA-01' banana trees four months after planting. Data were obtained during the first cicle and the bunchs were harvested when yellow color was observed on the peel of the first fruits. The cicle time was of 507 days, not differing in terms of doses and cultivars. The use of PBZ reduced pseudostem length. Increasing of PBZ doses increased the number of active leaves at inflorescence emission period of 'Prata Anã', but the effects on bunch were harmful, with reduction of the number of fruits per bunch, of commercial length and diameter of the fruits, which caused reduction of bunch weight and of productivity. In FHIA-01 cultivar, PBZ applied via soil reduced pseudostem length and improved bunch sustentation, not influencing crop productivity. The optimal dose of PBZ on 'FHIA-01' banana tree is around 1,0 g plant-1. For the 'Prata Anã' is not recommended the use of PBZ.

The productivity in banana is a complex character that results from the combination of different factors, influenced by environment. This work aimed to study the direct and indirect effects of vegetative traits on production in three cycles in banana. The work was conducted in the Experimental Field of Embrapa Acre in Rio Branco, Acre, among years 2003 and 2006. Thirteen genotypes of banana (Preciosa, Japira, Pacovan Ken, Pacovan, BRS Platina, Prata Anã, ST12-31, Nanicão, Grande Naine, Calypso, Ambrosia, Bucaneiro and FHIA 02) were evaluated, spaced 3 m × 2 m, in the randomized blocks with five replicates. The evaluated traits were: plant height, diameter of pseudostem, number of leaves at flowering and harvest, weight of bunch and number of hands in the bunch. Analysis of variance and path analysis were carried out for each cycle and phenotypic correlation coefficients were estimated. The trait weight of the bunch was adopted as the basic variable and the others were considered the explanatory variables. The study of direct and indirect effects showed that the character output is much influenced by the environment in the first cycle, and the following production cycle is much influenced by vegetative traits, especially number of leaves at harvest.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

Phytotechnical characters observed in field experimental are of phenotypic nature and most of the time its assessment is based only on the experience of the observer. The assessment of the correlations between variables allows the estimation of the changes in a character based on the changes in other characters. This present study estimated the impact of agronomic characters related to the weight of the bunch measured in banana plants. The experiment was a test for uniformity, conducted in Guanambi, Bahia, by using the cultivar Tropical (YB42-21), an AAAB tetraploid hybrid. The vegetative characters evaluated during flowering included plant height, perimeter of the pseudostem, number of offshoots, and number of living leaves. The yield related characters were evaluated during the harvest and included, bunch's weight, number of hands and fruits, weight of the second hand, and length and diameter of the fruit in two production cycles. In the evaluations, each plant was considered as a basic unit (bu). This work described a protocol for prediction of banana yield by using the artificial neural networks (ANNs) method as modeling tool. The computational model ANN was used and the prediction of the weight of the bunch in banana plants cv. Tropical was estimated with precision and efficiency (R2=91%, MPE=1.40 and MSD=2.29). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluated the influence of different irrigation levels on the growth of the banana crop cv. Grande Naine. The experiment was conducted in the experimental field of the Centro Nacional de Pesquisa Mandioca e Fruticultura. A randomized block design was used with six levels of irrigation and eight replications. The irrigation L1 corresponded to rain. The irrigation L6 was determined using the Kc and ETo. The other irrigation levels were determined by the formula NH = K × AF × ETo, where NH is the water requirement of the crop (L plant-1), K (empirical coefficient of plant transpiration), AF - leaf area (m2 plant-1) and ETo - reference evapotranspiration (mm). The parameters evaluated were: plant height, pseudostem circumference, leaf area, alive leaf number and duration of the crop cycle. The growth of cv. Grande Naine was influenced by irrigation, it is possible to estimate the water requirement of the banana crop, based on knowledge of leaf area and ETo. The best crop growth was obtained with a transpiration coefficient of 0.57 and irrigation depth estimated in 1247 mm.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the growth, nutrition and production of Prata Anã banana (Musa spp), intercropped with legumes and subjected to different irrigation depths. The experimental design was a randomized block split plot with five replications. The plots were formed by four irrigation depths: 50, 75, 100 and 125% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and the control subplots (conventional management without cover crops) and three types of cover crops intercropped with banana: spontaneous vegetation (VE), tropical cudzu in succession to crotalaria (CK) and calopogônio in succession to jack beans (FC). In banana crop, the height, pseudostem circumference, foliar concentrations of macro and micronutrients, production and crop cycle duration were evaluated. The use of legumes in the pre-planting and as a cover crop exerted positive influences on growth, nitrogen nutrition and yield of banana, partially replacing the N applied as mineral fertilizer. The use of legumes intercropped with banana represents an adequate alternative to provide N for banana.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of castor bean pie on the infestation by Cosmopolites sordidus and on the development of banana plants cv. Terra. To observe the dose-response relationship, each treatment focused on a different dosage of castor bean pie (0 g, 12 g, 15 g, 18 g, 24 g) applied every two months to the banana plants, starting from the planting date. The experimental design was completely randomized with ten replicates. Plant vegetative growth was evaluated by measuring plant height, pseudostem diameter, and counting alive (or green) leaves. The infestation of plants was undertaken by using 25 adults of C. sordidus per plant. Six months after planting, the percentage of damage caused was scored on rhizomes and the number of adults (alive and died), larvae, and pupae was registered. Absorbance related to the leaf chlorophyll content was also determined by a chorophyllometer. In plants treated with castor bean pie there was a low infestation of the banana weevil borer. Vegetative growth and absorbance were also positively affected by applying castor bean pie. Therefore, castor bean pie reduces C. sordidus population in rhizomes of bananas cv. Terra, improving vegetative growth and chlorophyll content in leaves.

The high density planting of some banana cultivars is an usable practical to increase productivity, especially in regions affected by Sigatoka. This study aimed to evaluate the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' grown in different planting densities with black leaf streak presence at Vale do Ribeira, SP. It was installed a banana orchard with seedlings produced in vitro of the Grande Naine cultivar. The experimental design was a completely randomized, in factorial scheme 5 x 2, with five densities (2,500; 2,222; 2,000; 1,667 and 1,111 plants.ha-1) and two production cycles. The black leaf streak severity was weekly monitored using the state evolution method (SE) and its control were set when occurred the second consecutive progression of the severity and/or increases of 200 points from a week to the next. For each plot it was evaluated eight plants measuring plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of active leaves at blooming and at harvest, bunch fresh weight, productivity, number of hands, bunch fruits number, total fresh weight and individual fresh weight of the 2nd hand, length and diameter of 2nd hand fruits. Data were submitted to variance analysis by F test and the significant means were compared by Tukey test (5% probability). Under the experimental conditions, it can be concluded that the density did not influence the plant development (plant height and pseudostem diameter). The biggest plants density gave higher banana plant 'Grande Naine' yields.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3×2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0×2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

The experimental design was in randomized blocks with 11 genotypes and three replicates with four plants per plot in 3 m x 2 m spacing. The following agronomic characteristics were evaluated: plant height (m); pseudostem diameter (cm); number of live leaves at flowering; number of live leaves at harvest; stem length (cm); stem diameter (cm); bunch weight (kg); hand weight (kg); single hand weight (g); number of hands; number of fruits per bunch; pedicel length (cm); pedicel diameter (mm); finger drop susceptibility (Lb); firmness of pulp with peel; fruit weight (g); fruit length(cm); fruit diameter (mm); elongation index; pulp weight (g); pulp/peel ratio; pulp yield (%); pulp diameter (mm), peel thickness (mm); pulp thickness (Lb), tritable acidity-TA (%), soluble solids-SS (°Brix), SS/TA ratio and pH. Of the thirty variables evaluated, 12 were significant for the source of variation ‘cycles´. As to the ‘genotype x cycles’ interaction it is possible to assert that there was no differentiated behavior in the genotypes from the first to the second production cycle, except for ‘plant height’, ‘number of live leaves at flowering’, ‘fruit diameter’ and ‘peel thickness´. Results for the effect of ‘genotypes’ were significant for all characteristics, except for fruit ‘finger drop susceptibility’. Considering the agronomic data, genotypes from the YB series and the cultivars BRS Princesa and BRS Garantida showed to be promising for cultivation in the Reconcavo region of Bahia for presenting good agronomic performance. © 2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Fruticultura.

The objective of this study was to agronomically characterize plants from induced chromosome doubling experiments in the Pisang Lilin parthenocarpic banana accession to select genotypes that will be used as 2n gamete donors in crosses with improved diploids to generate secondary triploids. Twenty-two plants were evaluated, of which 17 were autotetraploids. Compared with the original diploids, the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids showed significant increases in the plant height, number of living leaves at flowering and harvest, pseudostem diameter, and length and diameter of fruits; the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids also exhibited greater fruit and bunch weights compared with the original diploids. In addition, all autotetraploid plants did not exhibit any symptoms of yellow Sigatoka. Female fertility was also detected, as some plants produced seeds, indicating that they can be used as female parents. Therefore, the autotetraploids characterized in this study exhibited useful agronomical traits to be used as 2n gamete donors for generating secondary triploids. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The favourable climatic conditions make Brazil one of the most important producers of tropical flowers, among them some Heliconia native species are remarkable. In the present study 19 acceßions of H. chartacea were characterized using morphological descriptors related to pseudostem, leaf and inflorescences. The purpose was to select acceßions with desirable aspects for cut flower production. The experiment was carried out during August 2014 and January 2015. Differences were observed in morphological descriptors related to the inflorescences. In 54% of the inflorescences that were harvested, the length was between 30 and 60 cm and varied according to the number of open bracts. The width was larger than 40 cm in 75% of the inflorescences. About 70% of the harvested stems had weight above 200 g and the average stem diameter was between 20-30 mm. The latter feature was directly related to the stiffneß of the flower stem. The length of the peduncle varied between 10 and 20 cm for 60% of the stems. The vase life of the flower stems ranged between 5 and 11 days. In general, most of the studied acceßions were suitable for use as cut flower, nevertheleß more detailed evaluation is neceßary.

Brazil is the sixth largest producer of banana; however, traditional practices of banana propagation fall short when the intention is to introduce a uniform, pathogen-free banana plantation, with high yield potential . This research aimed to evaluate the vegetative growth and production of 'Prata Anã' banana derived from conventional seedlings (whole rhizome) of different sizes (up to 1000g, 1001 to 2000g, 2001 to 3000g, 3001 to 4000g, 4001 to 5000g, and more than 5000g) and in vitro micropropagation, during the first and second production cycles. The experimental design was completely randomized, with a variable number of repetitions. Analysis of variance was performed using regression equations for the vegetative data and Tukey test at 5% of probability for production data. Micropropagated plants originating from rhizomes with weight of less than 1000g, between 1001g and 2000g resulted in plants with more vegetative vigor, in the first cycle. In the second cycle, the number of leaves, height and diameter of the pseudostem tended to equalize for tratadifferent classes of plants assessed. In the first production cycle, periods between planting and floral anthesis and between planting and harvesting were inversely proportional to the size of conventional seedlings; the periods for micropropagated plants were similar to the conventional seedlings of greater weight. There was no difference in the number of hands, fingers and bunch weight between the different classes of seedlings. The differences between the amount of time from planting to flowering and until harvest among the different classes of seedlings tend to disappear from the first to the second cycle. Thus, the propagation of the banana with seedlings weighing less than 2000g or micropropagated is preferable; however, it is possible to use any kind of seedlings, planted in various plots according to the size.

Being one of the important tropical and subtropical fruit trees, banana (Musa.spp.) belongs to the family Musaceae and the order Scitaminae with two genera, Musa and Ensete. In a field survey, research team has discovered a potential banana mutant strain ‘HD-1’ with a sound economic value. The results of the finding are as follows: based on Simmonds’ classification, the pseudostem of banana strain ‘HD-1’ is relatively short and purplish red; its upright outward petiole groove has red edges and wraps its pseudostem loosely. Its ploidy is 3×, AAA type. Karyotype analysis shows that the number of chromosomes is 33, the karyotype formula is 2n=3x=33=2L + 3 M2 + 4 M1 + 2 S, ‘HD-1’ is classified as ‘1B’ type. With the help of ISSR molecular markers, we find thatbanana 'HD-1' has the closest relationship with Pubei and Tianbao dwarf banana; the similarity coefficient is 0.81. In an artificial simulation tests of cold, drought and salt resistance environment changes of physiological and biochemical indexes indicate that ‘HD-1’ exhibits stronger defense capability than Brazil banana. By way of inoculation with injury of root dipping method, we respectively treat two kinds of banana seedlings inoculated Banana Fusarium wilt race 4 small species. The results show that their resistance evaluation scores are 3 and 4, disease levels are ‘susceptible’ and ‘high sensitivity’ respectively. We conclude that ‘HD-1’ has stronger resistance ability toFusarium wilt than Brazil banana. © 2016, Pakistan Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

The present study evaluated plant morphological traits and fruit quality parameters of banana 'Dwarf Cavendish' cultivar and local type 'Azman' grown in subtropical conditions, under unheated plastic greenhouse. The study was conducted between 2014 and 2015 in Alanya, the province of Antalya. The planting density was 1850 ha-1 and drip irrigation system was used. Plant morphological features (plant height, stem circumference and height, leaves retention at flowering and bunch stalk circumference), yield components (number of hands, number of fingers, finger circumference and length, and bunch weight) and fruit quality attributes (peel thickness, the peel and pulp ratio, soluble solid content) after ripening were determined. The plant height, stem height, number of hand, bunch weight and finger features were the most variable traits. 'Dwarf Cavendish' produced shorter plants and pseudostem height. Bunch weight and finger features in 'Azman' were found to be superior to 'Dwarf Cavendish'. As 'Azman' type produced higher yield (69.3 t ha-1 year-1) than 'Dwarf Cavendish' cultivar (52 t ha-1 year-1), this local type is recommended for cultivation under unheated greenhouse.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. © 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Banana growth and hence production is affected largely due to many biotic factors that include bacteria, fungi, viruses, aphids etc. Common bacterial wilt disease that affect banana is caused by Xanthomonas vasicola pv. musacearum (Xvm), Ralstonia solanacearum. Symptoms include progressive yellowing, wilting and blackening of leaves; yellow or brown vascular streaks throughout the plant; pockets of pale yellow bacterial ooze in airspaces within leaf bases; premature ripening and internal discoloration of fruits. Erwinia-associated diseases such as bacterial head rot or tip-over caused by Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi, bacterial rhizome and pseudostem wet rot caused by Dickeya paradisiaca formerly E. chrysanthemi pv. Paradisiacal are also reported in banana. Other bacterial diseases of less widespread importance include: bacterial wilt of abaca, Javanese vascular wilt and bacterial fingertip rot (probably caused by Ralstonia spp.) R. solanacearum is soil borne pathogen, very diverse in its species, and belongs to group of Ralstonia-species complex. The Biolog GEN III identification is used as the first step in identifying the isolates from infected plants. This technology classifies bacteria by ability of their cell to metabolise all major classes of biochemicals, in addition to determining other important physiological properties such as pH, salt, and lactic acid tolerance, reducing power, and chemical sensitivity. Due to their diversity in species and strains, suitable diagnostic procedure should be done to identify the pathogens accurately. Pathogen identification based on colony morphology or disease symptoms is difficult, time consuming and unreliable. Molecular diagnostic such as polymerase chain reaction using specific primer and the other diagnosis of pathogen is also possible by using bacteriophage due to its specificity to infective. Rapid detection and accurate identification of pathogens in plant are critical steps to prevent pathogens dissemination. Innovative agronomic practices could be employed to control/manage the diseases. Integration of cultural practices with sensitive and specific diagnostic tools, transgenic approaches and conventional breeding techniques may offer a more sustainable and environmental friendly approach to control and manage the bacterial diseases in banana. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The absorption of the micronutrients B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn by banana (Musa sp.) cultivar "Prata Ana" explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog supplemented with BAP (3.5 mg/L) and sucrose (30 g/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after the inoculation. The experiment was arranged on a completely randomized design with three replications. Concentration of the micronutrients in the medium and in dry matter of the whole propagule and in the rhizome, pseudostem and leaves was also evaluated. Absorption of Mn was approximately constant during all the period of the experiment, while the other micronutrients had their higher absorption observed on the first 20 days. At the end of the experiment concentrations of B, Zn, Mn and Cu in the medium were 52, 61, 77 and 78%, respectively. These results point out that it is possible to reduce the concentration of these micronutrients on the basic medium MS for banana explants culture.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between vegetative and productive characteristics of banana tree (Musa spp) cv Prata-Ana (genomic group AAB) differently managed from the conventional system. The experiment was carried out in an orchard with five years old banana plants spaced by 3,5 x 2,0 m, in the Fazendas Reunidas FFL Ltda., at Cristais Paulista, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The experiment was a split plot under a completely randomized design with three replicates, being the main treatments constituted by: M1 - daughter-plant without the mother-plant whose stem was cut after flowering; M2 - daughter-plant and mother- plant conventionally managed until harvest. The sub plots were constituted by twelve periods of selection of the daughter-plants (February 2002 to January 2003). The pseudostem diameter and the bunch weight of all plants and the vegetative period of the daughter-plants were evaluated. The statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the stem diameter of the daughter-plants and mother-plants. The stem diameter of the mother-plant was positive correlated with its bunch weight. However the stem diameter of the daughter-plant not was correlated with its bunch weight. The vegetative cycle and the pseudostem diameter of the daughter-plants were negatively correlated. The Plant management (M1 and M2) and the selection of periods daughter-plant did not affected the correlations evaluated in this study.

An investigation about the genetical diversity among eleven banana diploid genotypes using nine agronomical characteristics and sixteen microsatellite markers was implanted at Embrapa Cassava and Tropical Fruits, Cruz das Almas (BA), Brazil. The generalized distance of Mahalanobis indicated the presence of genetic diversity. The genotypes were grouped into tree clusters. Among the investigated characteristics, the plant height, number of bunch's, number of fruits per bunch and pseudostem exhibited high contribution towards genetic divergence. The average number of alleles per primer was 7.51, with a total of 120 alleles identified. The average similarity among the all diploid was 0.44, range from 0.29 up to 0.60. New parental combinations can be identified with base of the divergence between these diploids, contributing for development of new improved diploids preventing the narrow genetic base and creating new genetic variability for selection.

The salinity is a common factor of abiotic stress that seriously affects the agricultural production where it is found. One of the strategies to promote reincorporation of salinity areas and the productivity increasing consists in development and selection of tolerant genotypes, which allows parental identification for crossings. This research aimed to identify the salinity tolerance among banana diploid genotypes to be used in future works of genetic improvement to saline soils of Brazilian northeast region. Nine banana diploid genotypes (AA) were evaluated for growth variables as leaf area, height, diameter of pseudostem, leaves number, weight of fresh and dry matter. During 21 days, the plants were treated with 0 and 100 mM of NaCl, in an entirely randomized experimental delineation with three repetitions. After 21 days, the determination of fresh matter weight was released using analytic balance. The attainment of the each plant dry matter weight from foliar limbo, pseudostem and root+rizome was carried out through drying in greenhouse at 65degC until constant weight. The Tjau Lagada genotype, which suffered minor reduction of leaf area, can possibly show a higher production despite other genotypes analyzed in this study. The genotype 0116-01, presenting a greater salinity tolerance, could be used in future crossings providing genes to be incorporated in productive cultivars by improvement programs which aims the adaptive cultivars to Brazilian northeast saline soils.

Under some cultivation conditions, excessive growth of the pseudostem of banana plants can be considered a limiting factor, and thus, the use of growth regulators can constitute a valid alternative. This work aimed to evaluate the action of paclobutrazol on the growth of the pseudostem of banana plants and other characteristics of their development. An experiment was installed with five paclobutrazol doses (0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5; and 2.0 g of a.i. plant-1) combined with two banana plant cultivars ('Prata Ana' and 'FHIA-01'). Paclobutrazol did not affect the number of days from planting to flowering, total leaf area and leaf emission rate. However, it increased leaf permanence on the plants and sucker number, reduced the foliar area of the leaves emitted after its application and provided an average reduction in pseudostem height of 26%.

To estimate the demand of micronutrients for the banana plants (Musa spp.), it is essential to know the amounts of dry matter and micronutrients accumulated in the plant and exported by the bunch. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of dry matter and micronutrients by six banana varieties under irrigation. Plants of Grande Naine, Pacovan, Pacovan- Apodi, Prata-Ana, Terrinha and Gross Michel varieties grown in double rows, with a density equivalent to 1,666 plants per hectare were sampled. At harvest four plants of each variety were selected for sampling of mother-plant, which was divided into rhizome, pseudostem, petiole, leaf blade, stalk and fruits. The plant parts were weighed to determine the fresh weight of each part and a sample of about 700 g of each part was collected to determine dry weight and contents of micronutrients. The samples were washed quickly with tap water and later with distilled water and placed in a greenhouse for pre-drying and afterwards conditioned in paper bags were put in an oven of forced circulation of air for obtaining the dry matter and subsequent determination of the contents of B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. The varieties Pacovan, Prata Ana e Pacovan Apodi accumulated greater amounts of dry matter and micronutrients, when compared to the varieties Grande Naine, Gross Michel e Terrinha, observing the following decreasing order of accumulation and export of micronutrients: Mn > Fe > B > Zn > Cu.

Brazil is the second world producer of banana, however, the expansion of the banana crop has many difficulties, as the lack of suckers in amount and quality, necessary for implantation of new banana plantations. The objective of this research work was to evaluate the influence of the pseudostem pruning with elimination of the apical meristem of the rhizome and of doses of nitrogen and boron on the production and growth of banana suckers. The experiment was carried out at Centro de Formacao de Tecnologos-UFPB, state of Paraiba. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with four blocks and nine mother plants by experimental unit, being two useful plants. The evaluated factors were doses of N (0 to 240 g plant-1) and of B (0 to 2, 2 g plant-1) combined by the use of the experimental matrix 'Central Composite', originating nine treatments, applied with pruning and without pruning of the mother plant pseudostem. The data were submitted to the analysis of variance and regression. In the plants with pruning, it was reduced the sucker number, which presented smaller growth, on the other hand, it increased the concentration of total chlorophyll. For the production of 'Pacovan' banana suckers, it is recommended the pruning of the mother plant pseudostem with elimination of the rhizome apical meristem and the application of N.

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of organic manure for five crops, on growth and yield characteristics of banana 'Prata-ana'. The experiment was installed in Botucatu, SP, Brazil, in November 2002 with conventional plants spaced 2.5 x 2.5 m. Plants were fertilized with organic compost produced with sawdust and manure, properly composted, which provided the following treatments: 0, 43, 86, 129 and 172 kg of compost per plant. The compost rates were calculated according to the potassium content in the compost. In 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, at blooming, the pseudostem circumference and the plants height were evaluated, as well as the number of living leaves per plant. At harvest, the bunch weight, the number of fruits per bunch, the number of hands per bunch, the bunch weight of the 2nd, the number of fruits in the 2nd bunch, the fruit length and diameter were evaluated. The organic compost rates did not influence the plant growth. However, concerning the crop cycles it was observed a decrease in the leaves number from the second cycle on, and also changes in plants height and pseudostem circumference. In this study, where the K2O rates ranged from zero to 394 g per plant, the bunches of higher weight were obtained with the two higher amounts of compost, which indicates that economically, the dose of 129 kg compost per plant, which corresponds to 290.5 g of K2O per plant, is the best to be recommended.

The fertilization with micronutrients is poorly studied for banana production, especially boron (B) application, which affects the development of apical meristems. This experiment aimed to study responses of B fertilization with different rates and application methods in banana plant 'Grande Naine'. The experimental design was in randomized block and factorial scheme with three rates (0.85, 1.70 and 3.40 g plant-1) and three fertilizer application methods (soil, leaves and tiller hole chopped) and a control, without B application, using boric acid as the source of B. Treatments effects were evaluated by B availability on soil, plant grown, plant nutritional status and by the yield. Treatments effects were submitted to variance analysis and when significant it was adjusted by regression equations. The B application on soil and in the leaves increased this micronutrient content in topsoil (between 1.0-1.5 mg kg-1, with the highest rate of the nutrient) and a corresponding increase up the soil layer to 20-40 cm, as a result of leaching. The contribution of foliar fertilization increasing the content in the soil was due to the washing and by draining the fertilizer solution from the leaves to the soil surface. Moreover, there was no effect of B availability in the soil when the fertilizer was applied in the tiller hole chopped (~0.3 mg kg-1 of B). It was also verified that there were no effects of B application on banana plant growth (height and pseudostem diameter) at the blooming stage. In leaf samples, collected each 15 days, it was observed that when the micronutrient was applied in the tiller hole chopped, leaf B concentration was higher and lasted up for one month. However, in the last foliar sampling (at blooming) it was observed that there was no effect of application methods on leaf B concentration (~20 mg kg-1). There were no effects of fertilization in yield according to rates and application methods of B, but the application on the tiller hole chopped promoted an increased accumulation of this micronutrient in the bunch due to the applied rates. Under the conditions of this experiment, it can be concluded that B application did not influenced the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' according to the rates and application methods of this micronutrient.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Ana' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Ana' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Ana' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Ana' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Ana' cultivar.

Ten diploid banana genotypes (Musa spp.) were evaluated with regard to salt tolerance, abiotic stress which limits the productivity of the crop. The plants were grown during 21 days, in a nutrient solution with and without the addition of NaCl (0 and 100 mol m-3). Growth variables including leaf area, fresh and dry biomass, biomass allocation and growth rate were analysed. The experiment was implemented in a completely randomized design in factorial (10 x 2) arrangement and three replicates per treatment. Salinity caused in most genotypes reductions in almost all variables. Genotype Lidi stood out by having better adaptation to saline stress in all measured biometric variables with the ability to maintain, under stress, the fresh and dry biomass (leaf blade, stem, pseudostem + root), leaf area, and absolute growth rate among others. The relative production of dry biomass of shoots was more than 70%, characterizing this as a tolerant genotype and promising to be integrated into breeding programs. Genotypes Ouro and Tungia, in turn, showed reduction of absolute growth rate and relative dry biomass production (less than 50%) were characterized as sensitive to salinity.

Data were obtained during the first cicle and the bunchs were harvested when yellow color was observed on the peel of the first fruits. The cicle time was of 507 days, not differing in terms of doses and cultivars. The use of PBZ reduced pseudostem length. Increasing of PBZ doses increased the number of active leaves at inflorescence emission period of 'Prata Ana', but the effects on bunch were harmful, with reduction of the number of fruits per bunch, of commercial length and diameter of the fruits, which caused reduction of bunch weight and of productivity. In FHIA-01 cultivar, PBZ applied via soil reduced pseudostem length and improved bunch sustentation, not influencing crop productivity. The optimal dose of PBZ on 'FHIA-01' banana tree is around 1,0 g plant-1. For the 'Prata Ana' is not recommended the use of PBZ.

The productivity in banana is a complex character that results from the combination of different factors, influenced by environment. This work aimed to study the direct and indirect effects of vegetative traits on production in three cycles in banana. The work was conducted in the Experimental Field of Embrapa Acre in Rio Branco, Acre, among years 2003 and 2006. Thirteen genotypes of banana (Preciosa, Japira, Pacovan Ken, Pacovan, BRS Platina, Prata Ana, ST12-31, Nanicao, Grande Naine, Calypso, Ambrosia, Bucaneiro and FHIA 02) were evaluated, spaced 3 m x 2 m, in the randomized blocks with five replicates. The evaluated traits were: plant height, diameter of pseudostem, number of leaves at flowering and harvest, weight of bunch and number of hands in the bunch. Analysis of variance and path analysis were carried out for each cycle and phenotypic correlation coefficients were estimated. The trait weight of the bunch was adopted as the basic variable and the others were considered the explanatory variables. The study of direct and indirect effects showed that the character output is much influenced by the environment in the first cycle, and the following production cycle is much influenced by vegetative traits, especially number of leaves at harvest.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

Phytotechnical characters observed in field experimental are of phenotypic nature and most of the time its assessment is based only on the experience of the observer. The assessment of the correlations between variables allows the estimation of the changes in a character based on the changes in other characters. This present study estimated the impact of agronomic characters related to the weight of the bunch measured in banana plants. The experiment was a test for uniformity, conducted in Guanambi, Bahia, by using the cultivar Tropical (YB42-21), an AAAB tetraploid hybrid. The vegetative characters evaluated during flowering included plant height, perimeter of the pseudostem, number of offshoots, and number of living leaves. The yield related characters were evaluated during the harvest and included, bunch's weight, number of hands and fruits, weight of the second hand, and length and diameter of the fruit in two production cycles. In the evaluations, each plant was considered as a basic unit (bu). This work described a protocol for prediction of banana yield by using the artificial neural networks (ANNs) method as modeling tool. The computational model ANN was used and the prediction of the weight of the bunch in banana plants cv. Tropical was estimated with precision and efficiency (R2=91%, MPE=1.40 and MSD=2.29).

This study evaluated the influence of different irrigation levels on the growth of the banana crop cv. Grande Naine. The experiment was conducted in the experimental field of the Centro Nacional de Pesquisa Mandioca e Fruticultura. A randomized block design was used with six levels of irrigation and eight replications. The irrigation L1 corresponded to rain. The irrigation L6 was determined using the Kc and ETo. The other irrigation levels were determined by the formula NH = K x AF x ETo, where NH is the water requirement of the crop (L plant-1), K (empirical coefficient of plant transpiration), AF - leaf area (m2 plant-1) and ETo - reference evapotranspiration (mm). The parameters evaluated were: plant height, pseudostem circumference, leaf area, alive leaf number and duration of the crop cycle. The growth of cv. Grande Naine was influenced by irrigation, it is possible to estimate the water requirement of the banana crop, based on knowledge of leaf area and ETo. The best crop growth was obtained with a transpiration coefficient of 0.57 and irrigation depth estimated in 1247 mm.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the growth, nutrition and production of Prata Ana banana (Musa spp), intercropped with legumes and subjected to different irrigation depths. The experimental design was a randomized block split plot with five replications. The plots were formed by four irrigation depths: 50, 75, 100 and 125% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and the control subplots (conventional management without cover crops) and three types of cover crops intercropped with banana: spontaneous vegetation (VE), tropical cudzu in succession to crotalaria (CK) and calopogonio in succession to jack beans (FC). In banana crop, the height, pseudostem circumference, foliar concentrations of macro and micronutrients, production and crop cycle duration were evaluated. The use of legumes in the pre-planting and as a cover crop exerted positive influences on growth, nitrogen nutrition and yield of banana, partially replacing the N applied as mineral fertilizer. The use of legumes intercropped with banana represents an adequate alternative to provide N for banana.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of castor bean pie on the infestation by Cosmopolites sordidus and on the development of banana plants cv. Terra. To observe the dose-response relationship, each treatment focused on a different dosage of castor bean pie (0 g, 12 g, 15 g, 18 g, 24 g) applied every two months to the banana plants, starting from the planting date. The experimental design was completely randomized with ten replicates. Plant vegetative growth was evaluated by measuring plant height, pseudostem diameter, and counting alive (or green) leaves. The infestation of plants was undertaken by using 25 adults of C. sordidus per plant. Six months after planting, the percentage of damage caused was scored on rhizomes and the number of adults (alive and died), larvae, and pupae was registered. Absorbance related to the leaf chlorophyll content was also determined by a chorophyllometer. In plants treated with castor bean pie there was a low infestation of the banana weevil borer. Vegetative growth and absorbance were also positively affected by applying castor bean pie. Therefore, castor bean pie reduces C. sordidus population in rhizomes of bananas cv. Terra, improving vegetative growth and chlorophyll content in leaves.

The high density planting of some banana cultivars is an usable practical to increase productivity, especially in regions affected by Sigatoka. This study aimed to evaluate the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' grown in different planting densities with black leaf streak presence at Vale do Ribeira, SP. It was installed a banana orchard with seedlings produced in vitro of the Grande Naine cultivar. The experimental design was a completely randomized, in factorial scheme 5 x 2, with five densities (2,500; 2,222; 2,000; 1,667 and 1,111 plants.ha-1) and two production cycles. The black leaf streak severity was weekly monitored using the state evolution method (SE) and its control were set when occurred the second consecutive progression of the severity and/or increases of 200 points from a week to the next. For each plot it was evaluated eight plants measuring plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of active leaves at blooming and at harvest, bunch fresh weight, productivity, number of hands, bunch fruits number, total fresh weight and individual fresh weight of the 2nd hand, length and diameter of 2nd hand fruits. Data were submitted to variance analysis by F test and the significant means were compared by Tukey test (5% probability). Under the experimental conditions, it can be concluded that the density did not influence the plant development (plant height and pseudostem diameter). The biggest plants density gave higher banana plant 'Grande Naine' yields.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3x2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0x2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

In the irrigated area of Jaiba in Northern Minas Gerais, there are reports on the presence of some genotypes of banana cv. Prata-Ana supposedly tolerant to the Panama disease, where the disease was not established after 15 years of cultivation even in the presence of the pathogen. Therefore this study aimed to evaluate the genetic diversity, agronomic performance and behavior of genotypes of banana 'Prata-Ana' cultivated in area with a history of Panama disease. Twenty-four families were collected, 11 classified in the moment of the collection as diseased (GEN 1, GEN 2, GEN 3, GEN 4, GEN 5, GEN 6, GEN 7, GEN 8, GEN 9, GEN 10 and GEN 11), and 13 apparently healthy (GEN 12, GEN 13, GEN 14, GEN 15, GEN 16, GEN 17, GEN 18, GEN 19, GEN 20, GEN 21, GEN 22, GEN 23 and GEN 24). This material were multiplied in tissue culture laboratory and taken to planting at the experimental area. Twenty-four treatments were evaluated (clones of banana 'Prata-Ana'), in a randomized block design with three replications, 20 plants per plot and the central six in useful area. In addition to the genetic diversity, length and diameter of pseudostem, leaf number, bunch, hands and rachis weight, number of hands and fruits, length and girth of the central fruit of the second hand, the percentage of dead plants, incidence and severity of Panama disease were evaluated. The average genetic distance between clones was 43.5%, ranging from 11.8% to 85%. Individuals GEN 12, GEN 13, GEN 19 and GEN 22 showed larger pseudostem at ground level and at 30 cm above the ground, and were higher. Individuals GEN 13, GEN 17 and GEN 19 stood out in both production cycles as Panama disease tolerant. (c) 2014, Sociedade Brasileira de Fruticultura. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to agronomically characterize plants from induced chromosome doubling experiments in the Pisang Lilin parthenocarpic banana accession to select genotypes that will be used as 2n gamete donors in crosses with improved diploids to generate secondary triploids. Twenty-two plants were evaluated, of which 17 were autotetraploids. Compared with the original diploids, the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids showed significant increases in the plant height, number of living leaves at flowering and harvest, pseudostem diameter, and length and diameter of fruits; the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids also exhibited greater fruit and bunch weights compared with the original diploids. In addition, all autotetraploid plants did not exhibit any symptoms of yellow Sigatoka. Female fertility was also detected, as some plants produced seeds, indicating that they can be used as female parents. Therefore, the autotetraploids characterized in this study exhibited useful agronomical traits to be used as 2n gamete donors for generating secondary triploids.

The favourable climatic conditions make Brazil one of the most important producers of tropical flowers, among them some Heliconia native species are remarkable. In the present study 19 accessions of H. chartacea were characterized using morphological descriptors related to pseudostem, leaf and inflorescences. The purpose was to select accessions with desirable aspects for cut flower production. The experiment was carried out during August 2014 and January 2015. Differences were observed in morphological descriptors related to the inflorescences. In 54% of the inflorescences that were harvested, the length was between 30 and 60 cm and varied according to the number of open bracts. The width was larger than 40 cm in 75% of the inflorescences. About 70% of the harvested stems had weight above 200 g and the average stem diameter was between 20-30 mm. The latter feature was directly related to the stiffness of the flower stem. The length of the peduncle varied between 10 and 20 cm for 60% of the stems. The vase life of the flower stems ranged between 5 and 11 days. In general, most of the studied accessions were suitable for use as cut flower, nevertheless more detailed evaluation is necessary.

Brazil is the sixth largest producer of banana; however, traditional practices of banana propagation fall short when the intention is to introduce a uniform, pathogen-free banana plantation, with high yield potential . This research aimed to evaluate the vegetative growth and production of 'Prata Ana' banana derived from conventional seedlings (whole rhizome) of different sizes (up to 1000g, 1001 to 2000g, 2001 to 3000g, 3001 to 4000g, 4001 to 5000g, and more than 5000g) and in vitro micropropagation, during the first and second production cycles. The experimental design was completely randomized, with a variable number of repetitions. Analysis of variance was performed using regression equations for the vegetative data and Tukey test at 5% of probability for production data. Micropropagated plants originating from rhizomes with weight of less than 1000g, between 1001g and 2000g resulted in plants with more vegetative vigor, in the first cycle. In the second cycle, the number of leaves, height and diameter of the pseudostem tended to equalize for tratadifferent classes of plants assessed. In the first production cycle, periods between planting and floral anthesis and between planting and harvesting were inversely proportional to the size of conventional seedlings; the periods for micropropagated plants were similar to the conventional seedlings of greater weight. There was no difference in the number of hands, fingers and bunch weight between the different classes of seedlings. The differences between the amount of time from planting to flowering and until harvest among the different classes of seedlings tend to disappear from the first to the second cycle. Thus, the propagation of the banana with seedlings weighing less than 2000g or micropropagated is preferable; however, it is possible to use any kind of seedlings, planted in various plots according to the size.

Being one of the important tropical and subtropical fruit trees, banana (Musa.spp.) belongs to the family Musaceae and the order Scitaminae with two genera, Musa and Ensete. In a field survey, research team has discovered a potential banana mutant strain 'HD-1' with a sound economic value. The results of the finding are as follows: based on Simmonds' classification, the pseudostem of banana strain 'HD-1' is relatively short and purplish red; its upright outward petiole groove has red edges and wraps its pseudostem loosely. Its ploidy is 3x, AAA type. Karyotype analysis shows that the number of chromosomes is 33, the karyotype formula is 2n=3x=33=2L + 3 M2 + 4 M1 + 2 S, 'HD-1' is classified as '1B' type. With the help of ISSR molecular markers, we find thatbanana 'HD-1' has the closest relationship with Pubei and Tianbao dwarf banana; the similarity coefficient is 0.81. In an artificial simulation tests of cold, drought and salt resistance environment changes of physiological and biochemical indexes indicate that 'HD-1' exhibits stronger defense capability than Brazil banana. By way of inoculation with injury of root dipping method, we respectively treat two kinds of banana seedlings inoculated Banana Fusarium wilt race 4 small species. The results show that their resistance evaluation scores are 3 and 4, disease levels are 'susceptible' and 'high sensitivity' respectively. We conclude that 'HD-1' has stronger resistance ability toFusarium wilt than Brazil banana. (c) 2016, Pakistan Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

The present study evaluated plant morphological traits and fruit quality parameters of banana 'Dwarf Cavendish' cultivar and local type 'Azman' grown in subtropical conditions, under unheated plastic greenhouse. The study was conducted between 2014 and 2015 in Alanya, the province of Antalya. The planting density was 1850 ha-1 and drip irrigation system was used. Plant morphological features (plant height, stem circumference and height, leaves retention at flowering and bunch stalk circumference), yield components (number of hands, number of fingers, finger circumference and length, and bunch weight) and fruit quality attributes (peel thickness, the peel and pulp ratio, soluble solid content) after ripening were determined. The plant height, stem height, number of hand, bunch weight and finger features were the most variable traits. 'Dwarf Cavendish' produced shorter plants and pseudostem height. Bunch weight and finger features in 'Azman' were found to be superior to 'Dwarf Cavendish'. As 'Azman' type produced higher yield (69.3 t ha-1 year-1) than 'Dwarf Cavendish' cultivar (52 t ha-1 year-1), this local type is recommended for cultivation under unheated greenhouse.

Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. (c) 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Banana growth and hence production is affected largely due to many biotic factors that include bacteria, fungi, viruses, aphids etc. Common bacterial wilt disease that affect banana is caused by Xanthomonas vasicola pv. musacearum (Xvm), Ralstonia solanacearum. Symptoms include progressive yellowing, wilting and blackening of leaves; yellow or brown vascular streaks throughout the plant; pockets of pale yellow bacterial ooze in airspaces within leaf bases; premature ripening and internal discoloration of fruits. Erwinia-associated diseases such as bacterial head rot or tip-over caused by Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi, bacterial rhizome and pseudostem wet rot caused by Dickeya paradisiaca formerly E. chrysanthemi pv. Paradisiacal are also reported in banana. Other bacterial diseases of less widespread importance include: bacterial wilt of abaca, Javanese vascular wilt and bacterial fingertip rot (probably caused by Ralstonia spp.) R. solanacearum is soil borne pathogen, very diverse in its species, and belongs to group of Ralstonia-species complex. The Biolog GEN III identification is used as the first step in identifying the isolates from infected plants. This technology classifies bacteria by ability of their cell to metabolise all major classes of biochemicals, in addition to determining other important physiological properties such as pH, salt, and lactic acid tolerance, reducing power, and chemical sensitivity. Due to their diversity in species and strains, suitable diagnostic procedure should be done to identify the pathogens accurately. Pathogen identification based on colony morphology or disease symptoms is difficult, time consuming and unreliable. Molecular diagnostic such as polymerase chain reaction using specific primer and the other diagnosis of pathogen is also possible by using bacteriophage due to its specificity to infective. Rapid detection and accurate identification of pathogens in plant are critical steps to prevent pathogens dissemination. Innovative agronomic practices could be employed to control/manage the diseases. Integration of cultural practices with sensitive and specific diagnostic tools, transgenic approaches and conventional breeding techniques may offer a more sustainable and environmental friendly approach to control and manage the bacterial diseases in banana.

The absorption of the micronutrients B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn by banana (Musa sp.) cultivar "Prata Ana" explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog supplemented with BAP (3.5 mg/L) and sucrose (30 g/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after the inoculation. The experiment was arranged on a completely randomized design with three replications. Concentration of the micronutrients in the medium and in dry matter of the whole propagule and in the rhizome, pseudostem and leaves was also evaluated. Absorption of Mn was approximately constant during all the period of the experiment, while the other micronutrients had their higher absorption observed on the first 20 days. At the end of the experiment concentrations of B, Zn, Mn and Cu in the medium were 52, 61, 77 and 78%, respectively. These results point out that it is possible to reduce the concentration of these micronutrients on the basic medium MS for banana explants culture.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between vegetative and productive characteristics of banana tree (Musa spp) cv Prata-Ana (genomic group AAB) differently managed from the conventional system. The experiment was carried out in an orchard with five years old banana plants spaced by 3,5 x 2,0 m, in the Fazendas Reunidas FFL Ltda., at Cristais Paulista, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The experiment was a split plot under a completely randomized design with three replicates, being the main treatments constituted by: M1 - daughter-plant without the mother-plant whose stem was cut after flowering; M2 - daughter-plant and mother- plant conventionally managed until harvest. The sub plots were constituted by twelve periods of selection of the daughter-plants (February 2002 to January 2003). The pseudostem diameter and the bunch weight of all plants and the vegetative period of the daughter-plants were evaluated. The statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the stem diameter of the daughter-plants and mother-plants. The stem diameter of the mother-plant was positive correlated with its bunch weight. However the stem diameter of the daughter-plant not was correlated with its bunch weight. The vegetative cycle and the pseudostem diameter of the daughter-plants were negatively correlated. The Plant management (M1 and M2) and the selection of periods daughter-plant did not affected the correlations evaluated in this study.

An investigation about the genetical diversity among eleven banana diploid genotypes using nine agronomical characteristics and sixteen microsatellite markers was implanted at Embrapa Cassava and Tropical Fruits, Cruz das Almas (BA), Brazil. The generalized distance of Mahalanobis indicated the presence of genetic diversity. The genotypes were grouped into tree clusters. Among the investigated characteristics, the plant height, number of bunch's, number of fruits per bunch and pseudostem exhibited high contribution towards genetic divergence. The average number of alleles per primer was 7.51, with a total of 120 alleles identified. The average similarity among the all diploid was 0.44, range from 0.29 up to 0.60. New parental combinations can be identified with base of the divergence between these diploids, contributing for development of new improved diploids preventing the narrow genetic base and creating new genetic variability for selection.

The salinity is a common factor of abiotic stress that seriously affects the agricultural production where it is found. One of the strategies to promote reincorporation of salinity areas and the productivity increasing consists in development and selection of tolerant genotypes, which allows parental identification for crossings. This research aimed to identify the salinity tolerance among banana diploid genotypes to be used in future works of genetic improvement to saline soils of Brazilian northeast region. Nine banana diploid genotypes (AA) were evaluated for growth variables as leaf area, height, diameter of pseudostem, leaves number, weight of fresh and dry matter. During 21 days, the plants were treated with 0 and 100 mM of NaCl, in an entirely randomized experimental delineation with three repetitions. After 21 days, the determination of fresh matter weight was released using analytic balance. The attainment of the each plant dry matter weight from foliar limbo, pseudostem and root+rizome was carried out through drying in greenhouse at 65degC until constant weight. The Tjau Lagada genotype, which suffered minor reduction of leaf area, can possibly show a higher production despite other genotypes analyzed in this study. The genotype 0116-01, presenting a greater salinity tolerance, could be used in future crossings providing genes to be incorporated in productive cultivars by improvement programs which aims the adaptive cultivars to Brazilian northeast saline soils.

Under some cultivation conditions, excessive growth of the pseudostem of banana plants can be considered a limiting factor, and thus, the use of growth regulators can constitute a valid alternative. This work aimed to evaluate the action of paclobutrazol on the growth of the pseudostem of banana plants and other characteristics of their development. An experiment was installed with five paclobutrazol doses (0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5; and 2.0 g of a.i. plant-1) combined with two banana plant cultivars ('Prata Ana' and 'FHIA-01'). Paclobutrazol did not affect the number of days from planting to flowering, total leaf area and leaf emission rate. However, it increased leaf permanence on the plants and sucker number, reduced the foliar area of the leaves emitted after its application and provided an average reduction in pseudostem height of 26%.

To estimate the demand of micronutrients for the banana plants (Musa spp.), it is essential to know the amounts of dry matter and micronutrients accumulated in the plant and exported by the bunch. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of dry matter and micronutrients by six banana varieties under irrigation. Plants of Grande Naine, Pacovan, Pacovan- Apodi, Prata-Ana, Terrinha and Gross Michel varieties grown in double rows, with a density equivalent to 1,666 plants per hectare were sampled. At harvest four plants of each variety were selected for sampling of mother-plant, which was divided into rhizome, pseudostem, petiole, leaf blade, stalk and fruits. The plant parts were weighed to determine the fresh weight of each part and a sample of about 700 g of each part was collected to determine dry weight and contents of micronutrients. The samples were washed quickly with tap water and later with distilled water and placed in a greenhouse for pre-drying and afterwards conditioned in paper bags were put in an oven of forced circulation of air for obtaining the dry matter and subsequent determination of the contents of B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. The varieties Pacovan, Prata Ana e Pacovan Apodi accumulated greater amounts of dry matter and micronutrients, when compared to the varieties Grande Naine, Gross Michel e Terrinha, observing the following decreasing order of accumulation and export of micronutrients: Mn > Fe > B > Zn > Cu.

Brazil is the second world producer of banana, however, the expansion of the banana crop has many difficulties, as the lack of suckers in amount and quality, necessary for implantation of new banana plantations. The objective of this research work was to evaluate the influence of the pseudostem pruning with elimination of the apical meristem of the rhizome and of doses of nitrogen and boron on the production and growth of banana suckers. The experiment was carried out at Centro de Formacao de Tecnologos-UFPB, state of Paraiba. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with four blocks and nine mother plants by experimental unit, being two useful plants. The evaluated factors were doses of N (0 to 240 g plant-1) and of B (0 to 2, 2 g plant-1) combined by the use of the experimental matrix 'Central Composite', originating nine treatments, applied with pruning and without pruning of the mother plant pseudostem. The data were submitted to the analysis of variance and regression. In the plants with pruning, it was reduced the sucker number, which presented smaller growth, on the other hand, it increased the concentration of total chlorophyll. For the production of 'Pacovan' banana suckers, it is recommended the pruning of the mother plant pseudostem with elimination of the rhizome apical meristem and the application of N.

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of organic manure for five crops, on growth and yield characteristics of banana 'Prata-ana'. The experiment was installed in Botucatu, SP, Brazil, in November 2002 with conventional plants spaced 2.5 x 2.5 m. Plants were fertilized with organic compost produced with sawdust and manure, properly composted, which provided the following treatments: 0, 43, 86, 129 and 172 kg of compost per plant. The compost rates were calculated according to the potassium content in the compost. In 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, at blooming, the pseudostem circumference and the plants height were evaluated, as well as the number of living leaves per plant. At harvest, the bunch weight, the number of fruits per bunch, the number of hands per bunch, the bunch weight of the 2nd, the number of fruits in the 2nd bunch, the fruit length and diameter were evaluated. The organic compost rates did not influence the plant growth. However, concerning the crop cycles it was observed a decrease in the leaves number from the second cycle on, and also changes in plants height and pseudostem circumference. In this study, where the K2O rates ranged from zero to 394 g per plant, the bunches of higher weight were obtained with the two higher amounts of compost, which indicates that economically, the dose of 129 kg compost per plant, which corresponds to 290.5 g of K2O per plant, is the best to be recommended.

The fertilization with micronutrients is poorly studied for banana production, especially boron (B) application, which affects the development of apical meristems. This experiment aimed to study responses of B fertilization with different rates and application methods in banana plant 'Grande Naine'. The experimental design was in randomized block and factorial scheme with three rates (0.85, 1.70 and 3.40 g plant-1) and three fertilizer application methods (soil, leaves and tiller hole chopped) and a control, without B application, using boric acid as the source of B. Treatments effects were evaluated by B availability on soil, plant grown, plant nutritional status and by the yield. Treatments effects were submitted to variance analysis and when significant it was adjusted by regression equations. The B application on soil and in the leaves increased this micronutrient content in topsoil (between 1.0-1.5 mg kg-1, with the highest rate of the nutrient) and a corresponding increase up the soil layer to 20-40 cm, as a result of leaching. The contribution of foliar fertilization increasing the content in the soil was due to the washing and by draining the fertilizer solution from the leaves to the soil surface. Moreover, there was no effect of B availability in the soil when the fertilizer was applied in the tiller hole chopped (~0.3 mg kg-1 of B). It was also verified that there were no effects of B application on banana plant growth (height and pseudostem diameter) at the blooming stage. In leaf samples, collected each 15 days, it was observed that when the micronutrient was applied in the tiller hole chopped, leaf B concentration was higher and lasted up for one month. However, in the last foliar sampling (at blooming) it was observed that there was no effect of application methods on leaf B concentration (~20 mg kg-1). There were no effects of fertilization in yield according to rates and application methods of B, but the application on the tiller hole chopped promoted an increased accumulation of this micronutrient in the bunch due to the applied rates. Under the conditions of this experiment, it can be concluded that B application did not influenced the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' according to the rates and application methods of this micronutrient.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Ana' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Ana' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Ana' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Ana' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Ana' cultivar.

Ten diploid banana genotypes (Musa spp.) were evaluated with regard to salt tolerance, abiotic stress which limits the productivity of the crop. The plants were grown during 21 days, in a nutrient solution with and without the addition of NaCl (0 and 100 mol m-3). Growth variables including leaf area, fresh and dry biomass, biomass allocation and growth rate were analysed. The experiment was implemented in a completely randomized design in factorial (10 x 2) arrangement and three replicates per treatment. Salinity caused in most genotypes reductions in almost all variables. Genotype Lidi stood out by having better adaptation to saline stress in all measured biometric variables with the ability to maintain, under stress, the fresh and dry biomass (leaf blade, stem, pseudostem + root), leaf area, and absolute growth rate among others. The relative production of dry biomass of shoots was more than 70%, characterizing this as a tolerant genotype and promising to be integrated into breeding programs. Genotypes Ouro and Tungia, in turn, showed reduction of absolute growth rate and relative dry biomass production (less than 50%) were characterized as sensitive to salinity.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield and the cycle of banana trees treated with paclobutrazol (PBZ). We tested five doses of PBZ (0.0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5 and 2.0 g plant-1), applied on the soil around 'Prata Ana' and 'FHIA-01' banana trees four months after planting. Data were obtained during the first cicle and the bunchs were harvested when yellow color was observed on the peel of the first fruits. The cicle time was of 507 days, not differing in terms of doses and cultivars. The use of PBZ reduced pseudostem length. Increasing of PBZ doses increased the number of active leaves at inflorescence emission period of 'Prata Ana', but the effects on bunch were harmful, with reduction of the number of fruits per bunch, of commercial length and diameter of the fruits, which caused reduction of bunch weight and of productivity. In FHIA-01 cultivar, PBZ applied via soil reduced pseudostem length and improved bunch sustentation, not influencing crop productivity. The optimal dose of PBZ on 'FHIA-01' banana tree is around 1,0 g plant-1. For the 'Prata Ana' is not recommended the use of PBZ.

The productivity in banana is a complex character that results from the combination of different factors, influenced by environment. This work aimed to study the direct and indirect effects of vegetative traits on production in three cycles in banana. The work was conducted in the Experimental Field of Embrapa Acre in Rio Branco, Acre, among years 2003 and 2006. Thirteen genotypes of banana (Preciosa, Japira, Pacovan Ken, Pacovan, BRS Platina, Prata Ana, ST12-31, Nanicao, Grande Naine, Calypso, Ambrosia, Bucaneiro and FHIA 02) were evaluated, spaced 3 m x 2 m, in the randomized blocks with five replicates. The evaluated traits were: plant height, diameter of pseudostem, number of leaves at flowering and harvest, weight of bunch and number of hands in the bunch. Analysis of variance and path analysis were carried out for each cycle and phenotypic correlation coefficients were estimated. The trait weight of the bunch was adopted as the basic variable and the others were considered the explanatory variables. The study of direct and indirect effects showed that the character output is much influenced by the environment in the first cycle, and the following production cycle is much influenced by vegetative traits, especially number of leaves at harvest.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

Phytotechnical characters observed in field experimental are of phenotypic nature and most of the time its assessment is based only on the experience of the observer. The assessment of the correlations between variables allows the estimation of the changes in a character based on the changes in other characters. This present study estimated the impact of agronomic characters related to the weight of the bunch measured in banana plants. The experiment was a test for uniformity, conducted in Guanambi, Bahia, by using the cultivar Tropical (YB42-21), an AAAB tetraploid hybrid. The vegetative characters evaluated during flowering included plant height, perimeter of the pseudostem, number of offshoots, and number of living leaves. The yield related characters were evaluated during the harvest and included, bunch's weight, number of hands and fruits, weight of the second hand, and length and diameter of the fruit in two production cycles. In the evaluations, each plant was considered as a basic unit (bu). This work described a protocol for prediction of banana yield by using the artificial neural networks (ANNs) method as modeling tool. The computational model ANN was used and the prediction of the weight of the bunch in banana plants cv. Tropical was estimated with precision and efficiency (R2=91%, MPE=1.40 and MSD=2.29).

This study evaluated the influence of different irrigation levels on the growth of the banana crop cv. Grande Naine. The experiment was conducted in the experimental field of the Centro Nacional de Pesquisa Mandioca e Fruticultura. A randomized block design was used with six levels of irrigation and eight replications. The irrigation L1 corresponded to rain. The irrigation L6 was determined using the Kc and ETo. The other irrigation levels were determined by the formula NH = K x AF x ETo, where NH is the water requirement of the crop (L plant-1), K (empirical coefficient of plant transpiration), AF - leaf area (m2 plant-1) and ETo - reference evapotranspiration (mm). The parameters evaluated were: plant height, pseudostem circumference, leaf area, alive leaf number and duration of the crop cycle. The growth of cv. Grande Naine was influenced by irrigation, it is possible to estimate the water requirement of the banana crop, based on knowledge of leaf area and ETo. The best crop growth was obtained with a transpiration coefficient of 0.57 and irrigation depth estimated in 1247 mm.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the growth, nutrition and production of Prata Ana banana (Musa spp), intercropped with legumes and subjected to different irrigation depths. The experimental design was a randomized block split plot with five replications. The plots were formed by four irrigation depths: 50, 75, 100 and 125% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and the control subplots (conventional management without cover crops) and three types of cover crops intercropped with banana: spontaneous vegetation (VE), tropical cudzu in succession to crotalaria (CK) and calopogonio in succession to jack beans (FC). In banana crop, the height, pseudostem circumference, foliar concentrations of macro and micronutrients, production and crop cycle duration were evaluated. The use of legumes in the pre-planting and as a cover crop exerted positive influences on growth, nitrogen nutrition and yield of banana, partially replacing the N applied as mineral fertilizer. The use of legumes intercropped with banana represents an adequate alternative to provide N for banana.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of castor bean pie on the infestation by Cosmopolites sordidus and on the development of banana plants cv. Terra. To observe the dose-response relationship, each treatment focused on a different dosage of castor bean pie (0 g, 12 g, 15 g, 18 g, 24 g) applied every two months to the banana plants, starting from the planting date. The experimental design was completely randomized with ten replicates. Plant vegetative growth was evaluated by measuring plant height, pseudostem diameter, and counting alive (or green) leaves. The infestation of plants was undertaken by using 25 adults of C. sordidus per plant. Six months after planting, the percentage of damage caused was scored on rhizomes and the number of adults (alive and died), larvae, and pupae was registered. Absorbance related to the leaf chlorophyll content was also determined by a chorophyllometer. In plants treated with castor bean pie there was a low infestation of the banana weevil borer. Vegetative growth and absorbance were also positively affected by applying castor bean pie. Therefore, castor bean pie reduces C. sordidus population in rhizomes of bananas cv. Terra, improving vegetative growth and chlorophyll content in leaves.

The high density planting of some banana cultivars is an usable practical to increase productivity, especially in regions affected by Sigatoka. This study aimed to evaluate the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' grown in different planting densities with black leaf streak presence at Vale do Ribeira, SP. It was installed a banana orchard with seedlings produced in vitro of the Grande Naine cultivar. The experimental design was a completely randomized, in factorial scheme 5 x 2, with five densities (2,500; 2,222; 2,000; 1,667 and 1,111 plants.ha-1) and two production cycles. The black leaf streak severity was weekly monitored using the state evolution method (SE) and its control were set when occurred the second consecutive progression of the severity and/or increases of 200 points from a week to the next. For each plot it was evaluated eight plants measuring plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of active leaves at blooming and at harvest, bunch fresh weight, productivity, number of hands, bunch fruits number, total fresh weight and individual fresh weight of the 2nd hand, length and diameter of 2nd hand fruits. Data were submitted to variance analysis by F test and the significant means were compared by Tukey test (5% probability). Under the experimental conditions, it can be concluded that the density did not influence the plant development (plant height and pseudostem diameter). The biggest plants density gave higher banana plant 'Grande Naine' yields.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3x2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0x2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

The aim of this study was to characterize Heliconia genotypes phenotypically using 26 qualitative descriptors. The evaluations were conducted in five flowering stems per clump in three replicates of 22 Heliconia genotypes. Data were subjected to multivariate analysis, the Mahalanobis dissimilarity measure was estimated, and the dendrogram was generated using the nearest neighbor method. From the values generated by the dissimilarity matrix and the clusters formed among the Heliconia genotypes studied, the phenotypic characterizations that best differentiated the genotypes were: pseudostem and wax green tone (light or dark green), leaf-wax petiole, the petiole hair, cleft margin at the base of the petiole, midrib underside shade of green, wax midrib underside, color sheet (light or dark green), unequal lamina base, torn limb, inflorescence-wax, position of inflorescence, bract leaf in apex, twisting of the rachis, and type of bloom. These results will be applied in the preparation of a catalog for Heliconia descriptors, in the selection of different genotypes with most promising characteristics for crosses, and for the characterization of new genotypes to be introduced in germplasm collections.

The objective of this study was to agronomically characterize plants from induced chromosome doubling experiments in the Pisang Lilin parthenocarpic banana accession to select genotypes that will be used as 2n gamete donors in crosses with improved diploids to generate secondary triploids. Twenty-two plants were evaluated, of which 17 were autotetraploids. Compared with the original diploids, the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids showed significant increases in the plant height, number of living leaves at flowering and harvest, pseudostem diameter, and length and diameter of fruits; the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids also exhibited greater fruit and bunch weights compared with the original diploids. In addition, all autotetraploid plants did not exhibit any symptoms of yellow Sigatoka. Female fertility was also detected, as some plants produced seeds, indicating that they can be used as female parents. Therefore, the autotetraploids characterized in this study exhibited useful agronomical traits to be used as 2n gamete donors for generating secondary triploids.

The favourable climatic conditions make Brazil one of the most important producers of tropical flowers, among them some Heliconia native species are remarkable. In the present study 19 accessions of H. chartacea were characterized using morphological descriptors related to pseudostem, leaf and inflorescences. The purpose was to select accessions with desirable aspects for cut flower production. The experiment was carried out during August 2014 and January 2015. Differences were observed in morphological descriptors related to the inflorescences. In 54% of the inflorescences that were harvested, the length was between 30 and 60 cm and varied according to the number of open bracts. The width was larger than 40 cm in 75% of the inflorescences. About 70% of the harvested stems had weight above 200 g and the average stem diameter was between 20-30 mm. The latter feature was directly related to the stiffness of the flower stem. The length of the peduncle varied between 10 and 20 cm for 60% of the stems. The vase life of the flower stems ranged between 5 and 11 days. In general, most of the studied accessions were suitable for use as cut flower, nevertheless more detailed evaluation is necessary.

Brazil is the sixth largest producer of banana; however, traditional practices of banana propagation fall short when the intention is to introduce a uniform, pathogen-free banana plantation, with high yield potential . This research aimed to evaluate the vegetative growth and production of 'Prata Ana' banana derived from conventional seedlings (whole rhizome) of different sizes (up to 1000g, 1001 to 2000g, 2001 to 3000g, 3001 to 4000g, 4001 to 5000g, and more than 5000g) and in vitro micropropagation, during the first and second production cycles. The experimental design was completely randomized, with a variable number of repetitions. Analysis of variance was performed using regression equations for the vegetative data and Tukey test at 5% of probability for production data. Micropropagated plants originating from rhizomes with weight of less than 1000g, between 1001g and 2000g resulted in plants with more vegetative vigor, in the first cycle. In the second cycle, the number of leaves, height and diameter of the pseudostem tended to equalize for tratadifferent classes of plants assessed. In the first production cycle, periods between planting and floral anthesis and between planting and harvesting were inversely proportional to the size of conventional seedlings; the periods for micropropagated plants were similar to the conventional seedlings of greater weight. There was no difference in the number of hands, fingers and bunch weight between the different classes of seedlings. The differences between the amount of time from planting to flowering and until harvest among the different classes of seedlings tend to disappear from the first to the second cycle. Thus, the propagation of the banana with seedlings weighing less than 2000g or micropropagated is preferable; however, it is possible to use any kind of seedlings, planted in various plots according to the size.

Being one of the important tropical and subtropical fruit trees, banana (Musa.spp.) belongs to the family Musaceae and the order Scitaminae with two genera, Musa and Ensete. In a field survey, research team has discovered a potential banana mutant strain 'HD-1' with a sound economic value. The results of the finding are as follows: based on Simmonds' classification, the pseudostem of banana strain 'HD-1' is relatively short and purplish red; its upright outward petiole groove has red edges and wraps its pseudostem loosely. Its ploidy is 3x, AAA type. Karyotype analysis shows that the number of chromosomes is 33, the karyotype formula is 2n=3x=33=2L + 3 M2 + 4 M1 + 2 S, 'HD-1' is classified as '1B' type. With the help of ISSR molecular markers, we find thatbanana 'HD-1' has the closest relationship with Pubei and Tianbao dwarf banana; the similarity coefficient is 0.81. In an artificial simulation tests of cold, drought and salt resistance environment changes of physiological and biochemical indexes indicate that 'HD-1' exhibits stronger defense capability than Brazil banana. By way of inoculation with injury of root dipping method, we respectively treat two kinds of banana seedlings inoculated Banana Fusarium wilt race 4 small species. The results show that their resistance evaluation scores are 3 and 4, disease levels are 'susceptible' and 'high sensitivity' respectively. We conclude that 'HD-1' has stronger resistance ability toFusarium wilt than Brazil banana. (c) 2016, Pakistan Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

The present study evaluated plant morphological traits and fruit quality parameters of banana 'Dwarf Cavendish' cultivar and local type 'Azman' grown in subtropical conditions, under unheated plastic greenhouse. The study was conducted between 2014 and 2015 in Alanya, the province of Antalya. The planting density was 1850 ha-1 and drip irrigation system was used. Plant morphological features (plant height, stem circumference and height, leaves retention at flowering and bunch stalk circumference), yield components (number of hands, number of fingers, finger circumference and length, and bunch weight) and fruit quality attributes (peel thickness, the peel and pulp ratio, soluble solid content) after ripening were determined. The plant height, stem height, number of hand, bunch weight and finger features were the most variable traits. 'Dwarf Cavendish' produced shorter plants and pseudostem height. Bunch weight and finger features in 'Azman' were found to be superior to 'Dwarf Cavendish'. As 'Azman' type produced higher yield (69.3 t ha-1 year-1) than 'Dwarf Cavendish' cultivar (52 t ha-1 year-1), this local type is recommended for cultivation under unheated greenhouse.

The characterization and evaluation of banana genotypes (Musa spp.) is an important step both for breeding programs and for indication to farmers. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate banana genotypes in Rio Branco - Acre, aiming at their incorporation into the region 's production systems. The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design in a subdivided plots scheme with five replicates and four plants per plot. The treatments of the plots were the three production cycles, and the subplots were the nineteen banana genotypes. We evaluated plant's height; perimeter of the pseudostem base; number of active leaves at the inflorescence and harvesting stage; the period from planting until flowering, the period from flowering until harvest and period from planting until harvest; the mass of the bunch, the total number of fruits per bunch; the number of pieces; productivity. The genotypes Thap Maeo, FHIA-02, FHIA-18, and Maravilha, present the best agronomic performance and have the potential to be incorporated into the banana production system in the edaphoclimatic conditions of the Rio Branco, Acre region.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. (c) 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Banana growth and hence production is affected largely due to many biotic factors that include bacteria, fungi, viruses, aphids etc. Common bacterial wilt disease that affect banana is caused by Xanthomonas vasicola pv. musacearum (Xvm), Ralstonia solanacearum. Symptoms include progressive yellowing, wilting and blackening of leaves; yellow or brown vascular streaks throughout the plant; pockets of pale yellow bacterial ooze in airspaces within leaf bases; premature ripening and internal discoloration of fruits. Erwinia-associated diseases such as bacterial head rot or tip-over caused by Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi, bacterial rhizome and pseudostem wet rot caused by Dickeya paradisiaca formerly E. chrysanthemi pv. Paradisiacal are also reported in banana. Other bacterial diseases of less widespread importance include: bacterial wilt of abaca, Javanese vascular wilt and bacterial fingertip rot (probably caused by Ralstonia spp.) R. solanacearum is soil borne pathogen, very diverse in its species, and belongs to group of Ralstonia-species complex. The Biolog GEN III identification is used as the first step in identifying the isolates from infected plants. This technology classifies bacteria by ability of their cell to metabolise all major classes of biochemicals, in addition to determining other important physiological properties such as pH, salt, and lactic acid tolerance, reducing power, and chemical sensitivity. Due to their diversity in species and strains, suitable diagnostic procedure should be done to identify the pathogens accurately. Pathogen identification based on colony morphology or disease symptoms is difficult, time consuming and unreliable. Molecular diagnostic such as polymerase chain reaction using specific primer and the other diagnosis of pathogen is also possible by using bacteriophage due to its specificity to infective. Rapid detection and accurate identification of pathogens in plant are critical steps to prevent pathogens dissemination. Innovative agronomic practices could be employed to control/manage the diseases. Integration of cultural practices with sensitive and specific diagnostic tools, transgenic approaches and conventional breeding techniques may offer a more sustainable and environmental friendly approach to control and manage the bacterial diseases in banana.
