The ownership strategies of 128 retail franchising systems are examined in the light of existing agency and resource scarcity explanations of this organizational form. Findings suggest that franchiser ownership strategies are more heterogeneous than previously recognized, and that neither explanation, alone accounts for observed ownership patterns. A path model of franchiser ownership patterns embodying agency and resource scarcity elements is developed that is consistent with empirical findings. Copyright (c) 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Entrepreneurship is the process by which firms notice opportunities and act (by creatively organizing transactions between factors of production) to create surplus value. Using concepts from information and agency theory, this article examines how agency problems affect the dynamics of internal corporate entrepreneurship and the level of entrepreneurial behavior The relationship between internal corporate and external entrepreneurship is explored, and the organizationalfactors that cause agency problems are examined. Finally, solutions to agency problems are suggested that also promote internal corporate entrepreneurship. (c) 1992, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

This study examines, from a cultural perspective, owner-managers'and other stakeholders'interpretations of the partial fusion of ownership and control through high leverage in eight UK management buy-outs (MBOs). Owner-control and debt-control are interpreted as having positive effects on managerial motivation, organizational decision-making processes and implementation of cost reduction strategies and negative ones on fundamental changes in strategy and acquisition. These interpretations accord broadly with agency theory propositions but show that owner-managers place less emphasis on wealth incentive effects and more emphasis on the enabling and facilitating roles of collective ownership and the freedom it gives from inappropriate corporate control.

Several studies have addressed the CEO duality-performance relationship, with inconsistent results. This paper proposes that these inconsistencies can be resolved by integrating agency and stewardship perspectives on duality. Using data from 192 firms in 12 industries, both the direction and magnitude of the duality-performance relationship was found to vary systematically across Dess and Beard's (1984) environmental dimensions. These results provide partial support for both agency and stewardship perspectives. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We examine how ownership configuration affects the determination of CEO pay raises. Based on a sample of 188 firms over a 5-year period, it was found that pay raises were based on distinctly different factors, depending on the ownership profile of the firm. In management-controlled firms--where no single major owner exists--results suggest an overarching pay philosophy: maximize CEO pay, subject to demonstration of face legitimacy of that pay. In externally-controlled firms--where a major (nonmanager) owner exists--results suggest a very different philosophy: minimize CEO pay, subject to the ability to attract/retain a satisfactory CEO.

Critics have argued that the field of information systems (IS) lacks a coherent theoretical framework. This paper attempts to further the theoretical development of a critical and pervasive contemporary phenomenon, outsourcing of IS functions, by synthesizing four theoretical models (resource-based theory, resource-dependence theory, transaction cost theory and agency theory) that are useful for understanding determinants of a firm's outsourcing strategy. From these theoretical models, a contingency model of outsourcing is developed which can be used to direct empirical research. (c) 1995, Palgrave Publishing. All Rights Reserved.

This paper examines the influence of competitive strategy on the relationship between suppliers and their distribution networks. Drawing on agency theory, hypotheses are developed specifying the appropriate match between manufacturer strategies and systems of control within distribution channels. Cluster analysis is used to show distinct differences in channel management and structure for the three generic strategies of cost leadership, differentiation and focus. Results suggest that variation in control relationships may be explained by the demands posed by manufacturers' competitive strategies. This study therefore extends the applicability of Porter's typology to the specific structure of distribution channels and shows that agency theory can provide insights into the economic basis of interorganizational relationships.

Most current writers on strategic control, whether from the rational planning or processual schools, agree on the importance of dialogue and debate between the interested parties to the control process. This is particularly so when strategic control is regarded in a 'warning bell' sense, responding to a signal that all is not going according to plan, rather than as a behavioural constraint or as an element of agency theory practice. This paper advances a normative framework for ensuring the effectiveness of such discussions based on Bird's notion of a 'good conversation'. Bird argued that the discussion of business ethical problems should be vocal, reciprocating, issues-oriented, rational, imaginative, and honest. It is argued here that these characteristics should also apply to the discussions within the strategic control process if the process is not to be dysfunctional.

Previous empirical studies of top managers tend to draw from either positive agency theory or strategic leadership theory. This manuscript reviews and critiques these two approaches, outlining their advantages and inherent limitations. Because each is inherently limited, we suggest that developments in personality theory, transformational leadership theory, and visionary leadership theory can contribute to a more realistic view of top managers. Consequently, we contrast these three alternative perspectives with the two more dominant approaches in this manuscript. As a result, we identify future research directions for scholars interested in studying strategic leadership. (c) 1997 JAI Press Inc. All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

Much debate has been generated about whether privatization tends to enhance firm financial performance. The research presented here seeks to identify the strategic choices that differentiated firms with superior post-privatization performance from those with inferior post-privatization performance. Using agency theory as a theoretical foundation, it is hypothesized that superior post-privatization firm performance will be associated with (1) the government not retaining a significant stock holding, (2) changes in leadership, (3) management stock options being initiated, (4) employee head count being reduced and (5) the company being restructured financially. The sample draws from 41 privatized firms from six industry classifications and 15 countries. To accommodate comparisons of small subsamples, non-parametric statistical methods are used. Controlling for size, industry and country (economic/regulatory effects), the hypotheses are generally supported except for the one relating to headcount.

The development of the field of strategic management within the last two decades has been dramatic. While its roots have been in a more applied area, often referred to as business policy, the current field of strategic management is strongly theory based, with substantial empirical research, and is eclectic in nature. This review of the development of the field and its current position examines the field's early development and the primary theoretical and methodological bases through its history. Early developments include Chandler's (1962) Strategy and Structure and Ansoff's (1965) Corporate Strategy. These early works took on a contingency perspective (fit between strategy and structure) and a resource-based framework emphasizing internal strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps, one of the more significant contributions to the development of strategic management came from industrial organization (IO) economics, specifically the work of Michael Porter. The structure-conduct-performance framework and the notion of strategic groups, as well as providing a foundation for research on competitive dynamics, are flourishing currently. The IO paradigm also brought econometric tools to the research on strategic management. Building on the IO economics framework, the organizational economics perspective contributed transaction costs economics and agency theory to strategic management. More recent theoretical contributions focus on the resource-based view of the firm. While it has its roots in Edith Penrose's work in the late 1950s, the resource-based view was largely introduced to the field of strategic management in the 1980s and became a dominant framework in the 1990s. Based on the resource-based view or developing concurrently were research on strategic leadership, strategic decision theory (process research) and knowledge-based view of the firm. The research methodologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated and now frequently combine both quantitative and qualitative approaches and unique and new statistical tools. Finally, this review examines the future directions, both in terms of theory and methodologies, as the study of strategic management evolves. (c) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper builds and tests a holistic model of risk in organizations. Using structural equations modeling, we disaggregated risk into two distinct components, managerial risk taking and income stream uncertainty, or organizational risk. This allowed us to identify an array of organizational and environmental antecedents that have either been examined in isolation or neglected in previous studies about risk. Our results suggest that both organizational and environmental factors promote risk taking. Further, we found strong support for behavioral theory of the firm and agency theory on risk but not upper echelons theory. Our data also suggest that environmental characteristics have a negligible direct effect on organizational risk. Instead, the environment's impact on risk occurs primarily through managerial choices.

We offer a rationale for a link between capital scarcity and franchising. Predictions respectively based on agency theory and the capital scarcity hypothesis were tested among 91 restaurant chains. Our specific focus was on whether or not variables based on capital scarcity could explain variance in firms' franchising decisions beyond what was explained by agency variables. The latter were significant predictors of franchising, and the capital scarcity variables explained additional variance, indicating that capital is among the resources related to franchising.

An enduring challenge for franchise management involves the reconciliation of (1) the franchisor's desire for standardization, consistency, and control for the preservation of its goodwill and brand equity, and (2) the franchisee's quest for autonomy, especially because franchises are frequently sold on the platform of be your own boss and have historically attracted would-be franchisees with self-employment histories and strong streaks of independence and autonomy. Building on arguments derived from agency theory, resource dependence theory, the locus of control argument, and the countervailing power premise, the present study attempts to evaluate (1) the interrelationships between the concepts of autonomy and dependence, and (2) the influence of competition, success, experience, and multi-unit ownership as determinants of the various autonomy-dependence perceptions. It is suggested that, contrary to the dominant perspective nested in the markets versus hierarchy dichotomy, which portrays the sentiments of dependence and autonomy as opposing theoretical variables (i.e., they are envisioned to exist only in high-low combinations of these two constructs), even their high-high and low-low combinations can emerge within a franchise setting, and that these diverse behavioral settings entail unique management challenges. The empirical portion of the study utilizes data drawn from the franchised channel of fastfood restaurants. The results support the emergence of all four combinations of dependence and autonomy (i.e., the traditional high-low combinations as well as the high-high and low-low combinations), suggestingthat behavioral settings of franchises are indeed richer than hitherto imagined. It appears that because franchisee-franchisor relationships encompass several domains, they each feel dependent on the other party in certain domains, and simultaneously, autonomous in other domains. The environmental factor of competition, the relationship factor of business success experienced in the franchise system, and the structural factor of multi-unit ownership emerged as significant predictors of dependence and autonomy. Notably, however, the countervailing power argument was not supported by the data. The multi-unit ownership effects were especially strong and provided a more direct test of the alignment of goals and incentives envisioned by agency theory. We conclude by identifying four categories of franchisees with distinct gestalts that franchisors would do well to learn to manage in the spirit of portfolio management.

In this study, two different theoretical perspectives are used to develop sets of hypotheses regarding the mechanisms used to manage foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations. First, agency theory serves as the basis for a model that predicts the use of monitoring mechanisms and incentive compensation. Then, it is argued that these mechanisms are insufficient for managing subsidiaries characterized by high levels of intra-firm international interdependence, the management of which is critical to many of today's complex global firms. A second set of hypotheses is argued, linking international interdependence to several social control mechanisms. Primary and secondary data from U.S. based multinational corporations were used to test both sets of hypotheses. The results indicate that agency theory, although a useful foundation for studies of control within MNCs, is limited in its ability to explain fully the phenomenon of foreign subsidiary control, however, the model based on intra-firm interdependence had much greater predictive ability.

The purpose of this paper is to draw together the many different facets of corporate governance that have been examined in the extensive literature in both strategic management and finance. In particular, we are interested in the relationship between the typical agency theory constructs of monitoring, incentives and ownership structure, with financial performance. First, we catalog this large body of work to see where there are still unanswered questions. We find that previous work has generally focused on examining subsets of governance mechanisms, typically studying one or two governance variables in any one study. Our view is that the most critical issue still to examine, is the ability of firms to choose among a number of different governance mechanisms in order to create the appropriate structure for that firm, given the environment in which it operates. We identify a sample of firms and examine CEO compensation, CEO tenure, board composition, leadership structure and ownership structure and their contribution to both market performance, Market Value Added, and risk-adjusted accounting performance, Economic Value Added. In addition, we control for ownership by blockholders, industry performance, and firm size. We examine these measures both individually and as interactions. Our results indicate that while some of the traditional agency variables do impact performance, both individually and as interactions, industry performance is a strong and significant driver of performance for our sample of firms. We conclude that, while there is evidence to support that firms may use governance packages to deal with agency issues, further research could provide important evidence on these issues by focusing on examining a more refined, industry-level context.

This paper analyzes the link between economics and the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm. Although, historically there has been a strong link between the disciplines of strategy and economics, explicit citations of key RBV works has been disappointingly low in mainstream economics journals. However, there are substantial bodies of works that build implicitly on the ideas of the RBV, in particular the consequences of path dependency on firm behavior, to explain a number of different economic issues. The issues we review in the paper are all influenced by path dependency and include: (1) diversification and market entry, (2) corporate refocusing, and market exit, (3) explaining innovative activity among firms, (4) diversification and performance and (5) industry evolution with rapidly changing products. Furthermore, we identify a number of reasons that may have limited the explicit use of the RBV in economics, which include the problems of causal ambiguity, tautology and firm heterogeneity. Finally, potential areas for future research are identified, which include the interaction of the RBV and Agency Theory, the RBV as a dynamic theory, using the RBV to explain radical change and the application of the RBV to issues of antitrust.

We examined the effects of unsystematic and systematic firm risk on CEO compensation risk bearing and total pay. Both the proportion of variable pay in CEO pay packages and their magnitude are curvilinearly related to unsystematic firm risk - that is, they are highest under conditions of moderate firm-specific risk. Our results are consistent with agency theory predictions that both performance-contingent pay and the greater earnings potential associated with that form of pay are highest when an agent has greater control over performance outcomes.

Entrepreneurial activity in the form of strategic subsidiary initiatives is examined theoretically utilising an extended agency theory perspective and extant empirical findings. The analysis using traditional agency theory suggests that entrepreneurial subsidiary initiatives are unlikely given the risk necessary to put forth an initiative and lack of incentives on the part of traditional subsidiary management. In developing an extended principal-agent analysis it is discovered that the risk attitudes of both the parent company and the subsidiary as well as the internal contracting system of the multinational company are rudimentary to a theoretical understanding of subsidiary-driven initiatives. The implications of the analysis are delineated and several propositions developed. (c) 2002 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Managing supply risk is an essential element of the overall supply management task. As the complexity of risk management has increased, responsiveness seems dominated by varying the level of inventory and using multiple supply sources as means of creating buffers. This research uses the framework of agency theory in managing supplier behaviors as a means to reduce supply risk and the impact of detrimental events. Empirical results indicate that purchasing organizations address various sources of supply risk by implementing management techniques that reduce the likelihood that detrimental events will occur. Firm size, purchases as a percentage of sales, and industry characteristics were also found to influence the manner in which supplier behaviors are managed. (c) 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper evaluates the relative performances of several well-known and widely-used incentive mechanisms under controlled experimental conditions. The scenario utilized is a delegated investment setting where effort and risk aversions contribute to moral hazard among fund managers. Analytical intractability of the problem requires a computational modeling approach to simulate comparative solutions for specific contracts under different parametric settings. Through a simulation exercise, we consider multiple agents who decide their investment strategy over several consecutive periods. Agents learn about estimation and market uncertainty through repeated realizations of investment returns. In each sequence of periods, a number of different incentive mechanisms based on the agent's communication and/or outcome are considered. Results of the computational experiments are presented. Our results overwhelmingly show the efficacy of the incentive contracts in improving the welfare of the investors. In the presence of an estimation risk, when agents learn from their past performances, the market volatility interacts with the estimation risk that makes risk- sharing arrangements such as limited liability overly important. Paying the agent to assume the risk may no longer lead to the best performance incentives.

This paper analyzes the links among executive compensation, a firm's strategic orientation, and firm performance. A number of key questions relative to the relationships among these elements remain unanswered because prior research on this subject has reported mixed results, and, moreover, has been confined almost exclusively to U.S. firms. We develop a framework that draws on arguments from agency theory to identify such links. A research design with both archival and survey data is used to test hypotheses in a sample of 253 Spanish companies. We found that top managers' compensation systems are linked with a firm's strategic orientations, but in a different form than that of previous studies. Results show two differentiated groups of firms: (1) prospective firms that adapt their managerial compensation systems to the requirements of strategic context, consequently obtaining positive performance effects; and (2) conservative firms that design managerial compensation systems independent of strategic context, consequently not obtaining additional performance benefits.

Although franchising is a pervasive organizational form, little is known about its performance consequences. Prior studies have not found a direct performance effect, suggesting a need for alternative approaches. Drawing upon agency and resource scarcity theories, we develop the idea that strategic groups exist among franchisors and that performance differs among the groups. Using a sample of 65 restaurant chains, three strategic groups were found. The strategic group most influenced to franchise out of resource scarcity exhibited poorer performance than the other two groups. Results indicate that important, but nonlinear, relationships exist among franchising, its antecedents, and performance. (c) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Research has suggested that information systems planning is an important challenge to managers of multinational firms. Although studies have examined marketing, finance, and manufacturing, limited research has considered IS planning autonomy in such firms. A field survey of 55 US subsidiaries collected data from matched pairs of senior IS and non-IS managers to test hypotheses based on corporate governance theory and agency theory. The former described their planning autonomy and the latter described organizational characteristics. Data analysis revealed that foreign product diversity, extent of local ownership of the subsidiary, intracompany purchases, and age of the subsidiary were related to the subsidiary's IS planning autonomy. The findings indicated that parent companies treat the IS function differently from other areas of the organization. Future researchers should investigate the proposed explanations of this difference. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study examines both the direct and indirect effects of chief executive officer tenure and age on CEO pay in UK organizations. It was found that the positive relationship between shareholder return and increases in the value of executive options held decreases with CEO tenure. Moreover, the positive association between changes in salary and sales was found to increase with CEO tenure. CEO age, on the other hand, weakened the relationship between the level in salary and size of the organization. Several new methodological issues relating to research on executive pay are also raised. One finding was that the study of these relationships might be better pursued through the use of non-linear functions as CEO influence over the pay setting process may not become significant until about the sixth year of tenure. These findings have implications for further research relating to executive pay and to the corporate governance process. (c) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Family firms are widely recognized as a major source of technological innovation and economic progress. Yet, over time, some family firms become conservative and unwilling to take the risks associated with entrepreneurial activities. Adopting a broad definition of entrepreneurial risk taking, this study uses agency theory to highlight key correlates of risk taking among 209 U.S. manufacturing family firms. The results show that family ownership and involvement promote entrepreneurship, whereas the long tenures of CEO founders have the opposite effect. These results urge managers to capitalize on the skills and talents of their family members in promoting entrepreneurship and selective venturing into new market arenas.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in international markets. This study argues that the ownership structures of SMEs influence their proclivity to take risks and expand the scale and scope of their internationalization efforts. Data from 889 Swedish SMEs reveal that internal owners (CEOs and other senior executives) tend to be risk averse and have a lower proclivity to increase scale and scope of internationalization than external owners (venture capitalists and institutional investors). The results provide interesting insights into the behavioral change of executives regarding the scale and scope of internationalization in the presence of external ownership.

Property rights theory has common antecedents with contractual theories of the firm such as transaction costs and agency theories, and is yet distinct from these theories. We illustrate fundamental theoretical principles derived from these three theories by analyzing the business case of oil field unitization. Theoretical principles and application of theory to oil field unitization are each summarized. From this, it is possible to see how property rights theory is well suited to explain business situations where inefficient economic outcomes persist. Additionally, property rights theory forges new theoretical connections with other branches of organizational economics, in particular, resource-based theory.

Corporate scandals, reflected in excessive management compensation and fraudulent accounts, cause great damage. Agency theory's insistence to link the compensation of managers and directors as closely as possible to firm performance is a major reason for these scandals. They cannot be overcome by improving variable pay for performance as selfish extrinsic motivation is reinforced. Based on the common pool approach to the firm, institutions are proposed, serving to raise intrinsically motivated corporate virtue. More importance is to be attributed to fixed pay and strengthening the legitimacy of authorities by procedural fairness, relational contracts, and organizational citizenship behavior.

The impact of globalisation and worldwide competition has become glaringly apparent in China. This paper examines China's transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to competitive privatised entities. With China's move toward an open market society, the Chinese government saw the need to privatise some of the SOEs. Using Agency Theory and Ramamurti's three-tiered model of privatisation as a theoretical framework, we chronicle the transformation of six Chinese SOEs that have used advanced management systems to make themselves viable market contenders and competitive enterprises. Finally, we showcase one firm, Chongqing CHN & CHN Ceramics Co., Ltd. (C&C), a company well on its way to becoming a leader in the global ceramics market. (c) 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The primary objective of the study is to determine whether there is a positive relationship between directors' fees with the size of the firm and performance, based on the annual report of 246 listed firms. The results indicate a weak positive relationship between directors' remuneration, corporate size (total assets) and corporate performance (operating cash flow on asset). The weak positive relationship between director fees and performance indicates that other factors, such as the director's yearly performance, may also account for the determination of the director's remuneration. The findings support the notion of agency theory and corporate governance that remunerating the top management should be based on individual and corporate performance. In contrast, other performance variables such as return on assets (ROA) and earning per share (EPS) measured indicates no statistical association.

This article seeks to link the domains of corporate governance, investment policies, competitive asymmetries, and sustainable capabilities. Conditions such as concentrated ownership, lengthy tenures, and profound business expertise give some family-controlled business (FCB) owners the discretion, incentive, knowledge, and ultimately, the resources to invest deeply in the future of the firm. These long-term investments accrue from particular governance conditions and engender competitive asymmetries - organizational qualities that are hard for other firms to copy, and thus, if tied to the value chain, create capabilities that are sustainable. Investments in staff and training, e.g., create tacit knowledge and preserve it within the firm. Investments in enduring relationships with partners enhance access to resources and free firms to focus on core competencies. And devotion to a compelling mission dedicates most of these investments to a core competency. When such investments are farsighted, orchestrated, and ongoing, capabilities will tend to evolve in a cumulative trajectory, making them doubly hard to imitate and thereby extending competitive advantage. Arguments are supported by making reference to the literature on corporate governance and agency theory and to emerging research on FCBs. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

We draw on the concept of community-level social capital and apply it to the situation of a family-controlled public corporation. While traditional agency theory argues that agency costs are minimized in a family-controlled business (FCB) due to an improved alignment of owner and manager interests, we argue instead that FCBs endure additional agency costs uniquely related to the family firm organizational structure. To mitigate these additional costs, we propose that FCBs use board interlocks to build and maintain community-level social capital. That is, the intercorporate network of FCBs generates shared understandings, values, problem solving techniques, and approaches to dealing with family issues. Further, the network generates a level of social support for family business owners and managers grappling with challenges endemic to family control of public corporations. We generate a number of propositions that can be used in future research to test the theory developed here. We conclude with the assertion that the community-level social capital generated by the network of FCBs is an important reason for the survival and persistence of individual family firms, despite the existence of additional family-related costs.

Alternative explanations of franchising offer contrasting predictions as to how the proportion of franchised outlets changes as franchisors age. We propose that two dominant views - resource-scarcity and agency theory - can be integrated by delineating when each is most relevant. Data from 102 franchisors over a 21-year period suggest that resource-scarcity considerations take precedence when franchisors are young, but that agency considerations prevail as franchisors age. Thus, the proportion franchised exhibits a cubic pattern as franchisors age - increasing rapidly at first, decreasing, and then increasing again. Future researchers and practitioners alike can benefit from understanding how the relative influences of resource and agency considerations shift over time. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper discusses the merits of purchasing firms of pursuing a focused commitment strategy (FCS) with suppliers. An FCS involves committing long-term investments with a limited number of suppliers to achieve superior performance. Drawing upon transaction cost theory, agency theory and the knowledge-based view, a basis is provided for comparisons of the benefits and risks of such a strategy. Using data gathered from 224 US manufacturing firms, support for the hypothesized trade-offs associated with an FCS is examined. The findings support such trade-offs, suggesting that operational benefits accrue from increasing levels of focused commitment beyond unfocused levels - but only up to a point. The results indicate that firms pursuing above-average levels of focused commitment may be subject to risks that offset transactional and scale-related benefits. Detriments from too much focused commitment erode the firm's manufacturing-based competitive performance. In addition, the evidence indicates that profitability and market share growth also suffer. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for managers and for future research.

I argue and found that the effectiveness of a firm's monitoring mechanisms to prevent managerial opportunism in acquisitions becomes more important under high environmental complexity and/or dynamism because of the increased information asymmetry between investors and top executives under these conditions. I also found that increased monitoring under non-complex and/or stable environments may be viewed negatively by investors, and that symbolic information about governance arrangements affects investors' evaluations of managerial opportunism in acquisitions. The results highlight the need for more research on factors that influence the explanatory power of agency theory. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Despite a decade since the inception of B2C e-commerce, the uncertainty of the online environment still makes many consumers reluctant to engage in online exchange relationships. Even if uncertainty has been widely touted as the primary barrier to online transactions, the literature has viewed uncertainty as a "background" mediator with insufficient conceptualization and measurement. To better understand the nature of uncertainty and mitigate its potentially harmful effects on B2C e-commerce adoption (especially for important purchases), this study draws upon and extends the principal-agent perspective to identify and propose a set of four antecedents of perceived uncertainty in online buyer-seller relationships - perceived information asymmetry, fears of seller opportunism, information privacy concerns, and information security concerns - which are drawn from the agency problems of adverse selection (hidden information) and moral hazard (hidden action). To mitigate uncertainty in online exchange relationships, this study builds upon the principal - agent perspective to propose a set of four uncertainty mitigating factors - trust, website informativeness, product diagnosticity, and social presence - that facilitate online exchange relationships by overcoming the agency problems of hidden information and hidden action through the logic of signals and incentives. The proposed structural model is empirically tested with longitudinal data from 521 consumers for two products (prescription drugs and books) that differ on their level of purchase involvement. The results support our model, delineating the process by which buyers engage in online exchange relationships by mitigating uncertainty. Interestingly, the proposed model is validatedfor two distinct targets, a specific website and a class of websites. Implications for understanding and facilitating online exchange relationships for different types of purchases, mitt gating uncertainty perceptions, and extending the principal-agent perspective are discussed.

Most research investigating the impact of board leadership structure as a corporate governance mechanism, on corporate performance has focused largely on either the Anglo-American context or the Asian experience and has come up with diverse conclusions. This study sheds light on the extent to which corporate leadership structure affects corporate performance by providing empirical evidence from a sample of Egyptian listed firms. The initial econometric results indicate that CEO duality has no impact on corporate performance. However, when an interaction term between industry type and CEO duality is included in the model, the impact of CEO duality on corporate performance is found to vary across industries, a result that is supportive of both agency theory and stewardship theory. In addition, when firms are categorised according to their financial performance, CEO duality attracts a positive and significant coefficient only when corporate performance is low.

This exploratory study is intended to analyze how a combination of the resources-based view and agency theory can provide a better understanding of the internal dynamic of the family business and its evolution. Our evidence seems to suggest that the desire to keep family control produces specific sources of value and conditions the firm's financial capacity to acquire resources. These peculiarities change between first and following generations. During the first generation, we find that less severe agency costs balance the negative effect of scarce financial structure on the family firm's value. After descendants join the firm, the increasing agency costs are compensated by the enlargement of the firm's financial structure. (c) 2007 Family Firm Institute, Inc.

We explore the impact of CEO tenure on returns to shareholders arising from acquisition announcements. Further, we consider the value added for shareholders when the board of directors is composed in such a way as to enhance vigilance. In the absence of a vigilant board, CEO tenure is positively associated with performance at low to moderate levels of tenure, and negatively associated with performance when tenure further rises to substantial levels. In the presence of a vigilant board, however, shareholder interests can be advanced even at high levels of CEO tenure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Some accounting information systems research suggests that the implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems improves corporate performance [Hayes DC, Hunton JE, Reck JL. Market reaction to ERPS implementation announcements. J Inf Syst 2001;15(1): 3-18; Hunton JE, Lippincott B, Reck J. Enterprise resource planning systems: Comparing firm performance of adopters and nonadopters. Int J Account Inf Syst 2003;4:165-184], while a seemingly disparate line of managerial accounting research indicates that the inclusion of non-financial performance incentives (NFPI) in executive compensation contracts also enhances performance [Said AA, HassabElnaby HR, Wier, B. An empirical investigation of the performance consequences of non-financial measures. J Manage Account Res 2003;15:193-223]. Two theoretical perspectives tie together these research streams. Cybernetic control theory explains how ERP systems offer the means by which managers can effectively use non-financial performance indicators, and agency theory describes how NFPI provide the motive and opportunity for managers to attend to key non-financial performance indicators. The research hypothesis tested herein asserts that the joint adoption of ERP and use of NFPI will yield greater corporate performance than either ERP or NFPI alone. In the current study, performance is reflected by return on assets (ROA) and stock returns (SR). Study results support the hypothesis, as archival data indicate that firms with both NFPI and ERP obtain significantly higher short-term and long-term ROA and SR than either ERP-only or NFPI-only firms. Research findings offer valuable insight into the theoretical and practical implications of jointly adopting the ERP and NFPI strategies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Agency theory focuses on monitoring and incentives as two solutions to agency problems. Prior research suggests that monitoring and incentives may act either as substitutes or as complements, and that the context of the agency relationship plays a major role in determining the direction of the relationship between them. In a corporate governance setting, we contend that board information and boards' usage of CEO control mechanisms are best viewed as complements. Thus, we hypothesize that boards' information gathering behaviour will be positively related to boards' usage of CEO control mechanisms. Using primary and secondary data from 149 US firms, we find that increases in boards' information gathering are associated with increases in boards' usage of managerial controls. These findings suggest that information and managerial control mechanisms act as complements in the governance context, and that boards take a variety of actions to protect the interests of shareholders.

This article classifies empirical research on vertical integration under four approaches - value-added-to-sales, qualitative-quantitative, input-output, and microanalytic. The emphasis here is on the microanalytic approach which has accumulated the most systematic evidence to support its theoretical propositions. In particular, this article emphasizes theoretical and empirical contributions from organizational economics (especially transaction costs and agency theories) for both vertical integration and (vertical) contracting. Limitations and methodological challenges concerning the empirical testing of theories of vertical integration are addressed and suggestions for further research are provided. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper uses the changing historical and theoretical frames within which management pay and investor claims are considered to provide a critique of the functionalist approach of agency and to develop an alternative, positional explanation of rewards. The first part of the paper draws on the contrast between the pre-1940 critique of the rentier and the post-1980 discursive construction of the shareholder to raise important contemporary questions about position and reward. The second part develops the idea of positional rewards to challenge agency assumptions by arguing that both giant firm managers and the less visible, though larger, group of intermediaries use their position to skim value. In contrast, the experience of position is more mixed for shareholders, who are generally passive value surfers. The final section of the paper argues that a renewed emphasis on position will enable a problem shift from value creation to value capture.

This article examines the conditions under which the principal-agent model is self-activating/socially causal. We do so by exploring a principal-agent framework that allows for the possibility that rational agents may hold intrinsic preferences for autonomy in decision making and experience disutility from being monitored. Using a dynamic model of preference formation, we identify conditions under which the principal-agent model is self-activating in that, over time, the introduction of the model in an otherwise efficient monitor-worker relationship leads to the inefficient adoption of the agency model. We also examine the extent to which the agency model is robust when autonomy-preferring agents are introduced into the population.

Departing from the usual debates regarding the superiority of one governance structure over another, this study aims to complement the prior institutional approach by addressing how a firm's internal governance, via board competence and managerial incentives, shapes innovation performance. In a sample of 178 Taiwanese firms in the high-tech industries, the study sets out to examine the innovation-enhancing effects of the firm-level governance arrangements prescribed by agency theory. The results show that the effective governance, characterised by vigilant control through a competent board and the incentives of managers through equity ownership, are conducive to the desired and valued outcomes of innovation by aligning the risk differential between principals and agents. This universal relationship is further extended to a contingency perspective that innovation can be more significantly achieved by managerial risk readiness through a tight coupling of internal governance and the correspondingly appropriate strategy profile. The findings stress that governance and a clear posture of differentiation in high-tech environments are, arguably, multiple bases on which innovation is sought.

Using data on all family owned firms listed on the Italian Stock Exchange for the entire period between 2001 and 2005, it is shown that agency theory prescriptions and monitoring activities differentially impact the market value and profitability of family owned firms. Specifically, nonfounder family firms benefit from a low level of board and insider stock ownership and a high level of stockholder and foreign investor ownership, because these firms necessarily face high agency costs. Conversely, founder family firms benefit from a high level of board and insider ownership, and a low level of stockholder and foreign investor ownership, owing to their lower agency costs.

Using panel data on 275 German exchange-listed companies I examine the relationship between founding-family ownership and firm performance. By separating the family effect from general blockholder effects, the paper shows that family firms are not only more profitable than widely-held firms but also outperform companies with other types of blockholders. However, the performance of family businesses is only better in firms in which the founding-family is still active either on the executive or the supervisory board. These findings suggest that family ownership is related to superior firm performance only under certain conditions. If families are just large shareholders without board representation, the performance of their companies is not distinguishable from other firms. In addition, the results indicate that other blockholders either affect firm performance adversely or have no detectable influence on performance measures. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on both economic and sociological theory, the effects of supervisory control and organizational support on the frequency and effort of individuals in contributing their personally held valuable knowledge to a "best practices-lessons learned, repository-based" knowledge management system (KMS) were compared. Supervisory control, as expected, had significant impact on frequency, but it also had unexpectedly significant influence on effort. When system variables-usefulness and ease of use-were controlled for, the organizational support measure had little effect on either outcome. These results provide greater support for economic-agency-theory motivators of knowledge sharing and lesser support for organizational support motivators than has been previously believed. They also emphasize the important impact of systems variables in motivating KMS use. Since the study was conducted in a government (joint civilian-military) organization, the organizational type may significantly influence the results. However, since the result is contrary to the conventional wisdom that suggests that a "knowledge-sharing culture" is all-important, at the very least, this study shows that the nature of the organization may moderate the relationship between the motivational approach and the outcomes.

We develop a conceptual model of the career horizon problem of CEOs approaching retirement and discuss its implications on firm risk taking, specifically in engagement in international acquisitions. Based on prospect theory and agency theory, we emphasize the legacy conservation and wealth preservation concerns of CEOs and investigate how their holdings of in-the-money unexercised options and firm equity accentuate or mitigate the career horizon problem. The model is tested in the context of international acquisitions with a sample of 293 U.S. firms over a five-year period (1995-1999). We find that a longer CEO career horizon is associated with a higher likelihood of international acquisitions. We also find that CEOs nearing retirement with high levels of in-the-money unexercised options and equity holdings are less likely to engage in international acquisitions than CEOs with low levels of in-the-money options and equity holdings. The study raises important considerations about the implications of CEOs ' equity and in-the-money option holdings on firm risk taking at various stages of their career horizon.

Foreign firms from emergent economies are increasingly seeking equity capital in developed economies like the United States. Utilizing institutional, signaling, and agency theories this research examines the legitimacy of foreign IPOs (initial public offerings) in the United States. Employing the population of foreign IPOs listed on U.S. stock exchanges between 1997 and 2004, it is demonstrated that firms from countries with governmental policies and institutional practices that protect the economic freedom of its citizens are significantly less underpriced than IPOs of firms originating from countries experiencing lower levels of economic freedom. The evidence further indicates that firms from emerging economies can overcome negative country perceptions associated with lower levels of legitimacy by increasing their international scope of operations prior to beginning the IPO process as well as by retaining acceptable levels of ownership in their respective firms.

Achieving competitive advantage through a broader consideration of stakeholders of the firm is examined. The inclusion of other significant organisational actors such as managers and employees as stakeholders capable of creating competitive strategic advantage for the firm is considered. Findings indicate that competitive advantage within an economic perspective may be garnered by establishing a broader conceptualisation of stakeholders of the firm. It is concluded employees may be characterised as hybrid stakeholders, as they are a mix of residual risk bearers and input suppliers of strategically highly relevant resources and that ways of articulating employee voice is a key element of gaining competitive advantage. The aim of this paper is to analyse internationally operating modern public corporations from an agency theory point of view with the focus on the role of a suite of stakeholders including shareholders, managers and employees. The economic reasoning demonstrates that the employees' voice is an important component of business from a strategic perspective irrespective of the type of institutional environment present in any given country.

Although the alignment effect of equity ownership is often studied with emphasis on changes in firm strategy, the exposure of CEOs' firm-specific wealth to firm risk is more easily controlled by changing their level of equity holdings than by changing firm strategic risk. We rely on prospect theory and the behavioral theory of the firm to examine the antecedents of CEO equity reduction and investigate whether it serves to decouple CEO wealth from firm risk. Given its central role in loss avoidance, we underline the effect of the firm's downside risk and distinguish the total loss potential on equity holdings from the loss potential due to firm-specific factors. Allowing for own-performance referents, we also consider firm performance and the value of a CEO's equity holdings in the analysis. Based on a sample of 208 U.S. CEOs for the years 1997-1999, we find empirical support for the role of downside risk and firm performance in CEO equity reductions. Implications on incentive alignment through equity ownership are presented. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

Agency theory has been the dominant framework for a theoretical conceptualization of corporate governance. According to this view, the governance problem of uncertainty about managerial behavior can be solved by assuming opportunistic behavior and setting up governance mechanisms to curtail opportunism. However, the adequacy of agency theory has recently been challenged because distrust-based governance mechanisms that are in line with the theory's recommendations have been ineffective to avoid managerial misconduct. Moreover, agency-based control and incentive systems have even been accused of being harmful. Stewardship theory has been proposed as an alternative approach. Building on a contrasting assumption about managerial behavior, this approach recommends trust-based governance designs that may, however, result in a one-sided and potentially disadvantageous system, too. On the basis of an in-depth analysis and critique of both theories this paper explores ways to either separate or combine the rival approaches. Due to shortcomings of these strategies a new perspective for the design of corporate governance systems is presented that opens the possibility of overcoming the theoretical tension.

Family businesses (FBs) play a key role in the world's economies. Unfortunately, the current literature surfaces disparate understandings and conclusions concerning their conduct and performance. Much of that literature falls under two insightful perspectives, agency theory and stewardship theory, that conflict quite directly. The agency view, based in economics, maintains that families will pursue utility for themselves to the detriment of their public shareholders. By contrast, stewardship proponents, arguing from a psychological perspective, suggest that family owners will invest deeply in their enterprise, to the benefit of all. This study synthesizes the literature on each of these perspectives to derive core motivational assumptions and expected organizational outcomes. Then, by employing a third sociological perspective, it proposes to reconcile these opposing views by considering the social embeddedness of firms and their key actors within the institution of the family for different types of public family enterprises. It will argue that there is a need for such integration in order to better understand and permit accurate, context-based predictions across various kinds of family businesses and family business situations.

Archaeologists make use of several different ontologies to research and develop theories about ancient technology. After briefly sketching out central features of mainstream (materialist) technovisions, this essay concentrates on recent ontological trends emphasizing the 'mutual becoming' of people and products. Symbolic and structuralist orientations enable archaeologists to 'see' something of the social values and cognitive structures shaping technological traditions in the deep past. As the question of gender has become an explicit topic of interest, archaeologists are able, at long last, to theorise about ancient technicians as thinking and feeling women and men. To appreciate ancient technology 'as if people mattered', I outline my own preferred ontology-grounded in phenomenology and agency theory. It argues that the ancient technician's body was a mindful, sensual, socially constituted and gendered being making sense of the world-and themself-by working through it. Chaine operatoire data on technical gestures and related strategic choices of artifact manufacture, use, and repair provide the necessary empirical and interpretive link between the making of personhood and the making and use of products within the (ancient) body politic.

The use of agency theory remains highly controversial among business ethicists. While some regard it as an essential tool for analyzing and understanding the recent spate of corporate ethics scandals, others argue that these scandals might not even have occurred had it not been for the widespread teaching of agency theory in business schools. This paper presents a qualified defense of agency theory against these charges, first by identifying the theoretical commitments that are essential to the theory (in order to distinguish between agency theory itself and certain incorrect interpretations that have been widely promulgated), and second, by specifying more clearly the different ways that agency theory can be used to analyze relations within the firm. The recommendation that follows from this analysis is that agency theory be used as a critical-diagnostic tool, to identify the points at which both firms and markets will be vulnerable to breakdown in the absence of moral constraint.

Why do small-business groups in developed countries exist? Research has shown the strong economic impact of business groups throughout the world but remains heavily focused on large-business groups and on emerging economies. Theoretical approaches to explain the existence of highly diversified business groups range from market power to the resource-based view and include market failure, transaction costs, agency theory, and cultural embeddedness. These approaches, however, are not very appropriate to explain the existence of small to medium-size firms in developed countries. What we know is that these smaller groups exist and that they are largely the outcome of related diversification. We investigate relatively small and young-business groups organized in a holding structure. What are the perceived benefits of this kind of group for entrepreneurs and how can we explain the phenomenon theoretically? Based on case study research, we argue that the small-business group is both the outcome and the antecedent of growth. It enables, and helps to realize and manage the growth of entrepreneurial firms. The enabling function consists in increasing reputation, attracting complementary resources that facilitate the exploitation of new opportunities, overcoming overembeddedness, and dealing with coopetition (concurrent cooperative and competitive relationships with another company). The group is also the outcome of realized internationalization and related diversification. Interestingly, for the emergence of the small-business group, just as important as diversification is the integration of activities as well as the separation of closely linked activities. Finally, the small-business group corresponds to an entrepreneurial management style. The main contribution of this article is to link organizational structure to the management and growth of entrepreneurial firms. (c) 2009 Baylor University.

Le Breton-Miller and Miller argue that as the family becomes more embedded in the firm, the firm's decision makers become more susceptible to influence by the family, and agency problems rise for outside investors. We contend that the family's embeddedness in the business does not, in itself, explain whether the assumptions of agency theory are warranted. Our commentary offers an alternative way in which outside investors might look at family firms' goals. Outsiders should assess the complementarity of the family firm's objectives with their own if they are to make rewarding investments in family firms. (c) 2009 Baylor University.

We propose a research agenda that can assist in developing a dynamic and comprehensive theory of boards of directors. It is based upon the concept of temporality, with time being organised around the life-cycle metaphor, and integrates research on agency theory, decision-making theory and resource dependence theory. We identify three key roles of boards of directors: 1) Monitoring and controlling top management 2) Involvement in strategic decision-making; and 3) Providing access to resources and networks. Our analysis suggests that boards perform all three roles, but that these roles change over time. We propose clear researchable questions for each stage of the organisational life cycle as well as the transition between the stages.

Management and organization literature has treated conflicts in numerous times and from various perspectives. Still, the theoretical literature holds different views about the essence of owner-manager relationship, including the view that the top manager and the owner are seen as subjects with different goals and interests. And these differences may cause conflicts created within this relationship. The research question here is about the subject of CSR as an enhancing factor in the deepening of special interests of the owners and the managers, as well as in emphasising their different roles. The in-depth interviews contained 60 questions and were recorded. With nearly all questions, two aspects were addressed: on the one hand, the difference between the periods 1995-1999 and 2000-2004, and on the other, between enterprises based on foreign and domestic capital. By the beginning of the former period - that is 1995 - the privatisation period in Estonia was predominantly over and the first legislative framework concerning the operation of corporations in the Western sense started to develop. The second turning point is represented by the year 2000, when the "purge" following the Asian and Russian crises presented new demands on economic activities and economic thinking as a whole. A total of 25 individuals were interviewed: 7 owners, 12 top managers and 6 of those who had been both as owners and top managers. This article concentrates on the results that concern the possible sources of conflict between the managers and the owners and their perception of social responsibility and the links between those questions. When summing up the opinions of the interviewees it should be admitted that the responses reflected the insignificance of the conflicts issue rather than their serious topicality. As the respondents remarked on several occasions, the existence of owner-manager conflicts is not considered normal or built-in; as the respondents added, this should not be considered such. Thus the claim of built-in conflicts in the owner-manager relations, derived from the agency theory (at least the classical agency theory) should be questioned according to the responses of the Estonian owners and managers. At the same time this does not mean that the responses coincide with the standpoints of stewardship theory, because the results of the interviews do not enable to make general conclusion that Estonian managers tend to act in the best interest of their principals. The results of the interviews lead us to conclude that the difference between the way top managers and owners understand ideas and activities is quite clearly presented in the context of social responsibility; despite the fact that the respondents usually do not admit the existence of conflicts when discussing them in general. When comparing the opinions of the owners and top managers about social responsibility, considering the theoretical literature, we may claim to certain extent that owners and managers have a different perception of social responsibility and this leads to the conflicts between them. To conclude, the authors present the understanding that the context of CSR brings out the conflicts between managers and owners more clearly, or even intensifies the conflicts between them. Results from an empirical study, undertaken in Estonia, are used.

There exists a gap in the literature available in the area of supply chain management (SCM) studies, on providing theoretical support for explaining the existence and the domain of SCM. This study, explores eight SCM theories and views for SCM studies: resource-based view, transaction cost theory, knowledge-based view, strategic choice theory, agency theory, institutional theory, systems theory, and network perspective. The main objective of this paper is to provide a framework for the developments of SC theories, and elaborate the possible ways that these theories can be applied to the case of Business to Business (B2B) e-Marketplace (EM) enabled supply chain. The case of EM is selected as one of the most recent collaborative tools in SCM studies and describes how the current SCM theories can be employed. (c) Common Ground.

Much of the literature on corporate acquisitions has focused on managerial incentives for making acquisitions but has underemphasized the role played by the social context of major shareholders. This study of Fortune 1000 firms argues that the priorities and risk preferences of family owners can have important implications not only for the volume but also for the diversifying nature of their acquisitions. Agency and family business perspectives are used to derive expectations concerning the acquisitions behavior of family owners. Consistent with both perspectives, and owners' desire to reduce business risk, we find that family ownership is inversely related to the number and dollar volume of acquisitions. However, whereas agency theorists differ about how ownership concentration influences whether acquisitions are diversified, the family firm literature is more definitive. The latter suggests that given family owners' desire to retain control of their firms for offspring, their wealth must remain concentrated. Hence they can most easily reduce the risk of their wealth portfolio by diversifying the business-that is, through diversifying acquisitions. Consistent with this logic, we found the propensity to make diversifying acquisitions to increase with the level of family ownership. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This research extends agency theory by exploring the influence of varied, competing, principal interests on executive actions. Findings reveal that ownership of a firm by dedicated institutional investors, who hold concentrated portfolios over time, is positively associated with firm use of strategic competitive actions. Ownership by transient institutional investors, who hold broad portfolios and make frequent trades based on current earnings, is negatively associated with strategic competitive actions and positively associated with tactical ones. Appreciable ownership of the same firm by these two classes of investors influences both strategic and tactical competitive actions. These results have broad implications for executives, investors, and policy makers. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

We provide an overview of the articles and commentaries devoted to theories of family enterprise in this special issue and link them to the concept of trust. Trust is a governance mechanism and theoretical construct of particular relevance for family firms, encapsulating some of their advantages and disadvantages. Trust is also linked to theoretical frameworks such as agency theory, stewardship theory, social capital theory, and transaction cost economics that are often used in family business studies, including those found in this special issue. Consequently, we advance trust as a bridging concept to reconcile and enhance our understanding of family firms as a unique organizational form. (c) 2010 Baylor University.

We argue that executives can affect firm outcomes only if they have influence over crucial decisions. This study explores the impact of CEO power or CEO dominance on bond ratings and yield spreads. We find that credit ratings are lower and yield spreads higher for firms whose CEOs have more decision-making power. To further investigate why bondholders are concerned about CEO power, we show that powerful CEOs tend to maintain an opaque information environment. Bondholders demand higher yields because it is difficult for them to monitor managers in firms with powerful CEOs. Taken together, the results suggest that bondholders perceive CEO power as a critical determinant of the cost of bond financing. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A wealth of research indicates that both executive characteristics and incentive compensation affect organizational outcomes, but the literatures within these two domains have followed distinct, separate paths. Our paper provides a framework for integrating these two perspectives. We introduce a new model that specifies how executive characteristics and incentives operate in tandem to influence strategic decisions and firm performance. We then illustrate our model by portraying how executive characteristics interact with a specific type of pay instrument- stock options-to affect executive behaviors and organizational outcomes. Focusing on three individual-level attributes (executive motives and drives, cognitive frame, and selfconfidence), we develop propositions detailing how executives will vary in their risk-taking behaviors in response to stock options. We further argue that stock options will amplify the implications of executive ability, such that option-heavy incentive schemes will increase the performance of talented executives but worsen the performance of low-ability executives. Our framework and propositions are meant to provide a starting point for future theorizing and empirical testing of the interactive effects of executive characteristics and incentive compensation on strategic decisions and organizational performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to better understand the antecedents of shareholder activism targeted at firms located in three common law countries (i.e., USA, UK, and Australia) and three civil law countries (Japan, Germany, and South Korea) during the 2003-07 time period. Research Findings/Insights: Our findings suggest that the antecedents of shareholder activism vary by the motivation of the activist. We demonstrate that activists target firms with two motives (a) to improve the financial performance, and (b) to improve the social performance of the firm. With respect to the target firm level antecedents, we find that firm size is unrelated to financial activism, but positively related to social activism; ownership concentration is negatively related to both financial and social activism; and prior profitability is negatively related to financial activism, but positively related to social activism. Further, these relationships in the case of financial activism are generally stronger in common law legal systems, whereas those in the case of social activism are generally stronger in environments with a greater level of income inequality. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings suggest that future research should differentiate between the motivations of the activism event. Further, we find that while agency logic works well for financial activism, institutional theory provides stronger explanations for social activism. Overall, we demonstrate the complementary nature of these two theories in explaining shareholder activism. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We found that the "exposure" to shareholder activism varies by the motivation of the activist, and the nature of the firm and its national context. An understanding of these issues would help firms develop proper response strategies to activism events. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Understanding the nature of family representation in public firms has been an important topic for entrepreneurship research. Because CEO compensation is a key tool that boards use to align the interests of shareholders and managers, researchers have taken steps toward understanding how family representation affects CEO compensation. Prior research has painted family-member CEOs as stewards who accept lower compensation. Based on agency theory, we describe a different scenario wherein family representatives engage in strategic control that reduces family-member CEOs' compensation. Thus, family-member CEOs accept lower compensation only when additional family members are represented in management or on the board. In comparison with CEOs at nonfamily firms, we find that family-member CEO compensation is 13% lower when multiple family members are involved, but 56% higher when the CEO is the lone family member.

We critique transformational leadership education in university business schools based on a literature review, a study of the websites of 21 leading business schools, and an analysis of two presentations to business school students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University by the former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. Our critique draws attention to the unresolved tension between two motivating ideas that underpin much teaching in business schools: collective interest ideas that permeate transformational leadership education; and self-interest ideas derived from agency theory. Transformational leadership tends to be depicted as a process by which leaders exert a 'top-down' influence over the activities of others, while simultaneously asserting that their organizations have a common purpose and pursue a collective interest. We highlight the risk that business schools are producing graduates who will attempt to appeal to common needs (guided by precepts of transformational leadership) but who will simultaneously enact contradictory performance management systems (guided by agency theory). We encourage business school educators in leadership to adopt approaches which are more critical, relational and reflexive. We suggest some general directions for an alternative leadership prospectus, based on followership, the promotion of critical upward communication within organizations, and the recognition of leadership as a contested, discursive and co-constructed phenomenon.

Much of the existing research in corporate governance has been directed at examining the consequences of board leadership structure on various organizational issues, with little to say about the determinants of this structure. By exploring either agency theory or stewardship theory, researchers provide contested conclusions regarding board leadership structure. The underlying premise of both theories is that 'one universal structure fits all'. However, the main argument of this paper is that the appropriate board leadership structure varies with some contextual variables and certain actors in a given environment. Econometric analysis demonstrates that board leadership structure varies with firm size, age and ownership structure. The implication of this result is that the assertion of both agency theory (CEO non-duality structure) and stewardship theory (CEO duality structure) may be valid under certain conditions. Thus, existing theories might need to be treated as complementary viewpoints, each of which draws upon a part of the whole picture, because depending on just one single perspective is more likely to result in misleading conclusions about the structure as a whole.

Agency theory offers a foundation for explaining the impact of project monitoring on project success. This study applied agency theory to survey 428 information systems project managers concerning their project monitoring, shirking by systems developers, and project success. Greater project monitoring via planning and meetings predicted less shirking, while greater monitoring via responsibilities and comparison did not. Less shirking via poor focus predicted increased project success, while less shirking via loafing did not. These findings have implications for project managers and project management researchers.

The question of the influence of ownership structure on corporate diversification strategy incites debate. Past research has led to controversial results whether it is based on agency theory, strategic approach or stewardship theory. We propose new empirical evidence by applying this question to the context of family businesses in France. We find that family businesses are more diversified than non-family businesses, which contradicts past results of studies based on US samples. This finding underlines the importance of considering the diversity of international contexts. Our analysis also shows that there is a negative relationship between the presence of a shareholder block and the level of diversification only for non-family businesses. This result emphasizes the particularity of family businesses in terms of the links between governance structure and business strategy. Furthermore, our results reveal that there is no difference between family and non-family businesses in terms of the choice of diversification type (related or unrelated). (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reports an analysis of whether state-owned enterprises (SOEs) increase their levels of corporate entrepreneurship after privatization. The study uses agency theory to discuss why SOEs display little entrepreneurial behavior and how privatization may alter this situation by changing firms' systems of controls and incentives. The study also uses a sample of Spanish firms for its empirical research. Data on these firms were available for three years before and after privatization. The findings show that corporate entrepreneurship increases after privatization when firms are in highly competitive industries, either because competition was greater after privatization or because the firm was already in a highly competitive industry. In summary, corporate entrepreneurship in privatized firms seems to be favored by two factors, a change of ownership and competition. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Tournament theory provides the basis for an assessment of the impact of pay disparity on performance. New evidence is provided regarding tournament theory by assessing two questions: (1) whether pay disparity leads to incentives for managers to engage in strategies that benefit the shareholders of the firm and (2) whether governance quality moderates the pay disparity-performance relationship, consistent with agency theory. Four measures of corporate governance are examined in order to assess governance's moderating role on the relationship between pay disparity and firm performance. The results suggest that while pay disparity can provide incentives for better performance, consistent with tournament theory, it can become destructive if it is reflective of agency conflict.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: We ask two research questions: (1) How do CEO stock ownership and options influence the amount of equity capital that a foreign firm raises in US capital markets? (2) How does the foreign firm's home-country risk moderate these relationships? Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we use a sample of firms from 40 countries that raised equity capital via ADR offerings between 1994 and 2005. Using a full-information maximum likelihood approach to estimate a model that accounts for sample selection associated with non-capital raising ADRs and non-listed ADRs, as well as hot and cold equity markets, we found that CEO stock and option ownership lead to a higher level of equity capital raised. Interestingly, the level of home-country risk of the issuing firm weakens the relationship between the CEO stock ownership and the amount of equity capital raised, but strengthens the relationship between CEO stock options and ADR equity capital raised. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We develop a framework that draws on behavioral decision making and agency theory to suggest that executive risk taking varies across countries and different forms of monitoring (stock ownership versus options) and that agents may exhibit risk-seeking as well as risk-averse behaviors. We also examined the potential corporate governance costs associated with principal-principal conflict as it relates to CEO stock-based compensation and the implications for raising equity capital. Because stock ownership and stock options have different risk profiles, and foreign firms operate in countries with different home-country risk, we theorize how home-country risk will moderate the relationship between CEO stock ownership or options with the amount of equity capital raised by a foreign firm in US stock markets through the issuance of American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that US investors pay attention to the types of stock-based executive compensation used by firms that raise capital in the US. In particular, CEOs of firms from higher risk countries need to consider US investors' perceptions of their stock-based compensation because it may hamper the firm's effectiveness in raising capital in the US.

Radical strategic change, a common event in high technology new ventures, presents a conflict between potential opportunity and the risk of departing from a planned and approved strategy. This study explores investors' perspectives regarding RSC in their portfolio companies, based on interviews of 13 private investors who are active venture capitalists or business angels. The study explores the investors' views based on three theories of VC-entrepreneur relationships: agency theory, stewardship theory and game theory. The findings indicate three approaches taken by investors: avoidance, expectation and passivity. Since the success of radical strategic change is critical to venture performance, it is suggested that investors adopt the expectation approach, which optimises the prisoner's dilemma inherent in the VC-entrepreneur relationship during such events. The findings of this exploratory study indicate the need for further research. (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

From the agency perspective, literature studying links between investor protection and governance profiles argues that family is more disposed than other shareholders to divert private benefits in countries with a poor legal framework: the question is empirically puzzling. From the stewardship perspective, the degree of familiness affects the stewardship attitude of the firm. We do not find that family firms perform worse or better than non-family counterparts. Some evidence is found as regards the entrenchment effect: family CEOs seem to weaken firm performance. Stewardship attitude - not familiness - does matter: moderate levels of stewardship improve performance and increase risk-taking.

There is controversy in the literature about the effects of ownership on strategy and performance. Some scholars have taken agency explanations as definitive, arguing that closely held firms outperform. Empirical studies, however, show conflicting findings for firms with concentrated ownership: lone founder firms outperform, family firms do not. Such conflicts may be due to the failure of agency theory to distinguish between the social contexts of these different types of owners. We argue that explanations of performance must take into account not simply ownership, but who are the owners or executives and how their social contexts may influence their strategic priorities. Family owners and CEOs, influenced by family stakeholders in the business, are argued to assume the role identities and logics of family nurturers and thus strategies of conservation. By contrast, lone founders, influenced by a wider set of market-oriented stakeholders, are argued to embrace the identities and logics of entrepreneurs and strategies of growth. Family founders and founder-executives are held to blend both orientations. These notions are supported in a study of Fortune 1000 companies. (c) 2010 The Authors.

This paper offers a new explanation of the gender pay gap in leadership positions by examining the relationship between managerial bonuses and company performance. Drawing on findings of gender studies, agency theory, and the leadership literature, we argue that the gender pay gap is a context-specific phenomenon that results partly from the fact that company performance has a moderating impact on pay inequalities. Employing a matched sample of 192 female and male executive directors of U.K.-listed firms, we corroborate the existence of the gender pay disparities in corporate boardrooms. In line with our theoretical predictions, we find that bonuses awarded to men are not only larger than those allocated to women, but also that managerial compensation of male executive directors is much more performance-sensitive than that of female executives. The contribution of attributional and expectancy-related dynamics to these patterns is highlighted in line with previous work on gender stereotypes and implicit leadership theories such as the romance of leadership. Gender differences in risk taking and confidence are also considered as potential explanations for the observed pay disparities. The implications of organizations' indifference to women's performance are examined in relation to issues surrounding the recognition and retention of female talent.

We employ agency theory to argue that the effects of family (and founder) ownership versus management will be quite different: the former is expected to contribute positively to performance, the latter is argued to erode performance. Previous studies, due to problems of multicollinearity have been unable to distinguish these effects. Using a Bayesian approach that avoids these problems, we find that whereas family and founder ownership are associated with superior performance, the results for family and even founder management are more ambiguous. Our study is the first to assess the distinctive performance effects of family and founder presence in both ownership and management using a Bayesian approach. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we examine whether the presence of a founder influences the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and company performance in a sample of European, publicly traded, family firms. Our findings contradict the widespread belief that smaller and more independent boards as well as nondual leadership structures always lead to better firm performance, suggesting that agency theory is limited in its explanation of the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. We find a positive effect of board size on business performance in nonfounder-led family firms and a negative effect of board size on founder-led family businesses. The presence of independent directors on the board has a positive effect on performance when a firm is run by its founder. However, when descendants lead the firm, the presence of independent directors has a negative effect on performance. Although the effect of board meetings on firm performance is positive, this relationship is weaker when the family business is run by its founder. Finally, CEO duality improves firm performance when descendants run the business, although CEO duality has no effect on performance when the firm is led by the founder. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper focuses on the relationship between one of the main corporate governance dimensions - ownership structure - and income smoothing. The paper investigates whether family-controlled companies differ from non-family-controlled companies with respect to income smoothing. Due to different incentives of management and owner investment horizons, we hypothesize that income smoothing is less likely among family-controlled companies than among non-family-controlled companies. Additionally, we hypothesize that among family-controlled firms income smoothing is less likely when CEO and Board Chairman are members of the controlling family. Various definitions of "family control" are applied. A sample of Italian listed companies is used for the empirical analysis. Research Findings/Insights: We find evidence that income smoothing is less likely among family-controlled companies than non-family-controlled companies. Moreover, among family-controlled companies, income smoothing is less likely for firms whose CEO and Board Chairman are members of the controlling family. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper fills a gap in the literature, suggesting that not only the level of ownership concentration or insider ownership but also the nature of the dominant shareholder (family versus non-family) should be considered when addressing the motivations for income smoothing. Furthermore, our findings indicate that agency theory and stewardship theory are complementary in explaining the role played by family control in income smoothing decisions. While in non-family-controlled companies the traditional owner-manager agency problems tend to prevail and motivate income smoothing, in family-controlled companies such agency issues become less relevant and a stewardship attitude emerges, rendering income smoothing less likely. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study is of interest to financial statement users, including analysts and investors, as it shows that different company types (e.g., family versus non-family) have a different attitude towards income smoothing. In particular, these results aid users in interpreting the company's reported profitability and its potential variability. The conclusions also are of interest to auditors when evaluating the reliability of the reported income of companies characterized by various ownership structures. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The paucity of research examining family firms engaged with franchising is surprising. We theorize about differences in franchising behavior between family and nonfamily firms and the relative advantages accruing to family firms in this context. We also explore how selection processes tend to lead to family franchisor/family franchisee matches that enable a more effective sharing of complementary resources. The theoretical framework we develop is grounded in the "familiness" of the family firm as suggested by the logic of the resource-based view. Additionally, our theoretical analysis extends and complements the frequent use of agency theory as the basis for studying franchising. (c) 2011 Baylor University.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Using insights from the upper echelon perspective and agency theory, this paper examines the effects of TMT characteristics on internationalization and the moderating effect of independent directors on the TMT characteristics - internationalization relationship. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a panel of listed firms in Taiwan, this study finds positive associations of TMT tenure and international experience and a negative association of TMT age with internationalization, supporting the upper echelon perspective. There is also some support for agency theory. The findings suggest that the positive relationships of TMT tenure and international experience with internationalization are stronger as more independent directors are included on the board, supporting the view that independent directors as monitors and resource providers may offer better advice and counsel to executives and enhance their strategic action capabilities in moving toward internationalization. However, the support for agency theory is limited, as this study finds no evidence of a moderating effect of independent directors on the relationship between TMT age and internationalization. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study contributes to corporate governance knowledge by bridging the gap in the relationship between TMT characteristics and internationalization via an empirical inquiry into the influence of independent directors on the TMT. Specifically, it reinforces the important role of the TMT in the strategic decision to internationalize and highlights the significant influence of independent directors on the TMT characteristics - internationalization relationship, expanding our understanding of the important strategic role of boards involved in TMTs' strategic action in a contextually appropriate manner. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that the board of a firm realizing that internationalization is a necessary strategy may consider choosing executives who are younger and have a longer tenure and more international experience in order to develop and execute international operations effectively. To improve board effectiveness and the quality of corporate governance, this study also demonstrates that a firm should include more independent directors on the board.

Agency theory stipulates that executives will use their superior information to exploit owners unless effectively monitored or incentivized to do otherwise: Agents here are held to be opportunists and owners responsible parties. However, sometimes agency theory misses the mark and the reverse holds true. It may be the owners who exploit their firm and compromise its long-term interests, and steward-like agents who use their superior information to benefit a firm and its stakeholders. This analysis provides an inspiring historical example of how that can happen and illustrates some conditions under which one might expect similarly happy circumstances to arise.

In developed markets including the United States, family-controlled firms, in particular founder-controlled firms, have been associated with higher firm performance than their nonfamily counterparts. Such family-controlled firms have concentrated ownership, which, according to agency theory, reduces agency costs and leads to superior firm value. Extant research, however, is not clear whether it is the family control or concentrated ownership that bestows the advantages that lead to enhanced firm performance. By examining different types of concentrated ownership, this study evaluates whether family ownership adds value beyond that provided by concentrated ownership. Based on analyses of panel data from the Indian corporate sector, we find that, in general, firms with concentrated ownership outperform firms with dispersed ownership. Surprisingly, and more importantly, however, we find there are no significant performance differences among family-controlled firms and firms controlled by either foreign corporations or the state. This result is consistent with the notion that concentrated ownership, not family control, is a key determinant of firm performance. (c) 2011 Strategic Management Society.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: Previous studies have reported the relationship between corporate governance and corporate liquidity (cash holdings). Factors affecting corporate governance, such as securities laws and control of corruption, should have bearing on corporate liquidity and its value. This study focuses on national-level predictors of cash holdings such as securities laws and control of corruption and examines their impact on corporate liquidity, as well as its value from the agency perspective.Research Findings/Insights: Using comprehensive data on 47 countries from 1996-2007, this study demonstrates that when benchmark variables are controlled, corporate liquidity is lower in countries with more effective securities laws or higher control of corruption. In addition, cash can increase firm value. This positive relation is more pronounced in countries with effective securities laws or high control of corruption. Furthermore, excess cash can reduce firm value in countries with ineffective securities laws or low control of corruption as opposed to other countries; however, this value-reducing effect can be mitigated or reversed when control of corruption or securities laws improve.Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study establishes that securities laws and control of corruption, in addition to the traditional cash determinants, play important roles in determining corporate liquidity and its value, and should therefore not be ignored in future liquidity studies. In addition, securities laws and control of corruption reinforce each other in the reduction of internal agency problems. Furthermore, this study provides empirical support for agency theory to explain corporate cash holdings.Practitioner/Policy Implications: Multinational firms should consider the potential impact of different securities laws and control of corruption of foreign countries in deciding the amount of cash to hold. Results suggest that firms should decrease target cash level in countries with more effective securities laws or higher control of corruption because investor protection is stronger, and the agency problem is less severe. In addition, excess cash should not be held in countries with ineffective securities laws or low control of corruption because these circumstances can reduce firm value, unless these countries substantially improve their control of corruption or securities laws. As for policy makers, caution has to be exercised when improving securities laws or repressing corruption; the concurrent improvement of both is more effective for stronger investor protection and better corporate governance.

This paper examines the interrelations among ownership, board and manager characteristics and firm performance in a sample of 54 firms listed at the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE). These governance characteristics, designed to minimize agency problems between principals and agents are operationalized in terms of ownership concentration, ownership identity, board effectiveness and managerial discretion. The typical ownership identities at the NSE are government, foreign, institutional, manager and diverse ownership forms. Firm performance is measured using Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Dividend Yield (DY). Using PPMC, Logistic Regression and Stepwise Regression, the paper presents evidence of significant positive relationship between foreign, insider, institutional and diverse ownership forms, and firm performance. However, the relationship between ownership concentration and government, and firm performance was significantly negative. The role of boards was found to be of very little value, mainly due to lack of adherence to board member selection criteria. The results also show significant positive relationship between managerial discretion and performance. Collectively, these results are consistent with pertinent literature with regard to the implications of government, foreign, manager (insider) and institutional ownership forms, but significantly differ concerning the effects of ownership concentration and diverse ownership on firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: This paper seeks to complement agency and stewardship perspectives regarding the governance of top managers by using insights from social categorization theory. Research Findings/Insights: This paper looks inside the black box of the control-performance relationship. We acknowledge that boards can positively influence organizational functioning by monitoring the top management team. However, we also argue that board control contains a hidden cost. The model we develop describes how control can highlight the distinction between principals and agents thereby causing the top management team to adopt a biased and less cooperative "us vs. them" orientation towards owners and their representatives. We contend this results in an increase in negative discretionary behavior and a decrease in positive discretionary behavior, which dampen the positive influence of control on firm performance. We also describe techniques for mitigating this unintended outcome of control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Agency and stewardship theories offer alternative views of human nature and provide divergent prescriptions for governance. This paper presents social categorization theory as a complementary lens emphasizing a situational and social view of human nature that helps explain top managers' discretionary behaviors that influence firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Ongoing governance scandals are costly illustrations of unchecked managerial opportunism. They demonstrate the need for vigilant control. A control approach to governance, however, does not consistently improve firm performance. This paper offers an explanation. It acknowledges that board control is necessary, while arguing that it can have unwanted side effects. We describe two tools (individualization and social recategorization) that can be used to ameliorate these effects. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

We examined CEO attributes, board composition, and ownership structure for their relationship to the share performance of the acquiring company around the acquisition announcement. Based on 273 acquisitions by Canadian firms from 1998 through 2002, we have shown that the levels of CEO and director ownership as well as the level of board independence were positively associated with the short-term financial performance of the acquirer. Board size was negatively related to value creation. Finally, cash-based deals and cross-border transactions were also positively related to increases in shareholder wealth for the acquirer.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to compare the governance structures of two distinctive governance forms&colon; the family firm and the leveraged buyout &lpar;LBO&rpar;. The paper also explores the relative performance of these two organizational forms over the course of the economic business cycle. Design&sol;methodology&sol;approachThe paper provides a theoretical treatment of the family firm and the LBO using the stewardship perspective and agency theory. The analysis anticipates the board structure for each organizational form and relates family firm and LBO governance to performance over the business cycle. FindingsFrom a conceptual treatment, the family&hyphen;owned concern exhibits board characteristics reflecting the longer&hyphen;term orientation of the firm, with boards empowered to include non&hyphen;economic, as well as economic, goals. LBOs are structured to maximize shareholder value over a shorter time horizon. LBOs may take advantage of expansionary environments whereas family firms may be better prepared for economic down&hyphen;cycles. Research limitations&sol;implicationsThe paper takes a holistic approach to contrasting two organizational forms that fit their respective theoretical frames and compares some of their more salient governance characteristics and performance over the business cycle. Practical implicationsManagers and boards can structure governance to manage the business cycle. Stakeholders can selectively engage firms that portray vital governance characteristics for their benefit and may also pressure boards and top management to make necessary governance improvements. Originality&sol;valueThe paper offers an introductory comparison between family firms and LBOs in terms of governance and managing the firm over the business cycle.

In this issue, Miller and Sardais challenge the established wisdom that agents are preordained to play costly villains in their contracts with shareholders in modern corporations. The key exhibit in support of their assertion is an angel agent in the form of Pierre Lefaucheux, the CEO of Regie Renault in early postwar France. Lefaucheux is shown to be a model agent, refreshingly free of the symptoms that afflict the archetypal economic agent of neoclassical agency theory. In this counterpoint, I provide a more restrained view of angel agents, question their wider presence and argue that one angel agent does not negate the overall theory of agency, and conclude by noting that the angel agent model has never really gained wide currency. Finally, I note that the inability of Renault to remain profitable in the late 1970s and the early 1980s raises questions about the longevity of programs left in place by well-intentioned angel agents.

The family firm preparing generational change, the partnership that welcomes new partners, and the shareholders of a firm that chooses to go public are making decisions that will have an impact on strategy and management. Conversely, a change in strategy such as a move to diversify or a decision to take on more risk in a business can make the firm more attractive to some shareholders and less attractive to others and is therefore not ownership neutral. Opening the black box of agency theory, Korine and Gomez show how management and ownership interact to shape the strategy of the firm. In their view, the critical question to ask is not what is the best strategy, but rather, who is the strategy for? With numerous detailed examples, Strong Managers, Strong Owners is an invaluable resource for company owners, board members and executives, as well as their advisors in strategy and governance.

This study investigates the impacts of family presence and board independence on corporate financial performance in 131 large listed firms from India, an emerging economy dominated by the presence of large business groups having concentrated ownership. Family presence includes the extent of family ownership and appointment of family CEO and family chairperson. Employing a multiple linear regression model, this study first detects a positive relationship between family ownership and financial performance. Second, a negative relationship is found between family CEO and firm performance, indicating that family firms with non-family CEOs perform better than firms having family CEOs. Third, the proportion of Board outsiders ' (i.e. independent non-family directors) is found to have no significant relation to financial performance, thus challenging agency theory's need for independent monitoring in family firms to enhance performance. These results are interpreted in the context of historical Indian family business practices and modern changes.

Family business researchers and practitioners have long been confused about the way of governing family managers in family firms, especially those under the influence of Chinese family culture. Agency theorists assume a self-interested nature of family managers and suggest imposing control mechanisms on them to improve performance. Stewardship theorists, however, believe a self-actualizing nature of family managers and argue against the use of control mechanisms. Based on a sample of 186 family businesses in China, this study investigates their ways of controlling family managers, and the effects of control mechanisms on firms' performance. Our results indicate that family business owners in China adopt a series of control mechanisms on their family managers, and obtain higher performance by doing so. The findings empirically validate the assumptions of agency theory in the context of Chinese family business, thus suggesting the existence of agency relationship between Chinese family business owners and their family managers.

The present work summarizes the theoretical foundations and empirical findings regarding the relation between family involvement and firm performance. From a theory-based perspective we integrate evolutionary psychology and agency theory and describe how conflicting predictions can be made regarding the relation between family involvement and firm performance. Similarly, we describe how the empirical landscape is equally conflicted. Findings from this meta-analysis summarize the observed effects from multiple studies and provide an estimate of the relation across the entire population. Results illustrated that family involvement did not significantly impact firms' financial performance (r= .006). Based on these data, there is no relation between family involvement and a firm's financial performance. Furthermore, we examined multiple conceptual and methodologically-based potential moderating influences-none was statistically significant. Overall, these findings provide the foundation for multiple new areas of inquiry as the domain of family business studies evolves. Moving forward, we advise future research in this area to search for additional moderator effects and explore the defining characteristics, other than performance, that make family businesses distinct from non-family businesses.

We challenge critics of agency theory who suggest that agency theory's value does not extend outside a narrow context dominated by egocentric agents seeking only to maximize wealth at the expense of the principal. Instead, we argue that agency theory's flexibility allows for its application to a variety of non-traditional settings where the key elements of agency theory, such as self-interest, information asymmetry, and the mechanisms used to control agency costs can vary beyond the narrow assumptions implied in traditional agency-based research. We suggest that extending agency theory to diverse settings using a deductive approach can be accomplished by formally recognizing and incorporating the institutional context surrounding principal-agent (P-A) relations into agency-based models. Thus, criticisms that agency theory fails to acknowledge the social context in which P-A relations occur provides not a barrier but an opportunity for extending our understanding of P-A relations to a variety of diverse contexts.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is two-fold: to examine two approaches buying firms can utilize to manage supplier quality; and to investigate the ways in which factors inherent in supply chain relationships affect the use of these approaches in supply chain quality management. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on agency theory, this paper proposes a conceptual framework that relates the underlying factors of a supply chain relationship to the use of quality management approaches. Two types of approaches, outcome-based and behavior-based, are discussed in terms of their focuses, purposes, and methods. Propositions are developed about the effects of these factors on the decisions buying firms make about supply chain quality management. Findings: This study suggests that rather than relying on one generic supply chain quality management approach for all suppliers, firms need to choose different management mechanisms for different suppliers based on the salient attributes of individual suppliers and their relationships with the buyers. Five types of agency-based factors are discussed. These factors - information asymmetry, goal conflict, risk aversion of suppliers, length of relationship, and task characteristics - can be expected to influence how firms design and manage their quality management systems for supply chains. Practical implications: A better understanding of the distinction between outcome-based and behavior-based approaches helps managers evaluate which approach is best suited to managing the quality of their suppliers. The propositions pertaining to the key factors provide managers with some guidelines about the critical conditions they should consider when building their firm's supply chain quality management system. Originality/value: Having an effective quality management system of a supply chain is essential for maintaining a smooth supply of high quality products and services to customers. However, little is known about how a firm should design this supply chain quality management system. The paper addresses this gap by applying agency theory to examine the two essential approaches to managing supplier quality and to explore the critical factors that should be taken into account when considering the appropriate approaches for different suppliers.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the issue of forced CEO turnover in China and summarizes the economic consequences of political connections within the framework of corporate governance. Research Findings/Insights: Using a large sample of listed firms in China from 2005 to 2008, we find that politically connected CEOs are less likely to be fired and that the sensitivity of forced turnover to firm performance is weaker for connected CEOs than for their non-connected peers. This suggests that CEOs in a transition economy tend to use their political resources for their own good. We also find a significantly positive relationship between the political connections of retained CEOs and future firm performance only when firm profitability is below the industry median. These findings suggest that the value of political connections is contingent on a firm's operating performance, and that the benefits of political connections may outweigh their costs when firms do not meet their profitability targets. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study is the first to examine how the political ties of CEOs relate to their forced turnover. It integrates agency theory with resource dependence theory and contributes to the ongoing debate on the role of political connections in emerging markets. It also takes a step toward reconciling the mixed evidence for the effects of political connections on firm performance by demonstrating a sharp difference between firms under different operating statuses. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers who are interested in improving corporate governance in transitional economies such as China, where CEOs have close connections with the government. It also provides a deep perspective for the boards in politically connected firms, allowing them to deal with the relationship between top management and the government in a healthy way.

We offer an institution-based view to the classic inquiry on the relationship between family business and firm performance, which has been dominated by traditional theories such as agency theory and the resource-based view. Specifically, we argue that institutions define family business characteristics such as ownership concentration and family management, and also affect the performance of family business. Our research contributes to a reconciliation of prior inconsistent findings and calls further attention to the embedded nature of family business in institutions.

Purpose: Recently, an increasing number of Internet users have begun to purchase various products, both secondhand and new, from online auction websites. However, some Internet users are still hesitant to purchase products from these websites. Moreover, the factors affecting male and female users' intention to shop on the websites may be different. Past studies have indicated that uncertainty is a major determinant of online shopping behaviors and may have different effects on men's and women's purchase intentions. Therefore, to explore the differences, this study seeks to propose a research model based on uncertainty and agency theory. Design/methodology/approach: This study included members of the Yahoo! and PChome online portal sites in Taiwan as research subjects. A web survey was conducted, and data were collected from a total of 313 bidders of online auctions. The casual model was validated using partial least squares (PLS) techniques. Findings: Gender moderated most of the relationships in the research model. The analysis results showed that the factors influencing men's and women's uncertainty are different. In addition, uncertainty has stronger influence on men's intention to purchase products from online auction websites. Practical implications: This study contributes to a theoretical understanding of the factors that promote men's and women's intention to purchase products from online auction websites. From a practical perspective, insights provided by this study can help online auction service providers understand buyers' concerns and eliminate the sources of the uncertainty. Originality/value: The primary value of this paper lies in providing a better understanding of male and female behaviors on online C2C market, and investigating the gender differences in the factors that influence the consumers' purchase in online auctions.

Although research on corporate entrepreneurship (CE) has attracted increasing attention, risks of CE are not well examined. In this paper, we examine direct and indirect agency risks associated with providing middle and operational managers with autonomy in the hopes of encouraging CE. The key ideas behind our discussion involve two dilemmas of CE. (1) To solve the risk-averseness problem of middle and operational managers and unleash their entrepreneurial ideas, top management needs to encourage autonomous behaviors, which can also exacerbate a different type of agency problem: opportunistic behaviors. (2) Although the generation of new ideas to explore new strategic directions and/or opportunities is important, the very newness of the ideas make them difficult to evaluate, and thus the selection process may be perceived as unfair by some managers. We propose that (a) stock options, (b) passive monitoring, and (c) perceived procedural justice would attenuate the negative side effects associated with CE, such as opportunistic behaviors and perceived unfairness. Although research in CE often stresses autonomy of middle and operational managers for new idea generation as important, examining the whole process in terms of idea generation, selection, and implementation with respect to potential risks will extend the CE literature.

Recent perspectives on community investments suggest that they are opportunities for firms to create value for shareholders and other stakeholders. However, many corporate managers are still influenced by a widely held belief that such investments erode profits and are therefore unjustifiable from an agency perspective. In this paper, we refine and test theory regarding countervailing forces that influence community-based firm performance. We hypothesize that high levels of available slack will be associated with higher community-based performance, but that this relationship will be moderated by three important governance variables: board independence, investment fund ownership, and CEO ownership. We find support for our hypotheses in longitudinal study of a large sample of U. S. corporations. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Family firms without able and willing family successors are frequently sold to non-family managers through management buy-outs (MBOs). Whether MBOs create value is thought to be dependent upon the ability to reduce owner-manager agency costs. In this article we examine the agency costs of MBOs that acquire family firms. We contribute to theory by arguing that in such situations, value creation by reducing agency costs will depend upon pre-MBO agency costs, the ability to solve the double agency problem, and the relationship between the cost of agency control mechanisms and the residual losses from opportunism before and after the MBO.

We use agency theory to explore how analyst coverage is influenced by the managerial entrenchment associated with the staggered board. The evidence suggests that firms with staggered boards attract significantly larger analyst following. We also document that firms with staggered boards experience less information asymmetry. Staggered boards insulate managers from the discipline of the takeover market. Entrenched managers are well-protected by the staggered board and have fewer incentives to conceal information, resulting in less information asymmetry. The more transparent information environment facilitates the analyst's job. As a consequence, more analysts are attracted to firms with staggered boards. We also document the beneficial role of analyst coverage in improving firm value. Our results confirm the notion that analysts, as information intermediaries, provide oversight over management and thus help alleviate agency conflicts. The positive effect of analyst coverage, however, is severely reduced when the firm has a staggered board in place. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into efficient entities has been an important approach in transition economies. However, the transition literature reveals little about how control structure affects firm performance of transformed SOEs. Drawing on agency theory, we distinguish three modes of control in transformed SOEs: state-controlled, dispersedly controlled, and privately controlled modes and argue that actual control after transformation plays a critical role in determining performance. Examining the impact of different control modes in China, we find that the key is who controls the transformed firm. Non-state-controlled (dispersedly controlled and privately controlled) firms are more likely to have enhanced post-transformation performance and reduced agency costs than state-controlled firms.

The "China concepts stock" in the U.S. has attracted a great deal of attention among international investors due to the fast growth in Chinese economy. This paper examines the aftermarket performance and the motivations to list in the U.S. for Chinese firms over 1993-2010 by considering the great impact of split-share structure reform in China. We find that the Chinese firms in the U.S. generally underperform the benchmark and industry peers in the post-IPO period of 3 years. The Chinese cross-listing ADRs show superior performance relative to the single-listings in the long run. It seems that more stringent listing requirements and accounting standards help to improve the corporate governance and operating performance of the Chinese firms. The evidence also supports that the Chinese issuers are motivated to cross-list in the U.S. due to over-investment incentives, leverage effects or free-cash-flow signaling, which is consistent with agency theory and signaling hypothesis.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates two questions: (1) What is the relationship between organizational complexity and auditor choice, and (2) Does auditor choice influence the relationship between organizational complexity and firm value? Research Findings/Insights: Examination of a sample of large public US companies reveals a positive association between auditor quality and various proxies for organizational complexity. We also find a positive association between organizational complexity and firm value when the complex firm hires Big N auditors. The results are robust to alternative measures of auditor quality and firm value and to controls for the regulatory environment. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The results extend the agency theory argument that agency costs resulting from information asymmetry between managers and investors affect the demand for external monitoring by auditors, specifically the demand by organizationally complex firms for higher quality audits. We also shed light on how the value enhancement of a complex organization depends on auditor quality. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings offer new perspectives for managers of complex firms that are industrially or geographically diversified. They can use the retention of a larger auditor as a credible signal that their consolidated reports are more informative about their financial performance. Further, the findings provide new insight into the value that investors place on auditor quality when they assess the value of firms with complex organizational structures.

This article analyses the appointments of outside directors to family firm boards within a sample of 423 observations (year/firm) regarding Italian publicly listed companies. The aim is to test predictions which suggest that efficient performance of control and service tasks by outside directors has positive effects on a company's capacity to raise capital and to grow. Unlike agency theory, which affirms that independents are efficient when performing functions of control, this article suggests that the adoption of outside directors who are also independent has no effect. The results of this research demonstrate that outside directors who have close ties with banks maintain valuable social capital with bankers in periods when such social capital is threatened by large investment policies requiring a great amount of bank financing.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

Research comparing family businesses and public companies has generally ignored the economic influence. We examine how public and family businesses fare in different economies. We argue that governance mechanisms may work for large public companies, but may not be suitable for family businesses. We find that during economic slowing down, family businesses tend to perform better than public companies because they have better control of their businesses and hence can make quick and decisive decisions. Another finding is that during economic upturn, duality is negatively related to company performance, however, that negative impact can be offset by family business status.

The purpose of this article is to review and systematize prior work on technological innovation in family firms and to open up an agenda to guide future research into this promising area. The study shows that family involvement has direct effects on innovation inputs (e.g., R&D expenditures), activities (e.g., leadership in new product development projects), and outputs (e.g., number of new products), as well as moderating effects on the relationships between these steps of technological innovation. The article uses theories applied in family business research (e.g., agency theory) to discuss opportunities for extending technological innovation frameworks by considering family involvement.

There has been much debate concerning the performance of family firms and the drivers of their performance. Some scholars have argued that family management is to blame when family firms go wrong; others claim that family management removes costly agency problems and encourages stewardship. Our thesis is that these disagreements can only be resolved by distinguishing among different types of family firms. We argue that family CEOs will outperform in smaller firms with more concentrated ownership and underperform in larger firms with more dispersed ownership; they will do neither where firms are smaller and ownership is more dispersed or firms are larger and ownership is more concentrated.

Despite increased attention given to family firms in the theory of organization and management, the value of family governance in emerging markets is not clearly understood. We draw insights from agency and institutional economics perspectives to address the debate on whether family governance fills or abuses the void left by weaker market and legal institutions. We propose a dual focus on the pattern of family control and weak institutions to reconcile these opposed assessments. We analyze how various combinations of family control over ownership, strategy, and operations yield different benefits and costs for the operational performance of firms in the absence of strong market and legal institutions. The uneven development of market institutions across industries and the impact of independent directors reinforce the importance of separating different patterns of family control. We find support for our hypotheses when tested on a data set consisting of all publicly listed firms in Taiwan between 1996 and 2005. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of family businesses in emerging markets, highlights the importance of weak institutions in shaping relative agency costs, and illuminates the differential effects of independent directors.

This article aims to increase our understanding of family firms' entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior by looking at the differences between family and nonfamily firms and by studying variations among family firms. We find empirical support for a positive influence of a nonfamily CEO on the family firm's level of entrepreneurial risk taking during the initial years of his or her CEO tenure and a leveling out of entrepreneurial risk taking as the CEO tenure of the nonfamily CEO is extended. We build on the concept of psychological ownership to explain these new findings. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

In this study we investigate how the dispersion of family ownership among family members affects the performance of small-to-medium-size family firms. Based on agency theory and prior research on family firms, we develop arguments pointing to the existence of a U-shaped relationship between the degree of family ownership dispersion and firm performance. We also consider the involvement of family members in top management as a moderating factor of this relationship. The empirical analyses conducted on 494 small-to-medium size private family firms in Italy support our hypotheses and offer further evidence about curvilinear relationships between family ownership and family involvement in management, and performance. Overall, our study represents a theoretical synthesis and extension of the effects of family involvement on the performance of small-to-medium size private firms. It adds empirical evidence to this stream of research, offers new insights into the sources of heterogeneity among the population of family firms, and paves the way for future investigations on other organizational outcomes, especially firm growth, in family firms.

This study examines the idiosyncratic manager-specific influence on corporate cash holdings. Although traditional economic theories such as trade-off theory, financial hierarchy theory and agency free cash flow theory have already contributed to a deeper understanding of corporate cash policy, we examine whether the integration of the Upper Echelons Theory (UET) into these traditional theories provides additional power in explaining corporate cash holdings. We contend that social, psychological and cognitive characteristics of CEOs, proxied by a number of CEO demographics, affect the level of importance that CEOs (and shareholders) attach to the economic arguments provided by the traditional theories, in turn affecting cash policy. We test our hypotheses using a sample of Belgian privately held SMEs. Controlling for the impact of traditional economic theories our findings suggest that older CEOs and CEOs without experience in other industries are more concerned with the precautionary motive of cash and less concerned with the opportunity cost of cash, giving rise to higher cash levels compared to younger CEOs and CEOs with other-industry experience. This indicates that cash policy in Belgian privately held SMEs reflects the natural tendencies of CEOs. Since cash policy affects shareholder value, it is important for stakeholders to consider the demographics of present or new CEOs and to understand their associated inclinations concerning cash policy.

Can internal corporate governance mechanisms (such as boards of directors) and external corporate governance mechanisms (such as institutional reform) promote risk-taking behavior in family firms? This paper argues that conflicts between majority and minority owners, known as principal-principal conflicts, and cronyism in the board of directors affect firm risk taking. Moreover, institutional corporate governance reform to appoint outside directors may not have an immediate effect on reducing these problems. Based on a sample of family firms in Taiwan, we find that outside directors reduce the negative relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking. However, when their influence is examined further, it is found that in those sample firms that went public after institutional reform, outside directors did not improve the relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking.

We present empirical evidence on traditional and family firm-specific determinants of cash holdings in the under-researched context of private family firms. We examine, from an agency theoretic perspective, how and to what extent the relation between family firm management and cash holdings is moderated by the ownership structure. Results reveal that descendant CEOs appear to maintain higher cash holdings than founder CEOs. This effect seems to be stronger if there is a low ownership dispersion. Moreover, outside CEOs maintain higher cash holdings than family CEOs if the family firm is owned by a single owner. (c) 2012 The Authors. Accounting and Finance (c) 2012 AFAANZ.

The philosophy of science offers two different perspectives on how empirical findings contribute to knowledge accumulation. The "law-statement" perspective interprets contributions to the extent that empirical research confirms or refutes general axioms of theory. Alternatively, the "model-theoretic" perspective recognizes contributions from models that improve scholars' ability to represent the world of managers. Management scholars often have limited awareness of the philosophical tradition underlying the model-theoretic perspective, and, consequently, useful contributions from improved models of important phenomena may be overlooked. Drawing on model-theoretic philosophy, we identify three ways in which empirical research contributes to theoretical knowledge without necessarily verifying or falsifying theoretical axioms, through the grafting, contextualizing, and repurposing of representational models. We provide examples of each by focusing on studies investigating incentive alignment. Finally, we discuss how the model-theoretic perspective contributes to an ongoing discussion about improving theoretical precision in management research. (c) Academy of Management Review 2013.

Practice-oriented publications have recently suggested a movement in the Chief Financial Officer's (CFO) role towards a more strategic role. In a family business, the CFO position is often the first into which a non-family manager is hired. However, the role of the non-family CFO in a family business is underresearched. Hence, this article uses previous findings as well as social role theory, agency theory, stewardship theory, and the resource-based view to investigate the role of the non-family CFO in family businesses compared to that in non-family businesses. Nine propositions are developed, which suggest not only a more traditional role for CFOs in family businesses, but also fewer monitoring efforts for the CFO in this setting. The article concludes with avenues for further research and concrete future research questions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the impact of family control on French acquirers' performance.We consider a sample of 239 acquisitions undertaken by French listed companies between January 1997 and December 2006. Comparing both, short-termand long-termperformance,we find that family-controlled firms outperformnon-family firms. We find that the relationship depends on the control level. The higher operating performance of family firms is statistically significant for an intermediate level of control. Around the announcement date, family firms with a high level of control outperform non-family firms. Using the calendar time approach, we find that long-term stock performance of family firms is positive and statistically significant. Robustness tests showthat our findings seem to not be driven by the endogeneity problem. Finally, we find that family wedge, due to the use of the pyramidal structure and the double voting rules, has no statistical significant effect. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study has extended existing research on CEO power, pay structure, and firm performance, offering models based mainly on agency theory and managerial power theory, and testing hypotheses using data from 112 companies across a five-year span (2001-2005) in computer-related industry groups in the United States. The results indicated that power from executive directorship positively impacts a firm's return on assets and return on equity, and that CEO power from duality negatively impacts CEO long-term pay and total pay, while CEO power from tenure positively impacts CEO long-term pay and pay leverage, and composite power negatively impacts short-term pay. Evidence for CEO pay as a mediator between CEO power and firm performance revealed that CEO short-term pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance but negatively impacts its market value, regardless of which source of power is being controlled. CEO total pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance, with power from CEO duality, directorship, or composite power being controlled. Hence, and in general, CEO pay fails to significantly mediate the relationships between CEO power and firm performance. The contributions include a multiple-perspective study of CEO power, compensation, and firm performance to comprehensively discover each of their respective relationships. This study has further extended the debate over agency perspectives with stewardship perspectives to fill knowledge and theoretical gaps. Thus, evidence-based findings provide boards of directors with practical knowledge for sound governance with another avenue for future research in corporate governance.

This article examines how ownership, management and governance characteristics and the associated agency problems of family firms impact the divestment decision. Based on the divestment activity of 48 listed family firms in Belgium over a six-year period, I find an inverse U-shaped relationship between family ownership and divestment likelihood, supporting the alignment view at medium levels of family ownership but entrenchment at high ownership levels. In addition to ownership, the governance of the family firm also impacts the divestment decision. Divestiture likelihood is significantly lower when the family exerts its influence through the board of directors, consistent with the entrenchment view that they will use their influence to pursue non-economic goals. Founders, on the other hand, act as active monitors of the firm's activities and do not seem to be hindered by emotional considerations which result in more divestment activity as compared to other family firms.

We propose that CEO compensation and tenure moderate the relationship between multinational corporations' (MNCs) R&D intensities and their percentages of equity ownership in international joint ventures (IJVs). Transaction cost economics (TCE) suggests a positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, but this relationship has not been confirmed consistently in prior research. We examine the moderating effects of CEO compensation and tenure on the relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, thereby bringing more nuanced explanations from agency theory and upper echelons theory into the discussion. Our proposed relationships were tested using a sample of 202 IJVs formed between U.S. MNCs and foreign partners in high-tech industries for the period 1993 to 2003. We found an overall positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and the percentage of equity ownership in IJVs. Moreover, CEO tenure and bonus compensation each weaken the positive R&D intensity-equity ownership relationship in our sample, while CEO stock options compensation amplifies it. These findings indicate that CEO compensation and tenure influence decision making about equity ownership in IJVs, suggesting that scholars and boards of directors should consider these CEO-related factors when evaluating strategic decisions regarding IJVs.

Family business success rests on implementing a governance system that recognizes a complex nexus of social relationships. While scholars have used existing frameworks such as agency theory to explore the effect of financial incentives on agent behavior and performance, they have not integrated perspectives from psychology and sociology in a way that fully addresses the challenges of effective family business governance. Our research advances current knowledge of governance in family business by examining the implications of accountability theory to explore differences in the perceptions of accountability between family and nonfamily executives as a result of family firm monitoring. We examine the elements and linkages that form the basis of accountability in the context of firm characteristics uniquely common to family business and that are influential in the development of perceptions between executives of contrasting family status. Potential contingencies to the family status-accountability relationship is also considered, as are the implications of effective monitoring for family firm performance. (c) 2013.

The behavioral agency model suggests family firms invest less in R&D than nonfamily firms to protect their socioemotional wealth. Studies support this contention but do not explain how family firms make R&D investments. We hypothesize that when performance exceeds aspirations, family firms manage socioemotional and economic objectives by making exploitative R&D investments that lead to more reliable and less risky sales levels. However, performance below aspirations leads to exploratory R&D investments that result in potentially higher but less reliable sales levels. Using a risk abatement model, our analyses of 847 firms over 10 years supports our hypotheses. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Family firms represent a globally dominant form of organization, yet they confront a steep challenge of finding and managing competent leaders. Sometimes, these leaders cannot be found within the owning family. To date we know little about the governance contexts under which non-family leaders thrive or founder. Guided by concepts from agency theory and behavioural agency theory, we examine the conditions of ownership and leadership that promote superior performance among non-family CEOs of family firms. Our analysis of 893 Italian family firms demonstrates that these leaders outperform when they are monitored by multiple major family owners as opposed to a single owner; they also outperform when they are not required to share power with co-CEOs who are family members, and who may be motivated by parochial family socioemotional priorities.N (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the direct effect of family ownership on innovation in emerging markets by using data from Indian family-controlled publicly listed firms as its sample. In particular, we study (1) the direct effects of family ownership on innovation and (2) the influences of business group affiliation on these family firms. Research Findings/Insights: Using an unbalanced panel of 395 Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) listed Indian firms during the years 2001 and 2008, we found that the impact of family ownership on innovation productivity is positive (after controlling for possible endogeneity). We further emphasized the business group affiliation of family firms and distinguished between the innovation activities of group-affiliated and stand-alone family firms. We found that affiliating with top 50 business groups increases the innovation activities of these family firms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Theoretically, we complement agency theory by incorporating both the institutional perspective and the external resourcing perspective to provide a more robust framework for examining the impact of family ownership on innovation in emerging markets. Methodologically, we adopted a more rigorous econometrics method by providing a panel analysis that used a system GMM estimator and addressed the endogeneity issue thoroughly, which represented a significant improvement over the shortcomings of the methodologies found in the existing literature. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings suggest that the Indian government should provide support for affiliating family firms with business groups while improving policies on information disclosures; it should also establish a proper corporate governance mechanism for private and public family business. The findings further suggest that a corporate governance code should encourage family firms to have an independent professional CEO. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

Family ownership has been recognized as an important determinant of corporate strategic choices; however, little research investigates the effects of family ownership and corporate governance on internationalization in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper utilizes agency theory and the resource-based view to analyze the relationships between family ownership, institutional ownership, and internationalization. Using a sample of Taiwanese SMEs, the finding of a positive family ownership-internationalization relationship suggests that family ownership may encourage internationalization. The interaction of family ownership and institutional ownership is positively related to internationalization, suggesting that SMEs with high family ownership are more likely to internationalize as institutional ownership increases.

Are restrictive covenants effective mechanisms in mitigating agency problems? Is the magnitude of the increase in the cost of debt due to agency problems non-trivial? We tackle these questions using a large dataset of public bonds. Contrary to the view that restrictive covenants in public bond contracts are standard boilerplates that serve little purpose, we find significant benefits in terms of reduction in the cost of debt associated with covenants. Restrictions on investment activities or issuance of higher priority claims reduce the cost of debt by about 35-75 basis points. These findings suggest that investors view bond covenants as important instruments in mitigating agency problems, and an increase in the cost of debt due to agency problems could be substantial. Additionally, we find that high growth firms and firms with low probability of default are less likely to include covenants suggesting that the costs of covenants outweigh benefits for these types of firms.

Extant theories agree that debt should inhibit diversification but predict opposing performance consequences. While agency theory predicts that debt should lead to higher performance for diversifying firms, transaction cost economics (TCE) predicts that more debt will lead to lower performance for firms expanding into new markets. Our empirical tests on a large sample of Japanese firms support TCE by showing that firms accrue higher returns from leveraging their resources and capabilities into new markets when managers are shielded from the rigors of the market governance of debt, particularly bond debt. Furthermore, we find that the detrimental effects of debt are exacerbated for R&D intensive firms and that debt is not necessarily harmful to firms that are either contracting or managing a stable portfolio of markets.

This study analyses the distribution of power among the several blockholders of a firm and the identity of those blockholders as a determinant of firm leverage. Using a sample of 694 firms from 12 Western European countries, our results support a negative relationship between ownership concentration in the hands of the main blockholder and firm leverage. Moreover, we detect that the presence of a second and third large shareholder (beyond the first blockholder) has a significant positive effect on the leverage ratio. In addition, the results show that contestability in family firms plays a more relevant role. Finally, we show that family firms do have significant impact on firm leverage level, and this impact varies depending on the legal framework and institutional environment. In our main sample the results show family firms negatively affect market leverage, supporting the theory that family firms are more averse to an increase in the debt level due to the risk of bankruptcy and financial distress as a result of having an under-diversified portfolio. In contrast, the opposite effect is found in the sample that excludes the United Kingdom. This last result cannot be explained by agency theory, given that family businesses are those that suffer less from Type I agency problems. This result suggests either some difficulty in financing their investments by issuing new equity or the need to use debt as a signal of the quality of its investments. Our results prove to be stable against a battery of robustness tests. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This study focuses on the relationship and identity changes within and between a project team and its organization following top management intervention in the context of a large international construction project. The study follows the project-as-practice orientation, examining the actions and behaviors of the project team through participant ethnography in the "praxis" of the project site over its entire duration. The longitudinal case allows the examination of the way the transition process established a new governance culture undermining the initial trust-based one and changed it from a virtual absence of mechanisms toward far more potent mechanisms of control, monitoring, and punishment. Simultaneously, the initial stewardship relationships and collectivist identity of the project team shifted toward agency relationships and individualistic identity. The triggers for the transformation process were identified as CEO succession, project failure, top management intervention driven changes in governance mechanisms, and perception of organizational betrayal of the project team.

We examine how CEO power affects the extent of analyst coverage. CEO power can influence a CEO's incentives to disclose information. The amount of information disclosed by the CEO in turn influences the information environment, which affects financial analysts' incentives to follow the firm. Consistent with this notion, we show that firms with powerful CEOs are covered by fewer analysts. In addition, the evidence shows that firms with more powerful CEOs experience less information asymmetry. Powerful CEOs are well insulated and have fewer incentives to conceal information, resulting in more transparency. The information provided to investors directly by the firm substitutes for the information in the analyst's report. As a result, the demand for analyst coverage is lower. Our results are important because they show that CEO power affects important corporate outcomes such as corporate transparency and analyst following. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Drawing from agency theory and socioemotional wealth considerations, we evaluate the extent post-IPO investment policy choices and their economic consequences differ for family firms relative to nonfamily firms. Our results suggest that family firms underinvest in post-IPO liquidity, total investment spending, and R&D expenditures, relative to similar non-family firms. On the other hand, family firms overinvest in capital spending and underinvest in acquisition spending relative to nonfamily firms with dispersed but not concentrated ownership structures. Furthermore, while increases in R&D spending decrease shareholder value in family firms, the reverse is the case with acquisition spending. (c) The Author(s) 2014.

The world-wide inflation in executive compensation in recent years has been accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of long-term incentives. This article demonstrates how the subjectively perceived value of long-term incentives is affected by risk aversion, uncertainty aversion, and time preferences. Based on a unique empirical study which involved collecting primary data on executive preferences from around the world, and using a theoretical framework which draws on behavioral agency theory, we conclude that, while long-term incentives are perceived by executives to be effective, they are not in fact an efficient form of reward, and that this outcome is not significantly affected by cross-cultural differences. We conjecture that boards of directors, acting on behalf of shareholders, increase the size of long-term incentive awards in order to compensate executives for the perceived loss of value when compared with less risky, more certain and more immediate forms of reward.

We examine leverage decisions in the context of national culture over the 1996-2010 period. Cultural characteristics can explain capital structure decisions from emerging-markets cross-listings. The results show that firms from countries with high Individualism and Indulgence employ more debt. Firms located in countries with high Power Distance, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Long-term Orientation are less leveraged. Additionally, Exchange-traded and capital-raising ADRs are more likely to be from countries with weaker corporate governance. Univariate tests show that capital-raising ADRs employ less debt relative to non-capital-raising ADRs, and notably, in the post-cross-listing period. Interestingly, the home country's cultural characteristics of capital-raising and exchange-traded ADRs exert less influence on their capital structure decisions. Our findings suggest that there is a value discount associated with increased firm leverage. Our insights have practical implications for portfolio managers attempting to enter emerging markets through the use of ADRs. Moreover, investors can evaluate the often neglected effect of cultural values into firm performance. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the determinants of board structure for Taiwanese firms by reviewing their board elections, held between 1991 and 2009. The paper emphasizes three factors: the distinction between insider-affiliated and non-insider-affiliated outside directors based on family relationships, governmental agency theory-based regulations, and the firm's choice between agency and stewardship governance philosophy. Evidence has shown that the proportion of non-insider-affiliated outsiders on the board is sensitive to changes in firm and CEO characteristics, and to changes in government regulations. Government regulations significantly shape corporate boards, encouraging a smaller size, more outside directors, and fewer insider-affiliated outside directors. For firms adopting agency and stewardship theories as governance arrangement, the determinants of board structure are diverse. The board structure of principal-steward firms is less susceptible to changes in firm characteristics but more susceptible to CEO influence, and more responsive to government regulations.

This study analyses whether or not the effect of board independence on a firm's strategic performance is moderated by family involvement in ownership and control. Moderation of the board's size and the independent director ratio are tested under quadratic specifications. The effect of CEO duality with family involvement on long-term sales growth is also measured. The empirical analysis is conducted in the Southern European context using a sample of publicly traded firms that have concentrated ownership structures. The main findings indicate that when nonlinearities are considered, family involvement moderates the relationship between the independent director ratio and firm performance. The optimal proportion of independent directors is lower in family businesses than in non-family ones. However, the results fail to support nonlinearities for board size. We find positive linear relationships between both board size and CEO duality with firm performance, which are not moderated by family involvement.

This research focuses on the relationship between corporate governance and performance in the largest European listed banks, which have been studied to a lesser extent within this field. The study is based on agency theory and we use a sample of 404 observations referring to 97 banks selected from the annual ranking of the 2,000 biggest companies in the world prepared by Forbes. The paper covers the period from 2006 to 2010, thus, examining the changes in the performance drivers in the recent financial crisis. On the basis of the panel data analysis, we confirm that the variety of governance factors including board size, insider appointed, directors' age, board meetings and affiliated committees influence the performance of the banks. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the effect of corporate governance on the financial performance of the financial companies in times of high capital market volatility.

This paper examines whether adaptation of standards to IFRS has converted Mexican GAAP into high. quality standards by increasing comparability with US GAAP and reducing earnings management We also question, according to Agency Theory, whether the differences between earnings reported by Mexican GAAP and US GAAP may be due to the opportunistic interpretation of Mexican standards by managers, rather than to differences between the accounting standards of both countries. Since the adaptation of Mexican GAAP to IFSS was initiated in 2005, using the Form 20-F of Mexican companies listed on NYSE during the period 1997-2008, we investigate whether accounting earnings of firms in the post-adaptation period exhibit more convergence and less management than in the pre-adaptation period. The results of our study suggest that efforts to converge accounting standards have increased comparability of accounting earnings. However, the adaptation to IFRS is not associated with lower levels of discretionary accruals. We also find that the choice of accounting method could be driven by opportunistic behaviour of managers. Based on our findings, we could conclude that managerial opportunism is a determinant of accounting choice decisions in cross-listed Mexican firms. (c) Vilnius University, 2002-2014.

Family governance is a typical governance structure in publicly traded firms in Taiwan and around the world. The founding family of a firm can choose direct ownership or a pyramidal ownership structure to achieve control over a publicly traded family business or a family business group. In addressing performance issues in family businesses, the family ownership structure could generate positive or negative impacts on performance. Thus, determining the contingent condition that will moderate the relationship between family ownership and performance is a key concern in family businesses. Utilizing longitudinal data in family businesses in Taiwan's personal computer industry, this study examines the relationships between the roles of professional managers on the board, the family ownership structure, and the firm's performance from agency theory viewpoint. The results indicate that the professional manager's position on the board will moderate the relationship between the family ownership structure and performance. Specifically, the professional managers serving as directors will enhance the positive impact from family direct ownership on performance and mitigate the negative performance impact from family pyramidal ownership. This study extends the principal-agent and principal-principal agency arguments by further considering the role of the professional manager's position in family businesses.

This study examines the relationship between cross-listing and managerial compensation of Chinese firms that concurrently issued A- and B-shares or A- and H-shares during 2001-2010. The results show that executive compensation is a positive factor to motivate Chinese A-share firms to cross-list as B- or H-shares; it implies that cross-listings could be employed as a way of asset appropriation at the managers' discretion. The results also confirm that corporate governance is important in determining cross-listings. Under the weak corporate governance institution, Chinese firms were chosen to cross-list based on political considerations rather than on economic merits, serving as a vehicle to signal the quality of state owned enterprises. The results are drawn on agency theory, signalling hypothesis and bonding hypothesis. (c) 2014 The Author(s).

Purpose - Stewardship theory is an emergent approach for explaining leadership behavior, challenging the assumptions of agency theory and its dominance in corporate governance literature. This study revisits the agency and stewardship theories by seeking to answer whether chief executive officers (CEOs) in China are committed stewards or opportunistic agents.
Practical implications - One size does not fit all. Leadership behaviors in China do not follow the agency assumptions inherent in Western practices, rather they favor the conditions of positive leadership expressed by the stewardship theory. Assuming that the motivations of managers in emerging markets such as China are similar to those in the West may lead to a poor fit between governance policies and the institutional context.
Design/methodology/approach - Based on 5,165 observations of 1,036 listed companies in China over the period 2005-2010, the results suggest that the corporate governance mechanisms developed from the agency theory in the West are not necessarily applicable in the Chinese context.
Findings - This study supports the stewardship theory in its findings that empowering CEOs through the practice of CEO duality and longer CEO tenure have a positive effect on firm value in China. Additionally, the positive relationships between CEO duality, CEO tenure and firm value are strengthened by the number of executive directors on the board, and weakened by the number of independent directors on the board.
Originality/value - As one of the few studies to connect the theoretical debate between the agency and stewardship theories, this study presents new evidence to support the stewardship theory, thereby strengthening its theoretical importance and relevance in corporate governance literature.

Compared to other transactions, corporate divestiture is characterized by greater ambiguity and lower transparency, which can be detrimental to stock market reaction. Drawing upon agency theory and information economics literature, this paper examines the relationship between information asymmetries, family ownership and the divestiture financial performance in Western European countries. Based on a sample of 115 Western European divestiture transactions carried out between 1996 and 2010, we find support for the assertion that information asymmetry impacts divestiture financial performance. We also show that the influence of information asymmetries is moderated by family ownership, which acts as a signal of divestiture quality.

This paper investigates the tax and agency explanations of corporate payout policy by investigating the likelihood, the level and the method of payout in founder and family firms. Controlling founders and families are both subject to the tax disadvantage of dividends arising from their substantial shareholdings, but family firms are arguably subject to more severe agency conflicts than founder firms due to their susceptibility to wasteful expenditure and the adverse effects of intra-family conflicts. Results indicate that founder firms on average are less likely and pay a lower level of dividends than family firms. Moreover, founder firms prefer share repurchase over dividends as the main method of payout whereas family firms prefer dividends over share repurchase. Overall, our findings are consistent with the agency explanation of corporate payout policy.

By complementing agency theory with behavioral assumptions, we explore the effects of family involvement on small and medium enterprises' (SMEs) performance. We identify three separate dimensions of family involvement and hypothesize nonlinear, direct, and interaction effects on the performance of an SME. The evidence on 787 SMEs suggests that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between family ownership and performance, and ownership dispersion among family members negatively affects performance. Balancing family and nonfamily members in the top management team (TMT) is found to be beneficial to SMEs' performance, but the family ratio in the TMT becomes crucial only at high levels of family ownership.

Family firms and business groups play an important role in many emerging economies. In this paper we study how different aspects of family involvement influence technological innovation in a firm. Arguments drawn from agency theory and particularly the principal-principal agency hypothesize a negative influence of family involvement with respect to technological innovation. In contrast, stewardship theory predicts a positive influence of family involvement on technological innovation. Drawing on these theoretical lenses with contrasting directionalities with regard to the impact of family involvement on technological innovation, we study how family involvement in ownership, management and board of directors, and business group affiliation influence R&D investments and patents obtained by the firm. The hypotheses are empirically tested on a seven-year panel of 172 firms from the pharmaceutical industry in India. Our results indicate that family shareholding and family control over both CEO and chairperson positions have a positive and significant influence on the firm's R&D investments, broadly lending support to stewardship theory. We also find a positive influence of business group affiliation on R&D investments and patents applied by the firm. Our conjecture is that the high technology opportunity environment in the Indian pharmaceutical industry facilitates stewardship behavior which in turn promotes innovation in these firms.

This paper revisits the influence of companies' financial factors on the extent of corporate environmental sustainability reporting (CESR) in an impressive sample of 3931 companies operating in 51 industries and 59 countries. A CESR composite index is constructed for each company that focuses on the G3 core environmental indicators from the Global Reporting Initiative because they are material for most organizations. In a methodological innovation, this study employs a quantile regression that unfolds certain interesting effects of financial drivers on the intensity of CESR that have not previously been revealed. Considering a combination of the main underlying theories of corporate sustainability reporting - legitimacy theory, agency theory, political costs theory, and signal theory - offers a better understanding of the complex structure of the dependencies found among factors such as company size, leverage, return on assets, research and development spending, market return and market capitalization, and commitment to environmental reporting.

To develop further insight into antecedents of the CEO's psychological orientation toward the firm, we investigate what might lead CEOs to identify with their firms. Although research suggests that CEO organizational identification can be quite consequential for the firm, little research attention has been paid to its determinants. To predict how the special context of the CEO position might lead to identification, we consider a set of motives that members have for identifying with their organizations and consider how unique features of the CEO position might be relevant to those motives. Our theory and supportive findings help explain how the context of the CEO position, including variables often conceptualized as control mechanisms in agency theory research, can have important effects on subsequent CEO organizational identification.

How do host country institutions influence the value of a firm's local resources? Using a novel dataset on the performance of 47 private equity (PE) firms in 49 emerging economies, we show evidence that the answer depends on the type of institution. Focusing on conditions at the time of initial investment, we find that PE firms with local origins and foreign PE firms with local experience performed better when contract enforcement institutions were weak than when they were strong. Financial development, in contrast, may have undermined the value of PE firm local origins. These results help reconcile contrasting findings on how host country institutions influence performance and lead us to contend that unbundling institutions is necessary for continued development of the institutions-based view.

We examine the effect of family control on IFRS mandatory disclosure levels, and the valuation implications of these disclosure levels, for Malaysian companies. We find that family control is related negatively to disclosure and that compliance levels are not value relevant. These findings suggest that agency theory predictions and theories linking common law legal systems to high quality financial reporting require refining in certain national contexts. Where Type 2 agency problems dominate, institutional arrangements intended to enhance financial reporting quality aimed at mitigating Type 1 problems in developed markets may have limited effect in less developed jurisdictions.

There remains a good deal of uncertainty as to whether and under which governance conditions family firms, even large, publicly traded ones, are entrepreneurial. We shall argue that agency theory, behavioral agency perspectives, and the resource-based view all posit both positive and negative influences regarding entrepreneurship in family firms, while empirical studies, collectively, are no less ambiguous in their findings. We use each of the above theories to propose various governance distinctions that can reconcile these contradictions and suggest when family firms will be most and least entrepreneurial.

Corporate political activity (CPA) is an important nonmarket strategy aimed at advancing a firm's interests by influencing public policy. Yet studies report mixed results as to the impact of CPA on firm outcomes. Building on recent extant research we suggest that one reason for the ambivalent evidence regarding the impact of CPA on firm performance is the moderating role of CEO discretion on the CPA-firm performance relationship. In a longitudinal study of S&P 1000 firms over 10 years, we test competing perspectives regarding the moderating impact of CEO discretion on the CPA-corporate performance relationship. We find that some aspects of CEO discretion, in particular CEO duality, moderate the relationship between CPA and performance. The findings provide some support for an agency view of the impact of CEO discretion the CPA-performance relationships, which carry implications for both scholarship and regulation in the areas of CPA and corporate governance.

Purpose - How family businesses (FBs) manage to survive in the long term is still not well understood in FB research. A promising concept to explain survivability, that is currently heavily discussed in the management literature is organizational ambidexterity (OA) - the ability to balance exploring and exploiting activities at the same time. However, FB research has not yet taken sufficient advantage of the potential of OA to contribute to explaining the ability of later-generation FBs to survive. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - Using central tenets of agency theory, this conceptual paper draws together findings from the FB literature and the OA literature to create a framework for the relationship between family involvement and the ability to reach high levels of OA. Findings - Seven propositions are developed which suggest that the level of family involvement in ownership and management affect the ability of later-generation FBs to reach high levels of OA. They further suggest that the number of family shareholders, the existence of majority family shareholders, and generational involvement of the controlling family in management moderate these relationships. Originality/value - This is the first paper to theoretically analyze OA in later-generation FBs. The seven propositions and avenues for further research presented in this paper are intended to motivate FB research to take a closer look at OA. This may be crucial to better explaining and predicting one of business-owning families' most important goals: the long-term survival of the FB. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747.

This article analyses founding family influence on pay-out policies for Swiss listed firms over the period 2003-2010. We hypothesise that family firms have different incentives and characteristics that affect pay-out decisions and propose three possible explanations: agency theory, reputation building and family income needs. Our results show that founding family firms display significantly higher dividend pay-outs relative to companies with other ownership structures. We also examine specific family characteristics and document that a family's stake, active involvement and generation play an important role in determining pay-out policies. Our findings appear to be consistent with the family income hypothesis and to some extent with reputational concerns. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Family business succession is a complex and challenging process, in which family members often build on the support of trusted advisors who can be seen as the most relied external source of advice and knowledge that family businesses draw on. Based on an extensive literature review, this article aims to synthesize prior research on both advisors and succession to systematically describe and analyze the role of trusted advisors during the succession-planning process. Based on arguments from agency theory, we discuss potential benefits and drawbacks associated with the involvement of trusted advisors along the four phases-trigger, preparation, selection, and training-of the succession-planning process and outline how trusted advisors can mitigate but also enhance agency costs-in particular goal divergence and information asymmetry-during each of these four phases. Subsequently, we discuss four typical constellations of advisor involvement, which vary in their agency costs and thus have different levels of bias and efficiency. We thereby outline several inefficiencies that result from the common setup in which an incumbent and a successor both rely on their own trusted advisors or a team of expert advisors and propose a balanced and efficient model of advisor involvement as a potential solution which reduces the agency costs. This conceptual article contributes to research on succession, agency theory, and trusted advisors in family firms. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose - While emotions and feelings arise in the singular personality, they may also develop a normative dimensionality in a plural agency. The authors identify the cybernetic systemic principles of how emotions might be normatively regulated and affect plural agency performance. The purpose of this paper is to develop a generic cultural socio-cognitive trait theory of plural affective agency (the emotional organization), involving interactive cognitive and affective traits, and these play a role within the contexts of Mergers and Acquisitions (M & A). Design/methodology/approach - The authors integrate James Gross' model of emotion regulation with the earlier work on normative personality in the context of Mindset Agency Theory. The agency is a socio-cognitive entity with attitude, and operates through traits that control thinking and decision making. These traits are epistemically independent and operate on a bipolar scale; with the alternate poles having an auxiliary function to each other - where the traits may take intermediary "balanced" states between the poles. Findings - Processes of affect regulation are supposed to go through three stages: first, identification (affective situation awareness); second, elaboration of affect is constituted through schemas of emotional feeling, which include emotion ideologies generating emotional responses to distinct contextual situations; third, execution: in the operative system primary emotions are assessed through operative intelligence for any adaptive information and the capacity to organize action; and turned into action, i.e. responses, through cultural feeling rules and socio-cultural display rules, conforming to emotion ideologies. Research limitations/implications - This new theory provides guidance for framing multilevel interaction where smaller collectives (as social systems) are embedded into larger social systems with a culture, an emotional climate and institutions. Thus, it is providing a generic theoretical frame for M & A analyses, where a smaller social unit (the acquired) is to be integrated into a larger social unit (the acquirer). Practical implications - Understanding interdependencies between cognition and emotion regulation is a prerequisite of managerial intelligence, which is at demand during M&A processes. While managerial intelligence may be grossly defined as the capacity of management to find an appropriate and fruitful balance between action and learning orientation of an organization, its affective equivalent is the capacity of management to find a fruitful balance between established emotion expression and learning alternate forms of emotion expression. Social implications - Understanding interdependencies between cognition and emotion is a prerequisite of social, cultural and emotional intelligence. The provided theory can be easily linked with empirical work on the emergence of a cultural climate of fear within societies. Thus, "Affective Agency Theory" also has a bearing for political systems' analysis, what, however, is beyond the scope of this paper. Originality/value - The paper builds on the recently developed Mindset Agency Theory, elaborating it through the introduction of the dimension of affect, where cognitive and affective traits interact and become responsible for patterns of behaviour. The model is providing a framework which links emotion expression and emotion regulation with cognitive analysis. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines how separation of cash flow and voting rights influences performance of firms affiliated with large family business groups. Complementing the dominant view grounded in agency theory, we suggest that the separation of cash flow and voting rights has positive influence on firm performance in the context of large family business groups. Research Findings/Insights: Using the data from the large family business groups in Korea, or Chaebols, between 2003 and 2010, we found that the separation is positively associated with firm accounting performance, but not with market performance. We also found that the effect of the separation is moderated by analyst coverage, R&D expenditure, and sales share in the business group. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study reveals that in the large family business groups, the context in which the separation most frequently occurs, the separation not only induces the controlling minority shareholders to pursue private benefits of control but also accompanies financing benefits from active use of the internal capital market. In addition, this study notes the importance of addressing the endogeneity in the analysis of the relation between ownership structure and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers planning to enforce/revoke the regulation on the separation of cash flow and voting rights in the pursuit of corporate governance reform especially in countries with poor shareholder protection.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: How do firm-level attributes and country-level institutions affect cross-national and firm-level differences in how minority owner rights in family firms are protected? Research Insights: We consider differences in family dynamics, stewardship-oriented organizational culture, and countries' legal and cultural dimensions to develop theory predicting differences in minority owner protection in family firms. We advance propositions and a model delineating the role of these key firm-level and country-level constructs. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We contribute to the literature in three ways: (1) We illustrate the importance of family dynamics for predicting the likelihood of a stewardship-oriented culture to emerge in a family firm; (2) our multi-level and cross-national approach extends earlier explanations of agency and stewardship that are centered at the firm, family, and individual levels of analysis; and (3) we consider the impact of cross-cultural dimensions on family firms, an area that has received limited attention in the literature. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research implies that individuals considering becoming a minority owner in a family firm should take into account not only the legal institutions of that country (which might not be as strong as they first seem) but also intra-firm family dynamics and the prevalent norms and values of the firm's national culture to get a more complete picture of the protections available to them.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Using agency theory and socioemotional wealth perspective as the theoretical framework, we evaluate the extent to which financing choices subsequent to going public and their economic consequences differ for family firms relative to non-family firms. Research Findings/Insights: Our results suggest that family firms maintain higher post-IPO leverage and longer debt maturity structure relative to non-family firms. Further, family firms raise less external capital subsequent to going public relative to non-family firms. The reluctance of family firms to raise post-IPO capital, however, results in higher investment sensitivity to internal cash flows and consequently inefficient investment. In addition, family firm financing choices differentially influence various facets of post-IPO performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study suggests that agency conflicts among firm stakeholders as well as socioemotional wealth considerations are important determinants of family firm financing behavior subsequent to going public. Further, ownership structure is an important determinant of the extent IPO firms capitalize on the opportunity to raise capital subsequent to going public to finance investments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results offer insights to entrepreneurs, managers, venture capitalists, and other capital market participants with regard to the link between firm ownership structure and the economic benefits of going public (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

We document three new facts about gender differences in executive compensation. First, female executives receive lower share of incentive pay in total compensation relative to males. This difference accounts for 93% of the gender gap in total pay. Second, the compensation of female executives displays lower pay-performance sensitivity. A $1 million dollar increase in firm value generates a $17,150 increase in firm-specific wealth for male executives and a $1,670 increase for females. Third, female executives are more exposed to bad firm performance and less exposed to good firm performance relative to male executives. We find no link between firm performance and the gender of top executives. We discuss evidence on differences in preferences and the cost of managerial effort by gender and examine the resulting predictions for the structure of compensation. We consider two paradigms for the pay-setting process, the efficient contracting model and the "managerial power" or skimming view. The efficient contracting model can explain the first two facts. Only the skimming view is consistent with the third fact. This suggests that the gender differentials in executive compensation may be inefficient. (c) 2015 Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Purpose - This study aims to examine the role the structure of corporate boards plays in the failure of the firm. Specifically, it examines whether the remuneration committee is related to corporate failure in the UK. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 failed and 269 non-failed UK-listed non-financial firms between the periods of 1994 and 2011. This study used pooled cross-sectional, fixed and random effects LOGIT models to estimate whether corporate failure is related to remuneration committee in the UK. Findings - The findings indicate that corporate failure is negatively related to the independence of the remuneration committee chairman and remuneration committee's effectiveness but not remuneration committee's presence, size and meetings. However, a positive and significant relationship was observed between corporate failure and remuneration committee independence. Practical implications - The findings of the study provide support for the appropriateness of agency theory as analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of remuneration committee, especially the independence of the remuneration committee chairperson, as a board monitoring device, in the context of corporate failure. Originality/value - The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance by establishing the likely causes of corporate failure in the UK. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Based on the assumptions of agency theory, family business researchers have often argued that family firms are less likely to use formal methods of monitoring and control than nonfamily firms. We explore the relationship between family firm status and presence of a written agreement among the owners, a formal measure of control. We hypothesize economic goals and perceived level of risk taking and management efficacy will mediate the relationship between family firm status and presence of a written agreement. Results indicate that the primary goal of the firm serves as a partial mediator of this relationship. (c) 2015 International Council for Small Business.

Purpose - This paper aims to explore the differing attitudes of salaried chief financial officers (CFOs) that can be associated with agency theory and stewardship theory. CFO attitudes are investigated because CFOs typically face additional agency conflict in their roles as overseers of the financial and accounting functions that are responsible for the production of numerical information used as a basis for incentive compensation. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative field study of 14 large privately held Austrian manufacturing companies was conducted. The findings rely on information retrieved from 18 semi-structured interviews conducted with individuals from these companies. Findings - The findings reveal a number of contextual factors that influence stewardship and agency attitudes of salaried CFOs. CFOs, who mainly report formally to owners, perceive more control in the hands of the owners. Short-term management appointments appear to facilitate agency-like behavior, whereas the existence of owner-managers and the typical CFO's maturity in terms of age and wealth seem to nurture stewardship behavior. Research limitations/implications - Further (quantitative) research is needed to corroborate the findings in this study, which are derived from a qualitative research approach. Further research on agency and stewardship behavior should also include the view of principal with respect to agent actions, as this paper shows that principal opinion strongly affects the way agents perceive control. Practical implications - The findings suggest that the behavior of company owners can influence and change a manager's agency or stewardship attitude. Owners who desire a culture of stewardship should set long-term goals and facilitate long-term management appointments. Moreover, owners can lower a manager's perceived level of owner control by adopting an active role in management. Originality/value - This paper is the first to analyze stewardship and agency attitude of salaried CFOs in privately held companies. It, therefore, adds to the current literature on the role of the CFO, as well as to the literature on governance issues in privately held firms. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Understanding the value the right chief executive officer selection and tenure choices can bring to an organisation is under researched in legal jurisdictions such as Australia where there is strong separation of the role of the chief executive officer and chairperson. The chief executive officer is the key organisation strategist and plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategy as well as keeping the board of directors informed of the work of the executive team. This paper reviews and synthesises the corporate governance literature to develop the argument that a chief executive officer's professional development background and work context will impact his or her ability to favourably influence organisation performance. A series of research propositions of interest to a range of stakeholders inside and outside the organisation are developed drawing on a number of corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory, stewardship theory). This conceptual paper develops a substantial future empirical research agenda. (c) 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

Former audit demand studies generally consider wholly family-owned private firms as a homogeneous group of firms that incur minimal agency costs. Family firm literature, however, argues that these firms might incur significant agency costs as well and we therefore examine audit demand in this particular type of firm. As we examine private family firms from the USA, which have no audit requirement, we broaden the concept of audit demand to the demand for auditor services, which encompasses audits, reviews and compilations. Consistent with former audit demand studies, we hypothesise a negative association between management ownership and the demand for auditor services, but only for first-generation private family firms. We hypothesise that this relation turns positive for subsequent generation private family firms due to entrenching behaviour caused by weakened altruistic feelings between the family shareholders. Our results support this hypothesis, but only regarding the demand for reviews and compilations. Therefore, our findings suggest that reviews and compilations seem to be sufficient and more cost-effective in this specific context to mitigate shareholder-manager agency costs compared to more expensive audits. Moreover, results suggest that the level of shareholder-debtholder agency costs do seem to be a driver for the demand for audits. (c) 2014 Taylor & Francis.

This study examines the moderation effects of corporate governance provisions on the link between family involvement (i.e., family ownership and family management) in publicly-traded firms and firm performance by drawing upon agency theory, with a focus on principal-principal agency issues, and the extant family governance literature. We develop and test the hypotheses on 386 of the S&P 500 firms longitudinally. Findings support the hypotheses suggesting the moderation effects of the use of provisions (a) protecting controlling owners in terms of their sustainability of controlling status, and (b) protecting management legally on the inverted U-shaped relationship between family ownership and firm performance. We also found support for the moderation effects of provisions (c) protecting controlling owners in terms of their voting rights, (d) protecting noncontrolling owners, and (e) protecting management monetarily on the inverted U-shaped relationship between family management and firm performance. By this, our study provides empirical support for the principal-principal agency perspective on the corporate governance in publicly-traded family firms. As such, it suggests new avenues of research for both the corporate governance literature, as well as for the theory of the family firm. Our study also offers insights to policy directed toward monitoring the actions of large shareholders such as family and enhancing the overall shareholder value in publicly-traded family firms.

The intellectual underpinning of much contemporary executive pay practice is to be found in agency theory, made famous by various scholars in the 1970s. Yet standard agency theory has been found wanting in various respect and has been criticised for supporting pay practices which may have contributed to the financial crisis. The Economic Psychology of Incentives proposes a revised theory of agency, drawing on ideas from behavioural economics and built on more robust assumptions about human behaviour than the standard principal-agent model. Incorporating evidence from a unique empirical study of executives from around the world, the book explains the mechanisms which link the performance of an individual senior executive, the performance of other executives who are part of the same top-management team, and corporate performance. The book proposes new design principles for executive pay, but also explains the difficulties in changing current executive pay practices. (c) Alexander Pepper 2015.

The impact of family ownership on strategic decision-making and diversifi cation in public corporations is an important but not clearly understood aspect of modern corporate governance. In many cases, large-block family owners of public corporations may have a great deal of input in strategic decision-making in large corporations. Previous literature investigates how ownership structure and diversifi cation are connected, but conclusions are not homogeneous. Agency theory suggests that professional managers are fundamentally self-interested, and the public corporation diversifi es because managers pursue their own interests, rather than the interest of shareholders. However in family fi rms, ownership and control use to coincide and family diversifi cation decisions which causes a lower diversifi cation. In this paper authors analyzes the impact of ownership concentration and the infl uence of ultimate owner's nature of business group (family or non-family) in diversifi cation's decision: specialization, related diversifi cation, unrelated diversifi cation and mixed diversifi cation (when a company uses both related and unrelated diversifi cation) Based on a sample of ninety-nine Spanish listed companies during the years 2000-2005, and using the listed company an their subsidiaries (pyramidal group) as unit of analysis, this research fi nds: fi rstly, the highest ownership concentration increases the adoption of specialization strategies and reduce the mixed diversifi cation; Secondly, attending to ultimate owner's nature, family fi rms adopt more strategies of specialization and related diversifi cation, and less diversifi cation strategies than nonfamily fi rms; Finally, results also show behaviour differences in family fi rms according to ownership concentration's degree: an increasing ownership concentration's degree in family fi rms rises the probability of diversifi cation.

This paper explores whether the performance of publicly-listed family-controlled firms in Malaysia is related to the extent of the families' ownership. It also explores whether there are any moderating effects from the various attributes of board independence on the ownership-performance relationship of these firms. The findings indicate that increasing families' ownership is related to better firm performance under the condition that the families do not have absolute ownership and control over their firms. However, giving more control via majority ownership that causes the families to become the only dominant party might enhance their ability to expropriate and cause firm performance to deteriorate. Therefore, proposal to increase ownership as a mean to reduce the classical agency-theory problems should be caveated under the principal-principal perspective. It is also found that the various board independence attributes do not exhibit any moderating influence on the family ownership-firm performance relationship. This finding may indicate the powerlessness of the boards of director in Malaysia when encountered with the influential controlling families whom the directorship tenures and opportunities of the non-family directors depend on. Decisions made by the controlling families which have bearing on firm performance may not have been effectively counter checked by the boards due to the lack of truly independent nature of the boards.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore product adoption beliefs and actions of a large retail food organization with both corporate-owned stores and privately held franchise stores. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used a case study approach involving survey data collection from 190 corporate-owned and licensed retail outlets that were members of a large, single organization. Ordinary least squares regression and mean differences (t-tests) were used to test the data. Findings were elaborated upon based upon structured interviews. Findings - Corporate-owned retail outlets invested heavily in food safety innovation, while franchised retail outlets pursued minimal investment to retain product flexibility. The level of adoption is contingent upon ownership structure, as well as institutional forces emanating from the corporate environment, the customer, and peer organizations. Research limitations/implications - The findings offer greater insight into methodological issues associated with measurement of new product adoption in particular. The authors have shown that it is critical for researchers to clarify the level of analysis of the study. Quantitative survey analysis revealed both safety and economic motivations to be desirable issues in product adoption considerations. However, when quantitative and qualitative results were combined, very different outcomes were realized as ownership structure differences appear to dominate product adoption decisions. Therefore, when conducting plural organizational form research, the data gathering efforts must be carefully undertaken to ensure that critical drivers of phenomena explored are not overlooked. Practical implications - Adoption of new product adoption involves the complex interplay between ownership structure/control, economic cost/benefit, managerial choice, and societal norms. Often, organizational research relating to adoption of new processes and innovations collects individual-level data. However, this study shows that adoption decisions occur at multiple levels and that the ownership/structural context must be considered. Social implications - The study has implications from social innovation/responsibility perspectives. Recent press regarding food safety has put pressure on food processing establishments to consider methods of reducing food safety breaches. No doubt, this has alerted the consumer to potential risks in food processing and influenced their preferences in favor of food safety innovations. Nonetheless, perceptions of the importance of "safety" can be interpreted in a variety of ways, leading to differingcourses of action. Interviews with corporate-level executives revealed that they preferred both corporate-owned and franchised retail outlets adopt case ready (CR) meats to stem safety concerns. Yet, this aspiration diffused throughout the organization differently. Originality/value - Multiple organizational structure forms operating within the same organizational entity, or "plural form" organizations, offer unique opportunities for examination. Applying various theoretical lenses, including agency theory, the resource-based theory, and institutional theory, the authors offer rationale for why different structural types within the same corporate entity may differ in their beliefs and actions concerning product safety, cost, and adoption.

A number of family business researches affirm benefits of family involvement to the business while some of other studies assure only detriments of family involvement. When comparative studies of family businesses begin to surface on the family involvement in business, there is that irritating question on what effect is brought about by family involvement to the business. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore business advantages and disadvantages generated by family involvement in businesses in Sri Lanka. The present study attempted to address the above knowledge gap, using qualitative research approach and multiple case studies as the strategy of inquiry. Purposive sampling technique was used to select both cases and respondents. Privately held, successfully conducted four family businesses were selected as cases and, existing business owner and one family related manager from each case were taken as respondents. Data was collected mainly via semi-structured, in depth interviews, observations, and secondary documents. Data collection from interviews consisted of 15 interviews with 09 different people from four cases. Before the data analysis, coding and categorization of respondents' views from interviews helped to identify common patterns and themes from both within the case and across cases. The analysis was carried out in the light of Agency Theory and resulted in a rich understanding of business advantages and disadvantages of family involvement in businesses in Sri Lanka. The findings of this study indicated that the agency cost is created not only on business matters but also on family matters. Further, findings revealed that agency benefit also can be obtained by family business by handling the family matters carefully in line with business matters. Findings of this study clearly indicated that an extension to Agency Theory is required to explain owner agent relationship in family businesses.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore post-acquisition compensation management and examine how the two most commonly used theories to explain CEO stock option exercise, agency theory and CEO overconfidence, expect CEOs to manage their stock options following an acquisition. Design/methodology/approach - Using logistic regression analysis, the authors investigate whether CEOs are more or less likely to exercise options following an acquisition, and the effect which CEO tenure and acquisition history may have on option exercise. Findings - The results suggest that CEOs are more likely to exercise options following an acquisition. The authors also find that CEO tenure and acquisition experience are both linked to an increase in option exercise. Research limitations/implications - The findings suggest that future research should expect agency effects to outweigh overconfidence effects when considering CEO stock option exercise behavior within the post-acquisition firm context. Practical implications - This paper advises directors and shareholders about whether agency concerns or overconfidence are of greater concern and how CEO tenure and past acquisition history may influence post-acquisition CEO stock option exercise behavior, offering information valuable in designing effective corporate governance. Originality/value - This paper is among the first to explore how CEOs manage their options following an acquisition and finds that CEOs are more likely to exercise stock options following an acquisition. Post-acquisition compensation management is an important, though overlooked, consideration in improving acquisition performance. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The objective of this work is to examine whether the adjustment of Mexican accounting standards to the IFRS has turned Mexican principles on this matter into better quality norms, increasing their comparability to the US GAAP and reducing tampering over results. At same time, we question if, according to the Agency Theory, the differences between accounting variables calculated under Mexican and American regulations may result from managers' opportunistic interpretation of Mexican standards, rather than from differences in accounting standards in both countries. Results suggest that all efforts to converge accounting standards have increased the comparability of the accounting results, although this convergence is also due to the opportunistic selection of accounting methods depending on different economic situations.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the influence of family character on the level and type of diversification,additionally considering the effect of ownership concentration that exists in family business. The studyuses a sample of 99 listed companies, parent companies of business groups, with business group beingconsidered as the unit of analysis (parent company and subsidiaries firms). The results show that familygroups have lower average levels of total diversification and unrelated diversification, and they showthe negative influence of family character in unrelated diversification level. The existence of a nonlinearU-shaped relationship between the level of diversification (total and unrelated) and the ownership con-centration in family group is also observed, thus confirming a different behavior depending on the capitalheld by the main shareholders. The results obtained provide new evidence for the academic literatureon family firms and business groups, as well as on the diversification strategies adopted by the familygroups. (c) 2014 AEDEM.

Agency theory draws attention to certain behaviors of CEOs and boards that, in aggregate, create losses for society. The empirical literature, however, characterized by contentious findings, suggests that the current form of agency theory is not supporting a clear understanding of these behaviors and their costs. We propose a change to one assumption, with potentially profound implications. Expanding on the assumption of narrow self-interest underlying agency theory, we apply an empirically wellestablished refinement that self-interest is bounded by norms of reciprocity and fairness. The resulting logic is that perceptions of fairness mediate the relationships derived from standard agency theory through positively and negatively reciprocal behaviors. This mediating variable provides a parsimonious new way to help explain extreme results found in prior studies. Rather than aiming to limit CEOs' self-serving behaviors, boards that apply these arguments improve social welfare by initiating positive reciprocity and avoiding unnecessary, welfare-reducing "revenge" behaviors.

Agency and stewardship theories are prominent perspectives to examine myriad issues within family firms. Although considered opposing theories, both address the same phenomena: the individual-level behaviors and firm-level governance mechanisms that predict organizational outcomes. Accordingly, we review and synthesize these theories concurrently, using the concepts of behavior and governance as our organizing framework. Our review encompasses 107 family firm articles grounded in agency and/or stewardship theory, published between 2000 and 2014 in 24 journals across several disciplines. Additionally, we identify future research areas that provide scholars opportunities to push theoretical boundaries and offer further insights into the family firm. (c) 2015, (c) The Author(s) 2015.

The ownership of corporations has been studied in multiple disciplines and using diverse theoretical frameworks for several decades. Despite a wealth of research, both research gaps and contradictory findings are common. This is partly due to the fragmentation of the foci of individual studies. We synthesize the work done to date through a content analysis of 145 articles and 523 effect size estimates. On the basis of this review, we develop an integrated perspective to understand how institutional, government, family, executive, and board ownership affect a variety of firm outcomes. We conclude by offering new theoretical and contextual directions to better understand the role of ownership in shaping firm outcomes. (c) 2016, (c) The Author(s) 2016.

We examine the unique nature of agency problems within publicly traded family firms by investigating the earnings management decision of dominant family owners relative to non-family. To do so, we draw upon literature demonstrating that family owners are loss averse with respect to the family's socioemotional wealth, or the affective endowment derived from firm ownership and control. Our theory and findings suggest that potential reputational consequences of earnings management lead family principals to engage in less of this practice relative to non-family firms, and that founder family firms are less likely than non-founder family firms to use earnings management. Moreover, the family-firm effect varies with the firm size, the degree of CEO entrenchment, and the firm's stock structure. We provide important insights regarding differences between family and non-family principals in the use of unethical accounting practices, thereby extending agency theory and advancing an underdeveloped research area.

Purpose - Theories develop over time and are influenced by both events and people. Looking primarily at the applications between contracting principal-agent relationships, the purpose of this paper is to explore how agency theory emerged from a number of economic and social developments. In doing so, the authors explain how this once dominant theory comes up short regarding varying realms of entrepreneurship as well as with multiple modern business phenomena. Design/methodology/approach - The authors first present a brief overview of agency theory. Second, the authors identify major events and people and address how they impacted the development of agency theory. Third, the authors provide insights on agency theory across three contexts (strategic entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, and family business). Implications, limitations, and future research directions are then offered. Findings - The authors provide a deeper understanding of agency theory, thus broadening its underpinnings and enabling readers to more readily understand why agency theory is limited in its explanation of certain and modern business phenomena. The authors find that some of the seminal influences to agency theory are quite dated which has limited its explanatory power in terms of the modern day business and with more recent disciplines such as entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications - The authors are limited by their choices of major events that influenced agency theory at the expense of not being able to include everything that may have impacted the theory over time. These limitations, however, are offset by the research implications. As the authors highlight the underpinning of agency theory, the authors subsequently provide scholars and practitioners with five primary boundary conditions, each of which are in need of attention for agency theory to maintain relevant explanatory power. Originality/value - A deeper understanding of agency theory can be gained by looking at its underpinnings. By presenting numerous principal-agent conflicts and demonstrating areas in which it has fallen short (i.e. entrepreneurship and more recent business phenomenon), we shed light on the obstacles agency theory must overcome in order to maintain its position as a prominent theory.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in the association among the board of directors, audit committee effectiveness and the cost of debt between the family- and non-family-owned companies in the Sultanate of Oman. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a panel data set that has multiple observations on the same economic units. Each element has two subscripts: the group identifier, i (68 companies listed on the Muscat Securities Market), and within the group index denoted by t, which identifies time (2005-2011). The regression model of this study is based on the random effects model, which, according to the Hausman and Breusch-Pagan (LM) (Breusch and Pagan, 1980) tests, is an appropriate model. Findings - This study finds that the association between a board of directors' effectiveness and cost of debt is negative and significant for the full sample and non-family firms. This relationship, however, is weak and not significant for family firms. Additionally, this study indicates that audit committee effectiveness has a significant effect on the cost of debt based on the full sample and family firms, but is not significant for non-family firms. Originality/value - This study examines firms in the Sultanate of Oman, where family ownership control is common. Based on a framework conceptualized according to the agency theory, using data from Oman enables a comparison between family and non-family firms with respect to the effect of the board of directors' and audit committee's characteristics as a composite measure. This composite measure captures their combined effect on the propensity of the cost of debt. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The management literature has devoted increased attention to nonmarket activities of firms, such as political involvement and social responsibility, including philanthropy. While these activities may be presumed to have the intent of improving the competitive position of firms or enhancing their reputation, firms have recently increased their support for or opposition to a wide array of politically charged social issues with no direct performance motivation. These "sociopolitical issues" are vastly different from corporate social responsibility and corporate political activities, as they are divisive, emotionally charged, and institutionally contested social issues. In this article, we explore sociopolitical issues and develop a distinct model that relies on multiple theoretical perspectives - agency theory and a push-versus-pull perspective of stakeholder theory - to provide complementary or at times competing explanations for firm involvement in such controversial issues. We also explore the contexts (or facilitating institutional environments) that enable management to get involved in sociopolitical issues. In addition to drawing attention to this growing phenomenon, the article provides guidelines for future research on corporate participation in politically charged social issues.

This article examines the relationship between long-term orientation, family involvement in the top management team (TMT), and family firm performance. On the basis of agency and stewardship theory, we propose that the inclusion of family members in the TMT only enhances firm performance if it induces a long-term orientation among management. An empirical analysis involving 201 privately owned family firms from Germany supports our theory that a long-term orientation helps align family and organizational goals. As such, it represents an important mediator that links family involvement in the TMT to performance. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Entrepreneurial universities are a catalyst for regional economic development and growth. Yet, the entrepreneurial university may not always capture the full gains made by the broader economy due to opportunistic behavior by its faculty scientists. We expand agency theory to address conditions when opportunistic behavior persists in the face of substantial information symmetry and where principals appear to tolerate opportunism despite the authority to sanction their agents. Using a sample of 105 US research universities and 73,603 scientists, we demonstrate that some scientists privately leak discoveries invented while working for their universities. Counter to prior prediction, we find that universities acting as principals often do not retaliate even when having knowledge of such opportunistic behavior and the capability to punish non-complying agents. To extend theory, we examined contexts that exacerbate and alleviate such overt opportunism: High-value discoveries and sizable entrepreneurial activity are associated with greater opportunistic behavior, whereas efforts to empower those who have close professional ties with scientists--their departments and technology commercialization offices--are related to reduced opportunism. To complement our empirical analyses, we provide a stylized mathematical model that shows how agency theory can improve its predictive power once it formally recognizes certain conditions under which agents wield substantial bargaining power over their principals, who in turn seem to tolerate agents' overt opportunistic behavior.

Product-harm crises are ubiquitous in today's marketplace. Prior research has explored the negative consequences associated with these crises and highlighted effective crisis management strategies. Limited attention, however, has been devoted to exploring the antecedents of such crises. The authors use agency theory to explore corporate governance and top management team (TMT) characteristics that impact firms' likelihood of experiencing a product-harm crisis. They argue that family firms, firms with higher levels of managerial ownership, and firms in which the marketing function has a higher influence in the TMT are likely to exhibit a higher strategic emphasis on product quality. Strategic product-quality emphasis, in turn, mediates these firms' lower likelihood of encountering a product-harm crisis. An analysis of 116 S&P 500 firms across 2006-2011 provides considerable support for the authors' arguments. These results have important implications for practitioners and for scholars working in the areas of innovation, family business, and corporate governance. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to employ agency theory to identify the determinants of the audit delay among Palestinian companies listed on Palestine Stock Exchange (PSE). Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the agency theory, eight hypotheses are tested using data collected from the year 2011 annual reports for all the 46 listed companies on PSE. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the influence of a set of company characteristics, ownership structure variables, and corporate governance mechanisms. Findings - The result of the analysis demonstrated that the audit reporting delay is influenced by the board size, corporate size, status of audit firm, company complexity, existence of audit committee, and ownership dispersion. Research limitations/implications - The main shortcoming of the current study is that the analysis covered the Palestinian companies' annual reports for only one year. A time series analysis might give fuller and understandable picture about the audit report lag (ARL) determinants.

In the public sector, the strategic quest for IT-based innovation often starts by hiring a successful private sector CIO and hoping his or her prior experience will transfer. However this often ignores the existence and influence of other entities and IT governance structures that form the innovation ecosystem. Applying the legal view of agency theory to the U.S. state innovation ecosystem and using a crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (csQCA) approach, we investigate factors that are associated with public sector IT-based innovation. We find that CIO characteristics, structural oversight mechanisms, CIO relationships with authorities, and the state environment combine to form configurations that lead to both high and low performance.

The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between corporate performance and corporate governance by companies listed on the Palestinian Stock Exchange. Accounting and market performance measures were used to proxy corporate performance. Corporate governance represented by the board of directors' size, the frequency of the annual meetings of the board, existence or otherwise of an audit committee, institutional investors ownership and foreign ownership. To achieve the objective of the study, all non-financial companies listed on the exchange and published their annual reports during the period between 2010 and 2012 were used. The result of the analysis revealed that corporate performance is negatively associated with corporate governance. This implies that the result is inconsistent with agency theory. This might be due to the fact that corporate governance in Palestine is still at its infancy stage. Copyright (c) 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study analyses the effects of agency conflict between "active family owners" (who participate in firm management) and "passive family owners" (who do not do so) on the performance in unlisted Spanish family firms wholly owned by family members. We employ agency theory to argue that ownership concentration by active family owners and governance mechanisms (direct control by passive family owners, existence of board of directors, and family governance mechanisms) improve the firm performance and that this effect intensifies in later-generation firms. Our findings show that family managers' ownership and family governance mechanisms have a positive influence on the performance in second- and later-generation firms. The results also show a positive effect of direct control by passive family owners over active family owners in second- and later-generation firms. However, the existence of a board of directors is not related to family firms' performance. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

This study incorporates insights from both institutional and family socioemotional wealth perspectives with agency theory to examine the relationships among governance practices, family ownership, and information disclosure quality. Employing a sample of 516 publicly listed firms in Taiwan over a period of 5 years (2006-2010), we found that high levels of board independence and board activity have a significant positive effect on disclosure quality. Further, family ownership positively moderated the relationship between board independence and disclosure quality. This relationship is stronger with a higher level of family ownership. The results support the institutional proposition that family-owned firms that pursue socioemotional wealth are more likely to promote information transparency to gain legitimacy and enhance their reputations with outside stakeholders.

CEO succession is a key theoretical and empirical issue in the fields of organizations and strategic management. Previous studies investigating the influences and effects of CEO succession mostly focus on post-succession contexts. This study focuses on the pre-succession context and offers a comprehensive theoretical framework based on agency theory and stewardship theory. Specifically, this study empirically tests the influence of several pre-succession factors on the founding CEO's decision to either sell the family firm or hire a professional manager as a successor. The results show that executive compensation schemes and industry dynamism separately influence the degree of stewardship through perceived pay premium and industrial growth potential. The findings help explain CEO succession decision-making in family firms, and provide empirical evidence for the incentive mechanisms between executive compensation schemes, industry dynamism, and professional managers' stewardship behaviors. This study broadens agency theory, stewardship theory, and upper echelons theory's explanation of CEO succession decision-making in family firms. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Based on Upper Echelons Theory and Agency Theory, we explore the effect of CEOs' power through their tenure, board committee membership and other corporate governance factors on idiosyncratic volatility. Our study addresses the gap in the literature to find the direct link between the source of corporate governance practices and idiosyncratic volatility in stock price. We use a generalised method of moments in a panel analysis of Australian firms for 2004-2013 and a robust model that controls for firm size, firm age, trading volume, market-to-book ratio, dividend payout, the global financial crisis, product market competition and financial intermediaries. We find that CEOs who have stronger managerial power are associated with lower idiosyncratic volatility. This determining factor remains significant with the inclusion of widely-researched firm characteristics and external factors on idiosyncratic volatility in our robust analysis.

This study extends the family firm performance literature by focusing on birth order differences among descendant CEOs. Data collected from a sample of Korean family firms yield three insights. First, descendant birth order is directly associated with differences in the distribution of control through ownership, leadership (i.e., CEO), and the incorporation of outside board participation and governance. Second, descendant birth order also moderates the relationship between outside block holdings and firm performance. Third, we find evidence suggesting that because of firm performance differences, first-son descendant CEOs may find themselves more often replaced over time. (c) 2016, (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study makes use of a large multi-country sample to examine how the market performance of family firms is affected by national context. Research Findings/Insights: We find that Tobin's Q among family firms is significantly lower than that of non-family firms across 33 countries. In examining these effects, results suggest that legal context and national culture influence the performance implications of publicly traded family firms, serving to mitigate some of the generally negative impact. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We find that national context is an important contingency in determining the family's ability and willingness to exploit minority shareholder wealth. Building upon our results, future research can focus on how formal and informal institutions may be substitutes for each other. Our results help explain why prior empirical research provides conflicting results regarding the impact of family governance on firm valuation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings suggest that the performance implications of family firms are contingent on legal protections, belief in the impartiality of the legal system, and culture. Given wide variations in these measures across countries, the appropriate mechanisms to strengthen investor protection will not follow a one-size fits all approach. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by examining relations between family involvement and CEO compensation. Using a panel of 362 small U.S. listed firms, we analyze how founding families influence firm performance through option portfolio price sensitivity. Consistent with the dual agency framework, we find that family firms have lower CEO incentive pay, which is further reduced by higher executive ownership. Interestingly, such incentive pay offsets the positive impact that families have on firm valuation. Collectively, our results show that, compared with nonfamily firms, lower incentive pay adopted by family firms due to lower agency costs mitigates the direct effect of family involvement on firm performance. Once accounting for CEO incentive pay, we do not observe performance differences between family and nonfamily firms. (c) 2016 International Council for Small Business

Recent studies have criticized MBA programs for their association with self-serving behavior, although there is little empirical research to establish the firm-level consequences of that relationship. We explored whether MBAs versus non-MBAs in a sample of celebrated CEOs of major U.S. companies--thus CEOs who have achieved and had opportunity to exploit their fame--were more apt than their counterparts to engage in self-serving behavior that benefits them but disadvantages their companies. We assessed this behavior via the pursuit of costly growth strategies, an inability to sustain performance, and the capacity to obtain superior private benefits in compensation. Our analysis of 444 star CEOs celebrated on the covers of major business publications confirmed that an MBA education either fosters or is related to such behavior among these executives.

Recent analyses of U.S. public family firms (PFFs) show that family firms outperform other forms of organization. However, scholars call for more studies to determine why PFFs outperform the market. High performance work systems (HPWSs) reflect the extent to which an organization adopts and implements a strategic approach in HRM practices and could be why PFFs outperform. Using the stewardship perspective, agency theory, and the resource-based view of the firm, this study empirically examines the relationship among family governance oversight, HPWS, and performance at PFFs. Using a sample of 159 Taiwanese public firms, the empirical results indicate that independent directors on the board and the level of family member board participation associate with HPWS adoption. Adopting HPWS also mediates the effect of independent directors and subjective firm performance. This finding has both theoretical and practical implications. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Borrowing from agency theory and using a sample of 145 entrepreneurs, this study contributes to entrepreneurship literature by providing a fine-grained explanation about how a decision-making mechanism such as decentralization influences the relationship between family involvement and innovativeness, and risk taking of family firms. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the importance of considering heterogeneity of family firms and the focal role of decentralization in spurring up firm-level entrepreneurship.

Purpose: Although the concepts of family business, internationalization, and agency theory have received some attention in the relevant literature, these concepts and theories have been used independently. The purpose of this paper is to help close the gap between what is known and what needs to be known about the decision-making processes of internationalization of family managers (FM) and non-family managers (NFMs). Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyzes the story of Busscar, a Brazilian firm that began internationalization under an FM and ended it under an NFM. The management transition took place suddenly, as the family CEO died in a tragic accident, and the company appointed an NFM to replace him virtually overnight. These circumstances, as well as the fact that Busscar accelerated its internationalization process after the transition only to go bankrupt a few years later makes this case critical. Findings: The paper concludes that under NFMs, the speed and scope of the firm internationalization processes were accelerated and the financial risks were augmented, which is in line with the agency theory hypothesis and contradicts suggestions that NFMs tend to be more structured. Research limitations/implications: Many researchers argue that it is important to professionalize the management of family firms. It is expected that an NFM leads to a more structured strategy. The study shows otherwise; changing the manager leads to opportunistic internationalization using emerging strategies rather than deliberate ones. Originality/value: This study suggests that firms, networks, entrepreneurship, and ownership are not the only important variables. Manager origin (inside or outside the family) can change everything.

Purpose: Research disputes whether family businesses are more or less innovative than their nonfamily counterparts. So far, no consistent results have been achieved. The recently introduced willingness and ability framework suggest that idiosyncratic behavior is only to be expected if both sufficiency conditions - willingness and ability - are fulfilled. The purpose of this paper is to test this hypothesis empirically. Design/methodology/approach: A large cross-sectional sample of German small- and medium-sized enterprises is used. The sample offers - alongside numerous moderators commonly used in innovation research - several family firm definitions. Given the censored nature of the endogenous variable chosen, a Tobit model is used. Findings: Drawing upon agency theory and the ability and willingness paradox in family firm innovation, it finds family firms to be less innovative only if both willingness and ability conditions are fulfilled. Originality/value: To the best of the knowledge, the study provides the first attempt to test the willingness and ability theorem. Therefore, the commonly used family firm-specific measures (self-assessment-, ownership-, and management criterion) are operationalized to better understand swwhat drives innovativeness in family firms. The findings thus add to the ongoing discussion on what really drives family impact on firm-level decisions. (c) 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study investigates the association between investment decisions and financial reporting quality in the context of family firms versus non-family firms. Building on the classic agency theory and the behavioral agency theory, we argue that financial reporting quality may play a different role on investment decisions for family and non-family firms. We address our research question by using a sample of listed firms in Taiwan from 1996 to 2011. Consistent with the behavioral agency theory, our findings suggest that family firms are more likely to under-invest than non-family firms in order to protect their socioemotional wealth, and financial reporting quality is more negatively associated with family firms' under-investment behavior. The existence of internal financing channels attenuates this negative association. However, this study does not find a significant role on such association when a family member serves as the chief executive officer. These results are robust after controlling for the potential endogeneity issue of financial reporting quality, alternate measures of inefficient investment as well as internal financing channels, family firm subsample, and different industry groups. This study contributes to the literature on the relation between financial reporting quality and investment decisions by highlighting the unique characteristics of family firms.

With the aim of achieving an advanced understanding of current research on unrelated diversification and providing fruitful groundwork to foster active interchange between disciplinary traditions, this paper detects articles from two relevant research streams; i.e., strategic management and financial economics. We first provide a brief overview of management thinking on unrelated diversification strategy. Then, we present a conceptual map that offers a comprehensive appreciation of unrelated diversification strategy antecedents (i.e., environmental and institutional, organizational value-enhancing, and managerial drivers), implementation process (i.e., managerial complexity, misallocation of resources, and structural inertia), and consequences (i.e., diversification premiums and discounts). Finally, we unpack the major gaps in our current knowledge that may help refocus the research agenda on unrelated diversification strategy and revamp the apparent waning proclivity of this issue.

Whereas the agency theory predicts that dual-class shares decrease firm performance, the stewardship theory predicts that dual-class shares increase firm performance. The cumulative findings on the performance consequences of dual-class shares have been weak and/or inconclusive. Because endogeneity is a constant challenge in empirical corporate governance studies, this study uses a unique law change in Switzerland as a source of exogenous variation in the fraction of firms with dual-class shares. Controlling for firm fixed effects and time-varying confounders, we find that dual-class shares neither harm nor benefit firm performance on average. However, dual-class shares increase firm performance if the firm requires external finance and dual-class shares decrease firm performance if the firm does not require external finance. External financing needs mitigate the agency costs between controlling and minority shareholders and create a context in which dual-class shares facilitate firm-specific investments instead of private perquisites. The study's results have both managerial and policy implications. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Blockholders impact strategic firm decisions because they are better at monitoring managers than dispersed shareholder groups. Nevertheless, we do not sufficiently understand how preferences of different blockholder types impact strategic firm decisions. We discuss this in the context of takeover premiums offered for publicly listed firms. Prior studies have argued that managers are often tempted to offer excessively high premiums. Consistently, blockholders might better control managers and ensure lower premiums. To better understand the impact of blockholder preferences, we focus on the special case of family firms. Specifically, drawing on the behavioral agency model, we hypothesize that bidders with family blockholders offer lower premiums than bidders with other blockholders or bidders without blockholders. Our empirical results support our hypotheses based on a sample of 149 takeover offers. (c) 2015, (c) The Author(s) 2015.

This article builds on the agency-stewardship approach to examine if the impact of related and unrelated diversification strategies on firm performance is contingent on the leadership style of diversifying Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) ranging from the agent model to the steward model. For this purpose, it proposes four hypotheses which are empirically tested using data from a sample of 183 Spanish firms. The findings provide new insights about the relevance of CEOs' leadership style so that a right fit between diversification type and executive leadership style seems to be crucial for firms pursuing growth and profitability benefits.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the possible trade-off between accountability and enterprise in the context of comply or explain governance. The issue was addressed through examining the effect of compliance with the corporate governance code (CGC) on corporate entrepreneurship (CE) and organisational performance. Design/methodology/approach: Based on cross-sectional survey and content analysis of annual reports, the level of CE and compliance with the CGC were measured in the large and medium-listed companies in the UK during 2010. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used for data analysis. Findings: The results suggest no conflict between compliance with the CGC and CE in the UK, which can be attributed to the flexibility of the "comply or explain" approach. This implies that no trade-off between accountability and enterprise in the context of comply or explain governance. Practical implications: The study provides evidence in support of the regulatory governance framework in the UK and the comply or explain approach at large. This evidence contributes to the debate on the rules-based or principles-based governance, which may affect future CG regulations. It can also guide the directors to achieve the balance between their conformance and performance roles. Originality/value: The study bridges the gap between CG and CE disciplines through developing a theoretical model that integrate contingency and agency theories lenses. Adopting a holistic approach provides insights into the relationships between CG and CE, rather than investigating the effect of each of these practices separately on organisational performance.

Based on the Behavioral Agency Theory and the socio-emotional wealth model proposed by Berrone, Cruz & Gomez-Mejia (2012), this work focuses on measuring and validating the model and its relationship to family firm's results. It also analyzes some characteristics such as size and age of the family businesses to determine their influence on the relation between socioemotional wealth and family firm's results. Unlike other studies, an empirical study was made in private family firms (not listed in the stock market). The study suggests that family firm's outcomes are positively related to socioemotional wealth. Furthermore, the 5 dimensions model of socioemotional wealth is valid but requires adjustments in some dimensions. (c) 2016, Allied Academies. All rights reserved.

Agency theory and socio-emotional wealth theory are central when explaining family firm advantages. However, research has not uncovered the extent to which reasoning from these two theories can also explain family firm advantages linked to the homeland production mode. This paper addresses this issue, building on the above-mentioned theories through an illustrative single case study of the family firm Weibel Scientific. The case study stresses that characteristics of family firms can be exploited in the homeland production mode and lead to reduced agency costs and social capital benefits. Furthermore, the case study highlights that there are important aspects to consider regarding the way in which these characteristics affect agency costs and social capital, and how these effects are influenced by the production locational mode. From this, it is concluded that arguments from agency theory and socio-emotional wealth theory can explain family firm advantages associated with the homeland production mode.

In the last decade, the interest for the study of ownership structure as a determinant of diversification arises. However, there is a lack of researches that analyze the influence of the nature of the ultimate owner in the level and type of diversification. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to analyze the diversification strategies used by the main Spanish business groups whose parent company is listed on the stock markets, and to study the differences between family and non-family business groups, considering in these last, the type of ultimate owner. In the study a sample of ninety-nine listed companies is used, where companies that constitute the business group are identified. In the paper are used as econometric methodologies the binomial logistic models and panel data models. The results show that family nature of business group positively influences in specialization and related diversification and negatively on unrelated diversification. Family groups differ most form those non-family groups where there is not a reference shareholder than can exercise effective control and ownership dispersion is higher, the groups referred as "non effective control". The research allows further analysis of differences between family and non-family groups, considering the nature of the ultimate owner for non-family groups.

Managerial risk taking is a critical aspect of strategic management. To improve competitive advantage and performance, managers need to take risks, often in an uncertain environment. Formal economic assumptions of risk taking suggest that if the expected values for two strategies are similar but one is a greater gamble (uncertain), managers will choose the strategy with a more certain outcome. Based on these assumptions, agency theory assumes that top managers should be compensated or monitored to achieve better outcomes. We review the theory and research on agency theory and managerial risk taking along with theories that challenge this basic assumption about risk taking: the behavioral theory of the firm, prospect theory, the behavioral agency model and the related socioemotional wealth perspective, and upper echelons theory. We contribute to the literature by reviewing and suggesting research opportunities within and across these theories to develop a comprehensive research agenda on managerial risk taking.

We show that firms with younger CEOs are more likely to experience stock price crashes, including crashes caused by revelation of negative news in the form of breaks in strings of consecutive earnings increases. Such strings are accompanied by large increases in CEO compensation that do not dissipate with crashes. These findings suggest that CEOs have financial incentives to hoard bad news earlier in their career, which increases future crashes. This negative impact of CEO age effect is strongest in the presence of managerial discretion. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of CEO age for firm policies and outcomes.

Research summary: Agency theory suggests that external governance mechanisms (e.g., activist owners, the market for corporate control, securities analysts) can deter managers from acting opportunistically. Using cognitive evaluation theory, we argue that powerful expectations imposed by external governance can impinge on top managers' feelings of autonomy and crowd out their intrinsic motivation, potentially leading to financial fraud. Our findings indicate that external pressure from activist owners, the market for corporate control, and securities analysts increases managers' likelihood of financial fraud. Our study considers external governance from a top manager's perspective and questions one of agency theory's foundational tenets: that external pressure imposed on managers reduces the potential for moral hazard. Managerial summary: Many of us are familiar with stories about top managers "cooking the books" in one way or another. As a result, companies and regulatory bodies often implement strict controls to try to prevent financial fraud. However, cognitive evaluation theory describes how those external controls could actually have the opposite of their intended effect because they rob managers of their intrinsic motivation for behaving appropriately. We find this to be the case. When top managers face more stringent external control mechanisms, in the form of activist shareholders, the threat of a takeover, or zealous securities analysts, they are actually more likely to engage in financial misbehavior.

Research summary: Past inquiry has found that implementing complex competitive repertoires (i.e., diverse and dynamic arrays of actions) is challenging, but firms benefit from doing so. Our examination of the antecedents and outcomes of complex competitive repertoires develops a more nuanced perspective. Data from 1,168 firms in 204 industries reveal that complexity initially harms performance, but then becomes a positive factor, except at high levels. We use agency and tournament theories, respectively, to examine how key governance mechanisms--ownership structure and executive compensation--help shape firms' competitive repertoires. We find that the principals of agency theory and the pay gap of tournament theory are both important antecedents of competitive complexity, and an interaction exists wherein firms build especially complex repertoires when both influences are strong. Managerial summary: In boxing, the fight does not always go to the bigger or stronger person, or even to whomever throws the most punches--the fight is sometimes won by the boxer who is unpredictable, such as throwing an uppercut when the opponent expected a right hook. Similarly, when companies compete in the marketplace, advantage is afforded not only to those with more resources or who engage in more competitive activity, but also to those whose actions are unpredictable. In this study, we develop the notion of "competitive complexity," which describes the diversity and changing nature of a company's competitive moves. Implementing complex competitive repertoires can be painful in the short term but, if done correctly, can help company performance in the long run. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Decreasing research and development (R&D) can impair the ability of firms to remain innovative in the long run. CEOs have been accused of curtailing R&D investments as they approach expected retirement, yet received findings on R&D investment behaviors of late-career CEOs are mixed. We argue that one reason for these inconsistent findings could be that traditional approaches overlook the fact that CEOs are not isolated agents in making R&D decisions. We build on the premise that CEOs interact with their top management team (TMT) when shaping R&D strategy and advance a contextualized view of CEO dispositions in their late career stages as being constrained or enabled by their TMT. We hypothesize that some TMT attributes (e.g., tenure and age) may amplify, whereas others (e.g., functional experience and education) may mitigate inclinations to reduce R&D. Our findings, based on a longitudinal sample of 100 US manufacturing firms from 1998 to 2008, provide nuanced insights into how different TMT characteristics influence CEO-TMT dynamics, with TMT age and TMT tenure playing particularly pronounced roles. We discuss implications of our CEO-TMT interface approach for theory and practice. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A growing number of recent studies highlight an avenue of entrepreneurship in family business. Previous studies have examined the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and firm performance, and generate inconsistent results probably due to the omission of the moderating role of family governance. To explicitly address this gap, this study investigates how entrepreneurial orientation (EO) influences firm performance in the contingencies of family and nonfamily firms by considering the influence of family governance. Built on agency theory and stewardship theory, the empirical findings of this study show that EO is positively associated with the concurrent and sustaining performance of firms, and such positive relationships are particularly strong when family ownership is combined with active family management and control; while in passive family governance, the EO-performance relationship becomes insignificant. These findings suggest that the potential advantages of EO can be better realized in family firms because active family governance alleviates agency problems and facilitates stewardship within firms when family CEOs, family top management, family chairpersons, and family directors are in presence.

This paper studies how governance drives entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in small firms. We argue that founder status and ownership create powerful personal incentives for small firm CEOs to engage in behaviors that influence EO. Integrating stewardship theory and the principal-principal branch of agency theory, we test our hypotheses on a sample of 339 Swedish firms, and find that CEO founder status is significantly and positively associated with EO, while CEO stock ownership significantly but negatively predicts EO. We additionally test two boundary conditions that show that the founder-CEO's prior managerial experience in start-up firms positively moderates the founder-EO relationship, while contrary to expectations, CEO ownership diversification has no effect on the negative association between ownership and EO. Thus, our study adopts a corporate governance perspective to explain how variations in EO across small firms are driven by the goals and motivations of its leader. Our research also shows that in small, private firms the balance of power is tipped in favor of the CEO rather than the board of directors. Finally, we underline the importance of adopting alternative theoretical lens like stewardship and principal-principal agency, given that traditional principal-agent problems are largely mitigated in the small firm context.

Family business research suggests that family involvement in the board (FIB) may have both positive and negative effects on entrepreneurship. To reconcile these conflicting views, this study builds on stewardship theory, agency theory, and the resource-based view and proposes a nonlinear relationship between FIB and entrepreneurial orientation (EO) to explore how board task performance moderates this relationship. Using a sample of 208 Belgian private family firms, the findings show an inverted U-shaped relationship between FIB and EO, with EO declining beyond moderate levels of FIB. Furthermore, board monitoring task limits the negative effects of high FIB on EO, whereas the board service task does not have any significant effect. This study offers a more nuanced view of the governance conditions that affect EO in the context of private family firms, an overlooked topic in the family business field. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This article examines whether agency or stewardship is the more effective form of managerial governance within family firms. Synthesizing arguments regarding the differential tendencies of nonfamily versus family managers and the bifurcated manner in which they are likely to be governed, we propose asymmetric responses to agency versus stewardship mechanisms. Our empirical results provide evidence challenging common assumptions regarding the behavior exhibited by nonfamily versus family managers and the mechanisms by which each is governed. Although our findings also provide evidence of response asymmetry, they nevertheless point to the greater effectiveness of stewardship over agency governance irrespective of a manager's family affiliation.

The agency theory and law and finance literatures show good country governance encourages financial development, mitigates agency problems, and increases firm value. Drawing on these literatures, we develop a theory that benefits from good country governance are portable by firms across countries through cross-border acquisitions. Using acquisitions from 56 countries from 1990 to 2007, we find that acquirers can transport the benefits from good country governance, so that they gain more from acquiring targets with worse country governance than their own. As predicted, the acquirer's stock-price reaction to acquisitions increases with the country governance distance between the acquirer and the target.

We draw on the socioemotional wealth perspective to examine the influence of family ownership on firms' noncompliance with corporate governance codes. Our results yield an inverted U-shaped effect of family ownership on noncompliance. While the family influence and control dimension leads to high levels of noncompliance, socioworthiness stemming from image and reputation dimension lessens noncompliance. In the presence of potential agency conflict, the control dimension prevails over reputation, even in countries with strong governance institutions. Our findings have critical implications for family business theory, for governance policy making and also for better understanding corporate governance in family firms.

There has been much debate concerning the innovative output of family-owned and non-family-owned companies. The purpose of this study was to show that the impact of family ownership differs depending on important governance conditions. Drawing on secondary data from the German machine tool industry from 2000 to 2010, we show that it is not family ownership per se that drives or impedes innovation in terms of the number of patents granted to a firm. Increases in the degree of family ownership and the generation of the family reduce the innovative output, whereas dedicated family business institutions nurture it. We discuss the implications of our findings for research and management. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

We examine the longitudinal relationship between ownership structure and firm internationalization, in a sample of Indian firms. Drawing on principal-principal (PP) agency theory and the resource-based-view (RBV) of the firm, we argue that divergent preferences (motivations) of a firm's owners affect the firm's propensity to internationalize, while resource heterogeneity among these owners (owners' capability to access and provide resources) affects the firm's capability to internationalize. We argue that both motivation and capability are required for firms to pursue internationalization and that when either of these is missing in an owner, that owner's shareholding will be negatively associated with internationalization. Additionally, our results uncover an interesting dichotomy. While family owners with lower levels of ownership favor their firms' internationalization, they do not favor it at higher levels of ownership. Our results indicate that foreign owners appeared to adjust their roles to accommodate the preferences of the dominant family owners. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This article theoretically and empirically intertwines agency and stewardship theories to examine their distinct and combined influences on family firms. Primary matched triadic data from CEOs, family employees, and nonfamily employees in 77 family firms suggest that agency and stewardship governance affects individual-level behavior and firm-level performance. Specifically, agent behavior is highest under conditions of coexisting low agency governance and high stewardship governance and is lowest when agency and stewardship governance coexist at high levels. Furthermore, when high levels of agency and stewardship governance coexist, family firm performance is the highest. Theoretical implications and future research directions are discussed.

Taking a combination between agency theory and resource dependence theory, we point out that directors' capital may have an effect on R&D strategies. A sample of both high-tech and low-tech industries for the period 2007-2011 is used. The results indicate that, regardless of the type of industry and the specific expertise on R&D intensive companies, board members with multiple directorships influence R&D corporate strategies. The resources acquired by directors through their experience and connections positively influence R&D intensity, but only if directors can carry out their monitoring activity adequately. This evidence implies a step forward in the understanding of the role of board of directors in corporate strategy, thus having significant implications for academics, companies and regulators, which are both theoretical and practical.

Emerging evidence suggests that pay dispersion among non-CEO top management team (TMT) members harms firm performance, which raises questions about why firms' owners tolerate or even support it. Prior research shows that the key distinction between founder and family owners is that in addition to firm performance and growth goals, family owners pursue socioemotional goals. On the basis of this distinction, we develop and test theory linking founders' and families' ownership to TMT pay dispersion. Consistent with our theory, a Bayesian panel analysis of Standard & Poor's 500 firms shows that founder owners use less TMT pay dispersion and that family owners, relative to founder owners, use more, although that declines across generations. We also provide evidence that TMT pay dispersion harms firm performance. Our theory and results are significant because they help to explain why some owners favor compensation practices that cause TMT pay dispersion, despite evidence that this harms firm performance.

More and more boards are tapping interim CEOs to temporarily fill the corner office. Prior research indicates the negative performance implications of this decision; yet, little is known about the rationale behind this decision. Our aim is to fill this research gap. Drawing on agency and human capabilities frameworks, we examined the contextual elements that influence a board's decision to pursue temporary leadership. Within a sample of 375 successions occurring between 1998 and 2005, we found that boards of directors were more likely to select interim CEOs under certain succession conditions, namely, when the prior CEO was forced out and there was no heir apparent or when the prior CEO had served for a short tenure. Our results highlight the importance of context in succession selections and provide insights into why a board would pursue a decision with seemingly negative repercussions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Franchise relationships engender franchisor-franchisee conflicts and are prone to premature dissolution. Building on agency theory and institutional theory, this study examines what specific reasons - from both franchisors' and franchisees' perspectives - may cause post-litigation relationship dissolution (PLRD) and how franchise regulations moderate these relationships. We argue that both franchisor and franchisee may misrepresent themselves before their relationship begins (adverse selection) and behave opportunistically after the contract is signed (moral hazard), that is, 'dual agency'. Based on 20-year archival records of franchisor-franchisee relationship histories gleaned from multiple data sources, we found that PLRD is likely to be caused by franchisors' passive moral hazard and by franchisees' active moral hazard. In addition, franchisor adverse selection has a greater impact on PLRD than franchisee adverse selection. With regards to regulatory influences, the presence of relationship law weakens the impact of franchisees' passive moral hazard, but not their active moral hazard, on PLRD. Contrary to what we hypothesize, the presence of registration law amplifies the impact of franchisee adverse selection on PLRD. Ultimately, this study creates a better understanding of the antecedents and curbing mechanisms of PLRD in franchising. (c) 2016

Drawing on agency theory and the resource-based view, this study examines the moderating effect of hotel ownership structure on the relationship between high-performance work systems for service quality (HPWS-SQs) and service performance as well as the curvilinear relationship between hotel service performance and hotel profitability. Results from surveys and archival data of 126 hotels showed that when hotels were owned and operated by brands, HPWS-SQs had a positive effect on service performance. Moderated mediation analyses showed that service performance as a mediator accounted for the moderating effect of ownership and management structure on the relationship between HPWS-SQs and hotel profitability. In addition, service performance demonstrated an inverted U-shaped relationship with hotel profitability. These findings advanced the understanding of the boundary conditions and influence processes of HPWS-SQs on financial performance in service settings. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Conventional agency theory typically focuses on a unidirectional problem, in which an agent behaves opportunistically against the interests of a principal. Yet, this conceptualization is too limited to fully describe all aspects of principal-agent relationships. This article presents a more comprehensive framework explaining a potential three-directional problem--that is, (i) agents behave opportunistically against the interests of principals, (ii) principals behave opportunistically against the interests of agents, and (iii) relationships between agents and principals representing confluence of interests affect the interests of third-party stakeholders. The article provides evidence of these problems, describes their unique characteristics, and outlines implications for society. It concludes with a discussion focusing on the implications of the proposed framework for purported governance solutions, the ongoing debate between shareholder and stakeholder views of the firm, and business practices.

Based on agency theory, this study analyzes whether family firms are more compliant with corporate governance recommendations than non-family firms in the context of emerging markets. Using a unique sample of 826 observations of the highest ranked companies on the stock exchange indices of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico during the period 2004-2010, we hypothesize that family firms may adopt better corporate governance practices to substitute for the absence or inefficiency of a regulatory system and to mitigate the agency problem between majority and minority shareholders. Additionally, we propose a corporate governance compliance index considering the legal and institutional framework of the region. The empirical results indicate that family firms report a higher corporate governance index. We find that board composition (independence, size and COB-CEO duality) does not moderate corporate governance compliance of family firms but rather such variables have a direct effect on the corporate governance index.

In this study we introduce a justice perspective to examining the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards over the allocation of firm residuals that ultimately determines CEO compensation. Framing CEO pay as the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards focuses attention on the power of CEOs to increase their share of firm residuals in the form of increased compensation, and the diligence of boards of directors to constrain CEO opportunism. Framing this negotiation through a theory of justice offers an alternative perspective to the search for pay-performance sensitivity. We predict and find that as board diligence in controlling opportunism declines and CEO power increases, CEOs are increasingly able to capture a larger portion of firm residuals relative to shareholders. This finding supports critics who charge that CEO pay violates norms of distributive and procedural justice. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Family firms, as insider-controlled companies, should be less likely to exhibit CEO turnover after poor performance and may thus promote enhanced focus on long-term goals. However, when a non-family CEO is in charge, the relatively limited empirical evidence is contrasting. Some studies find that only family CEOs are immune from the threat of dismissal following poor financial performance, while other studies show that family firms discipline their CEOs for poor financial performance regardless of their family status. In this work, we try to reconcile these contrasting findings and investigate what ownership and governance conditions influence the owners' pressure on the CEO to achieve short-term financial results. Research findings/insights: Drawing on a longitudinal dataset that covers the entire population of Italian medium and large family companies, we find that when family ownership is concentrated in the hands of few family shareholders or there is a low number of family members involved in the board of directors, non-family CEOs are less likely to be dismissed after poor performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study, adopting the behavioral agency theory as the guiding framework, highlights the importance for governance decisions of the potential goal divergence among principals in closely held ownership structures. Our results also add to the still scant literature on the relationship between family owners and non-family CEOs. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research suggests that, in the decision to hire a non-family CEO, family business owners should not only assess their gaps in managerial skills but also carefully consider the ownership structure and family involvement conditions. On the side of professional non-family managers, our results offer insights on ways to address the employment relationship with the controlling family. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the relationship between the firms' ownership and control structure and their export performance. The literature is traditionally focused on the relationship between firms' performance and internationalization, with the relationship between ownership and control structure with internationalization being much less studied, particularly in the context of family firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors focus their study on the Portuguese wine firms due to their increasing importance in the Portuguese economy and in the promotion of the country's exports and image abroad. They used a balanced panel data sample of 82 firms for the period from 2011 to 2015 and applied a random effects model and a Tobit specification. Findings: The degree of family involvement shows a negative and significant relationship with internationalization, meaning that family firms that intend to internationalize should be open to receive external managers with international experience and increase their internal competencies to enhance internationalization. Originality/value: This paper extends the literature since assesses, at the light of the agency theory, the presence of differences in the internationalization degree and export intensity between family firms that are managed and controlled by the owners and family firms that are managed by non-family members, with an application to a less studied sector and country.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate whether family CEOs benefit investment efficiency under uncertainty with Chinese family firms and to test the moderating effect of ownership structure, including family ownership, the separation of family control from family ownership and the multiple large shareholder structure. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effects models are designed for a sample of 5,734 firm-year observations for Chinese family firms from 2009 to 2014. Findings: The results show that investment efficiency is low under uncertainty, and having family CEOs can reduce this negative relationship. Further analysis reveals that for firms with family CEOs, the negative effect of uncertainty on investment efficiency is weaker when the family has higher ownership, when family control is less separated from family ownership, or when family firms have multiple large shareholder structures. Research limitations/implications: The authors do not distinguish founder-CEOs and descendant-CEOs. Most of Chinese family firms are still managed by founders, so the authors cannot explore the generation effect although different generations manage firms differently. Because family succession is becoming a more and more important problem in China, further research may be able to explore the generation effect. Practical/implications: This paper suggests that in emerging economies with weak investor protection, outside minority shareholders can avoid expropriation from family owners by investing in firms with large family ownership, little separation of family control from ownership or multiple large shareholder structure. In addition, policymakers can encourage institutional investors to participate in family business to improve corporate governance. Originality/value: Drawing on both Type I and Type II agency theory perspectives, the authors argue that although family CEOs can generally benefit firms' investment efficiency, the benefits vary with firms' ownership structure. In other words, family CEOs are not absolute agents or stewards but some extent of combination of both. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the presence, expertise, independence, size and meetings of the audit committee (AC) have an effect on corporate insolvency. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 insolvent and 269 solvent UK-listed non-financial firms from 1994 to 2011. Findings: The authors find that corporate insolvency is negatively related to thenieetings and independence of the AC but not to AC's presence and size. The authors also observe that financial expertise on the AC is not related to corporate insolvency. These associations are robust to different specifications, while after controlling for board composition, board size, the number of board meetings, CEO duality, financial and firm characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The study's approach has two main limitations: neglect of small and medium private unquoted firms and more regulated corporate governance environment. Practical implications - The findings lend support to the continual use of the agency theory as an explanation in understanding the role of the analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of the AC in reducing the likelihood of insolvency. Social implications: The findings support continued efforts to strengthen boards' ACs in the wake of high profile insolvencies. The findings will assist regulators and firm management to design appropriate ACs (e.g. independence) and processes (e.g. number of meetings). Originality/value: The authors provide empirical evidence on the impact of the AC on firm insolvency in the UK context, an important but neglected area in research.

Purpose - The objective of this study is to understand the linkages among executive compensation, corporate governance and performance of the Indian family and non-family firms. Further, the study also analyzes the level of shareholding pattern of the Indian family firms on their performance and the executive compensation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have collected panel data of the companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The data set consists of 284 companies (both family and non-family) for the period 2005-2014. The authors have made use of a dynamic panel data model with generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation to formulate the hypotheses and used fixed-effects regression model to check the robustness of our findings. Findings - The authors find support for the agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory in the paper. Specifically, variables related to executive compensation, corporate governance (board size, proportion of independent directors on board, chief executive officers duality and other directorships held by the executive directors outside the company), firm performance (Tobin's Q), leverage and shareholding pattern of the family are significant in this study. Practical implications - The study has practical implications for all stakeholders of the family and non-family firms, especially in the emerging market economies. It can be used as a reference guide by various other stakeholders of the family firms, viz., customers, educators, tax authorities, government and society. Originality/value - The authors confirm that their research is original and provides valuable insights on the Indian family firms. The authors study cross-holding of directorships, inter alia, in the Indian family business groups. As most of the previous studies in the Indian context ignored this important aspect, this study is unique in nature. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Family ownership has emerged as one of the most crucial determinants of corporate strategy in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Nevertheless, few studies examine the impact of family ownership and corporate governance on the internationalization of SMEs. We apply the resource dependency theory and agency theory to investigate the impact of family ownership and the moderating impact of institutional ownership on SME internationalization. Using 232 samples of Korean internationalizing SMEs from 2003 to 2013, we find a positive relationship between family ownership and internationalization indicating that the latter may be encouraged by family ownership. Institutional ownership acts as a moderator in the relationship between family ownership and internationalization, implying that internationalizing SMEs with high family ownership tend to internationalize as institutional ownership rises. An important implication for SMEs that depend on international expansion to remain competitive is the crucial need to establish long-lasting relationships with institutional investors, especially in South Korea.

This paper examines how family firms substitute corporate governance with family governance and self-governance at different stages of their development. We argue that the types of agency problems that family firms face as they pass from one generation to the next determine the extent to which these mechanisms can be used as substitutes for one another. Our empirical investigation provides evidence that in the early stages of a family firm's life cycle, instruments of self-governance lessen the need for mechanisms of corporate governance, whereas in the later stages, instruments of family governance can substitute for mechanisms of corporate governance.

Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not gain sufficient economic returns despite their significant economic contributions. A possible cause of poor SME performance is weak corporate governance. However, the corporate governance of SMEs is rarely investigated. Ownership structure provides SMEs with a monitoring mechanism that enhances performance. This study examines the relationships between board characteristics (including size, composition boards, CEO duality, expertise, and ethnicity) and SME performance in Malaysia. This study also explores how such relationships can be moderated by monitoring ownership structure. Survey results on SMEs in Klang Valley and Selangor areas show that non-executive boards and CEO duality are significantly and positively related to firm performance. In comparison, management ownership is significantly and negatively related to performance. Board size, expertise, ethnicity, and family ownership are not significantly related to SME performance. Findings indicate that good corporate governance improves decision making and firm performance. Furthermore, agency theory can explain conflict of interest in SMEs and the importance of corporate governance in enhancing their performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the importance of socioemotional wealth (SEW) to family firms in Poland viewed through the lens of the events surrounding the first hostile takeover bid of the post-communist era on the Warsaw Stock Exchange when the clothing company Vistula & Wolczanka (V&W) made an unsolicited, leveraged bid for the family-controlled jewelry company W. Kruk. Design/methodology/approach: The 2008 takeover and its aftermath are described in the context of the corporate governance and legal environment in Poland. The case study events demonstrate the connection between firm behavior and SEW theory. Findings: After the acquisition of W. Kruk by V&W, the Kruk family purchased stock in the newly named Vistula Group and gained influence over the supervisory board in concert with a business ally, eventually wresting back control of the company in the style of a Pac-Man "defense." The case study illustrates the importance of SEW in family firm takeovers. Research limitations/implications: The case study design has limitations for generalizability. Nevertheless the research highlights the important role of SEW preservation in understanding the market for corporate control of listed family firms in Poland. Practical implications: Understanding the reaction by family firms to takeover bids requires recognition that there is a tradeoff between financial and SEW considerations, not just financial gains and losses. Originality/value: The case study demonstrates the importance of SEW to family firms and suggests that the balance of power in takeovers on the Polish stock market rests with incumbent management.

This study explores two ownership issues in private family firms. First, we investigate the relationship between the ownership of family CEOs and firm performance, and postulate that this relationship in private family firms is more complex than the inverted "U" relationship found in public family firms. Second, we predict a potential moderating effect of the second largest owner, who may exert a monitoring role on family CEOs. We focus on private family firms as recent studies show that private family firms have distinct features compared to public family firms, and that findings documented in public family firms may not apply to the ubiquitous, but much less studied, private family firms. We have applied agency theory to develop the two hypotheses, used secondary data on a large sample of private family firms, utilized an adjusted conventional quadratic technique to test the hypotheses, and validated the findings using a second method of piecewise linear specification. The results show that the non-linear relationship between the ownership of family CEOs and firm performance is more complicated than the often-documented inverted "U" shape from public firms. Meanwhile, the second largest owner with a high enough ownership stake can impose a positive moderating effect by mitigating potential agency problems caused by family CEOs.

In this paper we analyze the relationship between conformity to executive remuneration standards, corporate ownership, and the level and structure of CEO compensation for large European listed companies in the years 2007 and 2010. We show that controlled corporations conform to executive remuneration standards less than widely held firms. We also show that weaker compliance is associated with lower CEO pay and more cash-based incentive structures. We interpret this "conformity gap" from the perspective of individual firms and from a societal perspective, with the aim to contribute to frame the policy questions concerning executive pay at controlled corporations. Different policy implications depend on whether the conformity gap reflects a lower need for managerial incentives, given the monitoring by controlling shareholders, or the latter's willingness to extract private benefits of control. We argue in this paper that the former hypothesis prevails, so that regulators should abstain from increasing the level of enforcement of executive remuneration standards.

This paper analyses the performance effects of management controls and goals for the business across both male and female-controlled farm and rural family businesses revealing that female-controlled farm and rural family businesses do not underperform their male counterparts. (c) 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.
Purpose: Prior research indicates that family businesses have fewer management control practices in place and are more likely to have non-economic goals for their firm. Further, researchers in this domain contend that female-controlled businesses tend to underperform compared to male-controlled businesses. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the performance effects of management controls and goals for the business across both male and female-controlled farm and rural family businesses. Design/methodology/approach: The data used in the analyses are from the 2012 Intergenerational Farm and Non-Farm Family Business Survey. The sample comprises 576 small- and medium-sized rural family businesses. The authors used probit analysis to model both family business objective and subjective success for women and men. Findings: The results suggest that female-controlled farm and rural family businesses do not underperform their male counterparts in terms of objective or subjective assessments of performance. The results do indicate, however, that strategic management via management control practices within the firm influence objective and subjective performance differently across male and female-controlled farm and rural family businesses. Originality/value: The results provide three primary contributions to the family business literature. First, the authors determined that strategic management practices via management control mechanisms, as well as the monitoring of managers, are of significance to the objective performance (i.e. gross income) of both men and women-controlled farm and rural family businesses. Second, the authors found that communicating economic vs non-economic goals do not influence satisfaction with the firm's performance, but do influence the probability of success for female-controlled family businesses. Finally, the authors find that when we compare male and female-controlled businesses in the same industry, while controlling for family and business factors, men and women do not differ in a statistical sense in objective or subjective performance.

The objective of this paper is to systematize and analyze existing empirical studies of the relationship between family involvement in family businesses and their financial returns. With this purpose in mind, a systematic review of papers has been carried out. These papers have been selected with criteria clearly defined in the most relevant databases of social sciences, aiming at seeing whether this relationship is positive or negative. Based on the findings, three trends of the studies analyzed were obtained: positive relationship, negative relationship and neutral relationship. With these heterogeneous results it has been concluded that the relationship between the family businesses and their performance are complex and probably moderate or affected by factors that are not included in these analysis.

In light of the need to develop mechanisms of control, protection, and transparency regarding the relationships between principal and agent, and with the aim of eliminating or reducing the agency problem, corporate governance has emerged. Based on Agency Theory, separation of ownership and control of activities derives from the complexity of organizations. In this context, this study aims to analyze the relationship between dimensions of complexity and corporate governance in companies listed on the Sao Paulo Stock, Commodities, and Futures Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA), in which contingency factors might influence organizational characteristics. The investigation gathers data from a sample of 162 companies listed on the BM&FBOVESPA. The following statistical tests were used in the data analysis: Factor Analysis, Multiple Linear Regression, Correspondence Analysis, and Correlation Analysis. For measuring complexity, contingency variables such as age, size, diversification, and internationalization were adopted; and, to assess corporate governance, a representative index of the adoption of good governance practices was used. The results show that organizational complexity is explained by the size and diversification variables, whereas operational complexity is explained by the size, diversification, and internationalization variables. It was observed that in the two dimensions of complexity - organizational and operational - corporate governance was influenced by the diversification, internationalization, and age variables, with the latter involving an inverse relationship. It is concluded that companies displaying more complexity, in its two dimensions, record a higher level of corporate governance, which confirms the research hypothesis.

Policy development and implementation is not only an attribute of a political administration, but also ofits bureaucracy. The natures of, and connection between, a political administration and its bureaucracyis important if one is interested in creating a comparative measure of that efficacy across administrationsor political systems. A traditional blueprint model of a bureaucracy comes from Weber, seen to be a servicingbody for the implementation of political policy decisions resulting from a process of governance.An alternative model arises from the fictional works of Kafka, which is underpinned by a firm conceptualbasis of a bureaucracy that confronts that of Weber. This paper explores the nature of bureaucracies,representing them as complex and dynamic. Agency theory will be used to model bureaucracies, andcomparisons will be made between the Weber and Kafka conceptualisation. The outcome suggests thatany attempts to measure comparative efficacy across political systems or administrations may well leadto failure due to the distinctions in the nature of the bureaucracies that they maintain.

Important corporate governance mechanisms such as ownership concentration and debt used by the large firms can affect firm performance and value in developed markets. The mixed findings - which are non-conclusive in the literature - pertaining to these relationships pose questions about the exact nature of the relationships between these mechanisms and firm value. Moreover, the mixed findings in the literature have resulted in the endogeneity issue of the former becoming central to discussions in corporate governance and corporate finance studies. The research in this book focuses on the dynamic endogeneity issue to investigate whether this issue influences the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm value in the largest Australian firms based on agency theory. The study investigates this issue through three different advanced econometric models and tests based on agency theory: two-way fixed effects (FE) and the two-step system known as the generalised method of moments (GMM). The book concludes that dynamic endogeneity is not a serious issue in influencing the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm value in the largest Australian firms. These models can be applied to other countries for investigating similar corporate governance and finance issues. (c) 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

CEO duality motivates executives to boost financial performance and withhold unfavourable news, which increases future stock price crashes. Using China's listed firms from 2004 to 2014 as the sample, we present evidence CEO duality exerts positive effects on stock price crash risk. Moreover, the positive effect of CEO duality on crash risk is strengthened when the firms have relatively higher R&D expenditure, lower market competition, and lower analyst coverage.

Research Summary: We investigate whether and how family ownership and management influence firms' internationalization strategies in an emerging economy in which family firms are dominant. Anchoring on the willingness and ability framework and drawing on the socioemotional wealth perspective and agency theory, we theorize how the heterogeneity among family firms in their ownership structures, concentration, and family involvement in management shapes the firms' internationalization strategies. We also theorize how certain contingencies, such as the presence of foreign institutional ownership and family management, moderate the relationship between family ownership and internationalization strategy. We test our predictions by using a proprietary, longitudinal panel dataset of 303 leading family firms from India and find support for most of our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Internationalization has emerged as a dominant strategy for firms in a globally interconnected world. We observe that ownership structure and management have significant bearing on internationalization strategies of family firms, as family owners and managers are more averse to internationalization. Family firms' aversion to internationalize is more pronounced when families can exercise greater control on firms' actions through the combined effect of higher family ownership (primarily through strategic control) and family's participation in management (through strategic, administrative, and operational control). However, certain contingencies, such as the higher ownership of foreign institutions and presence of professional managers, help business families improve their understanding of international markets, reduce the fear of the unknown, and better appreciate the benefits of internationalization, thereby aiding greater internationalization of family firms.

Management literature is currently giving growing conceptual and empirical attention to the peculiarity and relevance of entrepreneurial attitudes in family firms, with divergent outcomes. Aiming at concretizing the effects of these attitudes, denoted by the entrepreneurial orientation construct, on family business performance and considering that family dynamics come into play in this relationship, we particularly investigate the impact of control mechanisms and family-related goals. Findings are based on a sample of 180 family firms and show that Proactiveness and Autonomy are particularly relevant to financial performance. Agency-problems avoiding control mechanisms moderate the effect of Innovativeness and Autonomy, while socioemotional wealth (SEW) goals moderate the effect of Risk-Taking, respectively. The usage of these mechanisms and managing SEW goals provide opportunities for a more efficient exploitation of entrepreneurial attitudes. (c) 2017, The Author(s).

Research on corporate social responsibility (CSR) has traditionally focused on managerial discretion and stakeholders' influence. This study extends current research by addressing the effect of family firms and institutional owners on CSR performance, namely, CSR strengths and concerns. Based on stewardship theory and the socioemotional wealth perspective, we propose that family firms are more likely to value CSR performance. Next, drawing from multiple agency theory, we predict that institutional owners, unlike family owners, will influence a firm's CSR performance differently. We tested our hypotheses using a sample of 153 firms from 1994 to 2006 and found general support for our hypotheses. A higher percentage of family owned equity and the presence of a family CEO are found to increase CSR strengths, whereas transient institutional owners have an opposite effect. The presence of a family CEO and founding family are found to reduce CSR concerns. Contrary to our predictions, dedicated institutional owners are positively associated with CSR concerns.

The resource-based view posits that firms achieve competitive advantage from value creation through firm-specific investments held by key stakeholders: employees, suppliers, and customers. Shareholder-dominant (agency) theory holds that all residual income claimant rights belong to shareholders, circumscribing other key stakeholders' ability to appropriate value from their investment. However, recent enhancements to stakeholder theory grounded in property rights suggest that such stakeholders may need protection for implicit residual claims. A central purpose of this article is to build a model of the protection devices used to ensure these implicit rights. Individual ex ante devices such as stakeholder ownership only partially incentivize stakeholders' firm-specific investments because they are subject to two types of uncertainties--behavioral and environmental--and individual devices aimed at reducing one type of uncertainty may exacerbate the other. We therefore expand on efforts to establish a stakeholder theory of strategic management by proposing an integrated model of protection devices, which seeks to overcome the incentive dilemma in reducing both uncertainties by reducing barriers to stakeholder firm-specific investment. Our model also explores the conflicts and complementarities associated with device implementation. Finally, we discuss theoretical and practical implications, as well as future research opportunities associated with our model. Q Academy of Management Review 2018

This systematic literature review analyses the determinants and consequences of executive compensation-related shareholder activism and say-on-pay (SOP) votes. The review covers 71 empirical articles published between January 1995 and September 2017. The studies are reviewed within an empirical research framework that separates the reasons for shareholder activism and SOP voting dissent as input factor on the one hand and the consequences of shareholder pressure as output factor on the other. This procedure identifies the five most important groups of factors in the literature: the level and structure of executive compensation, firm characteristics, corporate governance mechanisms, shareholder structure and stakeholders. Of these, executive compensation and firm characteristics are the most frequently examined. Further examination reveals that the key assumptions of neoclassical principal agent theory for both managers and shareholders are not always consistent with recent empirical evidence. First, behavioral aspects (such as the perception of fairness) influence compensation activism and SOP votes. Second, non-financial interests significantly moderate shareholder activism. Insofar, we recommend integrating behavioral and non-financial aspects into the existing research. The implications are analyzed, and new directions for further research are discussed by proposing 19 different research questions. (c) 2018 University of Florida, Fisher School of Accounting

We investigate how family relationship conflict and family and firm name congruence influence subjective firm valuations by family firm owner-managers. Drawing on the socioemotional wealth perspective, behavioral agency theory and mixed gamble reasonings, we hypothesize and find a U-shaped association between relationship conflict inside the family firm and subjective firm valuation. While we do not find a direct effect between name congruence and subjective firm valuation, we show that name congruence interacts with relationship conflict to affect valuations in a complex fashion. Implications and contributions of our findings are discussed. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

This study integrates behavioral agency theory with the conditions of willingness and ability to investigate how family ownership and family involvement affect the likelihood of initial international entry, both directly and interactively. A firm's initial international entry--its first expansion into a foreign market--is considered a major, and often risky, strategic action that enables a firm to compete and grow. Among family firms, variance in initial international entry is theoretically explained by the family's willingness and ability to participate. Using survival analysis on data representing 190 different family firms across 10 years, our findings support hypotheses suggesting that family ownership and involvement decrease the likelihood of initial international entry. However, these two forms of family control also act as interactive substitutes in relation to initial international entry likelihood. Our findings provide for a more nuanced understanding of family control heterogeneity in relationship to major strategic actions. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Radical innovation is critical for firms to enhance their competitiveness. Whether they can achieve it, however, depends on organizational factors, including the corporate governance of the firm. In emerging economies in which shareholder protection is weak, large shareholders are widely used as an efficient governance mechanism to reduce agency problems. The literature on agency theory contains conflicting arguments regarding the role of large shareholders in firm innovation performance and has underestimated the role of social relationships between large shareholders and managers in determining the firm's innovation performance. By applying a stewardship theory perspective, this article argues that the characteristics of the relationship between large shareholders (owners) and managers, manifested as trust and shared goals, may explain variations in a firm's radical innovation. Drawing on data from 174 Chinese firms with large shareholders, our results show that trust has an inverted U-shaped relationship with firm radical innovation, whereas shared goals exhibit a positive linear relationship with radical innovation. Shared goals further moderate the nonlinear effect of trust on radical innovation. Trust is almost negatively related to firm radical innovation when there is a low level of shared goals. However, when there is a high level of shared goals, the relationship between trust and firm radical innovation is first positive, then plateaus, and finally becomes negative. These findings advance our understanding of the role of the relationship between large shareholders and managers as a driver of radical innovation and contribute to the innovation literature by providing a nuanced understanding of the key factors that influence the effects of the social aspects of governance on firm radical innovation.

This paper examines the effects of board composition and monitoring on the credit risk in the UK banking sector. The study finds CEO duality, pay and board independence to have a positive and significant effect on credit risk of the UK banks. However, board size and women on board have a negative and significant influence on credit risk. Further analysis using sub-samples divided into pre-financial crisis, during the financial crisis and post crisis reinforce the robustness of our findings. Overall, the paper sheds light on the effectiveness of the within-firm monitoring arrangement, particularly, the effects of CEO power and board independence on credit risk decisions thereby contributing to the agency theory.

In a study of family firms that included survey responses from both family CEOs and family member employees, we examined the roles that collaboration and CEO monitoring play regarding the prevalence of extra-role behavior, an important human resource outcome that can impact job performance and firm performance. Results indicated that an integration of stewardship and agency theories (manifested through interactions between family harmony and adaptability with monitoring) helps explain the level of extra-role behavior displayed by family employees. The findings lend some support for the argument that effective human resource practices in family firms should be balanced between instrumental governance mechanisms that reflect a monitoring approach and normative mechanisms that focus on collaborative efforts among family employees. When this balance is achieved, an environment of fairness and accountability rather than a tone of distrust and forced compliance may prevail in family firms, thus addressing a key human resource issue in this hybrid form of organization.

In this chapter, we highlight and review the most frequently cited articles that have influenced family business research between 2006 and 2013 from the five most commonly adopted theoretical perspectives: agency theory, resource-based view, stewardship theory, socioemotional wealth, and institutional theory. Using citation counts from Google Scholar, we identified 21 articles that covered these perspectives. Our review discusses the contributions of these highly cited articles, particularly in terms of understanding family firm heterogeneity. We conclude the chapter by suggesting future research directions using these and other theoretical perspectives. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to set a research agenda so that future conceptual and empirical research can improve the understanding of why CEO pay and CEO performance are decoupled. Design/methodology/approach: The paper compiles and adds to many of the explanations provided by this special issue's nine commentaries regarding why CEO pay and CEO performance are decoupled. These explanations were grouped into two categories: economic (e.g. marginal productivity theory, agency theory and behavioral agency model) and social-institutional-psychological (e.g. CEO individual differences and characteristics and CEO-organization interactions). Moreover, new analyses based on additional data were conducted to examine measurement-related explanations for the observed pay-performance decoupling. Findings: Results based on alternative measures of pay and performance confirmed, once again, the existence of pay-performance decoupling. Research limitations/implications: This paper will stimulate research pitting theoretical explanations against each other to understand their relative validity in different contexts. Practical implications: The paper informs ongoing efforts to link CEO pay to performance. Social implications: The paper also revisits the decoupling of CEO pay and firm performance from a normative and value-based perspective (i.e. regarding whether pay and performance should be related). Originality/value: The paper clarifies that the articles in this special issue largely concluded that CEO pay is decoupled from CEO performance. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This chapter reviews prior, so far inconclusive, research on the risk behavior of family firms. On the one hand, scholars assume risk-averse behavior of family firms based on agency theory and wealth concentration arguments. On the other hand, scholars predict that family firms are willing to take substantial financial risks to preserve their SEW. By integrating finance, management, and entrepreneurship literature, we show that different underlying definitions of "risk" are key for a better understanding of family firms' risk behavior and subsequent strategic decisions. We provide a conceptual model, highlight gaps in the existing literature, and propose fruitful areas for further research. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

CEO compensation in family firms is affected by certain corporate governance characteristics, such as the generational stage of the firm (founder or descendant-controlled firms), the level of family involvement on the board of directors (lone or multiple family members sitting on the board) and the family status of the CEO (family or professional CEO). In this paper, we argue that moderating effects arise among these dimensions of heterogeneity. The results show that in firms owned by descendants, the presence of multiple family members is beneficial in lowering family CEO compensation, while the opposite is true in the presence of the founder. Moreover, within founder and descendant firms, the number of family representatives on the board exerts a strong influence on the compensation of family CEOs, whereas it does not affect the compensation of professional CEOs. The results also show that in certain family clusters, CEO compensation is higher than in nonfamily firms, thereby emphasizing that when comparing CEO compensation in family and nonfamily firms, it is important to consider the intersections among the heterogeneity dimensions of the governance of family firms. The findings of the paper contribute to the literature on the governance of family firms by showing that certain family firm types are more effective than others in keeping CEO compensation under control.

Family involvement in corporate governance through ownership, management, and board membership presents a unique dilemma for understanding the strategic impetus and costs of entrenchment decisions. The presence of shared family ties and the family-centered goals of firm principals call to question the applicability of extant agency arguments regarding the nature and antecedents of managerial entrenchment. Exploring this, we develop and test a model of family firm-specific determinants (i.e., family ownership and family's involvement in management and governance) of entrenchment in publicly traded firms by drawing upon principal-principal agency theory. Findings of the empirical analysis of family owned S&P 500 firms suggest family firms are motivated to entrench managers when doing so supports the pursuit of family-centric goals. However, the extent to which entrenchment supports such goals varies at different levels of family ownership. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

This article analyses the relationship between CEO succession events and German firms' internationalization processes, which is represented by the degree of internationalization (DOI) growth and internationalization rhythm. Based on a theoretical framework combining elements of agency theory, institutionalism and upper echelons approach, we propose a longitudinal model to examine the relationships of both process variables with the number of CEO changes and succession type (internal vs. external succession), respectively. The results of our study of 102 German firms over 23 years (1990-2012) show an inverted U-shaped impact (no impact) of the number of CEO changes (succession type) on the DOI growth and a positive (negative) monotonic effect on the rhythm of internationalization.

Proxy advisors are information intermediaries that enable shareholders to exercise their voting rights. While proxy advisors' influence is documented in market-based corporate governance systems, we know little about the corporate governance role of proxy advice in relationship-based governance systems. Drawing on agency theory and the comparative corporate governance literature, we theorize that shareholders are sensitive to the costs and benefits of monitoring by considering internal monitoring capabilities. We also theorize that relative to market-based corporate governance systems, proxy advice is both less influential and has lower predictive quality in relationship-based governance systems. We test our multilevel model using 13,497 voting results from 613 firms in 16 Western European countries and generally find support for our predictions. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Family business owners and researchers tend to overwhelmingly focus on the top-level structure of firms but ignore the middle-level practice - involving family members in the middle-management team. Compared to top managers at the strategic apex, middle-level managers are mainly responsible for internal operations and control, and the composition of the middle-management team has an immediate and direct impact on the overall workforce efficiency of family firms. Integrating agency theory and organizational justice perspective, we proposed that family involvement in middle management would have a negative impact on the labor productivity of family firms. We further corroborated this effect by identifying three boundary conditions at the individual (i.e., familial CEO), organizational (i.e., firm size), and regional (i.e., labor mobility) levels. Using a sample of 1,284 privately owned family firms in China, we found that family involvement in middle management, measured as the percentage of familial middle-level managers, was negatively associated with labor productivity. Furthermore, this negative relationship existed only when the CEO is a family member rather than a professional manager, when the size of the firm is large rather than small, or when the firm is located in regions with low rather than high labor mobility. These findings contribute to family business literature and provide practical implications for human resource management in family firms.

This study examines the effects of family firms on the corporate social performance of Korean firms and analyses how their effect varies depending on the presence of family CEOs or chaebols. Based on the agency theory, we find that family firms exhibit lower corporate social performance. In particular, there is no difference in the performance of related stakeholders, such as society, consumers, environment, and employees, compared to non-family firms, but corporate governance registers as low performance. We further find that family firms managed by family CEOs show lower corporate social performance, whereas chaebol firms show higher corporate social performance.

This study established a broad theoretical framework combining agency theory and resource and capacity theory. We sought evidence of these theories' implications for corporate entrepreneurship (CE) and an understanding of how corporate entrepreneurship affects performance. To identify relationships between these theories and concepts, we designed a research model and tested it using data from a questionnaire to 114 multinational firms. Findings provide general support for this theory, indicating that CE is positively associated with principal management-based incentives and capabilities on performance.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) exhibit a wide variety of ownership structures but most are entrepreneurially controlled by founders or families. We investigate the relation between REIT ownership/control and REIT valuation. Using proxy data from 1994 through 2007, our analysis shows that, consistent with the incentive alignment prediction of agency theory, founder/family REITs, on average, have a higher valuation than non-founder/ non-family REITs. This result is driven by first-generation family and lone-founder REITs. Our results are also consistent with the entrenchment prediction of agency theory: limits on private benefits of control could lead to higher REIT valuation when founders/families do not occupy both board chairman and CEO positions.

Relying on two years' observations of 74 United Arab Emirates (UAE) listed firms, we examined the association between governance mechanisms (board size, audit committee, percentage of independent non-executive directors, external auditor, firm leverage and product market competition) and agency costs while controlling for firm size and industry type. We also utilised four different proxies to measure agency costs (asset utilisation, audit fees, expenses ratio and free cash flow measures) to test whether the effect of product market competition on agency costs is substitutive or complementary to internal governance mechanisms. The results show that the percentage of independent non-executive directors and type of external audit significantly influence proxies of agency costs when product market competition is factored out. However, this effect disappears when regressions include product market competition, suggesting that the competitive position of a firm has a substitutive effect to internal governance mechanisms.

Drawing upon the resource-based view and agency theory, this study examines the effects of human resource management and the innovative capabilities of nonfamily members on the performance of family businesses. The results show that training and innovative capabilities influence performance, while strategic planning strengthens the relationship between human resource policies and performance. Moreover, family businesses with weak governance practices can initially benefit from innovation, but they must enhance their governance to sustain growth in performance. Family businesses should focus on the selection and training of nonfamily members to increase their innovative capabilities and enhance their performance. (c) 2018, (c) 2018 Taylor & Francis.

Drawing on social capital and agency theories and using a multi-study research design, this study examined how perceived risk and return interacts with familism to influence individuals' investment strategies in new venture financing, both capital seeking and capital providing behavior. We found that individuals high in familism are more likely to seek capital from and provide capital to family members than non-family members for new ventures. However, such relationships are more complex than prior research suggests because when individuals' risk and return perceptions are included these interact with familism to differentially influence capital financing behavior directed at family versus non-family members. Contributions to theory and potential avenues for future research are discussed. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The chief information officer (CIO) is responsible for bridging the gap between two critical domains--technology and business, making the CIO's job uniquely different from other executives. As digital technologies become increasingly important to firms' competitive success, boards of directors and senior executives seek to align the CIO role with overall firm's objectives. Agency theory suggests that one way to create the alignment between an executive's efforts and firm performance is to implement appropriate equity compensation incentives (i.e., those resulting from stock and stock options) tying the executive's wealth to firm value. To date, research does not address what factors a firm should consider when designing CIO incentives and how these incentives influence firm performance. To address this major gap, we examine both the antecedents and performance consequences of CIO equity incentives. We assess organizational, environmental, and individual factors that influence CIO equity incentives and find that environmental and organizational factors are more important than individual CIO characteristics in the determination of CIO equity incentives. We also find that firms that create higher CIO equity incentives realize greater subsequent accounting and market performance. Our research contributes to the IT personnel literature by showing how firms can use compensation policies to leverage the CIO role to enhance overall business performance. (c) 2018

Built upon the agency theory and the stewardship theory, this study examines the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activities among Chinese publicly listed firms. Using a founder-CEO indicator, we separate steward effects from agency effects, and find that Chinese firms' M&A activities are significantly influenced by the steward factors after controlling for the agency factors. Firms, of which CEO is a founder, enjoy relatively higher premium during M&A. Further investigation reveals that the steward effects vary in the power of CEO. The results show that steward effect is reinforced when founder-CEO is more powerful. Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Purpose: Adopting an integrated agency and stewardship perspective, the purpose of this paper is to understand the relationship between family businesses (FBs) and private equity (PE) investors at three stages: entry, cooperation, and exit. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study combines the perspectives of 11 FB owners and/or managers, seven PE investors, and four intermediaries. The in-depth interviews of this purposive sample are analysed at the intra- and inter-case level using a template analysis approach up to reaching theoretical saturation. Findings: Building and maintaining an effective relationship between the FB and the PE investor requires both a stewardship perspective (i.e. reciprocal principal-steward behaviour) and a necessary but insufficient agency perspective (i.e. principal-principal behaviour). Research limitations/implications: More large-scale studies with an integrated agency-stewardship perspective on FBs using PE can increase the external validity of the insights from this research to build and maintain an effective relationship between both parties. Practical implications: Providing insights into the relationship building process and best practices, this study helps reduce the knowledge and empathy gap that exists between FBs and PE. Originality/value: The results clarify the need to reconcile an agency and stewardship perspective to thoroughly understand the relationship and behaviour of FBs and PE investors, and to help the parties understand and benefit from each other's added value.

The family business is an economically relevant worldwide phenomenon. It is widespread in every industry and it takes diverse legal forms, ranging from micro, small and medium sized firms to large public companies. Its economic relevance frequently impacts more than half of the national GDP and it becomes an essential source of employment. After, presenting some facts and figures about the family business around the world, this chapter shows the two main approaches used to define a family firm, namely the essence and component approaches. We thus review more than 180 definitions of family firms and organise them within a table according to the following three main criteria: (1) Percentage of ownership held by the family, (2) Members of the family involved in management and control positions, and (3) Generational stages of the family firm. The intersection of these three criteria gives rise to other four groups of family firm definitions, theoretically proving the multidimensionality of the phenomenon. We then review the studies on family business and accounting and discuss the main theoretical framework used, with a specific focus on the transition from a mainly agency theory-based literature to the derived socioemotional wealth theory. Finally, this chapter pinpoints some early conclusions on the family business providing a bridge with the ensuing chapter stressing the relations between family firms and accounting choices.

This chapter begins the discussion about earnings quality in family firms. It examines whether family firms differently manage their earnings compared to non-family firms. We show that both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective, prior research documents show that family firms manage less their earnings relative to non-family firms. Nonetheless, we also look at deviations from these results, mainly due to the differences in the institutional environment, and/or in the management structure. Moreover, there has been a shift from the agency theory to the socioemotional wealth theory to explain family firms' decisions with regards to earnings management. We conclude this chapter by suggesting future avenues for research, in particular in terms of theoretical framework and research design. The discussion about earnings quality continues in Chap. 4, where we investigate accounting conservatism in family firms. (c) Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the interaction between the structure of the top management team, takeover defense mechanisms and firms rate of collective actions. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses elements of agency theory, prospect theory and competitive dynamics research to develop a model for examining heterogeneity in the rate of collective actions among firms in the technology sector. A sample of 299 firm-year observations arrayed into panel regression analyses is used. Findings: The findings from this study show a positive relationship between the size of the top management team and the count of collective actions when takeover defense mechanisms are present. Further this study finds a negative relationship between top management team ownership and collective actions when these same takeover defense mechanisms are present. Additionally, the female ratio of the top management team is negatively related to collective actions. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of technological firms. These relationships may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other elements of the firm's governance structure (i.e. board of directors or shareholders) may play an important role in the strategic decision-making process. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by linking several blocks of literature, top management team literature, competitive dynamics literature and corporate governance literature, into a model to examine firm structural characteristics on the heterogeneity in the propensity to formulate collective actions among firms.

Environmental research has usually highlighted that the existence of slack resources in an organization helps allocate investment to innovative initiatives. However, the existing literature has paid very limited attention to how slack resources can influence the effects of focused and diversified innovations in different ways. Agency theory scholars claim that a manager's first preference when confronted with discretionary resources will not generate positive investments for the firm, but their own opportunistic preferences. The differences between focused and diversified environmental innovations allow us to gain a better understanding of the financial impact of being focused and how slack resources matter in this context. We analyze a longitudinal sample of 5845 environmental patents from the 75 largest companies in the electrical components and equipment industry worldwide. Our results show that high levels of slack resources reduce the existing positive relationship between focused environmental innovations and a firm's financial performance. These results contribute to delineating the theoretical and empirical implications of focused versus diversified environmental innovations and extend the literature on ethical dilemmas concerning managers' use of slack resources in the firm.

This study investigates the role of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in restraining earnings management activities of firms under varying levels of investor protection. Firms manage their earnings less when independent FIIs are among their shareholders, especially for firms in which monitoring is more valuable - firms in weak investor protection countries and when firms have greater growth opportunities. These effects are robust to a quasi-exogenous shock to FIIs' shareholdings, unobserved firm heterogeneity, and alternative earning management measures. FIIs are associated with an increase in foreign director presence on corporate boards and audit committees. (c) 2018, Academy of International Business.

Stewardship theory is a popular alternative to agency theory for studying family firm governance. Despite its contributions to management and family business studies, stewardship theory's assumptions limit its realism and relevance. Using agency theory as a standard of comparison, I discuss stewardship theory's model of man and its assumptions concerning goal alignment and control systems. I also discuss stewardship theory's lack of assumptions about bounded rationality and pre-employment situations since the neglect of those issues reduce its realism and relevance. Based on this discussion, I argue that to increase its realism and relevance, stewardship theory's assumptions should be revised. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

The present study unpacks the relationship between non-profit organizations' (NPOs) governance and organizational effectiveness by investigating the mediating role of volunteers' organizational identity (OI) and their organizational commitment. While management scholars have traditionally focused on for-profit organizations to investigate the mechanisms underlying governance related issues, noteworthy insights may be derived from the analysis of NPOs due to the emerging societal importance of the Third Sector. Stakeholders are progressively requiring a better definition and implementation of NPOs' governance, to ensure their effective and long-term sustainability at the service of the community. However, the extant literature has mainly focused on NPOs' board mechanisms, thus neglecting the critical stakeholders that play a crucial role in the governance of these organizations, such as volunteers. Building on an "enlightened" stakeholder theory perspective, this study proposes and empirically tests a conceptual model that explains the linkages between NPOs' governance effectiveness and organizational effectiveness. Specifically, volunteers' OI and commitment to the NPO are hypothesized as the underlying mechanisms explaining such a relationship. Bootstrapped multi-mediation analysis was used on a sample of 300 respondents who volunteered in NPOs located in 10 Italian provinces. Results confirmed the role of OI and volunteers' commitment as partially mediating variables on the relationship between NPOs' governance effectiveness and organizational effectiveness. Both theoretical and practical implications for NPOs' managers are provided, along with suggestions for future research by stressing the importance of the NPO governance phenomenon and the significant role played by volunteers.

Purpose: The aim of the paper is to examine the association of corporate governance (CG), the firms' characteristics and the financial performance of firms operating in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region after Arab Spring. The study focuses on CG, exemplified by boards' composition and ownership structure. It also explores the possible moderating effects of environmental social and governance characteristics (ESG), leverage and size on the relationship between CG and the company's performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using Thomson-Reuters database, a sample of 67 firms was extracted in the MENA region to measure CG and financial performance post Arab Spring from 2012 to 2016. Panel GLS regression random effects is used to quantify the relationship; robustness is checked by using several alternative regressions and specifications to the performance measure. Findings: The results reveal that board independence (BI) is negatively correlated with firm profitability but ownership concentration and board gender diversification contribute to profits. When firms that voluntarily form a governance committee are examined, ownership is less concentrated. We obtain a stronger impact of good governance on performance in these firms: board composition, in general, and workers' satisfaction generate more profits; and undertaking ESG activities become a more dispensable activity. The effect of board size (BS) and forming a governance committee are studied and ensuing recommendations are drawn. In addition, relevant internal control of firms' characteristics that strongly predict firms' market values are discussed in the context of agency and stewardship theories. Originality/value: Despite the fact that governance-performance nexus has been extensively discussed and examined, the focus of this volume of research is on western developed countries. The growing economies of the MENA countries, and the limited governance-performance literature in the MENA context have created a demand to understand the governance environment in these countries and its influence on firm's performance. In this region where firms' owners are mainly family members, governments and/or institutions, governance is typically weak; moreover, ownership concentration is expected to guarantee good performance, as the role of independent directors becomes ineffective. For firms where ownership is more diluted, a sound governance system should be established to replace ownership concentration, and to more efficiently monitor management, and consequently improve firm performance. Therefore, this study not only contributes a summary of the prevailing corporate structure in MENA. Moreover, it explains the settings where both the stewardship and agency theories apply in MENA firms. Some recommendation on the importance of changes to the existing governance rules are highlighted in terms of more rules requiring board independence, board gender diversity, limits on board size and establishing governance committees.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between the readability of annual reports and corporate performance in Qatari listed firms while controlling for a firm's competitive position, governance structure and specific features such as size, age and industry type. Design/methodology/approach: This study relies on both agency theory and legitimacy theory to develop testable hypotheses. It uses a sample of 126 firm-year listed companies in the Qatar Stock Exchange to test obfuscation in the annual reports through examining the association between the readability of Narrative Disclosures (NDs) and corporate profitability, financial risk and agency costs for the period from 2014-2016. Findings: The findings show that firms with higher annual report readability are more profitable and have lower agency costs, which is an indication of the existence of "obfuscation." Qatari firms may use narrative complexity as a disclosure strategy to enhance their image and consequently maintain their social legitimacy. Research limitations/implications: Although the study findings suffer from limited global generalization, they can be generalized across Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Thus, future cross-country research is encouraged. Practical implications: The findings encourage Qatari policymakers to instate a policy for "Plain English" writing to make NDs easy to read by international investors. Originality/value: This study is one of very few studies that examines the readability of annual reports in emerging market economies, i.e. Qatar. The study contributes to the paucity of research that examines English-written annual reports in non-English speaking countries. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The negative association between risk and return is paradoxical because risk-averse managers should only expose themselves to higher risk for higher returns. The paradox is resolved, however, if we recognize that risk-averse managers may be taking decisions that pose risk for shareholders and not for their own careers. We draw on the career concerns literature to explain why decisions that pose risk to shareholder returns can enhance managerial careers. We provide evidence that the risk-return paradox is exacerbated by agency problems that contribute to career concerns (i.e., CEO career horizon), and mitigated by various governance mechanisms that curb the agency problem by aligning managers with shareholders (such as monitoring by the market for corporate control, large block owners, institutional owners, vigilant board, and CEO incentive alignment). Our study sheds light on the role of career concerns and corporate governance in resolving the risk-return paradox. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: Based on the socioemotional wealth (SEW) perspective and agency theory, the purpose of this paper is to examine how the introduction of the 2006 Corporate Governance (CG) Guidelines and family governance affected the level of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting of non-financial companies in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use multivariate regression to analyse 2,637 firm-level annual observations, from 1996 to 2011 annual reports of Bangladeshi publicly listed non-financial-sector companies, to investigate how firm-level CG quality affects CSR disclosure in family and non-family firms. Findings: CG quality significantly increases the level of CSR disclosure and this relationship is stronger prior to the new CG Guidelines. Family firms' CSR reporting levels are significantly lower than non-family firms', and this effect is stronger after the change in the CG Guidelines. CEO duality, the presence of an audit committee and profitability improve family-firm CSR reporting in Bangladesh, while non-family CSR disclosures are positively associated with board size and firm competition. Board independence is not related to CSR disclosure. Originality/value: The authors provide evidence of the benefit of the CG Guidelines' introduction on company CSR disclosure in an emerging economy and the importance of specific governance mechanisms that differentiate family and non-family-firm CSR disclosures in Bangladesh using a SEW framework.

Purpose: As the primary decision makers, chief executive officers (CEOs) play pivotal roles in firm innovation. However, little is known regarding how CEOs influence the exploitation and exploration paradox. To advance theory and research, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the joint effects of CEO tenure and CEO-chair duality on a firm's shifting emphasis between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes the approach of a longitudinal sample of 81 US pharmaceutical firms. Findings: As CEOs' tenure advance, their firms' percentage of exploitative innovation increases. Furthermore, non-duality (separation of board chair and CEO) further strengthens the positive relationship between CEO tenure and the percentage of exploitative innovation. Research limitations/implications: This study integrates upper echelons theory and behavioral agency theory to juxtapose the effects of CEOs on technological innovation. This study extends knowledge of strategic leadership and innovation by showing that CEOs influence the balance between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Furthermore, this study also contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating that monitoring vigilance could inhibit capable CEOs from pursuing more exploratory innovation. Practical implications: Boards of directors should allow CEOs to have greater discretion over innovation, and vigilant monitoring and control may force CEOs to focus less on exploration. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies that explicitly investigate how CEO influences a firm's emphasis on exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the impact of two monitoring mechanisms: family ownership (FO) and financial reporting quality (FRQ) on investment efficiency (IE) over the period of 2007-2014 for listed firms on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ two-dimensional pooled OLS cluster at the firm and year level, two-stage least square regression and feasible generalized lease square regression regression methods. Findings: The findings suggest that higher FRQ and FO are associated with higher IE. Further, the authors report that higher FRQ and FO mitigate over- and under-investment. The impact of FRQ on IE is stronger (weaker) for family-controlled businesses. The results for these particular estimates are robust for alternative estimation techniques and measures of FRQ and FO. Originality/value: The study draws on both agency and behavioral agency theories and therefore contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, the authors examine a relationship between FRQ and IE. Second, the authors test the impact of FO on IE. Third, the authors test the moderating impact of FO on the relationship between FRQ and the IE of family and non-family firms in relatively less regulated emerging market.

Purpose: In order to deepen our knowledge of governance of family firms, the purpose of this paper is to focus our attention on the relation between family owners who are members of the board of directors and firm performance. Also, this study sheds more light on how the generation in charge of the family firm affects that relationship, as generational involvement may be a unique predictor of governance behavior in these firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors applied a cross-sectional ordinary least squares regression model to test the hypotheses on a sample of 313 non-listed Spanish family SMEs. The authors suggest the possibility of a non-linear relationship between the percentage of ownership by family members of the board of directors and firm performance, and specifically, the authors propose an S-shaped effect that implies two breakpoints. Findings: The authors find not only that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists, but also an S-shaped relationship between family board members' ownership and firm performance in family SMEs. Nevertheless, the results are different in comparing first-, second- and later-generation family firms. Originality/value: This is one of the few empirical studies that examine the relationship between family board ownership and firm performance in the context of non-listed family SMEs. The authors consider that the influences of family directors on the board of directors as well as the concentration of family ownership on the board of directors are worth studying in non-listed family SMEs. Moreover, previous studies have focused mainly on large listed family firms but not on unlisted ones. (c) 2019, Amaia Maseda, Txomin Iturralde, Gloria Aparicio, Lotfi Boulkeroua and Sarah Cooper.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize corporate entrepreneurial strategy using collaborative dynamics of contingency and agency theories, and to demonstrate how some constructs of these two theories are integrated to support long-term strategies of entrepreneurial firms in sustaining their competitive advantages and enhancing their performance. Design/methodology/approach: Review of literature on strategic entrepreneurship, firm growth, contingency and agency theories were explored to support the conceptualized framework of the entrepreneurial strategy developed in this paper. The authors adopt a vignette approach to problematize theoretical gaps identified. The vignette was also used to embody the entrepreneurial strategy matrix developed. Findings: This paper suggests that the effectiveness of corporate entrepreneurial strategies is influenced by the impacts of contingent environment and agency problem of goal conflicts. It provides some propositions for qualitative and empirical research that will extend the rigours of strategic entrepreneurship literature. Practical implications: This paper highlights the implications of understanding and adopting diverse competitive and sustenance strategies. It provides avenues for entrepreneurial firms to take cognizance and use of the contingency and agency approaches to influence their long-term strategic directions to stay competitive. Institutional authorities will also benefit from having a conceptual reference and guide to further improve their entrepreneurship policies. Originality/value: The authors took three novel steps to address the existing gap in the literature. First, the theories of entrepreneurship, contingency and agency were bound together and unified as a single framework to conceptualize entrepreneurial strategy. Second, the identified gaps were embodied in a vignette to problematize the theoretical issues and lastly, some testable propositions were put forward to explain different forms of entrepreneurial strategy. The authors also developed a corporate entrepreneurial strategy matrix based on the Covin and Miles (1999) forms of corporate entrepreneurship. It forms the basis for the propositions.

Purpose: Effective use of human resources is important for the profitability and governance of family firms. In a study of the human resource management (HRM) practices of US Hispanic family firms, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the implications of agency and stewardship governance. Design/methodology/approach: To better understand HRM practices in US Hispanic family firms, the authors present findings from 169 US firms to hypothesize the extent of HRM development in Hispanic family firms (n=70) vs non-Hispanic family firms (n=99). Findings: Results indicated that HRM practices in Hispanic family firms are less structured than those of non-Hispanic family firms; however, when Hispanic family firms effectively use HRM practices, they will have greater financial success. Originality/value: Therefore, the results suggest that Hispanic family firm leaders display relatively low agency governance and high stewardship governance. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Prior research in agency theory views outside directors as being mostly extrinsically motivated by the potential for financial rewards, and as such stresses the value of using director stock options and equity to incentivize outside directors to pursue strategic risks. We draw on and extend agency-theory by arguing that outside directors are primarily intrinsically motivated, and therefore excessive emphasis on pecuniary rewards and punishments can ironically subvert a director's motives away from strategic risk-taking. In particular, we claim that more important than extrinsic rewards and government regulations is creating a secure environment for directors so that they may exercise their fiduciary duties without fear of litigation. We test our theory on a sample of 196 S&P 500 firms from 2005 to 2015 and find that the pressures imposed on the board through external regulations and controls can often backfire and result in outside directors signing off on less risky expenditure. A strong implication of these findings is no real substitute exists to creating a safe environment for directors, where they have the freedom to pursue the long-term interests of the principals, even if this goes against the short-termism of capital markets.

We investigate private firms' ability to identify and replace poorly performing managers across countries. We document three main findings. First, private firms are more likely to retain poorly performing managers in countries where legal institutions that protect minority investors are weak. Second, private firms are more likely to retain poorly performing managers than public firms only in countries where governance mechanisms inherent in public equity markets limit managerial entrenchment in public firms. Third, private firm managers are less likely to be replaced even when poor performance continues for relatively long horizons. Overall, our findings provide new evidence on the potential vulnerability of minority shareholders in private firms. (c) 2019, Academy of International Business.

Although the link between managerial ownership and firm performance is often explained in relation to a firm's risk-taking behavior, little is known about how managerial ownership affects corporate risk-taking in industries characterized by high financial and operational risks, like the restaurant industry. To understand this important and understudied link, our study draws upon agency theory to examine the relationship between managerial ownership and franchising, typically a risk-reduction strategy of restaurant firms. Our results from panel data analyses using a sample of 962 firm-year observations show that managerial ownership is negatively associated with degree of franchising. Further, we find that after considering the scope of managerial discretion, there is a U-shaped relationship between managerial ownership and degree of franchising such that the degree of franchising decreases as managerial ownership increases up to a certain level, but then increases in tandem as managerial ownership increases to higher levels. Our results indicate that there is an optimal level of franchising associated with managerial ownership, implying that owners can influence their firms' risk-taking behavior by setting target managerial ownership goals and designing effective incentive contracts.

This paper offers a fresh perspective on executive compensation by offering a new paradigm for choosing executive compensation structure based on environmental factors and firm size. This new perspective uses agency theory as a theoretical foundation. The availability of information, primarily information related to the agent, has typically been of utmost concern in the compensation selection process. However, a predominant focus on cognitive or behavioral information of the agent neglects the relative importance and impact of environmental forces in this process. This study evaluates the composition of the compensation contract using fluctuating environmental dimensions as the primary determinant. Specifically, we examine environmental munificence, dynamism, and complexity and the influence of varying levels of each of these variables and their interaction on the optimal choice of compensation contract utilized for both large firms and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This externally focused view of compensation contract creation underscores the significance of environmental factors in determining contract selection while also acknowledging the necessity of principals utilizing information related to both the agent and the environment. Furthermore, we argue that top executive compensation structures for large organizations and non-adaptive SMEs should differ from those of adaptive SMEs.

Moral hazard can hinder both the realization and the effectiveness of research and development (R&D) supply relations. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no empirical studies investigating the determinants of moral hazard under the specific circumstances of R&D supply relations. Based on a study on 104 cases, this article will help to fill that gap. The results not only confirm information asymmetries as determinants, as predicted by principal-agent theory, but also reveal surprising effects of additional factors. Thus, we show that the general explanation of moral hazard needs to be adapted to the specifics of a concrete exchange situation. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Scholars have long studied drivers of entrepreneurial behavior among established firms. Yet little is known about how individual factors shape a firm's choice to pursue entrepreneurship. We draw on behavioral agency theory to explore the role of equity incentives in driving corporate entrepreneurship. Our findings suggest CEOs avoid corporate entrepreneurial behaviors as their option wealth increases. However industry dynamics also prove to be an important contingency when predicting the effects of both restricted stock and stock options on the likelihood that the CEO engages in corporate entrepreneurship. Our findings provide a theoretical platform for predicting dimensions of entrepreneurial behavior and highlight effects of CEO equity ownership.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine CEO compensation in immigrant-founder firms vs CEO compensation in non-immigrant-founder firms. Design/methodology/approach: Univariate and multi-variate tests are implemented. CEO compensation is designed as a function of the origin of a firm's founder (immigrant or native), executive characteristics and firm characteristics with firm and year fixed effect regressions. CEO compensation is measured with cash pay, equity-based pay and total compensation. Findings: CEOs of immigrant-founder firms receive higher equity-based compensation and higher total pay than CEOs of non-immigrant-founder firms and the levels of their equity-based and total compensation are contingent upon their stock ownership. CEOs in high-growth immigrant-founder firms receive higher stock-based pay than their counterparts in non-immigrant-founder firms. Immigrant-founder family firms compensate their CEOs with higher equity-based pay than immigrant-founder non-family firms. Practical implications: The paper provides some explanations on the success of immigrant-founder firms. CEO compensation designs in immigrant-founder firms can be adopted in other firms. Social implications: The paper provides some rationale for immigration legislation to encourage the talented to come to the USA and start their business in the USA. Originality/value: This paper is the first to study executive compensation practice in immigrant-founder firms. The findings provide some practical and policy implications on immigration reform.

Studies in developed economies show that family-owned non-financial firms outperform others, explained by agency theory and protection of family capital. Findings in emerging economies are equivocal, while studies of family domination and banks' performance are scant. This paper examines the profit-performance of family-dominated banks in Bangladesh under competing hypotheses of bank-market structure. Using panel estimation, we model the profit-performance of banks and show that the principal drivers are costs, efficiency and non-performing loans. Family-dominated banks are less efficient and less profitable. The sources of weaker performance are higher non-performing loans and higher costs, with indirect evidence of poor corporate governance.

We empirically investigate the largely unexplored relationship between corporate top management teams (TMT) and CVC unit managers. Doing so, we provide new insights into the interplay between TMT decisions and CVC managers' behaviour and how agency conflicts between them influence the survival of CVC units. Using a proprietary dataset of 64 CVC units we apply fsQCA in order to identify the interrelatedness, causal asymmetry and equifinality of agency-related conditions leading to survival. We relativise former literature by demonstrating that financial incentivisation of CVC managers need to be complemented by additional factors to impact the survival of CVC units. Further, we conclude that the decision-making autonomy of CVC managers seem to work as a form of non-financial incentive. Finally, we demonstrate that the configuration of providing strategic support, investing with high strategic proximity, and non-autonomously acting CVC managers is related to non-survival of the CVC unit.

This chapter illustrates the main issues with respect to innovation process within family firms. In the first part, it describes the main theories underlying the innovation process of family firms (agency theory, altruism, portfolio theory, stewardship theory, socioemotional wealth perspective). In the second part, it exposes the R&D underinvestment problem in large companies with a focus on the effect of the family ownership on the R&D investments. In the third part, it describes the effect of family ownership on the innovation output with a focus on the kind of innovation (radical vs. incremental). In the fourth section, studies exploring the innovation strategies of family firms (prospectors, analysers, defenders, reactors) are examined. In the fifth section, it sheds light on the innovation management process of family firms. In this part, it explores the issues of internal innovation process (functional vs. cross-functional structure) and of the partnerships with external actors aimed to generate innovation.

This chapter analyses the relationship between ownership structure and leverage, providing an integrated theoretical approach that combines traditional financial theories, agency theory, and recently developed theories relating to non-financial preferences. The results show that, after controlling for endogeneity, being a family firm has a positive effect on the propensity to incur debt. These findings add to the existing body of literature and underline the need for a multi-theoretical approach when explaining the capital structure of family firms. The authors apply panel data methodology to control for individual heterogeneity of family firms. The chapter uses a sample of Spanish firms operating in the tourism industry. (c) 2020, IGI Global.

We take the perspective that considering the affective motives of dominant owners is essential to understanding business exit. Drawing on a refinement of behavioral agency theory, we argue that family-controlled firms are less likely than non-family-controlled firms to exit and tend to endure increased financial distress to avoid losses to the family's socioemotional wealth (SEW) embodied in the firm. Yet, when confronted with different exit options and when performance heuristics suggest that exit is unavoidable, family firms are more likely to exit via merger, which we argue saves some SEW, although it is less satisfactory financially. In contrast, nonfamily firms are more likely to exit via sale or dissolution, options that are more prone to offer higher financial returns than mergers. Family and nonfamily firms thus show different orders of exit options. We find support for these arguments in a longitudinal matched sample of privately held firms. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

Capital structure is the outcome of market conditions, financial decisions taken by the firm, and credit rationing of fund providers. Research on the capital structure of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has gained momentum in recent years. The present study aims to identify key contributors, key areas, current dynamics, and suggests future research directions in the field of the capital structure of SMEs. This paper adopts a systematic literature review methodology along with bibliometric, network, and content analysis on a sample of 262 studies taken from the Web of Science database to examine the research activities that have taken place on this topic. Most influential papers are identified based on citations and PageRank, along with the most influential authors. The co-citation network is developed to see the intellectual structure of this research area. Applying bibliometric tools, four research clusters have been identified and content analysis performed on the papers identified in the clusters. It is found that the major research focus in this area is around theory testing--mainly, pecking order theory, trade-off theory, and agency theory. Determinants of capital structure, trade credit, corporate governance, and bankruptcy are also the prominent research topics in this field. Also, this study has identified the research gaps and has proposed five actionable research directions for the future. (c) 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Top management teams (TMTs) and boards of directors (boards) face increasingly turbulent environments as they strategically lead firms toward superior firm performance. The dominant theoretical lens about these two groups is agency theory, which focuses on the need for independence. We suggest that the environment in which the TMT and board govern is broader than conceptualized by agency theory, and thus theories regarding strategic leadership also require expansion. Drawing from the multiteam systems literature and broader systems theory, we offer a new consideration of the TMT and board as part of a strategic-oriented multiteam system, which we refer to as a strategic leadership system. The core premise of our theorizing is that TMTs and boards that strongly emphasize attention to both working independently and interdependently enhance their group and shared task performance, and in turn, firm performance. We further nuance this theorizing by describing how external environmental characteristics (i.e., munificence, complexity, dynamism) strengthen or weaken the influence of attention to working independently or interdependently, thereby shifting the zones of system effectiveness. Based on this theorizing, we offer a 2 3 2 framework combined with practical recommendations for strategic leaders. Additional implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed. (c) 2020 Academy of Management Review.

Previous literature has found that listed family firms underperform their nonfamily counterparts in terms of environmental performance, but has not explained why this occurs. We address this research gap by hypothesizing that training and development practices (i.e., managerial practices devoted to providing training and development for the workforce) mediate the relationship between family blockholders and environmental performance. Using a sample of 33,901 firm-year observations from 2002 to 2016 distributed across 56 countries and employing the structural equation model technique, we find that investment in training and development practices explains almost half of the negative relationship between family blockholders and environmental performance. Our study contributes to the agency theory debate on principal-principal problems by explaining why family blockholders could damage other blockholders and minority shareholders.

Purpose: This paper provides a conceptual discussion of the bidirectional relationship between knowledge management (KM) and intellectual capital (IC) in a specific subset of knowledge-based organisations, i.e. professional sport organisations. Through the review and conceptual discussion of two relevant research themes, i.e. KM strategies for IC value creation and IC codification, this paper aims to highlight research gaps useful to future research. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply a systematic literature review method to analyse 66 management and accounting studies on KM and IC in sport organisations. Internal and external validity tests support the methodology adopted. Findings: The authors provide a conceptual model to explain how KM strategies about IC investments can be optimal, i.e. they create value for all the stakeholders but also suboptimal, i.e. they create value only for a group of stakeholders. Next, they provide evidence of the opportunistic use of the codification associated with IC investments that impair financial reporting information transparency and mislead managers and investors. Practical implications: The results are informative for managers, regulators and policymakers to mitigate the inefficiencies regarding KM and IC codification and decisions. Originality/value: This study contributes to the understanding of the bidirectional relationship between KM and IC in knowledge-based organisations by focussing on professional sport organisations in which KM and IC have played an important role for a long time. It also includes future avenues for advances in managing, measuring and reporting IC. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research Question/Issue: We review the literature on the relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the theoretical lenses that researchers apply when studying strategic leadership and innovation, most notably agency theory and upper echelons theory. We review the innovation constructs and measures that scholars employ, and we survey the links among strategic leaders' characteristics and technological innovation. Ultimately, we organize the literature into an integrative framework that provides a concise overview of the extant knowledge, and we outline an agenda for future research. Theoretical/Academic Implications: First, we offer scholars a discipline-spanning overview of the extant knowledge on the topic. Second, by integrating important aspects of corporate governance, such as the role of the board of directors, incentives for the chief executive officer or the top management team, and firm ownership, into the context of technological innovation, we highlight the vital role it plays in the realm of technological innovation. Third, we provide a useful guide for scholars and direct their work towards fruitful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer insights for practitioners interested in better understanding the bidirectional relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. In particular, our framework and our detailed analysis of the impact of strategic leaders on technological innovation can guide shareholders and board members in matters related to board composition as well as top executive selection and compensation.

Whereas the corporate life cycle hypothesis says firms follow structured goals along their life cycle, others argue that corporate governance objectives vary independently of predetermined life cycle stages. This study examines the impact of the corporate life cycle on corporate governance in emerging markets, where firms can self-select into stricter rules by adopting an exchange listing level that fits the governance needs of the organization independently of life cycle requirements. We find the listing-level decision is a better predictor of corporate governance quality than corporate life cycle. Firms signal improvements in corporate governance by bonding to more stringent regulation; they determine the corporate governance quality that matches their needs at any point during their life-cycle.

This study examines the impact of chief executive officer (CEO) duality (a chief executive operating chair of board and leader of a firm) of newly privatized Vietnamese firms on the level of corporate entrepreneurship; this understanding is used to throw light on the extent to which a position of strategic agility is achieved. Specifically, does CEO duality enable firms to keep consistent with their vision, while remaining flexible in their business model? Data from a survey of 114 CEOs of board and top management team members in privatized firms in Vietnam were collected and examined through a combination of agency theory and stewardship theory. The research finds that CEO duality does not necessarily lead to a higher degree of entrepreneurial activity in privatized Vietnamese firms. The results have policy implications for shaping corporate governance and management implications for firms striving to be competitive, in ways that advance corporate entrepreneurship in economies such as Vietnam that are both emerging and pursuing privatization.

Innovation contributes to a firm's long-term competitive advantages but also involves significant risk and uncertainty. As agency theory predicts, CEOs are self-interested and risk-averse, and thus are reluctant to engage in innovation investments. However, the extent to which CEOs are self-interested and the mechanisms through which self-interested CEOs affect firm innovation have not been empirically tested. To fill this gap, we propose that CEOs possess a mix of both self-preserving and other-regarding motives, and build a mediation model in which CEO values affect firm innovation via firms' long-term orientation. Based on a three-phase (from 2014 to 2016) survey of 436 Chinese manufacturing firms, we find that CEOs with high self-regarding values reduce innovation efforts and performance by damaging a firm's long-term orientation. Moreover, CEO tenure, CEO duality, and environmental uncertainty weaken the relationship between CEO values and firm innovation via long-term orientation. Our study enriches the innovation literature by extending the basic assumptions of agency theory and by providing empirical evidence to determine whether and how self-regarded CEOs affect firm innovation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of corporate governance index on the cost of equity in companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange. This study collects data from 975 observations during the period 2012 to 2018 to test the hypotheses using multiple linear regression model for the panel data. In this research, the independent variable of corporate governance index comprises of 27 specific corporate governance attributes. The results of hypothesis testing showed that corporate governance has a negative and significant effect on the rate of capital cost. In other words, the quality of corporate governance can lower the rate of capital cost. This result suggests that, by using a powerful corporate governance system and by declining the information asymmetry (increasing transparency) and agency conflict, we would be able to enhance the quality of financial reports. It would strengthen the capital market, attract financial suppliers and investors, and absorb the required financial resources of the firm by a lower rate. The findings of the study suggest that companies are able to reduce the cost of equity by establishing strong corporate governance. This conclusion suggests the importance and effectiveness of corporate governance in the cost of equity. (c) The Author(s).

The study addresses the signs of earnings management in unlisted companies, comparing the situation in family firms and non-family firms. We adopt arguments from agency theory, and stewardship theory, which are supplemented with the assumptions of socio-emotional wealth literature, to justify our research model. The sample is composed of 263 audited Spanish companies with a turnover of more than 200 million euros, which were analysed in the period from 2011 to 2015. Results indicate that family firms are less prone to the practices of earnings management than non-family firms, and that the association between family firm status and earnings management is moderated by the firm generation. This work contributes to the literature on the quality of financial information in both family firms and unlisted companies, exploring new areas of research.

Corporate political activity (CPA) is an important area of research due to the high level of CPA in which many firms engage. Prior research has focused on the demand side of the political market. In this paper, we consider how choices made by CEOs regarding their interaction with the supply side of the political market can have performance implications for the firm. In particular, we argue that where CPA focuses less on supporting extreme ideologies, these investments in CPA will be positively associated with higher performance, and thus are more effective. Next, relying on agency theory, we argue that firms in which top managers are less likely to behave opportunistically will engage in such effective CPA. We test our theory on a panel of archival data generated by combining business data with political records, and we find strong support for our arguments. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study is to explore the quality of financial information of Spanish firms, by comparing family firms with non-family firms, and relating this quality with corporate governance practices. For this purpose, a sample of 650 Spanish firms was analysed during the period 2011-2016. Based on agency theory and socioemotional wealth literature, the results show a higher quality of financial information in family firms, a relationship which is reinforced by corporate governance factors. Our results are consistent with the scant previous research, and with the premises of agency theory, which indicate lower asymmetry of information between owners and managers in the singular context of family firms. Additionally, our work provides evidence that the participation of women on the board boosts the quality of financial information in family firms, contributing to the justification of family firm heterogeneity in terms of earnings management. This study contributes to reducing the gap in the literature on the influence of the family business context and the influence of women on the board on the quality of financial reporting.

Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to extend agency theory in the context of tunneling by exploring how different owner types seek private benefits of control. Specifically, we examine how information asymmetries and board representation create different pressures for tunneling for state-owned, business group-owned, and family-owned firms. We tested our hypotheses with a meta-analytic structural equation model. Research Findings/Insights: Our findings show that the relationship between ownership and tunneling differs across owner types in terms of both directionality and magnitude. Our study offers a substantial theoretical contribution to the principal-principal problem literature by theorizing and testing variations of the problem among owners. Our study also advances our understanding of the role of ownership in firms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings have important theory-building implications for the principal-principal literature. Controlling shareholders have been linked to performance outcomes or to tunneling in general, yet little is known about their comparative propensity to engage in tunneling. Our results, however, highlight that the propensity to engage in tunneling varies substantially among controlling shareholders. Furthermore, in the robustness checks, we disconfirm some of the assumptions of the principal-principal literature. This study demonstrates the need to theorize about specific types of ownership and reassess the core arguments of principal-principal theory. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights for policymakers interested in mitigating the risk of minority shareholders being expropriated by the controlling shareholder. As the key driver of tunneling appears to be access to private information and knowledge of the firm, we offer recommendations on what policymakers can do to minimize the asymmetry of information.

Global apparel brands that source production from less developed countries are increasingly exposed to risks that arise from human rights violations. Despite widely publicized factory safety failures, reactionary regulatory efforts remain inadequate. This situation is commonly attributed to unyielding downward price pressure imposed on factories by Western brands. To address this problem, this research develops a comprehensive cost model for low-cost apparel production following a total cost of ownership approach. Comprehensive production data for cotton T-shirts from nine Bangladeshi factories provide the basis for model construction. The model reveals that materials generate the bulk of production costs (77%) for a T-shirt, in contrast to worker wages which generate only 2 percent of the total production cost per unit (e.g., 16 cents out of a $8USD retail price). The TCO provides fundamental insights, grounded in real data, to guide policy and regulation among stakeholders in high-risk, low-cost supply chains. Based on the research context, results are considered through the lens of agency theory to provide managerial implications for relevant stakeholders. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study examines whether auditor-client economic bonding and corporate governance moderate the adverse effects of principal-principal agency problems on earnings quality in U.K.-listed family firms. We find that although earnings management is lower in family firms, there is a higher tendency of earnings management for those firms with economic bonding. However, such an impact may be moderated by good governance mechanisms where the latter may alleviate the adverse effects of the lack of auditor independence on the association between earnings management and family firms.

This study tests the catering theory and explores the main determinants of dividend payments across a sample of eleven emerging countries. There is evidence of catering to investor sentiment for dividends in Middle Eastern and North African countries. Dividend payers are mature, profitable, large firms with lower growth opportunities, and high dividend premiums, which supports the catering, lifecycle, and agency theories. Catering behavior persists even after controlling for the effect of Arab Spring. Difference-in-difference analysis shows that countries highly affected by the political transition period are less likely to pay dividends in the post-Arab Spring period than less affected countries. Catering decreases significantly in the post-Arab Spring period as compared with during- and pre-Arab Spring periods, suggesting that investors prefer that managers retain earnings to reinvest and grow during unstable economic conditions. Furthermore, catering persists in countries with high corruption levels and poor legal quality to reduce agency cost, and substitute for weak legal systems with poor enforcement of laws.

Agency theory considers information the most decisive element in investor-entrepreneur relations. Building on the notion of better-than-average (BTA) beliefs, we investigate the extent to which information asymmetries between investors and entrepreneurs may also emerge on paths other than the self-interest or opportunistic behaviour of rational actors. Based on a data set of 176 investors from 23 different German financial institutions, we conduct a conditional process analysis that indicates approximately 30% of all professional investors hold unjustified BTA beliefs regarding their abilities to identify flaws in new venture ideas, which leads to inaccurate financing decisions. We further find evidence that investors generally tend to underfund start-up projects if they perceive little similarity with the founders, but overfund projects if interpersonal similarities are high. Moreover, we demonstrate that high BTA beliefs facilitate engagement in competition with peers for the best investment option. (c) 2019 European Academy of Management

Family business literature shows that family and nonfamily firms differ with respect to their financial reporting decisions. However, although the literature on financial reporting in family firms has developed over the last ten years, it is mostly oriented towards earnings management and management control issues. Given the specific characteristics of family firms in financing and governance, do their published accounting data have less value relevance for public investors than in the case of non-family firms? How do family firms differ from one another on this issue? While different theoretical perspectives have been used to tackle this problem, two main theses based on agency theory were the most frequently called upon. In fact, the views of interests' alignment and entrenchment are competing in explaining the differential quality of family and non-family firms accounting numbers. This paper draws on this theoretical lens and contributes to filling this research gap by conducting a comparative analysis of earnings' value relevance for a sample of quoted French family and non-family firms. First, it examines whether family firms show more or less relevant accounting earnings than non-family firms. Second, it seeks to study the heterogeneity of family firms in terms of earnings figures' relevance by considering the extent of family control and the involvement of a family CEO as mechanisms leading to alignment or entrenchment. The findings show that family firms exhibit better earnings' value relevance than non-family firms. In addition, when owning families' control becomes high, earnings' value relevance worsens, which suggests a possible entrenchment effect on behalf of controlling families.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of ownership structure on merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions of Brazilian listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is an applied and explanatory research based on secondary data. The sample is comprises non-financial companies listed on the BM&FBovespa between 1998 and 2007. Considering that the dependent variable is binary, the authors estimate panel data logistic regression models. Considering the existence of conflicts of interest among those who have the decision-making power and the supplier of capital for M&A transactions, they draw upon the Agency Theory to develop the theoretical hypotheses. Findings: The results show that, for a sample of Brazilian non-financial companies listed on the BM&FBovespa (B3), from 1998 to 2007, Brazilian firms present, on average, a highly concentrated ownership structure and the major controlling shareholders are families or the State. These characteristics are negatively related to the likelihood of M&A transactions, as most of these controlling shareholders are reluctant to adopt mechanisms that reduce their control. Research limitations/implications: With regard to the limitations, this study considered only the M&A definitions as stated by the Bureau van Dijk database. In this sense, future studies may analyze the effects of ownership structure based on other M&A definitions and typologies. In addition, the study is limited to the period from 1998 to 2007, which is prior to the international financial crisis. Future studies may extend the analysis period to include the post-crisis period (2008) to check if there are differences in M&A strategies before and after the crisis. Practical implications: From a managerial perspective, the results show that minority shareholders have little or no influence over an M&A decision, so they cannot decide on the use of resources for fast growth and access to new markets through M&A. Thus, the investment decision must take into account the nature and the quality of the controlling shareholder. Social implications: This study shows a significant and negative effect of ownership concentration on the likelihood of M&A transactions. In part, this result demonstrates the importance of understanding the behavior of controlling shareholders before inferring on other key aspects that the M&A literature tends to make fundamental in explaining M&A decisions in publicly traded companies, particularly, in an environment of low minority shareholder protection. Originality/value: Previous studies have partly found that the M&A decision is motivated by individual advantages obtained from increasing the size of the firm, or from managerial hubris. The results show that these hypotheses do not hold in the Brazilian context. Moreover, the results indicate that M&A decisions are associated with the characteristics of the controlling shareholder, their level of ownership concentration and their typology, contributing to the agency debate on whether the incentive or the entrenchment effect prevails in the context of the agency problem between controlling and minority shareholders, particularly, in an institutional environment of low shareholder protection.

Based on the agency theory, this paper analyzes whether family firms pay more dividends compared to no-family firms and identifies whether the board composition affects the dividend policy. Brazil and Chile have established mandatory dividends, retain lower cash holdings, pay higher dividends compared with other markets in the region. The sample of study is composed by 853 observations from 49 Brazilian and 32 Chilean top publicly listed firms in terms of market capitalization over the 11-year period from 2004 to 2014. Using an unbalanced panel data, results indicate that family controlled firms distribute more dividends and board composition namely; board size and the proportion of women on the board have a significant and positive impact on the dividend policy of the firm. By contrast, Chairman of Board - Chief Executive Office (COB-CEO) duality signficantly. Thus, dividend policy constitutes an effective corporate governance mechanism in mitigating the family' expropriation of minority shareholders' wealth. (c) 2021 European Journal of Family Business.

This study examined the strategic planning process used in U.S. public company boardrooms, with a particular focus on companies that used board-level Strategic Planning Committees (SPCs) as opposed to those that engaged the full board in strategic planning oversight (which we call "strategic planning overall" or "SPO" firms). Based on interviews with 8 SPC members and 12 directors from SPO firms, we found a number of similarities in SPC and SPO processes, as well as a number of key differences. Overall, it is clear that there often can be a fundamental tension between management and directors with respect to the responsibility for strategic planning. There also can be significant information asymmetries arising from agency theoretic assumptions requiring board independence and arms-length interactions. Organizational scope may, within limits, constrain these assumptions. Such conditions increase both resource and information processing demands on the board, creating a need for greater formality in the board's strategic planning processes. These demands increase the need for paradoxical approaches that can accommodate greater flexibility in board-management interactions. The paradox lies in the board's ability to simultaneously meet and balance agency theoretic, resource dependence based and information processing demands. The contrasting organizational logics that are in play result in paradoxes that influence whether and in what form a board-level SPC should be constituted. The evidence suggests that constituting and structuring SPCs to embrace more collaborative interactions between the board and management could be helpful in dealing with the contrasting requirements and tensions that arise in certain firms. Embracing paradoxes and modifying governance approaches to include collaborative interactions with management may also help in ensuring that the board's strategic planning processes are equipped to deal with the challenges that confront the organization. Ultimately, individual company directors will need to determine whether and in what form a board-level SPC would add value to their governance structure and processes. Our interview-based evidence suggests that firm size and director experience are important considerations in the choice of how the board should oversee strategy. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Although acquisitions rarely deliver the anticipated value acquiring firms estimate, it remains a popular strategy for growth. We draw upon agency theory to investigate two types of stakes acquiring firms can obtain during an acquisition to ensure greater post-acquisition value - voting rights and cash flow rights. Using domestic acquisition data in Japan over 12 years to test our hypotheses, we find that greater voting rights directly improve value creation and positively moderate the effect of cash flow rights to improve acquiring firm value. This study sheds light on the strategic mechanisms crucial for post-acquisition integration value creation, and highlights acquisition strategies.

Purpose: As widely known and well established, strategic decision-making at family firms is an interface between business interests and family considerations. The purpose of this paper is to understand the underlying basis of decision-making in setting corporate strategy and designing chief executive officer (CEO) compensation at founder- vis-a-vis descendant-led family firms in the Indian pharmaceutical sector. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 106 BSE-listed pharmaceutical companies have been studied over the period 2012-2017 resulting in a total of 636 firm-year observations. Impact of family involvement in business (FIB) on corporate strategy and CEO compensation has been analysed by constructing multivariate panel data regression models. To deal with the problem of endogeneity, Arellano-Bond (1991) dynamic panel data estimation procedure has moreover been conducted. Findings: Supporting stewardship theory, founder-owned and governed firms have been found to favour "growth" strategy and distribute "conservative" executive pay, thereby exerting a positive moderating impact on the strategy-compensation linkage. On the contrary, descendants/second-generation entrepreneurs have put forth a "conservative" stance for growth and innovation, and have rather been observed to favour a "liberal" compensation policy, thereby showcasing the application of behavioural agency theory. Originality/value: The research is a novel attempt to unravel the interaction between corporate strategy and CEO compensation in a family firm backdrop carried out in the context of an emerging economy. The study, moreover, adopted an all-encompassing definition of FIB (ownership, management and governance). (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Based on the institutionalized agency theory, this paper aims to analyses the role of earnings management (EM) in mediating the relationship between ownership structure (OS) and the cost of equity capital (COE). Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the above relationship by investigating a sample of 249 European non-financial listed companies during 2005-2012. The authors adopt different measures for both EM and COE and identify three main types of ownership by the majority share of the ultimate owners. Path analysis is used to explore the role of direct, mediated (i.e. EM) and total effects of OS on COE. Findings: While OS directly affects COE, the results support the idea that an EM-mediating effect contributes to further explain this relationship in some ownership structures. Particularly European listed family-owned firms experience lower COE owing to the prevailing direct and negative effect of OS, despite the fact that both accrual and real EM mediate and have a positive effect on COE. In financial institutions-owned firms, only a direct and positive effect can be observed on COE while state-owned firms do not have a direct influence on the COE, although they do reduce real EM, which, in turn, decreases the COE in a mediated effect. Further analysis comparing the Anglo-Saxon context with Continental Europe shows more detailed results. Practical implications: The study marks its entry into the international debate on the evolution in the value relevance of accounting information by arguing that the COE implications of EM depend on institutional factors such as OS and the context investigated. Originality/value: The paper contributes to extant finance, accounting and corporate governance literature by providing new, robust evidence on the mediating role of EM in defining COE for different ownership types and their diverse risk-taking propensities in Continental Europe, which differs from the Anglo-Saxon context both institutionally and legally.

Purpose: Although principal-agent theory has gained a prominent place in research, its negative image of self-serving managers is frequently criticized. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine how existing theories of agency and stewardship can be combined by using behavioral characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: This study reviewed articles on the behavior of agents and stewards from the domains of finance, economics, management, corporate governance and organizational research. Additional theoretical and meta-analytical empirical literature from the fields of psychology and sociology was used to account for general patterns of human behavior. Findings: The results indicate that goal congruency and the perception of fairness can serve as moderators distinguishing agency theory and stewardship theory. Goal congruency can be achieved by stipulating psychological ownership. The perception of distributive and procedural fairness is demonstrated by two major corporate governance mechanisms: performance-based compensation and board monitoring. The results are summarized in six hypotheses that allow a situational, customized corporate governance. These hypotheses can be tested in future research. Originality/value: Prior work either focused on the merits of principal-agent theory or advocates the utilization of positive management theories, such as stewardship theory. However, little work has been done on bridging the gap between both constructs and develop a more extensive view of management theory. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Larger companies cannot escape from facing financial distress, which eventually leads to insolvency and unsustainability. In this regard, this study examined the relationship between ownership concentration and firm sustainability of top 200 Malaysian public listed companies for the period between the years 2009 and 2015. The two-stage least squares regression results of this study showed that ownership concentration was significantly and negatively related to firm sustainability. This finding remained the same when different proxies of ownership concentration and firm sustainability were used. Generally, this finding indicated that excessive concentrated ownership may lead to decisions that did not satisfy all key shareholders, and may reduce the level of firm sustainability.

The study aimed to investigate the extent and level of risk management disclosures of listed companies in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), and to examine the relationship between risk management disclosures and financial performance. Using quota sampling, 160 firms were used as the samples. Content analysis by word counting was used to quantify risk management disclosures in corporate annual reports during 2017 to 2019, while financial performance and corporate characteristics were collected from samples' websites. Descriptive analysis, correlation matrix, and panel data analysis by pooled OLS regression were used to analyze data. As the results, the study found that the average level of risk management disclosures in annual reports of Thai listed companies during 2017 to 2019 were 2226.11 words. In more details, operational risk management disclosure was the most common disclosure following by following by financial risk, legal and regulatory risk, contingency risk, and major shareholder risk. Moreover, the study found the positive relationship between major shareholder risk management disclosure and financial performance, while financial risk management disclosure had negative influenced on financial performance. The study demonstrated agency theory that can be used to explain risk management disclosures in Thailand where the disclosures were not mandatory reporting yet. (c) 2020. All Rights Reserved.

This study uses 462,678 monthly observations of US-listed firms for the period 1990-2018 to document a strong positive relationship between short-term changes in financial distress risk and future stock price crashes. This result is economically significant as a one interquartile increase of the main explanatory variable in any month increases the probability of a stock price crash by 8.33% relative to its mean value. The findings withstand controls for a large array of variables, firm-fixed effect estimations, and alternative definitions of distress and crash risk measures; they are also robust to a range of tests conducted to buttress against endogeneity concerns. The study conducts analyses demonstrating that the positive distress-crash risk relationship is driven by managerial opportunism that seeks to camouflage bad news that has an adverse effect on firms' economic fundamentals. Accordingly, the findings corroborate an agency theory explanation for the impact of distress risk on stock price crashes. This study offers practical insights to investors, who should be vigilant of a firm's distress risk, as sudden short-term increases underscore withheld negative information pertinent to crash risk problems.

Research Summary: Using a principal-principal agency theory lens, we examine corporate governance and compensation design in family-owned businesses. We conceptualize how CEO pay and pay-performance sensitivity is influenced by whether the CEO is a professional or drawn from the controlling family (family CEO). Data from a sample of 277 publicly listed Indian family firms during 2004-2013 support our argument that family CEOs get paid more than professional CEOs. This pattern is stronger in superior-performing firms that are named after the controlling family (eponymous firms). Furthermore, family CEOs of superior-performing firms have higher pay-performance sensitivity compared to professional CEOs of other superior-performing firms. Our findings reveal nuanced heterogeneity in nepotism in emerging economy family firms--CEO compensation is a mechanism for some controlling families to tunnel corporate resources. Managerial Summary: We examine whether CEO compensation and its responsiveness to realized firm performance in Indian family firms in influenced by whether the CEO is a professional or drawn from the controlling family (family CEO). Data from a sample of 277 publicly listed Indian family firms during 2004-2013 suggests family CEOs get paid more than professional CEOs. This pattern is stronger in superior-performing firms that are named after the controlling family (eponymous firms). Furthermore, family CEOs' high compensation is unaffected by poor firm performance and is disproportionately boosted by superior firm performance. These results suggest that poor corporate governance allows some family controlled Indian firms to use CEO compensation as a mechanism to tunnel corporate resources in ways that hurt minority shareholders.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the moderating role of family involvement on the corporate social responsibility (CSR)-firm performance (FP) relationship in the US hospitality industry. Building on agency theory, this study examines how family ownership, management and board control influence the relationship between CSR and FP. Design/methodology/approach: To examine the moderating effect of family ownership, family management and family board control, this study adopts the two-way fixed-effects model and performs a panel regression analysis with robust standard errors. The sample period spans 1994-2018 and 565 firm-year observations are included. Findings: This study finds that the impact of CSR on FP is positively moderated by the extent of a firm's family member involvement. In specific, all three aspects of corporate governance (i.e. ownership, management and board control) positively moderate the relationship between CSR and FP. Research limitations/implications: Findings of this study yield several recommendations for hospitality managers, including shaping strategic decisions for implementing CSR, by providing a unique perspective that the involvement of founding family members can be helpful in enhancing firm value through CSR activities. Originality/value: This study sheds light on the further understanding of the CSR-FP link in the hospitality literature. In addition, this study provides practical guidelines for hospitality firms in the context of CSR by revealing possible advantages of strengthened founding family involvement.

Multi-family firms represent an important and complex type of family firm that is not as well understood as single-family firms. We develop a governance-based framework of the agency complexities in multi-family firms, theorizing that divergent family-centered noneconomic goals between the owning families create complex inter-family agency problems that are intensified by evolving family dynamics. We propose governance mechanisms that address these problems by limiting opportunistic behavior associated with the pursuit of noneconomic goals related to firm control, family altruism, social capital, and transgenerational succession. We then present a future research agenda that can expand our knowledge of multi-family firms. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

Over the past few years, scholarly interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been increasing. However, research on the relationship between CSR and firm performance has revealed a complicated relationship. In this paper, we argue that part of the basis for the generally positive relationship between CSR and firm performance might come from a reduction in agency costs. Relying on behavioral agency theory, we construct a model in which CSR moderates the impact of the agency problem on specific firm outcomes, including firm performance, the use of stock options, and goodwill. Based on panel data of publicly traded U.S. firms from 1999 to 2013, we find support for that model. These findings suggest the role of CSR in improving corporate governance efficiency through mitigating agency problems inside the firm. (c) 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose: Challenging the static view of family business governance, we propose a model of owner-manager relationships derived from the configurational analysis of managerial behavior and change in governance structure. Design/methodology/approach: Stemming from social exchange theory and building on the 4C model proposed by Miller and Le Breton-Miller (2005), we consider the evolving owner-manager relationship in four main configurations. On the one hand, we account for family businesses shifting from a generalized to a restricted exchange system, and vice versa, according to whether a family manager misbehaves in a stewardship-oriented governance structure or a nonfamily manager succeeds in building a trusting relationship in an agency-oriented governance structure. On the other hand, we consider that family firms will strengthen a generalized exchange system, rather than a restricted one, according to whether a family manager contributes to the stewardship-oriented culture in the business or a nonfamily manager proves to be driven by extrinsic rewards. Four scenarios are analyzed in terms of the managerial behavior and governance structure that characterize the phases of the relationship between owners and managers. Findings: Various factors trigger managerial behavior, making the firm deviate from or further build on what is assumed by stewardship and agency theories (i.e. proorganizational versus opportunistic behavior, respectively), which determine the governance structure over time. Workplace deviance, asymmetric altruism and patriarchy on the one hand, and proorganizational behavior, relationship building and long-term commitment on the other, are found to determine how the manager behaves and thus characterize the owner's reactions in terms of governance mechanisms. This enables us to present a dynamic view of governance structures, which adapt to the actual attitudes and behaviors of employed managers. Research limitations/implications: As time is a relevant dimension affecting individual behavior and triggering change in an organization, one must consider family business governance as being dynamic in nature. Moreover, it is not family membership that determines the most appropriate governance structure but the owner-manager relationship that evolves over time, thus contributing to the 4C model. Originality/value: The proposed model integrates social exchange theory and the 4C model to predict changes in governance structure, as summarized in the final framework we propose.

Women-owned businesses represent a significant segment of the contemporary economy upon a global basis. However, women entrepreneurs still experience more obstacles than men depending on cultural context; for example, research on the Arab world concerning the interaction between women entrepreneurs and their families remains under-developed. Consequently, we ground our study upon an enhanced framework of agency theory, which includes family altruism. We examined the relationships between business-family interface (BFI) enrichment components and the performance of firms headed by female entrepreneurs women in Jordan and Sudan. Specifically, we investigated if and how the country level of political and social stability moderates these relationships. The findings suggest that the relationship between the family-related objective factor (family financial support) and the performance of firms headed by female entrepreneurs is not affected by the country's political and social stability context. Conversely, the family-related subjective factor (family moral support) is affected by this context. Our study bridges the gap in contextual studies on the Arab world concerning the success of women-owned businesses and confirms how institutional elements affect business in addition to family-related matters. Implications for future research and public policy are discussed. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

A single family office (SFO) is an organizational entity owned by a single family and primarily dedicated to managing assets and meeting the needs of family members. While a rising number of SFOs around the world emphasize the importance of this specific vehicle for entrepreneurial families, scholarly knowledge on SFOs is surprisingly scarce. To better understand this phenomenon, we conducted and analyzed exploratory interviews with 109 German-speaking SFO-owning families. We answer a call for research on SFO heterogeneity by identifying two relevant, separate dimensions: a) whether the family still owns the original family firm and b) whether the family generation who founded the SFO still owns the SFO. Based on our qualitative insights and theoretical approaches such as socioemotional wealth (SEW) and agency theory, we develop propositions about how the respective heterogeneity of SFOs affects the family-related goals, entrepreneurial investment behaviors, and governance of SFOs.

Auditors of foreign cross-listed firms face liability arising from the nature of the institutional monitoring framework of legal claims that can potentially be brought against the auditor in both the home country and the US. This paper is the first to document the relationship between auditor liability and auditor pricing of excess cash holdings for foreign firms cross-listed in the US. Our findings indicate that auditors demand a fee premium for foreign incorporated clients with greater excess cash holdings, consistent with auditors recognizing the potential for legal exposure to agency conflict arising from foreign listed US traded clients. Furthermore, we examine aspects of foreign capital market protections, such as disclosure requirements, the strength of legal enforcement, and the strength of shareholder rights to better understand auditor perception of the liability they incur due to the agency costs associated with excess cash holdings. We find that there is a significant positive association between audit fees and excess cash holdings for firms where the country of incorporation permits greater liability of auditors in criminal and civil litigation. In addition, auditors assign higher audit fees to firms holding greater excess cash incorporated in countries with greater required accounting disclosure, stronger legal enforcement and stronger shareholder rights.

This study examines the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on corporate social performance. The amount a given country spends on corporate social responsibility activities varies due to various motives. Therefore, the objectives of the study involve examining the impact of board characteristics and ownership structure on corporate social responsibility. Based on a panel data regression, this study finds that board size is positively related to corporate social performance (social performance and environmental performance) in the Chinese context. In the case of India and South Africa, board size exhibits a negative relationship, which is inversely related to China. CEO duality is positively related to firms' corporate social performance in India and China. However, in the context of South Africa, it exhibits a negative relationship. Gender diversity has positive impact in India and South Africa, wherein in case of China it is inversely related. It is observed that women on the board and women directors significantly influence corporate social responsibility spending. Moreover, among the ownership structure, family ownership is positively related to corporate social responsibility in the India and South Africa. The institutional investors have a negative impact in South Africa and a positive impact in India and China. This study supports the stewardship theory and agency theory and finds that firms should spend on corporate social responsibility activities to protect the interests of the stakeholders and the role of firms' responsibilities towards different sectors of society. Finally, this study provides insights into the state-of-the-art literature and offers practical implications for top-level management and shareholders. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

Since the early 2000s, Sino-foreign equity joint ventures (JVs) have declined sharply as a predominant strategy for multinational enterprises (MNEs) to enter and operate in China. We study one of the contributory factors, foreign buyout, and its performance implications. By applying incomplete contract theory and an agency perspective, we provide micro evidence that superior post buyout performance is observed in converted wholly-owned subsidiaries (WOSs) with efficiency-seeking operations and subsequent CEO succession. The findings extend our understanding that ownership per se does not guarantee performance improvement. Instead, it is the alignment between ownership and the owner's inputs, and between ownership and the owner's managerial control, that give rise to performance improvement. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We present evidence that the negative impact of CEO short-termism on firm value can be attributed to a sub-optimal exercise of real options. Accordingly, the value relevance of firms' real options portfolios is maximized in the absence of CEO temporal myopia. Moreover, the impact of real options on firms' stock returns' idiosyncratic characteristics is more pronounced when CEOs' decision horizons are longer, in line with the view that enhanced operating flexibility from longer decision horizons can amplify the convexity of real options' payoffs. These findings have important implications regarding the impact of CEO career horizons on corporate strategies and board decisions related to CEO incentives and succession.

This paper investigates the role of a firm's information visibility in the assessment of its default risk. We use press coverage to proxy for firm visibility and find that highly visible firms generally have better credit ratings. The positive association between firm visibility and credit ratings arises because (1) press coverage facilitates the generation and dissemination of firm-specific information to market participants and (2) it disciplines the activities of managers and large shareholders. This positive association becomes stronger for firms with more severe information asymmetry or weaker alternative monitoring systems. Our findings contribute to the accounting literature by providing new evidence on the influence of firm visibility in the debt market. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

Research Question/Issue: On the basis of a dynamic interrelation between the assumptions of agency theory and stewardship theory, this study seeks to make sense of disobedience at the highest corporate level. Departing from a processual view in order to better understand how loyalty plays a critical role in the relationships between a CEO and his/her principal, we propose a conceptualization of the options open to a top executive in disagreement with the principal. We view the relationship from "below" by primarily taking the CEO's perspective, resulting in a more complex view on how "duty" is perceived and acted upon by the CEO. Research Findings/Insights: We use the rich and abundant archives left behind by the CEO of a large French firm. We had access to over 50,000 pages of documents that allowed us to follow the CEO and his relationships with his principals, at times from day to day. We found two competing loyalties (loyalty to the principal--agency theory--and loyalty to the organization--stewardship theory) that gradually become independent of each other, triggering different responses in terms of "exits" from the relationship with the principal. This particular dynamic in which the CEO acted as a guardian of the overall purpose of the organization enabled the emergence, development, and consolidation of a disobedience process that over the years contributed to the well-being of his firm as well as to the social changes occurring in France at that time. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This longitudinal study extends the corporate governance literature by offering a process-oriented approach, quite rare in this stream of research, and a more dynamic view of how agency theory and stewardship theory interact. Then, by providing empirical support for the idea that the disobedience process can protect and allow an organization to first evolve positively over time and eventually contribute to social improvements, our study proposes a form of responsible stewardship. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers important insights for executives, directors, and shareholders on how to make sense of, and in the long run potentially benefit from, disobedience at the highest corporate levels.

Purpose: This study seeks to highlight the dynamic nature of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) by investigating how firms respond to adversity, i.e. performance below aspiration levels through pertinent changes in EO, and if some of these changes can be accounted for based on the ownership of the firm. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a multiple regression using an ordinary least square methodology on a sample of 13,333 Indian firms within the period 2005-2016 to test its hypothesis. Findings: This research sheds light on performance feedback as an antecedent to EO as also on the effect of ownership moderating this relationship, with diversity in resource configuration and governance arrangement being the key drivers. Research limitations/implications: This is a single country study; hence, there is a possibility of a country-specific bias. This study uses a secondary measure of EO and thus is unable to capture the entrepreneurial intentions and opinions of managers. Practical implications: The study establishes a nuanced understanding of how ownership impacts the entrepreneurial behaviour of firms during times of adversity. Social implications: This study may help policymakers draft appropriate policy interventions for firms at the time of adversity, so that they can improve their entrepreneurial spree. Originality/value: This rare study from an emerging market establishes performance feedback as an important antecedent of EO. It further highlights the vital role of ownership in supporting/constraining EO. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research on the capital structure of family firms has flourished in recent years, but the impact of performance aspiration and family ownership together on capital structure remains inadequately investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the impact of family ownership and under-aspiration performance and their interaction on capital structure. Panel data estimations were applied with a unique dataset of 3.857 observations from 387 public firms in Vietnam from 2010 to 2020 (134 family firms and 253 non-family firms). The results reveal that family ownership and under-aspiration performance each has a positive effect on capital structure. However, under-aspiration performance negatively moderates the positive effect of family ownership on capital structure. These findings contribute to a stream of studies on the capital structure of family firms by exploring the role of under-aspiration performance, as well as provide important implications for shareholders, managers and debtors in financial management.

The agency problem strikes as an ethical, practical, and economic issue in equal measures. The principal objective of the current research is to trace the nature of the agency conflicts in the family-owned pyramidal business groups of corporate Malaysia and how they affect the firm value. It is argued that the principal-principal (PP) conflict is more severe in family-owned business firms. To achieve the objectives of the current study, the GMM and the fixed effect estimates are used. In addition, to find the difference between family-owned firms and family-owned firms in the pyramidal business, we have employed the Mann-Whitney test. The null hypothesis is accepted which indicates that the impact of the PP conflict among family firms is different from those in pyramidal business groups. The final sample of 420 firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia is chosen for the analysis. The results of the current study provide support to the hypothesized results that the PP conflict is severe in family-owned groups and has a significant effect on firm value. The findings of the current study also provide support that the PP conflict is prevalent in Malaysia, supporting the earlier evidence regarding the expropriation of minority shareholders rights reported in the studies carried out on samples of Malaysian non-financial firms. This is also in line with our measure of PP conflict severity, which is high in pyramidal family firms. Overall, the results provided support to the expropriation hypothesis. Thus, the findings of this study also confirm the view that in family-owned Malaysian firms, the ethical dilemmas of wealth expropriations do exist and are more intense in the pyramidal family-owned business structures. Instead of relying on traditional methods, the current study employed a synthetic measure to gauge the PP conflict. The study which is among the pioneer on the expropriation of minority shareholders will be helpful for policymakers, researchers and finance professionals in understanding the issues related to principal-principal conflict, and firm value in family-owned pyramidal business groups of Malaysia.

The purpose of this study empirically investigates the influence of corporate governance structure on the firm's financial performance of the alcohol beverage industry in the United States. Secondary financial data were collected for the U.S.-based alcohol beverage firms. Bivariate correlation and fixed-effects model analyses were performed to examine the proposed impacts. A two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression analysis was subsequently performed to examine the endogeneity. The analysis outcomes support the finding that certain corporate governance attributes significantly affect the financial performance of alcohol beverage firms. Theoretically, the findings reaffirmed the financial impact of industry-specific corporate governance structures (i.e., stewardship versus agency theory, and integrated traits of hospitality, retail, and distribution of the alcohol industry). Managerial implications are suggested in terms of the alcohol industry's specific corporate governance models, such as the balance among common stock ownership, executive tenure, board-size increase, and levels of control by outside board members. As a relevant sector (e.g., festival) of the hospitality and tourism industry, corporate governance of the alcohol beverage industry has never been empirically nor theoretically studied. The governance attributes in this study are compared between stewardship and agency theory and provide a better understanding of alcohol beverage industry firms' corporate governance structure.

Prior empirical research investigating the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) tenure and firms' financial performance has shown inconclusive results. Based on arguments of agency and behavioral agency theories, we suggest that this relationship is nuanced and may vary depending on CEO pay and board monitoring. In response to these arguments, we meta-analytically test 385 studies (n = 1,029,602). We find that CEO tenure is positively related to firms' financial performance. This positive relationship is enhanced when CEOs receive higher cash compensation or hold more stock ownership. On the other hand, the above positive relationship becomes weaker when CEOs receive higher long-term incentives or when the firm has more independent board directors. These findings suggest that CEO pay and board monitoring, or agency mechanisms in general, can offer new research avenues to help explore boundary conditions of the CEO tenure and firms' financial performance relationship.

The uncertainty of outcomes from innovation typically affects related decision-making in family firms. Innovation presents both opportunities for business growth and investment risks, and the relationship between family firms and innovation remains inconclusive. Moreover, the interplay between family firm ownership and control rights may result in agency problems. Ownership by family members can be regarded as a real option for family shareholders. Thus, we combine agency theory and the real option view to argue that ownership structure characteristics among family members in board affect innovation in family firms. Examination of the innovation behaviors of Taiwanese family firms reveals that ownership concentration among family board directors positively influences innovation in family firms. In addition, family board directors without personal ownership in the family firm are more supportive of innovation than those who have such ownership. (c) 2021 IEEE.

We use a sample of French firms over the period 2001-2017 to investigate the relationship between board gender diversity and related-party transactions (RPTs). Although some of these transactions are efficient, RPTs are usually perceived negatively by outsiders because of the existence of conflict-of-interest transactions deemed to be value-destroying. Based on agency theory and managerial power theory, we argue that female directors have the ability and motivation to challenge managers' use of RPTs. Consistently with this argument, we find that board gender diversity negatively correlates with the number of reported RPTs. This negative correlation is driven by female directors involved in the board's monitoring duties (female independent directors and members of the audit committee). However, because they are less likely to be able to challenge managers, female inside directors do not affect the occurrence of RPTs. In January 2011, the French regulator enacted a gender quota law resulting in a significant increase in female board representativeness. We find that the marginal effect after enacting the gender quota law on the number of reported RPTs is negative for the proportion of female independent directors and female audit committee members, and positive for female inside directors.

Concentrated ownership implies greater alignment between ownership and control, mitigating the agency problem. However, it may also engender governance challenges such as funds appropriation through related party transactions and the oppression of minority shareholders, especially in the context of weak legal systems. We draw from legal theory (the tradeoff controlling shareholder model and private benefits of control) and from organization theory (socioemotional wealth), to suggest that concentrated ownership can be beneficial in both robust and weak legal systems for different reasons. We advance theory on the effects of controlling shareholders and suggest that the longer-term outlook associated with engaged concentrated ownership can aid the shift of the corporation toward Berle and Means' (1932, p. 355) "third possibility" of corporations serving the interests of not just the stockholders or management but also of society.

Purpose: This study aims to explore the moderating role of board gender diversity (BGD) in the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms (i.e. board size, board independence, chief executive officer (CEO) gender, CEO duality and ownership concentration) and firm risk-taking. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 192 non-financial publicly traded Italian firms over 2014-2018, this study tests the proposed research hypotheses and assess the moderating effect of BGD. Findings: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study finds a significant relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm risk-taking, which is significantly moderated by BGD. BGD accentuates the negative effect of board size, independent directors, CEO gender and CEO duality on firm systematic risk and attenuates the positive impact of CEO duality on firm unsystematic risk. The results, which are consistent with the risk-reduction effect of BGD, are robust to the use of alternative measures of firm risk-taking. Practical implications: Women's presence on corporate boards plays a critical role in the board's involvement in risk-taking. Hence, investors and stakeholders should consider women on corporate boards as a crucial risk-mitigating factor. Originality/value: This paper contributes to our knowledge on risk management by demonstrating the moderating role of BGD while relating corporate governance mechanisms and firm risk-taking.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between board gender diversity and private firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the association between board gender diversity and private firm performance by estimating pooled multivariate regressions using an unbalanced panel data set of 115,253 firm-year observations. Findings: The authors find that younger, less busy and local women directors enhance private firm performance. Firms with 40% or more women directors report triple the economic benefits compared to boards with at least 20% women directors. Considering firm size, women directors significantly increase small firm profitability, and the effect is more pronounced for high-risk firms. Greater board gender diversity enhances small firm performance as the monitoring role of women directors benefits the firm even in the presence of busy men directors. Consistent with the agency theory framework, the authors find that women directors improve small firm profitability in the presence of agency costs. Research limitations/implications: Due to the lack of availability of data about private firms, many factors are not directly observable. The analysis uses accounting-based performance measures that may be subject to managerial discretion. Nevertheless, the authors report highly significant results using cash-based performance measures that substantiate the overall findings. Practical implications: The results of the present study point to the need for private firms to increase board gender diversity and consider women director busyness, age, nationality and firm size when making board director appointments. Originality/value: This study adds to the scarce existent literature investigating private firms. The results contribute to the understanding of gender-diverse boards as well as the attributes of women directors that enhance private firm performance. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the impact of gender diversity on sustainability growth, and moderating role of family ownership in an emerging economy, Pakistan. We employed 3730 firm-year observations, comprising of 307 non-financial firms listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange, over a period 2008-2020. Using framework of agency theory, resource dependence theory and social identity theory, we report that gender diversity results in higher sustainable growth in our sample firms. Further, our results indicate that due to strong identification of family owners with their firms, their presence positively moderates this relationship. Overall, we report that despite of a weak corporate governance mechanism, the presence of female directors and family owners results in higher firm growth and low agency conflicts, which serve as positive signals for the investors. Our study provides empirical support to mandatory appointment of female directors on boards and urge the policymakers to focus on capacity building of female workforce.

This paper aims to systematically review the existing studies of corporate governance with organisational performance in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and put forward theories, research methods, topics, and variables that emerge from the review. The systematic literature review is based on 42 peer-reviewed journal articles on the topic written by reputable academics on the Science Direct Database focused on corporate governance, board characteristics, and ownership structure. This study's conceptual framework is based on agency theory, which is the most widely used to analyse corporate governance (Fama & Jensen, 1983; Jensen & Meckling, 1976). The majority of results show a positive correlation between corporate governance and organisational performance (Pucheta-Martinez & Gallego-Alvarez, 2020) with agency theory being the most utilised theory of choice (Bergh, Ketchen, Orlandi, Heugens, & Boyd, 2019; Panda & Leepsa, 2017). This paper undertakes a significant thorough systematic review of corporate governance with firm performance and the Fourth Industrial Revolution literature. It gives an 11-year review with a reference index from 2011 to 2021, useful for both academics and professionals. This study recommends more evidence-based systematic reviews for different aspects and within different regions. It is further recommended to expand geographical spread across all continents to cover corporate governance area and to improve studies related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and its impact on corporate governance. Lastly, it is recommended that more studies that look at the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on corporate governance and firm performance should be performed. (c) 2022 The Authors.

By integrating literature on behavioral agency theory and fear as an emotional lens, we develop a theoretical framework explaining how family owners' fear of losing specific dimensions of socio-emotional endowments influence family firm innovativeness. Our analysis of data from a two-phased, multi-respondent, matched survey (n = 407) at two different time points from family SMEs (n = 207) in manufacturing industries in Chongqing, China, shows that socio-emotional preferences, and the fear attached to losing specific endowments, activate or constrain innovativeness. Family owners' fear of losing family control and influence increases firm innovativeness, as do family owners' fear of losing guanxi (social bonds). However, family owners' fear of losing identification with the business among family members decreases firm innovativeness, as do family owners' fear of being unable to renew family bonds. By deepening current understanding of fear and the perceived danger of losing socio-emotional wealth as determinants of firm innovativeness, our findings offer important implications for theory and practice, correcting for the inattention to sentiments and emotional preferences family owners may or may not have towards specific socio-emotional dimensions in their strategic choices.

Prior research has found that corporate political activity (CPA) can both positively and negatively impact firm performance. Combining agency theory with the resource-based view, we examine the relationship between domestic lobbying (a key form of CPA) and firm performance by explicating the moderating effects of international and product diversification. We argue that expansion into international and product markets increases a firm's resources and reduces agency costs in domestic lobbying. Our results, based on a sample of 737 firms, show that lobbying is positively associated with performance for firms that are diversified in both international markets and along product-lines; whereas lobbying is counter-productive for purely domestic and undiversified firms. Our results contribute to the literature on the firm performance implications of corporate political activity by highlighting the roles of international and product diversification.

Consistent with the resource-based view research on investment syndicates indicates relative performance advantages of syndicate-backed ventures. However, in line with agency theory, the literature shows that heterogeneous syndicates between independent venture capital (IVC) and corporate venture capital (CVC) produce portfolio firms that exert only marginal growth and are less likely to exit successfully. These contrasting views motivate this study, which aims to shed light on the determinants of value creation for new venture firms in IVC-CVC co-investing. Our qualitative research builds on a cross-industry sample of 35 interviewees identifying a distinctive set of value drivers comprising shareholder relationships, corporate setup, venture life cycle, and deal terms.

Purpose: Capitalizing on a unique measure of takeover susceptibility principally based on the staggered implementation of state laws, this study aims to explore the takeover market's effect on managerial ownership. The market for corporate control, often known as the takeover market, is an important external governance mechanism, whereas managerial ownership is a vital internal governance instrument. Managerial ownership brings into convergence the interests of shareholders and managers. The originality of this study arises from the usage of state-level anti-takeover legislations as a measure which is beyond the control of firms and plausibly exogenous to firm-specific characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: In addition to the standard regression analysis, this study also executes a variety of robustness checks to minimize endogeneity, i.e. propensity score matching, entropy balancing, instrumental-variable analysis, Lewbel's (2012) heteroscedastic identification and Oster's (2019) testing for coefficient stability. Findings: Based on a large sample of US firms, the results show that more hostile takeover threats bring about significantly lower managerial ownership. The results reinforce the prediction of the substitution hypothesis. The disciplinary function of the takeover market reduces agency conflict to the point where managerial ownership is less necessary as a governance mechanism. Specifically, a rise in takeover susceptibility by one standard deviation diminishes managerial ownership by 7.22%. Originality/value: `To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to shed light on the impact of the takeover market on managerial ownership using a novel measure mainly based on the staggered adoption of state laws, which are plausibly exogenous to individual firms' characteristics. Consequently, unlike prior research, this study is more likely to indicate a causal effect, rather than merely a correlation. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: There is still an ongoing debate on the value relevance of capital structure and its determinants. Recently the issue has been explored in family firms after being explored in mature firms. This paper investigates the role of institutional investors and the firm's innovation activity in influencing the firm's decision and ability to acquire debt capital. Design/methodology/approach: A large sample of 700 privately-held family firms in Italy from 2010 to 2019. Two analysis techniques are used: panel analysis and path analysis. The value of debt and the debt ratio are used as leverage measures. The value of patent (as a proxy for innovation) and institutional investor are the explanatory variables. Findings: The results show that institutional investors have no relationship with financial leverage measures except when controlling for an interaction variable (Institutional investors x Lombardy region). The patent value is positively correlated with debt; however, the ratio patent-to-asset is negatively related to financial leverage indicating higher risk exposure. The nonlinearity test demonstrates a turning point when the relationship between patent value and debt inverts. Practical implications: Firms should monitor their innovation activity since excessive innovation increases risk exposure and affects financing opportunities and value. The involvement of institutional investors does not always enhance value. Originality/value: Existing literature focuses separately on family firm innovations and financial leverage as outcome variables, emphasizing the role of institutional investors in both fields by adopting agency theory and socioemotional wealth framework. In this study, the authors go further by merging both relationships, investigating the dynamics of the institutional-family firm innovation relationship in influencing the firm's capital structure. The authors contribute to the ongoing debate by providing original findings on capital structure, governance and innovation, supported by rigorous methods to enhance family firms' decision-making.

This paper examines the effect of director co-option on product market outcomes. We find that future market share growth declines as executives co-opt more of the board. Co-opted directors also inhibit the product market benefits from cash reserves. These findings hold in a variety of robustness tests, sustaining the view that director co-option reduces product market performance. Our results further show that co-option leads to lower market share gains among firms whose industry rivals intensely change products and have higher borrowing capacity. Compared to their competitors, firms with more co-opted directors also allocate less internal resources to potential product differentiation strategies, but award executives more cash-based pay. Overall, our findings support the agency theory supposition that firms with co-opted boards lose market share ex-post. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Based on the behavioral agency theory, this paper aims to analyze the relationship between family CEOs and the social and environmental adopted practices by family listed firms in Ibero-America, and how board structure (size, independence and female on the board) moderate this relationship. An unbalanced panel data integrated by 836 yearly-observations during 2011-2016 period and GMM method are adopted to carry out several econometric analyses. The results show that family CEOs increase social performance, particularly in the aspects related to labor practices, work condition and human rights. The main limitation of the study is the sample of study, focused on those companies with the highest stock market prices in four Ibero-American countries. This research contributes to advance both the family firms and CSR literature at a comparative level, and emphasizes that socio-emotional wealth preservation constitutes a strategic mechanism for family CEOs, which, in turn, enhances the non-financial performance of Ibero-American firms.

The aim of this study is to examine a possible relationship of corporate financial performance and board membership changes. As a consequence, whether too little or too much board membership changes would produce a detrimental impact to financial performance. Furthermore, this study investigated whether this effect is more pronounced in family firms over non-family firms. Based on the agency theory and stewardship perspective, the results indicate that board membership changes are significant for family firms towards short-term financial performance indicators, with positive effect above a certain interval, though it signaling to the market may not be relevant. Also provides insightful examination of a specific corporate governance issue that is valuable both for academics and practitioners. (c) 2022 Authors. All rights reserved.

The growing number of corporate scandals globally highlights the importance of effective corporate governance mechanisms. Many of the corporate governance frameworks that are rooted in the agency theory advocate the election of independent non-executive directors, an independent chairperson, and a lead independent director. Shareholder voting on the election or re-election of directors (hereafter referred to as 'director re-elections') has been largely unexplored in South Africa--a country widely recognised as a pioneer in the corporate governance field and yet marred by several corporate scandals in recent years. In this study, an unbalanced panel data set was thus constructed comprising voting outcomes and board-level characteristics of companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2020. Significant positive relationships were noted between shareholder voting opposition to director re-elections and both board size and board tenure. Shareholders who cast opposing votes mainly did so because of their concerns about the lack of director independence, at board, committee, and nominee level. The findings of this study were explained in the context of the agency, stakeholder, stewardship, and resource dependence theories. It is recommended that nomination committees use more robust selection criteria for directors. Shareholders are also encouraged to vote more actively on director re-elections to monitor these monitors. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

Drawing on agency and socioemotional wealth theory, this study elucidates that ownership succession intentions affect earnings management in private family firms. Based on a combination of questionnaire data and archival data of 331 Belgian private family firms, results indicate that family firms intending to transfer ownership to non-family members engage more in earnings management than those planning to transfer ownership to family members. Our findings also show differences in earnings management within each subset of ownership succession, thereby highlighting family firm heterogeneity. Family owners intending to transfer ownership to their children engage less in upward earnings management than those planning to transfer ownership to other family members. Family owners intending to transfer ownership to employees engage more in downward earnings management than those intending to transfer ownership to outsiders. This study contributes to both theory and practice by considering ownership succession intentions as a driver of earnings management.

The objective of this paper is to empirically examine the relationship between the firm's ownership and control structure and its leverage. Capital structure is not only the result of various financial characteristics of the firm but also depends on who is in control. Thus, it is fundamental to understand the influence that certain features of the shareholding structure or the composition of the board, including the potential differences between family and non-family firms, exert on capital structure decisions. The paper uses a sample of wine firms in Portugal, because it helps to capture a business sector where family firms make up a significant portion of the industry. It is used an unbalanced panel data set of 460 firms for the period 2010 to 2018 and applied a random-effects model specification. Our results do not evidence significant differences between family and non-family firms. Still, they indicate that firms with fewer shareholders, smaller boards, and where the main director or member of the board is also a shareholder tend to present higher debt levels. There is no evidence of a non-monotonic relation between the ownership structure and debt, nor the presence of moderating effects on that relation. This paper fills a gap in the literature as the impact that specific characteristics of firms and their leaders have on capital structure decisions is still a topic less studied in the literature, particularly in bank-based economies.

The alignment among multiple stakeholder benefits is a valuable performance indicator for the benefits generated by a firm for various stakeholders. Our research seeks to augment stakeholder-agency theory with an institutional perspective to analyze how national institutions affect stakeholder benefit alignment. We suggest that the current development of stakeholder-agency theory has overlooked the alignment of different stakeholders' benefits and the external institutional contexts as critical determinants in ensuring such alignment. We conceptualize stakeholder benefit alignment as a positive relationship between different stakeholder groups' benefits, and propose an institutional framework grounded in relative stakeholder salience. Using this framework, we argue that stakeholder benefits are better aligned when national institutions enhance the ease of withdrawal, legal protection, and private enforcement for intrinsically less salient stakeholders, and when a long-term oriented culture characterizes a society. We found supportive evidence by employing a meta-analytic approach based on 530 correlations from 94 primary studies representing 23 economies. Our study adds new insights to the stakeholder-agency literature by conceptualizing and quantitatively examining the degree of alignment across different stakeholder benefit dimensions, focusing on national formal and informal institutions as boundary conditions.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the drivers for proactive workplace social performance in family firms through a configurational approach. Comparative research on family versus non-family firms and workplace social performance has produced mixed results. Consequently, several calls have been made to account for family business heterogeneity to understand better how family involvement in the business affects the workplace social performance. The authors respond to these calls by exploring the governance antecedents that can catalyze family firms' workplace social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using qualitative comparative analysis, the authors analyze 131 family firms from the STEP survey data. Findings: The authors find two governance configurations that lead to better family business workplace social performance. The first configuration is the combination of 100% family ownership, high family involvement in management and a mix of outside directors and family members on the board. The second configuration is the combination of less than 100% family ownership and low family involvement in management. Originality/value: The study builds on and extends the nascent work suggesting the integration of agency and stewardship theories. The authors show that these two theoretical approaches are able to not only coexist, but that they can also be complementary in helping to understand the unique workplace social behaviors of family firms.

Drawing on principal-principal agency theory and the socioemotional wealth (SEW) perspective, this paper explores the motivations and mechanisms regarding the founding family's contingent choices of governance provisions that facilitate managerial entrenchment, which can potentially threaten firm performance. By investigating S&P 1,500 firms between 2007 and 2017 and employing quasi-experimental treatment effects analyses, this study finds that family firms are less likely to utilize the E-index provisions than non-family firms in general. Further, family firms tend to adopt more E-index provisions when the first generation of the founding family remains involved in the firm. However, as these firms age, they rely less on the E-index provisions to entrench family managers. Consequently, this paper expands current research on the governance of publicly-traded family firms by illustrating the differences between family and non-family firms as well as the impact of transgenerational family governance on the use of entrenchment mechanisms over time.

Longstanding assumptions underlying strategic alliances, such as agency theory, are actively being revoked by dynamics in the new economy. The mechanism of inter-firm cooperation is increasingly being altered by radical developments in blockchains and artificial intelligence among other technologies. To capture and address this shift, this review takes a problematisation approach and focuses wholly on the pertinence of agency theory. First, it begins by acknowledging the established corpus in the area before, second, appraising the seven long-held assumptions in the principal-agent relationship encompassing (1) self-interest, (2) conflicting goals, (3) bounded rationality, (4) information asymmetry, (5) pre-eminence of efficiency, (6) risk aversion and (7) information as a commodity. Third, to add a fresh perspective, the review proceeds to proffer seven assumptions to advance a novel 'Blockchain Agency Theory' that would better describe new attributes and relaxed agency behaviour in blockchain alliances. These counter assumptions are (1) common interests, (2) congruent goals, (3) unbounded rationality, (4) information symmetry, (5) smart contracts, (6) mean risk and (7) information availability. In the fourth part, the prior audience of principals and agents is appraised and this culminates into, fifth, a consideration of a new audience of blockchain agency in algocratic environments. Altogether, the seven new assumptions extend and provoke new agency thinking among scholars and blockchain practitioners alike. (c) 2023 The Authors

How family firms innovate has captivated scholars for over a decade. However, an investigation into the benefits of research and development (R&D) for family firm value under differing economic conditions has received little attention in the family firm innovation or R&D literature. This study examines the relationship between R&D intensity and firm value among listed family firms during the economic recession period of 2007-2010 and nonrecessionary periods (referred to as normal periods) in the US between 1995 and 2013. Based on behavioral agency theory, we evaluate the moderating effects of investments in inward-looking and outward-looking corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives on this relationship. We hypothesize that R&D intensity is negatively related to family firm value during a recession period, but outward-looking CSR positively moderates the relationship between the two. The opposite is hypothesized during normal periods. The results support the assertions that outward-looking CSR can ease the negative impact brought about by R&D intensity on firm value during a recession period, while inward-looking CSR investments surprisingly bear no effects. Important implications for research, family firm leaders, and R&D managers are discussed. (c) 2023 The Authors. R&D Management published by RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose: Building on behavioral agency theory, the authors explore the role played by corporate governance characteristics as drivers of the diversification strategies of family firms. Specifically, this study aims to investigate the effects of board size and board gender diversity on the likelihood that family firms will execute a diversifying acquisition vis-a-vis a related acquisition. Furthermore, the authors investigate the contingency effects played by foreign directorship and the firm's listing status. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses are tested on an original sample of 213 cross-border acquisitions executed by Italian family firms between 2008 and 2021. Findings: The findings suggest that both large board sizes and greater gender diversity positively affect the diversification of family firms. While the presence of foreign directors magnifies the positive effect of board size, gender diversity discourages diversification in the case of listed firms. Originality/value: The originality of this study is twofold. First, while prior literature has mostly focused on the family vs nonfamily dichotomy, this paper contributes to an emergent line of research investigating the heterogeneity among family firms' corporate strategy decisions. Second, by exploring the corporate governance-diversification link in the context of family business, the authors answer to recent calls that diversification by family firms deserves further investigation in light of its highly controversial nature in terms of socioemotional wealth implications and potential mismatch among multiple objectives.

Extending past research, this paper proposes that the quadratic inverse-U relationship between family ownership and the performance of entrepreneurial firms when moderated by the presence of family management and external blockholding. Specifically, it proposes that both factors exacerbate the decline in performance when the proportion of family ownership in entrepreneurial firms remains high. The proposed hypotheses are tested on ten years of panel data from a sample of European firms. Analysis of data supports the hypotheses. Implications for the theory and practice of entrepreneurial firms are discussed. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Based on agency and asymmetric information theories, the objective of this paper is to investigate whether the transparency on corporate governance is determined by strategies followed by the board of directors (liquidity, investment, capital structure, innovation and board composition impact on the corporate governance transparency). The study sample is composed by 826 observations from Latin American firms during the period 2004-2010 (128 unique firms). A two-way cluster standard errors and GMM methods have been adopted to perform the econometric analysis. Results suggest that corporate governance disclosure is attributable to changes on firm's decisions made by the board with respect to financial aspects and innovation. However, the impact upon transparency of board composition with regards to female directors, independence and size of boards are attributable to industry and/or country effects. Although the main limitation of the study is focused on the period of analysis, the results provide important implications for the business sector, demonstrating that the board composition and the financial and innovation strategies adopted by the board encourage greater corporate transparency, thus increasing confidence in the markets.

This article highlights the crucial areas and recent dynamics of the takeover field in family firms and recommends avenues for further research. Employing a bibliometric examination, this study analyzes a sample of 63 studies from the Scopus database on acquisition involving family firms between 1997 and early 2021. The study also performed a systematic literature review of the most significant articles as revealed by the computation. We obtain the prominent authors based on citation analysis. We also find current themes and suggest future research avenues. Despite the worldwide prevalence of family firms, there is less study on the takeover of family firms. The results also show that most of the articles are based on the few most studied theories, such as agency theory, resource-based view and stewardship and stagnation perspective, and so on. The scant studies on the takeover of family firms center around acquisition decisions, determinants of acquisition, and acquisition outcomes, with relatively less attention on measuring non-economic goals, board structure, and generation of family members. Finally, the results indicate that very few studies have focused on cross-industry and cross-country to examine the effect of family ownership on takeover events. (c) 2023 K. J.

Building on qualitative data from 53 interviews with different types of investors and start-ups, we study the financial and non-financial information that different investor types demand to monitor their portfolio start-ups' performance during different lifecycle stages, as well as how entrepreneurs generate and furnish the required information. We specifically show in detail how investors, like venture capitalists, incubators, or business angels, mitigate agency conflicts through the exchange of specific financial and non-financial information, both formally and informally. By directly comparing both investor and investee cases, we provide insight into the monitoring methods common among different investor types and start-ups. While investors consider accounting to be an important part of the relationship, some entrepreneurs do not or set their priorities differently. Our study illustrates that accounting not only plays a crucial role in the management of established businesses, but is equally important in entrepreneurial investment settings, as is financial literacy.

Purpose: From an agency perspective, the authors investigate whether family ownership and control configurations are systematically associated with a firm's choice of auditor and audit fees. Agency theory is an economic theory that purposes the existence of a contract between two parties, principals and agents. Auditor choice and audit fees by family firms provide interesting insights given the unique nature of the agency problems faced by such firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ Big-4 auditors (PWC, KPMG, E&Y and Deloitte) as a proxy for high quality auditor (Big N) for the auditor choice model. For the audit fee model, the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of audit fees (LnAF). The authors use two measures for family firm as explanatory variables: (1) a dummy variable (FAM_Control), which equals one if the firm is classified as a family firm and (2) FAM_Ownership, which is an indicator variable with a value of one if a firm has family members who hold CEO position, occupy board seats, or hold at least 10% of the firm's equity. Data of Chinese listed firms from 2011 to 2021 are used. The authors adopt the Heckman (1979) two-stage model to mitigate the potential endogeneity issue involved in the selection of Big-N auditors. Findings: The findings suggest that compared with non-family firms, Chinese family firms have a less tendency to employ Big-4 auditors due to less severe agency problems between owners and managers. Additionally, Chinese family firms sustain higher audit fees than non-family firms. Similar to the prior literature, however, Chinese family firms audited by Big-4 auditors incur lower audit fees than family firms audited by non-Big-4 auditors in this study. In contrast to young-family firms, old-family firms are less likely to pick top-tier auditors and sustain lower audit fees. Consistent and robust results are found from endogeneity tests and sensitivity analyses. Originality/value: The empirical evidence provides a unique insight, for accounting practitioners, policymakers, family owners and other capital market participants concerning the diverse effects of various family ownership and control features on selecting high-quality auditors and audit fees. This study advances the understanding, showing that a lower demand for audit quality occurs in Chinese family firms as they encounter less severe Type I agency problems. However, the more severe Type II agency problems in Chinese family firms sustain higher audit fees due to higher audit risk and greater audit effort. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates whether CFO's educational background could influence his/her firm's level of earnings management because CFO plays a direct role in overseeing financial reporting. Based on agency theory and upper echelons theory, we discuss whether a CFO with/without an accounting degree could incentivize him/her to choose one over another among the three types of earnings management. Using a US sample between 1999 and 2016, we empirically find that CFOs with an accounting degree are associated with a higher degree of accrual earnings management and a higher degree of real earnings management through overproduction while CFOs without any accounting degree are associated with a higher degree of classification shifting. Our results hold robust when we implement a difference-in-difference test on the executive turnover from a CFO without any accounting degree to a CFO with an accounting degree. Finally, we find that CFOs with CPA certification behave more ethically in all three types of earnings management. Our study enriches the management demographic factor influence literature, unveils the role of CFO in choices of earnings management, supports ethics requirements in business education, and provides implications to executive hiring as well to audit practices.

Research on entrepreneurship in family firms has grown exponentially over the past two decades. Due to the various theoretical perspectives and contexts found here however, this body of research remains fragmented, with a unified understanding of the current state of knowledge and the opportunities for future research in the field continuing to lack. In this study, we address this gap by conducting an updated bibliometric analysis of the research on entrepreneurship in family firms. Here we integrate two different bibliometric methods to provide a more comprehensive picture of the field, unveiling its intellectual foundations and current research discourses and how these two are related. To do this, we first conduct a co-citation analysis clustering the intellectual foundations of the research on entrepreneurship in family firms. Second, a bibliographic coupling of recent publications from 2010 to 2021 provides a transparent structure of current research discourses. Third, analyzing which intellectual foundations are primarily cited in each current research stream unveils the dominant theoretical paradigms in the current state of research. Analyzing 570 published studies, we identified four intellectual foundations of entrepreneurship in family firms: socioemotional wealth (SEW), entrepreneurial orientation, family-embedded resources, and agency theory. The current research can be clustered into seven main discourses: entrepreneurial motivation, gender and success, entrepreneurial orientation, individual and firm-level characteristics, the family embedded network, family firm internationalization, and family heterogeneity. An integrative network diagram provides an overview of the research field's development while also identifying the gaps to be addressed by future research. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

This study aims to provide a bibliometric review (Zupic & Cater, 2015; Hallinger, 2019) of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base. This paper is guided by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and based on the Scopus index for determining and extracting data. A total of 1,661 articles from 1983 to 2021 are included. The USA, the UK, and Australia are the leaders in the literature. A significant gap exists for further research from developing and non-Western settings. We identified authors with the highest citations (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Kose John), the most prominent authors based on the citation for each document (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Igor Filatotchev), and the most highly cited documents (--Higher market valuation of companies with a small board of directors||, Yermack, 1996; --Disentangling the incentive and entrenchment effects of large shareholdings||, Claessens et al., 2002, and --Boards: Does one size fit all?||, Coles et al., 2008). Besides, the review reveals an intellectual structure of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base in three schools of thought: agency theory, firm value, and boards of directors. Our findings provide an overview of top-influential research for new scholars and enable us to identify highly cited theoretical foundations quickly. (c) 2023 The Authors.

Guided by a call for research on small entities using innovative methodologies, this study is the first to analyse small municipality audit fees on a per capita basis. The research utilises a complete dataset of all 92 Connecticut municipalities that meet the study criteria and does not rely on samples or survey results. The measure of per capita was utilised to account for differences between town populations allowing for a more accurate comparison of audit fees and audit fee determinants across municipalities of differing populations. Consistent with the premise that auditee characteristics are an important consideration in audit fees, we find that when examining audit fees on a per capita basis in the subset of small municipalities: (1) smaller towns pay considerably more for audit services than larger towns, (2) towns with an ethics committee oversight function and best practices financial reporting practices have lower per capita audit fees than those that do not and (3) audit firm size, audit firm tenure and existence of audit/finance committee oversight have no significant impact on per capita audit fees. The results of this study help fill a void in the audit literature by providing insights into audit fee determinants in small municipalities by considering the added feature of a per capita analysis. The authors also sought to provide additional information for consideration in the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) efforts to streamline standards for auditing of less complex entities.
