Male and female Cosmopolites sordidus were attracted to freshly cut banana rhizome and pseudostem in a still-air olfactometer. Females responded similarly to odors from a comparatively resistant and from a susceptible cultivar of banana, when presented as either freshly cut tissue or as Porapak-trapped volatiles. Females were also attracted to rotting banana pseudostem and to volatiles collected from it. Males and females gave similar responses to host tissue in both the behavioral bioassay and to collected volatiles in EAG recordings. Weevils did not respond, either behaviorally or electrophysiologically, to a synthetic mixture of mono- and sesqiterpenes, which made up over 9% of the volatiles collected from pseudostem. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

Banana weevil females laid on an average 2.7 eggs/week in rhizome material and 0.7 eggs/week in pseudostem material in the laboratory. At extremely high weevil population densities the egg‐laying activity declined. Under controlled field conditions 0.7 eggs/week were laid in banana suckers and 1.3 eggs/week in stumps of harvested suckers. 25% of the weevil stages found in suckers in the field were eggs of which 78% were laid in the rhizome and 22% in the pseudostem base. The majority of eggs was deposited in the crown area of the rhizome followed by the remaining surface area of the rhizome, the walls of abandoned larval tunnels in rhizome and pseudostem and the leaf sheaths. 58% of the eggs found were considered accessible to egg predators. 1993 The Netherlands Entomological Society

During examination of banana suckers in western Kenya egg predators of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus were regularly found in the pest's egg‐laying sites, viz. on the surface of the rhizome and the pseudostem base as well as inside abandoned larval tunnels. Under experimental conditions at high pest and predator densities Eutochia pulla (Erichs.) (Col., Tenebrionidae), Euborellia annulipes (Luc.) (Dermapt., Carcinophoridae) and Dactylosternum abdominale (F.) (Col., Hydrophilidae) reduced weevil multiplication in banana suckers through egg predation by 20.5 %, 28 % and 44 %, respectively. D. abdominale was similarly effective also at lower weevil and predator densities.

Plantains (Musa spp., AAB group) are an important food crop and an integral component of the farming systems in the lowland humid forest zone of West and Central Africa. A group of 24 plantain cultivars, representing the major variability in West Africa, was evaluated for nine quantitative characters. The association between growth and yield parameters in this African plantain germplasm was examined to determine if the pattern of quantitative variation in inflorescence and vegetative traits agreed with taxonomic groupings based on inflorescence type and plant size. Phenotypic correlations between these traits were calculated. Giant cultivars were taller, their pseudostem thicker, and they flowered much later than medium-sized cultivars. Giant cultivars produced more foliage, resulting in heavier bunches with more hands and fruits. Groupings that resulted following principal component analysis (PCA) supported conventional taxonomic groupings of plantains. PC A was based mainly on time to flowering, pseudostem height, and number of fruits. The last two traits, in combination with the number of hermaphrodite flowers and the persistence of the male bud, sufficed to group plantain cultivars. © 1995 The New York Botanical Garden.

The GC-MS analysis of activated charcoal trapped air-borne volatiles from eight different banana cultivars, revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in their monoterpene content. Eighteen monoterpene hydrocarbons were found in airborne volatiles from the eight cultivars. Tricyclene, α-pinene, camphene, sabinene, β-pinene, β-myrcene, α-phellandrene, limonene, ocimene and α-dimethylstyrene are the major monoterpenes which are universally found in all cultivars. The other seven monoterpenes are present in low relative amounts. The results indicate a potential for the use of the airborne volatile composition in chemosystematic identification or classification of bananas.

Musa cultivars (bananas and plantains) are important crops in the humid tropics of Africa, America and Asia. This paper reports the extent of morphological variation of the Musa germplasm maintained in the gene-bank of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in southeastern Nigeria. Qualitative and quantitative descriptors were used to evaluate AA, BB, AB, AAA, AAB, AAAA, AAAB and AABB bananas, AAA and ABB cooking bananas, AAA beer bananas and AAB plantains and a few wild species. Univariate and principal component (PCA) analyses were performed to identify the most important descriptors to characterize and classify Musa germplasm collections. The most important qualitative morphological descriptors were persistence of male bud and hermaphrodite flowers, pigmentation in pseudostem, foliage, petiole and male flower, pseudostem blotching and waxiness, and leaf orientation. Furthermore, the most important quantitative morphological descriptors included pseudostem girth, height of tallest sucker, number of fruits and fruit sizes. These quantitative descriptors have a high heritability (>0.8), high repeatibility (>2.0)and low coefficient of variation (9-15%) with the exception of the height of the tallest sucker. The implications of the germplasm grouping revealed by PCA are briefly discussed in relation to the evolution of the triploid cultivars. This paper also proposes a new scientific nomenclature for the triploid Musa cultivars.

Three varieties of enset (Ensete ventricosum), Agade, Badedat and Lemat, were collected in the Guraghe zone in Ethiopia. The plant parts (the leaf lamina, leaf midribs, pseudostem sheath, pseudostem core and corm) were separated, weighed and analysed. The dried samples were analysed for dry matter (DM), total ash, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and lignin. There was no significant difference between varieties in the proportion of the DM weight of the plant parts to the total DM weight of each respective variety nor was there any difference between varieties in their chemical components except in the lignin of the pseudostem sheath where Badedat variety had a lower content of lignin, and the DM and CP of the corm where Lemat variety had lower values than the two other varieties. The average values in percent of DM for the chemical composition of leaf and pseudostem respectively were 12.6 and 7.2 (CP), 62.7 and 23.7 (NDF), 40.9 and 9.8 (ADF), 6.7 and 1.8 (lignin) and 12.6 and 7.8 (ash). The DM content was 11.7% in the leaves and 15.8% in the pseudostem. The voluntary intake of enset leaf and pseudostem with or without urea supplementation was determined using eight non-lactating Ethiopian zebu cows with an average live weight of 197.5 kg (S.D. = 12.42) in the experiment. Urea supplementation had a significant effect on DM intake of pseudostem of enset (22.0 vs. 25.6 g/kg body weight/day for unsupplemented and urea supplemented respectively) but had no significant effect on the DM intake of the leaf (24.3 vs 24.8 g/kg body weight/day for unsupplemented and urea-supplemented respectively). The rumen degradability of the plant parts (the leaf lamina, leaf midribs, pseudostem sheath, pseudostem core and corm) of three varieties of enset was studied using three fistulated steers of Ethiopian zebu breed and incubation periods of 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. The degradability of enset lamina at 48 h was better than that of straw and banana leaf and similar to that of stover and Chloris gayana hay. The other parts of the enset plant had even higher degradability than green C. gayana, setaria grass, elephant grass and guatemala grass. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Banana (Musa spp.) is a major semi-perennial fruit crop in Sri Lanka. A study was conducted at the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centre, Angunakolapelessa to investigate the effect of age on growth and yield of banana cv Mysore ("Embul", AAB group). Thirty-seven "Embul" banana accessions collected from various ecological regions of Sri Lanka were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. The observations were recorded in three consecutive years. Number of leaves per clump, LAI (leaf area index) and penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to the crop were recorded at 4, 9, 20 and 32 months after planting. Pseudostem height and girth of the crop were investigated at different ages. Number of combs and fruits per comb, fruit maturity period, bunch weight, total fruit weight, average fruit weight and peduncle weight were also measured. Comb weight, fruit circumference, fruit length and diameter were recorded in the second and last combs. Leaf number and LAI increased, while penetration of PAR decreased with the age. Except weight of second comb, fruit length in second comb and fruit diameter in last comb, all other characteristics varied significantly with age of the crop. Fruit maturity period increased with the age of the crop to second year and then decreased, while total fruit weight decreased up to second year and then increased. Number of fruits per comb and bunch weight significantly increased after the second year. Stem height and girth, number of fruits per bunch, weight of the peduncle and length of the male axis consistently increased with the age of the crop investigated up to the third year.

The influence of windbreak shading was investigated over the plant crop (P) and first ratoon (R1) cycle of bananas cv. Dwarf Cavendish, to quantify its effects on assimilation, phenology and yield in the subtropics. Plants growing under seasonal windbreak shading (late autumn to early spring) were compared with those growing under full sun but under similar windbreak protection. Windbreak shading reduced average photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by 69%, which in turn reduced photosynthesis rate by 27%, transpiration rate by 38% and stomatal conductance by 40% compared with plants growing in full sun. Pseudostem temperature was 2.1 K lower on plants growing in shade. This led to a reduction in monthly leaf emergence rate and an extended cycle time. An additional extension to cycle time was caused by the extra 3.4 leaves produced before flowering on plants growing under windbreak shading. The decreased photosynthesis of leaves growing in shade was partially compensated for in the P cycle by an extended flowering to harvest interval, resulting in no loss of bunch mass. However, bunch mass was significantly reduced in the R1 cycle, when flower to harvest intervals were similar. The most significant effect of windbreak shading was therefore a cumulative 10.6% extension in cycle time over the two crop cycles. The effect of a longer cycle and reduced bunch mass in the R1, caused by windbreak shading, resulted in an overall reduction of 13% in annual yield per ha, compared with plants growing in full sun.

Two bean (Phaseollus vulgaris L.) cultivars, Arroyo Loro and DOR 364, and four lines, 9443-1, 9443-8, 9443-33, 9226-17, were intercropped once or twice with one cycle of plantain cultivar Maricongo at the AES-UPR Corozal substation during 1994-1995. The first cycle of beans intercropped at the time of plantain planting produced a high yield. The second cycle of beans intercropped two months before the termination of plantain harvest yielded poorly. The height of intercropped plantain plants was less than that of non-intercropped plantain plants (P < 0.05) at six months after planting. However, at 12 months, there was no height difference between them. There was no significant difference in diameter of pseudostem, nor in number of leaves, between the intercropped and the non-intercropped plantain plants. Plantain yields, in terms of number of fruits and bunch weight, were not significantly affected by the intercropping (P < 0.05). The highest net income of the intercropping treatment was derived from the first cycle of the bean line 9443-1 ($7,646/ha). This net income represents an additional income of $4,894/ha beyond that of plantain monoculture.

Plantains exhibit great variability in West and Central Africa, which accounts for 60% of world production. Sixteen quantitative characteristics were evaluated in 75 plantain and 18 banana cultivars during several production cycles. The extent of variation in quantitative continuous characteristics and the phenotypic correlations between them were analysed. Index descriptors based on the combination of two characteristics were calculated. Despite the significant (P &lt; 0.05) influence of the environment and the genotype-by-environment interaction, most of the variation was significantly affected by the specific genotype of the Musa accessions. The most productive cultivars were the Cavendish bananas and the giant French plantains (&gt; 30 t ha-1 year-1). Five phenotypic correlations were common to all known taxonomic Musa groups. Short-cycling cultivars showed early flowering, whereas tall cultivars had wide plant girth and many leaves. The number of fruit per bunch was significantly associated with the number of hands (or nodal clusters of fruit). The most important component of yield potential was bunch weight in all Musa cultivars, and days to harvest only in the dessert bananas derived from interspecific crosses of M. acuminata. Index descriptors may be useful for selection of traits that are difficult to score or that show a high coefficient of variation. Short Musa cultivars may be selected by calculating the index of pseudostem condensation. A low value of pseudostem condensation (&lt; 9 cm leaf-1) was characteristic of known dwarf plantain and banana cultivars.

A dwarf variant (TC1-229) of banana resistant to race 4 of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense was identified from a tall, resistant Cavendish cultivar, 'Tai Chiao No. 1'. This study showed that the dwarf characteristic of TC1-229 was retained over 4 clonal generations. Although 3% of tissue-cultured plants of TC1-229 were found to be a tall reversion, the dwarf characteristic of TC1-229 appears to be a relatively stable genetic trait. The average pseudostem height of TC1-229 in the plant crop was 229 cm which was about 62 cm shorter than its source plant. TC1-229 retained the resistance to fusarium wilt in a wide range of environments. Unlike Dwarf Cavendish, the leaf bases of TC1-229 were not crowded and the bunch stalk was normal, thus 'choking' was not observed. This study shows that the step-wise selection of beneficial traits by using somaclonal variation can be useful in banana improvement.

Disease severity associated with the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum is generally thought to be proportional to the population of fungal propagules in the soil. However, results from studies using naturally infested soil are contradictory, implicating host predisposition to disease. In this study, soil was amended with chicken manure to investigate the interdependence between the activity and invasiveness of the pathogen, and the incidence of Panama disease in susceptible banana plantlets. Two soil types naturally infested with either race 1 or race 4 of the pathogen, and cultivars Lady finger and Grande Naine, were used. Pathogen activity was measured by burying root tip segments for 5 days, then calculating the frequency of isolation of Fusarium from the segments. Pathogen invasion was measured by transplanting banana plantlets into trays of amended and unamended soil for 4 weeks, then calculating the frequency of recovery of Fusarium from each pseudostem. Amending both soil types with chicken manure enhanced both pathogen invasion and disease incidence. However, pathogen activity was not correlated with either parameter. We postulate that the addition of chicken manure is predisposing banana plantlets to Panama disease, by reducing the efficacy of the host wound response.

The effects of host and non-host plant odours on the foraging responses of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), were investigated in the laboratory through arena and olfactometer bioassays. Contrary to previous reports that banana rhizome and pseudostem were the most attractive parts to the weevil, dead leaves were most preferred. Comparison of dead banana leaves with dead leaves of other plants showed that attractant odours were present in yam, cocoyam and dead grasses but absent in cocoa and soybean leaves. Complete leaf senescence while the leaf was attached to the mother plant proved necessary for the development of the dead-leaf-based odours but the involvement of microbial organisms could not be demonstrated. It is possible that dead-leaf-based attractants could be used in combination with microbials such as entomogenous fungi and nematodes in integrated management of C. sordidus.

Scientific strategies for crop improvement ensue from genetic knowledge gain from the relevant breeding populations. Few genetic studies were undertaken in Musa before the 1990s, despite the importance of the crop in human diet in the tropics. It was believed that genetic studies of most cultivated Musa, a virtually sterile triploid crop, were impossible. This explains the absence, until recently, of inheritance studies in triploid plantain and banana and the lack of genetic markers. Although several characteristics of the Musa crop make genetic analysis difficult, the production of euploid test-cross segregating populations obtained from triploid-diploid crosses has made inheritance studies possible. Thus, plantain and banana genomes have been investigated at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) since 1992. This paper provides insight into the genetics of black sigatoka and banana weevil resistance, pseudostem waxiness, virus susceptibility, apical dominance and suckering behavior, dwarfism, bunch orientation, fruit parthenocarpy, and male fertility. It also discusses the effects of genetic markers, ploidy and the environment on quantitative variation of disease and pest resistance as well as growth parameters of yield. This new knowledge has provided important information to develop IITA's scientific breeding strategy for the genetic improvement of plantain and banana.

The movement and mobilisation of phosphorus in various tissues of banana was studied using 32P. The isotope was given by pseudostem injection and activity measured in various tissues. It was inferred that the male inflorescence, rhizome, fruit and fruit peduncle are the major nutrient sinks. The activity pattern in different hands showed that the highest activity was in the fourth followed by the third, second and fifth (terminal) and least in the first hand (first to emerge) in a five hand system. Another experiment conducted on various intensities of bunch trimming in a eight hand system revealed that trimming of three terminal hands improved yield and finger characters like length, girth and weight. The trimmed hands could be used as a vegetable and the retained hands for yielding quality fruits. Thus the same bunch serves the dual purpose of vegetable and fruit. The study underlines the imperative need for removing the male bud, fruit peduncle and undeveloped hands.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

To compare the mineral nutrition of organically and normally grown banana plants, observations were made on growth and yield of organic banana plants, at the Canary Islands. The data were then discussed opposite the results previously reported for conventional plantations. Materials and methods. Growth parameters (plant height, leaf emission rate, pseudostem circumference) and yield parameters (bunch weight, number of hands, finger grade, etc.) were measured during ten months on an organically grown banana plantation of Dwarf Cavendish cv. Leaf N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn contents were also assessed. Results and discussion. Leaf emission rates showed higher values in late spring and early summer (0.099-0.109 leaf.d-1), while pseudostem circumference grew more in late spring (0.238 cm.d-1) than in summer. In August, pseudostem circumference decreased dramatically, probably because the plants with a larger circumference had flowered before that month and could not be measured. Bunches gave good yields for the zone (43.59 kg on average) and had a high mean number of hands (12.79). Number of fingers of the second upper hand (25.63), their grade (37.63 cm), length (23.50 cm) and weight (165.19 g) ranged from normal to high. Month of harvesting influenced yield and quality of the fruits. Leaf content of N, P, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn fell within the normal range related to the conventionally grown banana plants. Potassium foliar content showed low levels but not deficiencies, whereas Ca leaf concentrations were high but not excessive. No relationship was found among leaf nutrient levels and growth, yield and fruit quality parameters. © 2001 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

An experiment was established to characterize twenty-seven locally selected and introduced plantain clones. The clones were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Twenty morphological descriptors were used to obtain information of the plant, bunch and individual fruits at bunch-emergence and at harvest. The clones were first organized into two main groups on the basis of their genomic constitution: true plantain (Musa AAB) and cooking banana (Musa ABB, AAAB). Within the second group, we included three Musa AAB clones that are considered distinctive cooking bananas because the M. acuminata species responsible for the donation of the A genome had its origin in the Pacific and not in Asia. In each main group the clones were subdivided into true-horn, false-horn and French on the basis of bunch phenotype. Clones in these three subgroups were further subdivided into tall and dwarf, depending on the height of the pseudostem. After the clones were organized into this classification, statistical comparisons were made between or among those corresponding to the same subdivision, utilizing the data obtained from the plant, bunch and individual fruit traits. This scheme is easy to implement in the field, provides for the clustering and separation of clones regardless of their geographical origin and common names, and offers the opportunity for agronomists and horticulturists to learn about the economic potential of the clones from the outset. The application of this scheme will allow the number of plantain accessions in the TARS collection to be reduced from 27 to 20 clones.

Despite extensive research since pathogenicity was first established in 1919, no cultural or chemical control strategy has proven effective against Fusarium wilt of bananas. The efficacy of cultural control is attributed to the suppression of pathogen activity. Yet, amending naturally infested soil with aged chicken manure has been shown to enhance disease severity, without any change in the activity of the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) in the soil. In this study, the effect of amending soil with composted sawdust, and of solarising soil, was compared with the effect of amending soil with chicken manure. Bioassays comparing the activity of Foc in the soil with the extent of invasion of banana pseudostem tissue by Foc were used to investigate why strategies targetting pathogen survival have not proven successful in controlling this disease. The enhancement of Foc invasion of the banana plantlets was reproduced with the addition of chicken manure to the naturally infested soil. However, changes in the activity of Foc in the soil were not associated with changes in the frequency of invasion of the plantlets. Invasion of banana pseudostems in the sawdust and solarisation treatments was not significantly different from invasion in the respective control treatments, despite a reduction in the activity of Foc in the sawdust-amended soil and an enhancement in the solarised soil. Moreover, the increase in Foc activity in the solarised soil recorded during the bioassays occurred despite the effectiveness of solarisation in reducing the survival of Foc in pre-colonised banana root tips buried in the soil. Changes in the frequency of invasion were associated with changes in the availability of mineral nitrogen, particularly ammonium N. These results suggest that the physiological response of banana cultivars to ammonium N may be associated with their susceptibility to Fusarium wilt. Accordingly, cultural strategies for controlling Panama disease will only be effective if they enhance the ability of the host to resist invasion.

Sterility has profound effects on the development of reproductive tissues in members of the Musaceae and limits genetic improvement required to deal with new diseases. Ovules of seeded diploid Musa acuminata (AA) and edible triploids (AAA) from the same cytogenetic group, plus edible triploids containing genomes of the M. balbisiana cytogenetic group (AAB, ABB) and the related genus Ensete sp. were studied to determine the effects of sterility on the growth and development of the ovule and its tissues. Specimens were collected from subtropical and Mediterranean environments in Australia. At anthesis, the ovules of triploid plants were 36% larger than the ovules of diploid plants. The diploid ovules ceased growth shortly after the inflorescence emerged from the pseudostem. In contrast, the triploid ovules continued to grow 7-10 days past anthesis, increasing in size by 70%. All ovules of diploid M. acuminata ssp. had an embryo sac at anthesis, against 97% for triploids. At anthesis the embryo sacs in diploid ovules occupied 2.7% of the nucellus compared with 1.5% in triploid ovules. The embryo sacs did not grow between bunch emergence and anthesis, once formed they maintained the same size. Many embryo sacs were not positioned correctly, flush with the nucellar cap. The diploid M. acuminata ssp. had 75% of embryo sacs correctly positioned against 10% in the edible triploids. The proportion of balbisiana genome (B) did not affect ovule or nucellus size or shape, or cell number across the nucellus. It increased the embryo sac presence 96-100% of ovules. The sterile edible triploid bananas have embryo sacs at anthesis but many are incorrectly positioned, which may contribute to their sterility. The balbisiana genome in the edible triploids was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the number of correctly positioned embryo sacs and this may contribute to the increased fertility associated with the B genome. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ten plantain (Musa x paradisiaca L.) varieties were evaluated at the experimental farm of the Institute, Lucknow to find out the suitable varieties for commercial cultivation. The highest pseudostem girth was recorded in 'Burdi Chinia' followed by 'Bhos', 'Chinia', 'Kothia' and 'Bersain'. The pseudostem height was maximum in 'Chinia' and 'Bhos' and minimum in 'Dakhnisagar' and 'No 15. 'Bhos' and 'Gauria' took maximum days (456 days) for a crop cycle and 'Dakhnisagar' (375) and 'Chinia' (383) minimum days. Bunch weight and estimated yield/ha were maximum in 'Chakkel', followed by 'Bersain', 'Bhos', 'Chinia', 'Gauria' and 'Kothia'. Minimum bunch weight, estimated yield/ ha and hand weight were recorded in Dakhnisagar. Finger length was maximum (20.9 cm) in 'Beula'. The finger diameter (5.6 mm) and weight (218.7g) were higher in 'Bhos' than the other varieties. On the basis of bunch weight/plant, estimated yield/ha and short crop cycle, varieties 'Chakkel', 'Chinia', 'Bersain', 'Kothia', respectively, were found suitable for commercial cultivation in subtropics of north India.

Plantain production (Musa spp.) in Central and South America and the Caribbean is affected by bacterial diseases. In Puerto Rico, production of the plantain 'Hua Moa' is affected by a condition known as bunch abortion or 'choke neck'. This condition in some cases is accompanied by soft rot symptoms and therefore could be related to phytopathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacteria related to the soft rot tissues on plants affected with the bunch abortion symptoms and determine their virulence in other clones of plantain and banana. Bacterial colonies were isolated from pseudostems of Hua Moa at three locations in Puerto Rico, using semi-selective and nutritive agar media. The pathogenicity was determined by using potato and plantain pseudostem discs in humid chambers under in vitro conditions. Pathogenic bacteria were identified by using the BIOLOG® system. Under greenhouse conditions, the virulence of Burkholderia gladioli, Pseudomonas spinosa, Erwinia chrysanthemi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was confirmed on plantain (Maricongo, FIAH-121, Enano Común, and Hua Moa) and banana (Grand Nain) using a scale from 1 to 9. All clones evaluated under greenhouse conditions were susceptible to E. chrysanthemi, potential causal agent of soft rot in Hua Moa plantain once the bunch abortion appears. Burkholderia gladioli is reported for the first time affecting plantain and banana.This bacterium was more virulent in Hua Moa and Grand Nain clones with severity of 7 and 5, respectively, than in Maricongo, severity 3. Pseudomonas spinosa and P. aeruginosa produced less damage with severity less than 4, than E. chrysanthemi and B. gladioli with severity greater than 4. This research was conducted under in vitro and greenhouse conditions and demonstrates that the most important bacteria causing soft rot in plants with the choke neck condition are E. chrysanthemi and B. gladioli. It is recommended to conduct field studies using plants up to the reproductive stage to determine whether these bacteria are also related as causal agents of the choke neck.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between vegetative and productive characteristics of banana tree (Musa spp) cv Prata-Anã (genomic group AAB) differently managed from the conventional system. The experiment was carried out in an orchard with five years old banana plants spaced by 3,5 x 2,0 m, in the Fazendas Reunidas FFL Ltda., at Cristais Paulista, São Paulo, Brazil. The experiment was a split plot under a completely randomized design with three replicates, being the main treatments constituted by: M1 - daughter-plant without the mother-plant whose stem was cut after flowering; M2 - daughter-plant and mother- plant conventionally managed until harvest. The sub plots were constituted by twelve periods of selection of the daughter-plants (February 2002 to January 2003). The pseudostem diameter and the bunch weight of all plants and the vegetative period of the daughter-plants were evaluated. The statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the stem diameter of the daughter-plants and mother-plants. The stem diameter of the mother-plant was positive correlated with its bunch weight. However the stem diameter of the daughter-plant not was correlated with its bunch weight. The vegetative cycle and the pseudostem diameter of the daughter-plants were negatively correlated. The Plant management (M1 and M2) and the selection of periods daughter-plant did not affected the correlations evaluated in this study.

The banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus, is the most important insect pest of banana and plantain in the world. Cultural control methods were investigated over 2 years in southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Harvesting at ground level and dissection of remnants (treatment 1), and covering the base of the mat (entire plant consisting of several meristems) with soil and moving debris to the inter-row (treatment 2), were compared to a positive control that involved treatment of plants with a registered pesticide (treatment 3), and a negative control that involved harvesting at 150 cm from the collar with no soil or sanitation amendments (treatment 4). Yield, weevil damage and pseudostem girth of plants were measured from August to November annually, while adult beetle densities were assessed over 4 weeks in October/November and April. Nematode samples were taken and analysed in October/November every year. Damage parameters included the coefficient of infestation, the percentage coefficient of infestation (PCI) at two intervals, the summed PCI value, the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder and cortex, and the mean cross-sectional damage percentage. A randomized block design with three replicates was used in the trial. The parameters were similar before the onset of the trial. Fruit yield and plant girth, corrected by nematode densities, were not significantly different in any treatment, nor were the nematodes controlled. Soil cover and recession of remnants was the only effective treatment, significantly reducing the CI, but not the adult density or the other damage parameters. Soil cover showed promise as a cultural control method because it only needs to be applied seasonally and reduced the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder, the damage parameter most closely related to yield, by 14%. © 2008 The Authors.

World production of bananas, estimated at 106 million tons (Lescot 2006), ranks fourth in agricultural production. Bananas make up the largest production of fruits and the largest international trade, more than apple, orange, grape and melon. Bananas are cultivated in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical zones on 5 continents. Banana products represent an essential food resource and have an important socioeconomic and ecological role. Current varieties are generally seedless triploid clones either of the single genome A from the species Musa acuminata (group AAA) or of both genomes A and B from species M. acuminata and Musa balbisiana (groups AAB and ABB). More rarely, diploid varieties (AA and AB) and tetraploid clones are encountered. There are two major channels of banana production: those cultivated for export and those reserved for local markets. The main banana varieties cultivated for export, known as Grande Naine, Poyo and Williams, belong to the monospecific triploid bananas (AAA) of the Cavendish sub-group. They differ from each other only in somatic mutations such as plant height or bunch and fruit shape. Their production relies on an intensive monoculture of the agro-industrial type, without rotation, and a high quantity of inputs. Banana cultivation for local consumption is based on a large number of varieties adapted to different conditions of production as well as the varied uses and tastes of consumers. Diploid bananas, close to the ancestral wild forms, are still cultivated in Southeast Asia. In other regions, triploid clones belonging to different sub-groups Plantain, Silk, Lujugira, Gros Michel, Pisang Awak are the most widely distributed. Bananas have many uses. They are not only consumed as fresh fruits but also cooked, like plantains. They are processed in various ways, into chips, fries, fritters, purees, jams, ketchup and alcohol (banana wine and beer have a very significant production in East Africa). The daily per capita consumption of bananas from 30 g to over 500 g in some East African countries. Apart from the fruit, other parts of the plant are also used: the pseudostem is used for its fibres and as floaters (Musa textilis or abacá) in the Philippines, and the leaves are used to make shelters or roofs or as wraps for cooking. In Thailand, the floral buds of particular varieties (Pisang Awak) are used in various culinary preparations. Some varieties are also considered to have medicinal properties. Cultivated throughout the world, bananas are threatened by several diseases and pests (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Jones 1999) that need to be taken into account for banana improvement. Various major fungal diseases are constraints in industrial production and, to a lesser degree, in local production. For example, Sigatoka disease (SD) due to Mycosphaerella musicola and black leaf streak disease (BLSD) caused by M. fijiensis result in production losses in large industrial plantations and necessitate costly pest control measures to be adopted. In certain production zones, Fusarium wilt due to the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense prevents the cultivation of susceptible varieties like the Gros Michel types. Great constraints are also exerted by the nematodes Radopholus similis and several representatives of the genus pratylenchus and by the black weevil of banana, Cosmopolites sordidus. Also, viral diseases are spreading. Those of greatest concern are due to BBTV (banana bunchy top virus), CMV (cucumber mosaic virus), BSV (banana streak virus) and BBMV (banana bract mosaic virus). Chemical control measures used in intensive cultivation are not available to small banana farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, for some diseases, there is no effective chemical control. Genetic improvement has thus been focused mainly on obtaining varieties resistant to principal pests and diseases. Breeding bananas through hybridisation, which began in the 1920s, is currently being pursued at seven research centres. FHIA in Honduras is breeding banana for export as well as the cooking types (Rowe 1984). EMBRAPA-CNPMF in Brazil (Dantas et al. 1993), NRCB and TNAU in India (Sathiamoorthy et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy and Kumar 2004) aim at breeding local types of dessert and cooking bananas. CARBAP (Jenny et al. 2003) in Cameroon and IITA (Tenkouano and Swennen 2004) in Nigeria are conducting research on plantain and banana breeding in Africa. These six research centres are mainly interested in developing new tetraploid varieties by crossing triploid varieties and wild or improved diploid clones with resistance to diseases. Some secondary triploids derived from crosses between these new tetraploid varieties and other diploid clones were also obtained. In the French West Indies, CIRAD has conceived another crossing strategy aimed at the development of triploid varieties directly from diploid plant material (Bakry et al. 2001). Since the 1980s, apart from these conventional breeding approaches, other groups have focused on mutagenesis as at IAEA (Roux 2004) in Austria or on the selection of somaclonal variants as at TBRI (Hwang and Ko 1990) in Taiwan. These technologies appeared as a result of the development of in vitro culture techniques designed for rapid industrial multiplication of micro-propagated banana plants. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

The banana tree demands large quantities of fertilizers to maintain its nutritional requirements and achieve high productivity, but large percentage applied are not available, since it gets lost mainly by fixation, leaching and volatilization. The objective of this study was to evaluate the rate of remobilization and repartition of nutrients in banana tree, cultivar Thap Maeo, cultivated in the Western Amazon. The results showed that the highest proportion of K, Na, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe and Zn was found in the pseudostem. The remaining flowers represent a strong drain of nutrients. The biomass that comes from the culture residues represents a significant source of nutrients. The nutrient remobilization index was higher with N and K. The inverse was observed with Fe and Mn.

Purpose of review: This article reviews some of the versatile postharvest uses of plantains and other components of plantain plants. Findings: Plantain belongs to the Musacace family and is cultivated in over 120 countries. Many African, Asian and Latin American countries depend primarily on the plantain plant for sustainability. Mature plantains are consumed as a staple on cooking, while overripe fruit is consumed in raw form. Plantains are rich in iron, potassium, ascorbic acid and vitamin A, and are a very good source of starch, which has various uses, such as in functional foods and edible films. In addition to plantains being used for food, the waste material such as the peel, pseudo-stem, pith, male bud and leaves, have also been used as food and feed, as well as for other special purposes in most of the plantain-growing parts of the world. Directions for future research: A plantain-based diet can be designed for diabetic people based on its low glycaemic index. Moreover, due to its high starch content and cheaper cost, it has the potential to be added to other fruit-based juices and beverages as starch filler. Further research can be done on deflavouring of plantain, which might overwhelm other fruit based beverages when added as a filler. Since most of the parts of the plantain plant have some or other therapeutic value, further research can be done to extract the phytochemicals for potential drug development.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

The aim of this research emerged to evaluate the content of N, P, K in flours from different parts of edible Musa clones. For this experiment, a randomized block design with four replicates was established by using five Musa clones ('FHIA 01', 'FHIA 02', 'FHIA 03', 'Yangambi Km5' y 'Plátano Hartón' and 36 plants per plot. Pseudostem, leaf, shell, fruit pulp, acorn, and rachis of the bunch were ground to fine flour; and a chemical analysis of N, P, K nutrients was performed. Statistical analysis of data in a factorial arrangement was used. A highly significant difference for N, P, K contents was found, resulting in higher content of N from 'FHIA 03́ leaf flour (2.57%), P from 'FHIA 03' and 'Yagambi Km 5' acorn flour (0.37 and 0.34% respectively); and K from 'Plátano Hartón' rachis flour (2.32%). As conclusion, these Musaceae vegetative parts represent a potential in flour preparation as raw material for making animal feed with acceptable N P K content, giving an integral advantage for crop and plant parts which can be used by the producers. Digestibility studies in animals and food rations for economic feasibility are recommended.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Banana cultivars have been classified into genome groups based on their morphological characters. Modern molecular tools are available to support characterisation, identification of hybridisation and analysis of evolutionary trends. Two wild species, Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Cacutta-4' (female parent) and Musa balbisiana 'Bee Hee Kela' (male parent) collected from Northeastern Hilly region of India, were crossed to produce F1 populations of the AB type with characters from the heterozygous parents. Seed set was very high (3552 seeds) and 317 seedlings germinated. About 150 seedlings were maintained for further evaluation and molecular mapping. Plant height was dwarf to medium, similar to 'Calcutta-4'. The pseudostem was green with few black-brown blotches, expressing both characters, but less waxy, which is characteristic of the 'A' genome. For the 52 hybrids that flowered, most bunches were horizontal, showing the AB character. However, there was good segregation for male flower colour. The colour varied from cream to pink-purple with gradations of pink (31% of the observed progeny). It was observed that 40% of the F1 population studied did not produce any pollen and was totally sterile, unlike the parent accessions. These F1 populations could serve as useful material for studying segregation of different morphological characters and molecular mapping.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Anã' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Anã' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Anã' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Anã' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Anã' cultivar.

The present study was conducted in two successive seasons (2009/2010 and 2010/2011) on the first and second ratoons of Williams banana plants cultivated in loamy clay soil under flood irrigation at a private orchard located at Tanta, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt. Four planting densities (ranged from 933 to 1400 plants feddan-1) were examined to study their effect on vegetative growth, flowering, yield and fruit quality of Williams banana. Banana plants grown at close spacing had taller pseudostem than plants grown under wide spacing. The highest yield per feddan was obtained from plants spaced at 3×2 in with two plants per hole, followed by those at 3×1 in, with one plant per hole since it was 34.07 and 30.33 tons in the first ratoon and 34.80 and 31.50 in the second ratoon for both planting distances, respectively. Earliest bunch shooting and minimum days for harvesting were recorded with planting distance 3×4 in with three plants per hole and bunch emerged earlier (12-13 days) than bunches produced from plants spaced at 3×1 in with one plants per hole in both first and second ratoons, respectively. Heaviest bunches were harvested from plants at 3×4 in spacing with three plants per hole. Increasing yield per feddan by this planting distance could be attributed mainly to the increasing number of plants in the area unit. The highest finger weight, length, Total Soluble Solids (TSS%) and total sugars% were produced from plant spaced at 3×4 in with three plants per hole. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.

Occurrence of multiple male buds in banana is a rare phenomenon. It is caused by branching of the peduncle or differentiation of the male flower into male bud. Five types of peduncle branching occur, viz.: (i) inside the pseudostem, (ii) at the time the peduncle emerges from the pseudostem, (iii) after the peduncle emerges from the pseudostem but before fruit development, (iv) during fruit development, and (v) after fruit development. Mostly, branching is accidental, except for that produced by 'Double Mahoi' cultivar that always produces two or three bunches per pseudostem, which is inherited. Differentiation of male flower into male bud in banana is the world's first reported case. It has been found in four accessions of probably the same clone of Musa acuminata subsp. siamea cultivated by the Hmong hill-tribe villagers living on the highlands in northern Thailand as an idol of worship to obtain prolific babies as well as to obtain more male buds as food for nursing mother. After a brief female phase with almost no fruit developed, numerous male flowers, instead of withering and dropping, differentiate into male buds with long rachilla. Close to a hundred small male buds may be produced on a single pseudostem, thus the name 'Kluai Roi Pli' (banana having hundred male buds) has been given to this clone of banana. A single, normal-sized terminal male bud continues to produce male flowers, which may or may not differentiate into male buds. The values of multiple male buds are: (1) to satisfy curiosity, (2) as educational material, (3) as an idol for worship, (4) as ornamental plant, and (5) economic gain of increasing overall yield, number of fruits and male buds, and size and length of fruits.

Absorption of applied 32P by the treated as well as neighbouring banana cv. Robusta plants under high density planting was studied on a sandy clay loam soil using 32P labelled super phosphate with application of three levels of P fertilizers viz., 60, 80, and 100 per cent at 15-35, 35-55 and 55-75 cm distance from pseudostem of the plant. The first, 2nd and 3rd dose of urea, labelled single superphosphate and muriate of potash was applied to banana at early vegetative (8th leaf/65 DAP), late vegetative (16th leaf/115 DAP) and bud differentiation stages (165 DAP). Higher 32P absorption (dpm/g of dry matter) in leaf was observed in the treatments supplied 100 per cent of recommended dose of fertilizers at closer distance of 15 to 35 cm distance from pseudostem during first split application and at middle distance of 35 to 55 cm from pseudostem during second and third split application. The maximum per cent phosphorus derived from fertilizer (% Pdff) was also recorded with the application of 100 per cent recommended dose of P fertilizers in the middle distance of 35-55 cm from the pseudostem of the experimental plant. No significant difference was observed in the leaves of Robusta banana. The study has brought out the differential nature of the absorption pattern in treated plant and border plants with different levels and placement of fertilizers. Radiophosphorus applied to the root zone was absorbed by the treated plant and the neighbouring plants. © 2014, Society for Plant Research. All Rights Reserved.

Enset [Ensete ventricosum (Welw.) Cheesman (Musaceae)] is a multi-purpose and drought-tolerant crop, traditionally grown in Ethiopia. Food from enset has nutritive values similar to potato; it could improve food and livelihood security for many in larger geographical areas. Agronomical advice is needed which requires increased knowledge of management techniques. The purposes of this study were to (i) compare traditional corm pre-treatments when planting for sucker production, (ii) compare all six officially released cultivars regarding sprouting and (iii) investigate the effect of watering on newly buried corms. Emergence rate and number and characteristics of sprouts were recorded. Corms, from 63 two year old plants, were buried in local soil supplied with cow manure in Wolaita Sodo, Ethiopia. Emergence was recorded daily. After nine months, including one rainy season, all suckers (totally 4405) were harvested and individually recorded. Regardless of cultivar, minimum time to emergence was 50 days. Sprouts from split parent corms emerged earlier than from entire. Emergence occurred from 100% of corms, number of sprouts was strongly correlated to cultivar: average 28-106. The cultivars responded similarly to corm splitting: the more pieces the corm was split into, the more sprouts per parent corm. Average pseudostem diameter of the seven largest per parent corm: 8-10 cm for all cultivars, leaf length: 3.1-3.7 m, remaining 2700 smaller suckers: diameter 3 cm (SD 1.8). Watering decreased the average time to emergence and levelled out the differences between pre-treatments. The traditional belief is that watering as well as manure on corm cause rotting; manure is therefore usually put on the soil surface. On the contrary, full emergence and unexpected large suckers may be a result of careful soil preparation with manure applied on corm directly; watering resulted in an even emergence and growth. In conclusion, vegetative propagation of enset is efficient, but methods used and agronomical advice can be improved. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2014.

The objective of this study was to agronomically characterize plants from induced chromosome doubling experiments in the Pisang Lilin parthenocarpic banana accession to select genotypes that will be used as 2n gamete donors in crosses with improved diploids to generate secondary triploids. Twenty-two plants were evaluated, of which 17 were autotetraploids. Compared with the original diploids, the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids showed significant increases in the plant height, number of living leaves at flowering and harvest, pseudostem diameter, and length and diameter of fruits; the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids also exhibited greater fruit and bunch weights compared with the original diploids. In addition, all autotetraploid plants did not exhibit any symptoms of yellow Sigatoka. Female fertility was also detected, as some plants produced seeds, indicating that they can be used as female parents. Therefore, the autotetraploids characterized in this study exhibited useful agronomical traits to be used as 2n gamete donors for generating secondary triploids. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Being one of the important tropical and subtropical fruit trees, banana (Musa.spp.) belongs to the family Musaceae and the order Scitaminae with two genera, Musa and Ensete. In a field survey, research team has discovered a potential banana mutant strain ‘HD-1’ with a sound economic value. The results of the finding are as follows: based on Simmonds’ classification, the pseudostem of banana strain ‘HD-1’ is relatively short and purplish red; its upright outward petiole groove has red edges and wraps its pseudostem loosely. Its ploidy is 3×, AAA type. Karyotype analysis shows that the number of chromosomes is 33, the karyotype formula is 2n=3x=33=2L + 3 M2 + 4 M1 + 2 S, ‘HD-1’ is classified as ‘1B’ type. With the help of ISSR molecular markers, we find thatbanana 'HD-1' has the closest relationship with Pubei and Tianbao dwarf banana; the similarity coefficient is 0.81. In an artificial simulation tests of cold, drought and salt resistance environment changes of physiological and biochemical indexes indicate that ‘HD-1’ exhibits stronger defense capability than Brazil banana. By way of inoculation with injury of root dipping method, we respectively treat two kinds of banana seedlings inoculated Banana Fusarium wilt race 4 small species. The results show that their resistance evaluation scores are 3 and 4, disease levels are ‘susceptible’ and ‘high sensitivity’ respectively. We conclude that ‘HD-1’ has stronger resistance ability toFusarium wilt than Brazil banana. © 2016, Pakistan Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

Bacterial diseases of bananas and enset have not received, until recently, an equal amount of attention compared to other major threats to banana production such as the fungal diseases black leaf streak (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense). However, bacteria cause significant impacts on bananas globally and management practices are not always well known or adopted by farmers. Bacterial diseases in bananas and enset can be divided into three groups: (1) Ralstoniaassociated diseases (Moko/Bugtok disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and banana blood disease caused by R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis); (2) Xanthomonas wilt of banana and enset, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum and (3) Erwinia-associated diseases (bacterial head rot or tip-over disease Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi), bacterial rhizome and pseudostem wet rot (Dickeya paradisiaca formerly E. chrysanthemi pv. paradisiaca). Other bacterial diseases of less widespread importance include: bacterial wilt of abaca, Javanese vascular wilt and bacterial fingertip rot (probably caused by Ralstonia spp., unconfirmed). This review describes global distribution, symptoms, pathogenic diversity, epidemiology and the state of the art for sustainable disease management of the major bacterial wilts currently affecting banana and enset. © 2017 Blomme, Dita, Jacobsen, Pérez Vicente, Molina, Ocimati, Poussier and Prior.

Ethnopharmacological relevance Musa acuminata, the wild species of banana is a plant of the tropical and subtropical regions. Over the past few decades, the health benefits of M. acuminata have received much attention. All parts of the plant including fruits, peel, pseudostem, corm, flowers, leaves, sap and roots have found their use in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. Literature review have indicated use of M. acuminata in the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cough, bronchitis, dysentery, allergic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and some of the non-communicable diseases. The reported pharmacological activities of M. acuminata include antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic, anticancer, and antimicrobial especially anti-HIV activity. This review presents information on the phytochemicals and pharmacological studies to validate the traditional use of different parts of M. acuminata in various diseases and ailments. A comprehensive assessment of the biological activities of M. acuminata extracts is included and possible mechanisms and phytochemicals involved have also been correlated to provide effective intervention strategies for preventing or managing diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was performed on M. acuminata using ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, local magazines, unpublished materials, and scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The Plant List, Promusa, Musalit, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases were used to validate the scientific names and also provide information on the subspecies and cultivars of M. acuminata. Result and discussion The edible part of M. acuminata provides energy, vitamins and minerals. All other parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. The rich diversity of phytochemicals present in them probably contributes to their beneficial effects, and validates the role of M. acuminata plant parts used by various tribes and ethnic groups across the geographical areas of the world. Conclusion This review presents information on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of M. acuminata plant parts. Pharmacological studies support the traditional uses of the plant, and probably validate the uses of M. acuminata by the indigenous people to treat and heal many infections and diseases. Some studies on animal models have been carried out, which also provide evidence of efficacy of the M. acuminata plant as a therapeutic agent. These observations suggest that M. acuminata plant parts possesses pluripharmacological properties, and can be used in designing potent therapeutic agents. However, individual bioactive constituent(s) from different parts of this plant need further investigations to confirm various pharmacological claims, and to explore the potential of M. acuminata in the development of drugs and use in functional foods. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

Cultivation of banana in modified high density planting systems with more crop cycles is widely followed in Gujarath, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu states of India due to its higher productivity and lower cost of production. In this system, three suckers were planted in a pit spaced at 1.8 × 3.6 m accommodating 1542 mats or 4626 plants/ha. Nematode pests remain a threat to this modified system of banana cultivation especially in ratoon cycles. Investigations were undertaken in ratoon banana grown under a high density planting system on effect of cartap hydrochloride 4G, carbofuran 3G, Glomus mosseae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Sunhemp, Coriander, Marigold, and neem cake on control mixed populations of burrowing nematode, Radopholus similis, and spiral nematode, Helicotylenchus multicinctus. Application of cartap hydrochloride @ 20 g/mat twice at the time of ratooning followed by 4 months later gave greater control of R. similis and H. multicinctus in soil and root with lesser damage in root and corm than untreated plants. The banana plants in this treatment were taller with a larger number of leaves and thicker pseudostem girth resulting in 33.4–37.3% more bunch yield than other treatments including control. The effect of cartap hydrochloride at 20 g/mat was similar at higher dose (40 g/mat) but significantly superior than 10 g/mat dose. Carbofuran 3 G @ 80 g/mat twice, Neem cake @ 250 g/mat twice and growing Marigold around the basin and incorporating before flowering were the next best treatments on nematode control and growth promotion. The P. fluorescens and G. mosseae applied were not established well and caused lesser nematode control in ratoon banana grown under high density planting system. Hence application of cartap hydrochloride @ 20 g/mat or neem cake @ 250 g/mat or growing Marigold around the basin and incorporating before flowering could rectify the damage caused by R. similis and H. multicinctus in ratoon banana crops growing under a high density planting system. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. © 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Morphological traits are routinely used to characterize the banana varieties but are unable to precisely discriminate the closely resembling ones. Current study explores the five common banana varieties using 41 qualitative traits and discriminating traits are shortlisted based on uniformity within variety (zero Shannon index), differences between varieties (varying mode scores across varieties and significant binomial distribution of mode class from non-mode class). Five traits at vegetative stage (leaf habit, leaf blotch color, color of midrib leaf dorsal surface, petiole canal area, and pigment under pseudostem) are useful as unique descriptors for quick discrimination of five banana varieties at 62.5–100% accuracy levels. © 2021, The National Academy of Sciences, India.

Background. Enset (Ensete ventricosum (Welw.) Cheesman) is an important staple crop for more than 20 million people in Ethiopia. Precise ethnobotanical information of intraspecific enset diversity and local knowledge on how farmers maintain, manage, and benefit from enset genetic resources is imperative for the promotion, conservation, and improvement of enset and its farming system. The aim of this study was to identify and document the wealth of indigenous knowledge associated with the distribution, diversity, and management of enset in Adola Rede District. Methods. The study was conducted in Adola Rede District of Guji Zone, Oromia, Ethiopia. To identify and document the wealth of indigenous knowledge, the data were collected mainly through individual interviews and observation with 139 farm households and key informant interviews. Results. Thirty-four landraces were identified. The number of landraces cultivated in individual households ranged from 3 to 14 (mean of 6.08 ± 2.17). The farmers distinguish landraces primarily using morphological features such as pseudostem color, midrib color, plant height, and leaf color. Agronomic characteristics such as resistance to disease and pest and maturity time were secondary criteria for the identification of enset landraces in the study area. Enset is mainly used as food (kocho, bulla, and amicho) and source of fiber, and it has also medicinal value for both humans and livestock. Farmers prefer a landrace to the other, for example, Gantichoo for worqee (kocho) and fiber, Adoo for budhaa (bulla), Nimfoo for amicho, and Astaraa for medicinal use. The majority of the informants (74.10%) have got their plant material by multiplying planting material by themselves, exchanging with neighbors (16.50%), and purchasing from the market (9.40%). Conclusion. There was relatively high on-farm enset landrace diversity, and the indigenous people had a long tradition of enset cultivation, conservation, and maintenance of landraces in the district. The information is crucial for developing community-based complementary in situ and ex situ conservation strategies to foster conservation of enset genetic resources and associated indigenous knowledge system. © 2022 Wendawek A.

RNA of Musa cultivars under different status of pest infestation exhibited significant difference on quantity and quality. Differential display reverse transcription of RNA extracted from two AAB Musa cultivars, of which one is susceptible and other is resistant to infestation by Odoiporus longicollis Olivier, showed sharp difference on the banding pattern of cDNA. Susceptible Palayankodan and resistant Thenkaali exhibited 13 shared bands. As the susceptible cultivar showed 30 unique bands, resistant cultivar exhibited 56 bands. Identical study done in Musa cultivars of different genome constitution and ploidy such as susceptible Kappa (AAA) and resistant Aadinkombu (AA), there was sharp decrease on the on the number of shared bands and it was only nine. Here also number of unique bands are as high as 55 in resistant cultivar and 36 in susceptible Kappa. Proteins, the translation products of RNA also exhibited increase on the number of bands in resistant cultivars than to that of susceptible cultivars. Additionally expressed proteins in resistant cultivars indicated more active genes in them and some of which may confer pest resistance. Differential expression of genes responsible for the synthesis of secondary metabolites make Musa cultivars either susceptible or resistant to infestation by O. longicollis, which completes the whole lifecycle in the pseudostem of banana and plantains. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The National Academy of Sciences, India.
