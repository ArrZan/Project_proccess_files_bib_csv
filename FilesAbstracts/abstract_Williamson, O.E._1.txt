Without exaggeration, the basic challenge of management is economics: how to choose to employ scarce productive resources to accomplish limited objectives effectively. It is well recognized today, and increasingly so in post-industrial societies, that information, broadly defined, is a strategic economic resource that must be managed if it is to be productive. A comprehensive literature has developed in the discipline of economics which concerns information, information systems, and information-related phenomena of import to management and the development of management information systems (MIS). Although this literature is vast, this overview attempts to relate some of this work to MIS and MIS research.We highlight results in three general areas: (1) those which concern the effect of information upon economic markets external to the firm, (2) those which concern issues of information and its relation to decision making and the internal organization of the firm, and (3) those which concern questions of allocation and control of information resources within the firm. In particular, attention will be directed to interpretation of the major results related to the effect of information upon markets and upon individual decision making, team theory, agency theory, decomposition theory, resource allocation and pricing, incentives, and information evaluation.

Agency theory is employed to formalize the intuitive rationale for the widespread practice of setting up captive finance subsidiaries: reduced agency costs of debt increase the firm's consolidated debt capacity. Of the two Canadian industries tested, firms forming captives had significantly higher use of debt in manufacturing but failed to show any significant difference for merchandising. In light of confounding influences from tax-clientele effects, size difference, and support in tests on U.S. firms, the mixed finding should encourage further testing. The outcome of these tests suggests that it is potentially useful to think of captive finance subsidiaries in light of agency theory.

This paper has examined the structure of incentive schemes for divisional managers in a broad agency theory framework. The objective of any incentive scheme must be to reduce principal-agent 'friction'. More specifically, in the divisional case, it should seek to mitigate the divergence of the manager's interest from that of the centre. Such divergence may derive from differences in risk attitudes, and from limited or costly observability of the manager's skill and effort. Incentive schemes also need to take account of the managerial labour market, which has an essentially constraining role on the behaviour of the manager and the centre. The paper has implicitly subscribed to the premise on which all incentive arguments rest: that, in the absence of appropriate pecuniary inducements, managers will not pursue the firm's objective per se, whether it is one of profit maximisation, as assumed in this paper, or other dimensions. This premise has enabled the paper to concentrate on an explanation of many of the variables that enter the utility functions of divisional managers, whilst at the same time being aware that many other variables exist. A fuller specification of these variables provides a natural direction for research. This should lead to a unification of economic and behavioural input to this subject.

This article discusses two leading theoretical approaches to understanding how firms operate in markets and the functioning of their internal organizations. Game theory is a microanalytic approach that offers a useful framework for organizing thinking about the factors that influence firm strategic conduct vis-a-vis its competitors. Agency theory is mainly concerned with market mechanisms, such as an executive labor market or market for corporate control, that may discipline firm management in the absence of ownership control. Both approaches can yield useful hypotheses for empirical testing of factors affecting industry and firm performance. Copyright (c) 1988 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

The ownership strategies of 128 retail franchising systems are examined in the light of existing agency and resource scarcity explanations of this organizational form. Findings suggest that franchiser ownership strategies are more heterogeneous than previously recognized, and that neither explanation, alone accounts for observed ownership patterns. A path model of franchiser ownership patterns embodying agency and resource scarcity elements is developed that is consistent with empirical findings. Copyright (c) 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper reviews the evidence on takeover waves of the 1960s and 1980s, and discusses the implications of this evidence for corporate strategy, agency theory, capital market efficiency, and antitrust policy. We conclude that antitrust policy played an important role in the two takeover waves, and that the wave of the ';60s presents a problem for efficient capital markets.

Equity financing is the optimal strategy for innovating firms, which can use their financial structure as a signalling device to attract outside investors. This situation is likely to arise when the firm undertakes a specific purpose R&D project aimed at developing a certain product innovation. Typically, innovations of this kind draw on the firm's cumulative, idiosyncratic knowledge base and, accordingly, the innovation process involves an high degree of asset specificity. Under such circumstances, the terms of debt financing will be adjusted adversely, and equity financing will represent the most economically efficient solution. These arguments are developed in standard static principal-agent models dealing with New Technology Based Firms and publicly held large firms undertaking an aggressive R&D strategy. In the case of NTBFs, two kinds of optimal venture capital contracts are considered, which render the sharing rules independent (a) of the agent's action and (b) of both the agent's action and the specific assets involved in the transaction. Regarding innovating large firms, it is argued that in this case, too, equity represents the optimal financing strategy, and that top executives use their equity share to signal the firm's expected return stream and value to outside investors.

Taking agency theory and stakeholder theory as points of departure, this article proposes a paradigm that helps explain the following: (1) certain aspects of a firm's strategic behaviour; (2) the structure of management-stakeholder contracts; (3) the form taken by the institutional structures that monitor and enforce contracts between managers and other stakeholders; and (4) the evolutionary process that shapes both management-stakeholder contracts and the institutional structures that police those contracts.

The literature applying agency theory to management has focused on the performance advantages to be gained when ownership and control of the firm are aligned. This article investigates that premise by comparing family-owned and -managed and professionally managed firms. The article presents the results of a field survey that examined the extent to which family-owned and -managed firms differ across structural, process, and performance dimensions from their professionally managed counterparts. Significant differences exist between these two groups on both structural and process dimensions, and there is evidence that family-owned and -managed firms exhibit performance advantages as a result of the unification of ownership and control.

Vertical integration is a fundamental corporate strategy of interest to the fields of strategic management and organizational economics. This paper synthesizes theoretical arguments and empirical findings from this literature to identify the underlying advantages and disadvantages of choosing vertical financial ownership relative to vertical contracts. It then suggests that in the absence of agency and transaction costs, vertical financial ownership and vertical contracting are equivalent governance structures for achieving corporate objectives. However, given a world of positive agency and transaction costs, the key theoretic question then becomes predicting when market mechanisms are sufficient, when intermediate forms of vertical contracting become necessary, and when vertical financial ownership becomes the preferred governance structure. The concluding section of the paper provides a framework for making this analysis based on a synthesis of agency and transaction costs perspectives. Copyright (c) 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study examines, from a cultural perspective, owner-managers'and other stakeholders'interpretations of the partial fusion of ownership and control through high leverage in eight UK management buy-outs (MBOs). Owner-control and debt-control are interpreted as having positive effects on managerial motivation, organizational decision-making processes and implementation of cost reduction strategies and negative ones on fundamental changes in strategy and acquisition. These interpretations accord broadly with agency theory propositions but show that owner-managers place less emphasis on wealth incentive effects and more emphasis on the enabling and facilitating roles of collective ownership and the freedom it gives from inappropriate corporate control.

Recently, economists have directed attention to the phenomenon of organization. An important difference between the newly developed economic theories of organization, such as for example agency theory, and sociological theories of organization is the fact that economists explicitly employ an individual utility maximization assumption. In this paper, it is reasoned that this assumption, if used as in agency theory, entails logical inconsistencies if we try to explain the existence of the kind of agreements that purportedly form the basis of organiza tions. However, if the condition of uncertainty to which agency theorists merely pay lip service is taken seriously, the observed inconsistencies can be reconciled. A classificatory scheme of four 'sources of obligation' is proposed for the analysis of the basis of agreements. Taking all four sources into consideration in the analysis of organizational agreements can help to avoid one-sided attention to, for example, formal, legally enforceable agreements. The findings of empirical research suggest that two basic dimensions lie at the root of the proposed classifi catory scheme. Further research is needed to check this supposition and its implications.

Board of director involvement in restructuring reveals whether restructuring is brought on as an action by the board in its central oversight role or whether managers are purusing positive strategic action or correction. Therefore, based on an integration of organization economics (agency theory and market for corporate control) and strategic management theory (internal control and strategic leadership contingencies), this research examines board involvement in restructuring. Board involvement is hypothesized to be contingent on the governance mechanisms used by the board to monitor top management, control emphasis used by managers to process strategic information and board and managerial characteristics. The basic premise of the paper is that, due to their oversight role, board members (especially outside directors) become involved in restructuring only when managerial strategy implementation appears to be deficient. Top management team equity stakes are found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring, while outside director ownership is found to be positively related. Emphasis on strategic controls by managers was found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring. Top management team tenure and top management organizational tenure are negatively related to board involvement. Outsider representation on the board is positively related to board involvement in restructuring, while board tenure was found to be unrelated. Results imply that incentives to monitor (ownership) and emphasis on strategic controls reinforced by higher top management team tenure result in less board involvement in restructuring. However, restructuring may be initiated by outsiders on the board when other governance and control mechanisms fail. This implies a substitution process between governance tactics (ownership vs. board monitoring) and internal controls (managerial vigilance). Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper deals with the impact of debt on R&D intensity for firms undergoing a leveraged buyout (LBO). We develop seven hypotheses based on capital market imperfection theories and agency theory. To test these hypotheses, we compare 72 R&D performing LBOs with 3329 non-LBO control observations and 126 LBOs with little or no R&D expenditures. The regressions yield four statistically significant major findings. First, pre-LBO R&D intensity is roughly one-half of the overall manufacturing mean and two-thirds of the firm's industry mean. Second, LBOs cause R&D intensity to drop by 40 percent. Third, large firms tend to have smaller LBO-related declines in R&D intensity. Fourth, R&D intensive LBOs outperform both their non-LBO industry peers and other LBOs without R&D expenditures. Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper tests competing theoretical explanations for the passage of corporate charter antitakeover amendments. The managerial entrenchment hypothesis suggests that antitakeover amendments are adopted by incumbent management to obtain job security at stockholders' expense. An alternative hypothesis is that antitakeover amendments are proposed in order to enable the management of the target firm to extract a higher price from the bidding firm and thereby benefit stockholders. Our event study from a sample of 409 firms that adopted antitakeover amendments in the 1974-88 period indicates a strongly negative effect on stockholder wealth, in support of the managerial entrenchment hypothesis that antitakeover amendments are adopted by managers at the expense of stockholders.

This paper contributes to the literature on organizational form and performance (the performance-conduct paradigm) by examining the impact of two sets of variables that have not been examined previously: measures of environmental uncertainty and alternative forms of controlling separation of ownership from control. The paper first examines the extent to which contextual variables such as perceived environmental uncertainty and age of the organizational form moderate the relationship between organizational form and corporate performance. Next, the paper extends the analysis by examining the possible effects of ownership and control structures on performance. Measures suggested by agency theory, such as conventional ownership proxies (i.e. proportion of shares held by identifiable, homogenous groups), the proportion of non-executive board members and Fama and Jensen's concept of separation of decision management from decision control are used in the analysis. The results indicate that these measures have direct impact on corporate performance in their own right, though the main impact is indirect through interactions with organizational form variables.

This paper proposes a contract model of employment relations that integrates insights from economic and sociological perspectives on labor market transactions. The utility of the contract model is illustrated empirically using a large data set on organizations and their employees in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing industries. The results are consistent with many transaction cost and agency theory predictions, though they also indicate the need to supplement these economic theories with sociological explanations based on political, cultural, and other institutional differences.

Recent research and public discourse on executive compensation and corporate governance suggests a growing consensus that firms can and should increase their control over top managers by increasing the use of managerial incentives and monitoring by boards of directors. This study departs from this consensus by offering an alternative perspective that considers not only the benefits, but also the costs of both incentives and monitoring in large corporations. The study develops and tests a contingency cost/benefit perspective on governance decisions as resource allocation decisions, proposing how and why the observed levels of managerial incentives and monitoring may vary across organizations and across time. Specifically, the study suggests that: (1) firms that are more risky face greater costs when using incentive compensation contracts for top managers, thus reducing the expected level of incentive compensation use for such firms; (2) firms facing this problem of low incentive compensation use can realize greater benefits from higher levels of board monitoring, and thus are likely to rely more on board monitoring; and (3) firms with more complex comporate strategies face higher costs in using board monitoring, and are thus likely to rely less on board monitoring as a source of controlling top management behavior. The study also proposes that within this contingency perspective there may be diminishing 'behavioral returns' to increases in monitoring and incentives. These hypotheses are tested using extensive longitudinal data from over 400 of the largest U.S. corporations. The supportive findings suggest that maximal levels of incentives and monitoring are not necessarily optimal, and that a firm's strategy may not only have significant product/market implications, but also corporate governance implications.

This paper evaluates agency theory as a theory of performance outcome. Agency theory attributes uncertainty in performance outcomes to moral hazard, adverse selection and the state of nature. This paper argues that by overlooking two critical sources of outcome uncertainty in organizations -- incomplete knowledge about the effort-outcome relationship and lack of agreement about effort and outcome -- the generalizability of the theory is strictly limited. Even in such settings where it is generalizable, principal-agent approaches to contract design are unrealistic to the extent that they presume that performance in organizations results exclusively from individual-contributor jobs, exagger ate the degree to which individuals are work-averse, and emphasize the quant ity of effort at the expense of the quality and type of effort. As a theory of performance, principal-agent approaches overstate the importance of opera tional effort and ignore the importance of facilitative effort such as team work. (c) 1994, Sage Publications.

This article suggests that strategy research (and other management disciplines as well) should move beyond a neo-Hobbesian approach to contracting toward a new social contract approach. Work from an agency theory perspective in particular has generated utilitarian insights, but its description of agent behavior is too limited and its assumptions are not a useful guide to productive alliances among firms. Altruism, ethics, goodwill, moral sentiments, and trust need to be placed in the foreground of our vision, and society must be accepted as the ultimate principal to which both individuals and firms are responsible.

In this paper we argue that unobservable constructs lie at the core of a number of influential theories used in the strategic management literature--including agency theory, transaction cost theory, and the resource-based view of the firm. The debate over how best to deal with the problem of unobservables has raged in the philosophy of science literature for the best part of the current century. On the one hand, there are the positivists, who believe that theories containing unobservable constructs are only useful as tools for making predictions. According to positivists, such theories do not inform us about the deep structure of reality. On the other hand, there are the realists, who believe that our theories can give us knowledge about unobservables. Herein we review this debate, we argue for adopting a realist position, and we draw out the implications for strategic management research. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Critics have argued that the field of information systems (IS) lacks a coherent theoretical framework. This paper attempts to further the theoretical development of a critical and pervasive contemporary phenomenon, outsourcing of IS functions, by synthesizing four theoretical models (resource-based theory, resource-dependence theory, transaction cost theory and agency theory) that are useful for understanding determinants of a firm's outsourcing strategy. From these theoretical models, a contingency model of outsourcing is developed which can be used to direct empirical research. (c) 1995, Palgrave Publishing. All Rights Reserved.

This study tests the effects of ownership concentration, outside director equity holdings, and corporate strategy on, and the Performance implications of, the size and relatedness of units sold by parent firms. The study is based on a model that integrates agency and resource-based theories, and a sample of sell-offs by 112 Fortune 500 firms. Ownership concentration is found to be associated positively with the sale of unrelated and small units. This relationship is strengthened when outside director equity is high. In addition, the effects of corporate strategy types on the characteristics of units sold depend on ownership concentration and outside director equity. Finally, post'sell-off performance of the parent firm is associated negatively with the relatedness of the unit sold. These results suggest that the type of unit sold depends on the type of economic benefit sought by the parent firm. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper provides an empirical examination of the impact of the corporation tax and agency costs on firms' capital structure decisions. Our evidence suggests that the agency costs are the main determinants of corporate borrowing. Consistent with the agency theory, we find that firms that have fewer growth options have more debt in their capital structure. Moreover, our results show that debt mitigates the free cash flow problem and that firms that are more likely to be diversified and less prone to bankruptcy are highly geared. the negative effect of insider shareholding on leverage disappears, however; when all the agency mechanisms are accounted for. In addition, we find that, in the long run, companies that are tax exhausted exhibit significantly lower debt ratios than tax-paying firms. However, in the short run, firms' capital structure decisions are not affected by taxation. Copyright (c) 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

Quality management practitioners in the USA such as W. Edwards Deming, strongly advocate the Japanese model of supplier relationships-recommending substantial specific investment in a single supplier for improved co-ordination and higher quality. But the strategy literature and conventional wisdom favor multiple sourcing, suggesting that a high level of specific investment in a sole source will lead to problems with supplier performance. Using agency theory, we construct a model to evaluate the tradeoff between the costs to set up and coordinate with suppliers and the incentive for performance provided by competition. We find that the validity of Deming's Point Four, that sole sourcing is more profitable than competitive sourcing, depends on parameters such as profit sensitivity to supplier performance.

This paper proposes a "morphological grammar" intended to describe any type of contract between two economic agents. A contract is considered as a combination of coordination mechanisms that ensure the creation of a quasi-rent and its sharing between contractors. Three types of mechanism are distinguished: those that ensure the technical governance of transactions (compatibility of actions), those that guarantee the enforcement of promises, and those that operate the remuneration of participants. In addition only a few options are available to design each mechanism. Therefore any coordination process can be described through a limited collection of mechanisms that have a limited number of possible designs. Although the grammar proposed here is open to discussion, the methodology supported by the modular conception of contracts seems particularly powerful. At the empirical level it enables scholars to describe contracts precisely and to compare actual coordination mechanisms. At the theoretical level, it is a way to simplify the analysis of complex decisions (i.e. contract design) and of complex phenomena (i.e. the contracts' properties). The "grammar" is used for an applied study of the impact of Information and Communications Technologies on coordination processes among firms to illustrate its analytical potential.

Security of tenure is discussed in this paper by contrasting conventional and recent hybrid so-called flexible employment regimes. These regimes will be analyzed in a neoinstitutional perspective-that is, within transaction cost and agency theory frameworks, including public choice considerations. We start from the premise that in a standard employment scenario ex ante hostages may not be taken and that limited ex post compensation payments are efficient. We then trace features of safeguarding employee investment in hybrid flexible regimes such as new independent contracting, franchising (and other relevant variants of symbiotic contracting, capacity-oriented variable work time schemes, job sharing, and so on. We compare these new institutional creations in the labor market with standard regimes under the hypothesis that in an ideal scenario Pareto superior moves are feasible but that there is a systematic aberration from optimality caused by information asymmetries, search constraints (boundedness), and a lack of adaptive capacities of the regime users, particularly employees. This "regime deception factor (RDF) needs theoretical and empirical scrutiny from both legal and economic perspectives. (c) 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

The recent marketing literature reflects a growing interest in relationship management issues. In particular, several recent studies have drawn on transaction cost and agency theory to examine how interfirm relationships are organized. The general premise is that explicit control mechanisms must be deployed in a relationship to manage a partner's potential opportunism. Although previous research has shown that different mechanisms can be used, the tendency has been to examine individual mechanisms in isolation. The authors develop hypotheses about interdependencies between different control mechanisms. They also identify some of the contextual factors that influence their use. The framework is tested empirically by examining how chemical manufacturers organize their supplier relationships. The results generally support the hypothesis that firms' choices among control mechanisms are influenced by contextual factors. Only limited support is found for the hypothesis that interdependencies exist between different mechanisms.

In a recent 1993 paper in Organization Science, Hennart discussed the underlying logic, based on transaction cost and agency theory, for explaining the choice between firms and markets and the reason why most transactions have both firm-like and market-like properties. Relying on Williamson's comparative institutional approach, which studies economic organization from a transaction cost minimizing point of view under the assumption of opportunism, the argument was made that transaction cost (TC) logic provides a complete theory of the organization of economic activity. In this paper, I argue that, with its purely incentive-based logic governed by assumptions of opportunism, TC economics is fundamentally incapable of being a complete theory of economic organization. The notion of the firm as a bundle of transactions or contracts is an inadequate and shallow basis for a theory of the firm since it basically ignores the essential notion of the firm as a bundle of knowledge, and the underlying processes therein. My arguments are based on the organizational capability (OC) view of the firm, which provides a central role to bounded rationality and to organizational routines in the organization of economic activity. In the paper, I show how OC-based logic can provide an alternative (and complementary) explanation to TC theory for understanding boundary and governance decisions. TC reasoning does not realistically address issues pertinent to firms' capabilities, both as a source of competitive advantage and constraint, and has a static approach towards the benefits of a particular governance form. A more complete theory of economic organization needs to also address the more dynamic costs and benefits of an organizational form. The paper demonstrates how the OC perspective contributes towards a more balanced view. After arguing why TC does not provide a complete understanding of economic activity, and the contribution of organizational capabilities in this regard, organizational capability logic is applied to a transaction between two firms. Here, I examine in some detail the impact of a firm's resource/capability attributes on governance decisions, and the difficulties of contracting posed therein. In particular, I show how the transaction will not be effectuated, i.e., the market fails, but for reasons which have nothing to do with opportunism. The paper shifts the pivotal focus of governance decisions from the failure of markets due to the prevalence of opportunism to the failure (or success) of firms due to bounded rationality. Furthermore, it broadens the focus from minimizing the costs involved in the organization of an activity under a particular governance arrangement to also incorporate the managing of value inherent in a firm's knowledge base, in terms of both erosion and enhancement. These two interrelated concerns of firm failure and management of value are argued to be critical to a fuller understanding of firm behavior with respect to governance decisions. In general, it is argued that by replacing less restrictive assumptions in trying to understand economic organization and governance, that of bounded rationality alone, while simultaneously being able to explain the same economic phenomena as TC, and even some that TC explanations may face difficulty in fully explaining, the OC perspective has both greater and more realistic explanatory capacity.

This paper examines the influence of competitive strategy on the relationship between suppliers and their distribution networks. Drawing on agency theory, hypotheses are developed specifying the appropriate match between manufacturer strategies and systems of control within distribution channels. Cluster analysis is used to show distinct differences in channel management and structure for the three generic strategies of cost leadership, differentiation and focus. Results suggest that variation in control relationships may be explained by the demands posed by manufacturers' competitive strategies. This study therefore extends the applicability of Porter's typology to the specific structure of distribution channels and shows that agency theory can provide insights into the economic basis of interorganizational relationships.

The study of capital structure has increasingly gained importance in strategic management research. Paradigms derived from organizational economics have also gained popularity in explaining firm actions. Agency theory and transaction cost economics represent two such paradigms that rely on the notion of market imperfections. Notwithstanding the similarities between them, these two offer different explanations of the role of debt and equity in a firm. The governance abilities of the financing structures and the nature of assets of the firm provide two key sources of differences. Viewing capital structure from transaction cost economics gives rise to predictions that are contradictory to those presented by agency theory. It is argued that the extant evidence mainly supports the transaction cost viewpoint. Two organizational phenomena - leveraged buyouts and product diversification - are used to highlight the comparison.

Within many categories of consumer products, manufacturers differ markedly in how intensively they distribute their brands among retailers. The authors enhance understanding of why such differences in distribution intensity occur. Literature in the marketing and economics disciplines on brand and channel management, agency theory, and credible commitments, combined with extensive field interviews, provides the foundation for a conceptual framework that centers on proposed moderator effects. Data collected from manufacturers in the consumer electronics industry are used to test the conceptual framework. Credible commitments by retailers in the form of contractual agreements and investments are shown to moderate the relationships of manufacturer brand strategy and channel practices with distribution intensity.

For innovators and entrepreneurs in service businesses, franchising is frequently suggested as a way to succeed and grow. Academic research has provided little guidance for potential franchisors, however. This article provides a model to guide that choice of organizational form using results from agency theory. Analytically, franchising is a way to allocate decisions within the franchise system between the franchisor and the franchisee in order to promote efficiency and provide incentives. Franchisees make decisions regarding local operations, such as hours, prices, and locations, because they have the knowledge about local trading conditions. Franchisors make decisions regarding the product, its production, and associated marketing efforts that together create the standardization that the trademark signals. The revenue of franchise systems is divided to provide incentives to each party to support the allocation of decisions. Franchisors receive a percentage of gross sales, typically 5%, to compensate them for use of the trademark and associated services. Franchisees keep the unit's profits after paying royalties. These profits motivate the franchisee to make the good decisions that operate the unit efficiently. But franchising has limitations as well. First, by making franchisees invest in a unit in a specific geographic area, the franchise system exposes the franchisees to business risk; it consists of local economic conditions beyond franchisees' control that could reduce or eliminate their capital. That risk could be eliminated by owning a geographically diversified portfolio of shares of units in different places, but then incentives are weakened. Second, the requirements of standardization under the common trademark constrain franchisees from the full use of their human capital, including their knowledge of local conditions. Some adaptations to the local market are prohibited by the requirement of standardization. So high levels of either business risk or human capital in an industry make franchising a less desirable choice of organizational form. These ideas are tested with interindustry data using an econometric discrete choice model on the share of sales through franchise systems (termed organizational form share). The methodology is identical to market share models used in economics and marketing. Business risk, as measured by percent of units that have failed in the industry in the last 3 years, and human capital required in the industry, as measured by average wages paid, both negatively influence the share of sales through franchise systems. The model can be applied by entrepreneurs considering franchising, especially in industries not traditionally associated with franchising. Using public data sources identified in the study, a prospective franchisor can research the industry to determine if industry conditions support franchising as the optimal choice of organizational form. The empirical tests also suggest a second managerially relevant conclusion: the decision of "should we franchise?" can be and should be separated from the decision of "how do we implement franchising?" Factors previously shown to influence the implementation of franchising, the degree of ownership of units within the system, do not influence organizational form share, thus suggesting that the strategic decision of whether to franchise is distinct from the operating decision of how to implement franchising.

Using agency theory and the stakeholder fairness concept as the conceptual base, this study confirmed three agency theory hypotheses about differential relationships between four sets of pay procedures and evaluations of pay, supervision and the employing organization. Education and seniority related variables were also found to moderate the relationships between procedural justice perceptions and evaluations of supervision and the employing organization. The study used a stratified random sample of 612 occupationally heterogeneous employees of a large County government in South Eastern United States. Results suggest that agency theory provides a parsimonious explanation for why justice matters in compensation decision making.

Empirical studies of information systems planning practices in organizations indicate that wide variations exist. We propose and test a model based on agency theory and transaction-costs economics to account for these variations. As senior management's uncertainty with respect to the information systems function increases, we argue they will delegate more decision rights to the information systems manager. As a result of increased agency costs, senior management will demand more information systems planning to provide the basis for monitoring and bonding of the manager. In addition, because information systems plans may be used to resolve the distribution of gains and losses between senior management and the information systems manager in the event of unforeseen circumstances, both senior management and the information systems manager will seek to exercise control over the planning process and the form of the final plan. We argue that the relative specialization of human capital of senior management versus the information systems manager will dictate whose views dominate in the preparation of and form of the information systems plan. Our empirical results show moderate support for our model.

Most current writers on strategic control, whether from the rational planning or processual schools, agree on the importance of dialogue and debate between the interested parties to the control process. This is particularly so when strategic control is regarded in a 'warning bell' sense, responding to a signal that all is not going according to plan, rather than as a behavioural constraint or as an element of agency theory practice. This paper advances a normative framework for ensuring the effectiveness of such discussions based on Bird's notion of a 'good conversation'. Bird argued that the discussion of business ethical problems should be vocal, reciprocating, issues-oriented, rational, imaginative, and honest. It is argued here that these characteristics should also apply to the discussions within the strategic control process if the process is not to be dysfunctional.

This article, first, synthesizes three theoretical approaches to salesforce control systems and, second, examines the effect of the control mechanisms on key consequence variables. More specifically, the manuscript develops a comprehensive model of salesforce control by integrating key constructs from three alternative theories: organization theory, agency theory, and transaction cost analysis. The constructs are (1) outcome observability from organization theory, (2) behavior observability from agency theory, (3) transaction-specific assets (TSA) from transaction cost analysis, and (4) task programmability or environmental task uncertainty, a key construct in all three theories. In addition, the study examines the effects of controls on certain consequence variables: salesperson-customer relationships and salespersons' motivation and organizational commitment.

This paper contends that a major breakthrough has occurred in economics, that this breakthrough is related to the matching of economics and organization theory, and that this breakthrough is already remodeling our understanding of how economic systems work. Section I comes back to the problem of the existence of organizations and to its generalization through the concept of "governance" structures. Section II develops the explanation provided by transaction cost economics of the trade-off among these structures. Section III compares recent contributions of agency theory and of transaction cost economics to the analysis of the structuring mechanism of formal organizations. Section IV explores some properties of the government of organizations. Section V argues that what precedes may have major consequences on public policies and regulations.

In this paper we challenge the Public Choice-Agency Theory approach, which characterizes economic transactions as a series of discrete, unique events. We argue that the policy implications flowing from this view of the world are flawed, as they ignore the role of trust in contract formation and execution. Evidence is drawn from health, local authority, and water service sectors of the economy to illustrate the way in which the efficiency-enhancing properties of contract-based provision may be attenuated if trust is distorted by institutional change.

This article critically examines the key assumptions of the positive theory of political control. The authors argue that the key assumptions of the theory are flawed and that these flaws seriously limit the importance of much research in the field of regulatory studies. The authors develop a set of new assumptions which would reorient the regulatory studies and force researchers to give greater attention to the role of the bureaucracy in political-bureaucratic relations.

Innovation in complex engineering projects is hampered by information asymmetries which attend joint problem solving by owners and external organizations. This uncertainty creates additional informational asymmetries between owners and firms engaged in designing, building, and supplying projects. Industrial marketing suggests that overcoming these asymmetries is easier when owners are knowledgeable and part of the design process. We examine whether the same proposition holds for innovation in complex engineering projects. We focus on the relationship between innovativeness of complex engineering projects and internal owner capabilities. We test hypotheses derived from agency and organization theories of innovation. Our results indicate that projects where owners have internal capabilities are generally less innovative than projects where owners lack internal capabilities.

The late 1980s and the early 1990s have witnessed the emergence of new approaches -known in France and Europe as 'trade marketing' and in the US as 'partnering' - whose field of application and methods, along with the theoretical apparatus, need further examining. After analysing the origins of trade marketing in France and the current elaboration of this concept, this paper aims to describe the new methodological and theoretical research issues. Emphasis will be laid on the applicability of Porter's value chain and competitive advantage, Williamson's transactions costs, and the agency theory. This case study points out the key factors of success in the establishment of new types of relations between suppliers and retailers.

Recent thinking about top management has been influenced by alternative models of man.1 Economic approaches to governance such as agency theory tend to assume some form of homo-economicus, which depict subordinates as individualistic, opportunistic, and self-serving. Alternatively, sociological and psychological approaches to governance such as stewardship theory depict subordinates as collectivists, pro-organizational, and trustworthy. Through this research, we attempt to reconcile the differences between these assumptions by proposing a model based upon the subordinate's psychological attributes and the organization's situational characteristics.

Among the various stakeholders of a firm, senior managers are the most likely targets for private and public political pressures. Other stakeholder groups are less visible and may be perceived as less influential in corporate strategy formulation and implementation. In some situations, consequently, senior executives may adopt corporate strategies in response to political pressures even if these strategies may be costly to shareholders. In this study, a special case is examined: the effect of divestment of South African business units on firm value. Using data from 1984 through 1990, we examine the impact that announcements of divestments have upon the stock return behavior of publicly traded firms. Our results indicate that significant and negative excess returns accrue to shares of companies announcing divestments of South African operations. These results are supportive of the premise that noneconomic pressures may influence managerial strategies rather than value-enhancement goals.

In this article I examine those business exchanges in which firms hire professional service organizations and give them limited decisionmaking authority to perform knowledge-intensive tasks. I frame such exchanges within agency theory perspective and invoke the extant literature on professions to delineate several attributes that make principal-professional exchanges intrinsically distinct from others, such as owner-manager agency. In doing so, I question and complement some key assumptions in agency theory and also discuss explicitly how the study of principal-professional exchanges helps highlight important considerations not addressed in the mainstream theory. I then present an expanded framework that integrates agency theory and the literature on the professions and present several propositions to outline four types of restraints on potential opportunistic behavior of professional agents: (1) self-control, (2) community control, (3) bureaucratic control, and (4) client control. The article ends with theoretical and empirical implications.

Previous empirical studies of top managers tend to draw from either positive agency theory or strategic leadership theory. This manuscript reviews and critiques these two approaches, outlining their advantages and inherent limitations. Because each is inherently limited, we suggest that developments in personality theory, transformational leadership theory, and visionary leadership theory can contribute to a more realistic view of top managers. Consequently, we contrast these three alternative perspectives with the two more dominant approaches in this manuscript. As a result, we identify future research directions for scholars interested in studying strategic leadership. (c) 1997 JAI Press Inc. All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

This paper's empirical results indicate that the average effect of antitakeover provisions on subsequent long-term investment is negative. The interpretation of these results depends on whether one thinks that there was too much, too little, or just the right amount of long-term investment prior to the antitakeover provision adoption. We use agency theory to devise more refined empirical tests of the effects of antitakeover provision adoption by managers in firms with different incentive and monitoring structures. Governance variables (e.g. percentage of outsiders on corporate boards, and separate CEO/chairperson positions) have an insignificant impact on subsequent long-term investment behavior. However, consistent with agency theory predictions, managers in firms with better economic incentives (higher insider ownership) tend to cut subsequent long-term investment less than managers in firms with less incentive alignment. Furthermore, managers in firms with greater external monitoring (due to higher institutional ownership) also tend to cut subsequent long-term investment less than managers in firms with less external monitoring. Thus, the decrease in subsequent long-term investment is significantly less for firms where the managers have greater incentives to act in shareholders' interests. Finally, there are interesting effects of the control variables. First, high book equity/market equity firms cut total long-term investment more. Second, firms that were takeover targets or rumored to be takeover targets cut long-term investment more. These results suggest that inefficient firms cut long-term investment more when an antitakeover provision is adopted. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Sales employees generally do not share all of the performance information that they are privy to with their supervisors. This leads to information asymmetries that they can use for personal gain. This study examinee the antecedents and consequences of information asymmetry in a performance evaluation setting. A major feature of the study is the use of two theories--namely, agency theory and social exchange theory--for explaining the level of information asymmetry between salespeople and their supervisors. Empirical results indicate that social exchange theory is more useful in explaining the occurrence of information asymmetry. The study also examinee the dual role played by control systems in reducing asymmetry and promoting dysfunctional behaviors of salespeople. (c) 1997 PSE National Educational Foundation.

Firms exporting via foreign channel intermediaries, such as import agents or distributors, trade off a lack of control of the foreign channel for a low-risk market entry. Agency theory and transaction cost analysis suggest that a lack of control manifests itself in the foreign channel intermediary (FCI) having opportunities to behave in its own interests, rather than those of the exporter. Even so, management strategies that result in an alignment of the exporter's and FCI's goals are more likely to result in a perception of satisfaction in the relationship than if only one party's goals were met. Such management strategies should commence with an extensive precontractual screening step to find an intermediary whose goals are complementary to those of the exporter. After forming a trading relationship, an exporter can better coordinate the relationship by noncoercive monitoring of the exporter, and reduce the potential for opportunistic behavior and achieve a relationship that performs to the satisfaction to both parties. Greater monitoring is also likely to maintain a state of goal congruence between the parties. Conditions of environmental uncertainty may, however, create difficulties in precontractual screening by the exporter. A conceptual framework explaining the interaction between these variables has been presented, along with nine testable propositions and directions for future research.

Examination of financial economic stories told at a conference on hostile takeovers demonstrates the power of stories to frame thinking about issues and to compel and convince listeners. Assumptions of financial economic stories include ethical properties ascribed to market forces, primacy of shareholder wealth maximization, and presumption that managers are the enemy. When market efficiency and agency theory assumptions are questioned, financial economic stories fail to provide a convincing response to the concerns of economic justice. Ethical shortcomings of financial economic theory are relevant since financial economic theory underlies accounting practice and research. Accountants' ability to portray performance and value becomes critical if market prices do not adequately represent this information. If the social benefits of shareholder wealth maximization are questioned, accounting must be expanded to adequately meet the needs of stakeholders other than shareholders and accounting researchers must investigate the wealth distribution effects of financial reporting.

The American corporate sector saw major reform movements during the 1980s. Despite frequent admixture in practice, two key movements can be singled out as analytically distinct: financial restructuring (generally debt-financed, often involving mergers), and total quality management (a particular approach to productive restructuring). Unfortunately the precepts and practices of these movements often clashed. This paper examines these tensions and explores them by reference to economic theories of the firm associated with each movement. While financial restructuring has been interpreted through the lens of neoclassical agency theory, total quality management has strong links with alternative approaches that can be grouped under the heading 'capabilities theory'.

There has been a steady increase in the amount of research and theorising in the area of interorganisational research, especially with regard to buyer-seller arrangements in marketing channels (Andersen and Narus 1990, Bergen et.al., 1992, Boyle et.al., 1992). Alternative interorganisational governance models, such as joint ventures, strategic alliances, and sole-sourcing are the reality of modern business management (Borys and Jemison 1989, Buckley and Casson 1988), and so interfirm governance has become a strategic management issue. The much-cited work of Porter (1985, 1991) has focused on the optimal linkage of interfirm activities, and regards the planning and governance of interfirm relations as an important competitive strategic issue, a point reiterated by Heide (1994). The issue of channel relationships has been one of concern for both practitioners and academics, and theories such as those of transaction cost analysis (TCA), agency theory, and relational norms have on the one hand shed much light on the problems, and on the other provided a fruitful backdrop to much empirical research. Less attention has been given to the effects of time on these notions, both in the literature and in empirical research. In this article we provide an overview of the theories, and attempt an integration. The purpose of this article is to focus on transaction cost economics (TCE) and relational exchange theory to provide an overview of the areas of interorganisational research where relationships play a role. A number of areas where the theories diverge and converge are outlined. More importantly, we endeavour to bring the effects of time into consideration, and to develop propositions for further research. (c) 1997, MCB UP Limited

Cooperative organizational forms such as franchising and joint venturing have long been popularamong hospitality chains. However, not all chains use cooperative organizational forms and those that do varygreatlyin theirproclivityto use them. One possible explanation for this variation is that when a chain confronts critical resource scarcities, its managers will use cooperative organization in order to build upon the resources of their partners. However a second approach, agency theory, suggests that chain managers use cooperative organization to minimize the costs of monitor ing outlet managers. Using data on 94 restaurant chains, hypotheses are tested that investigate the independent and joint efficacy of these explanations. Results show that capital and brand name are important resources affecting the choice of organizational form whereas geographic dispersion, task programmability, and asset specificity are key agency variables. Overall, perhaps the key finding is that the ability of agency theory to explain organizational form is diminished among resource scarce chains. The results, therefore, suggest that both perspectives are needed to fully explain the choice of organizational form. (c) 1997 THE COUNCIL ON HOTEL, RESTAURANT AND INSTITUTIONAL EDUCATION.

The agency framework is a general formulation of a stylized relationship between two parties, the principal and the agent, where the principal wants the agent to supply a productive input. However, due to information asymmetries, the relationship is not frictionless. In the case of investments, the agent may use the information asymmetries to produce investment myopia in an attempt to boost the agent'smarket value or otherwise to further his/her own interests. Throughout the literature review, a simplified model is used to capture the information asymmetry leading to bias. Critical drivers, as well as main and ancillary results, are tabulated and discussed. Suggestions of testable hypotheses and managerial implications are provided. As a general conclusion, the theoretical case of investment bias within the agency framework appears to have reached a state of maturity, spanning a number of issues and possible real-world situations. Thus, it seems more and more timely to develop an integrated and general formulation of the problem at hand, a formulation that captures the fundamental economic properties in a stable and convincing fashion, rather than to pursue further variations of assumptions which, in the models, sometimes are of a partial and ad hoc nature. To that end, four possible fundamental investment bias drivers have been suggested: 1. Several input factors that are unobservable to the principal, through 'signal jamming', create a potential for investment bias. 2. Limited possibilities of risk spreading of human capital, together with managerial risk-aversion, affect investment bias. The information asymmetries of the investment models are primarily grouped into hidden action and private information. 3. Chain effects of exogenous frictions in capital markets may induce investment bias. 4. Non-verifiabilities of critical information pose problems of incentive and bias, particularly with innovative output. At a greater level of generality, the investment bias problem revolves around the well-known market failure problems: imperfect and incomplete markets. However, it can be shown that the very foundation of received capital budgeting theory since Fisher (1930) o the Separation Theorem o rests precisely on the assumption of perfect and complete markets. The Separation Theorem in turn provides the theoretical foundation of the received managerial implication: use the discounted cash flow method. Since the agency theory offers an intra-theoretical rationale for questioning the validity of the Separation Theorem, agency theory promises new perspectives on a dominant finding in empirical studies on the administrative use of capital budgeting methods o namely, the limited role of the methods for reaching administrative decisions. Traditionally, this finding has been related to weaker forms of economic rationality (e.g. bounded rationality) and the impact of uncertainty. However, with agency theory there is no need to shift theoretical focus and the finding can instead be related to the impact of information asymmetries. Thus, there is a potential scope for agency theory in both empirical and managerial settings. This potential can hardly be realized by trying to apply specific models to administrative problems, but rather by using the theory as a general framework in which economic trade-offs and information asymmetries in organizational structures and processes are illuminated. Developing the framework into an analytical and useful tool formanagement seems a fruitful research objective, since the positive nature of economics in general suggests a practical role for the agency framework also in this field o the economics of management, and the economics of investment management in particular.(c)Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997.

The best opportunity for growth is often overseas, even for smaller entrepreneurial firms. However, resource-constrained smaller firms do not have as many available entry strategies as larger multinational corporations (MNCs). Smaller firms frequently must ally themselves with partners in order to make international expansion feasible (i.e., employing an export agent, licensing, joint venture, or strategic alliance). The alliance of two distinct parties central to these entry strategies lends itself to an agency theory perspective. Agency theory illuminates the underpinnings of these relationships, in particular highlighting the problems and risks that the entrepreneur faces when entering into the partnership. These problems arise from information asymmetry (each party is privy to knowledge that the other isn't). This article develops these problems within the entrepreneur/ export agent realm and suggests that government assistance can reduce these problems. Specifically, government assistance reduces verification and monitoring costs. The article proposes that those firms that take advantage of governmental information and assistance will more likely enter foreign countries successfully. (c) 1997 Taylor & Francis.

Total quality management (TQM) has received considerable attention as a way to increase both the effectiveness and the efficiency of corporations (Bounds et. al., 1994; Grant, Shani and Krisnan 1994; Olian and Rynes 1991; Powell 1995; Ross 1993). Concerned primarily with the delivery of customer satisfaction, the proponents of quality and/or TQM (Deming 1986; Juran 1992; and Crosby 1979) have developed principles and procedures for achieving total quality and meeting multiple corporate goals. Empirical evidence regarding outcomes is mixed; success and failure case studies abound, statistical methodologies are questioned, and more rigorous empirical studies present some positive findings (Powell 1995). Some maintain that the reasons for the failure of TQM systems is incompatibility between existing Western management thought which is grounded in economic models, and the TQM paradigm, which evolved from statistical theory, and has its own set of assumptions (Grant, Shani and Krisnan 1994). Despite such mixed empirical results, TQM continues to be promoted and implemented. This is the beginning point for our examination of TQM. The TQ management paradigm is practiced in economically and culturally diverse environments, including those which embrace an economic perspective, complete with maximisation of shareholder wealth, self-interest, rational decision makers, separation of ownership, and agency costs (Grant, Shani and Krishnan 1994).

This paper examines the link between a firm's resources and its efficient organization form with a focus on entrepreneurial resources. Entrepreneurial resources are defined as the propensity of an individual to behave creatively, act with foresight, use intuition, and be alert to new opportunities. This paper assumes that these entrepreneurial resources can be distributed in two ways throughout the firm: they can be held by one or a few individuals-"individual entrepreneurial resources" - or they can be dispersed among a team of individuals - "team entrepreneurial resources." Agency theory is used to consider how various organizational characteristics - such as the assignment of decision responsibilities, incentives and risk bearing, the number of hierarchical levels, horizontal linking structures, mutual monitoring and bonding devices, and information systems - will differ in the individual and team entrepreneurial forms. Generally, the individual entrepreneurial form resembles the "classic entrepreneurial firm" (Fama and Jensen 1983) in which various decision making roles and risk bearing are performed by a single entrepreneur. The team entrepreneurial form is similar to what Bartlett and Ghoshal (1993) call "beyond the m-form." Responsibility for steps in the decision process is dispersed in the team form, and monitoring the decision process will occur at the organization's apex. The CEO will not make operational or strategic decisions; instead, he manages the internal market for managers and develops an organization's cultural context and information systems. Below the CEO level, team entrepreneurs are responsible for ratifying innovative decisions, and below this team entrepreneurs are responsible for initiating innovative decisions. After presenting these two entrepreneurial forms, this paper relates them to extant research on corporate entrepreneurship and organizational forms.

Because Islamic banks are prohibited from entering into transactions based on riba (interest), they mobilise funds mainly on the basis of the mudaraba (profit-sharing) form of contract. Thus, in the place of interest-bearing customer deposits, Islamic banks offer investment accounts the return on which depends on the return on the pool of assets in which the customers' funds are invested by the bank. In contrast to conventional deposits, such investment accounts therefore yield a variable periodic return which may be negative (a loss). Islamic investment accounts are thus a form of limited-duration equity investment.This type of investment account raises a set of issues concerning the contractual relations between the bank and the holders of such investment accounts. These issues may be addressed from the perspectives of both Agency Theory (principal-agent and principal-principal relations) and Transaction Cost Economics (contractual forms and governance structures), and it is the purpose of this paper to do so. In particular, we focus on governance issues such as the monitoring possibilities which may or may not be contractually available to investment account holders. We conclude that, under present contractual arrangements, investment account holders depend unduly upon 'vicarious' monitoring by or on behalf of shareholders, a situation aggravated by current shortcomings in financial reporting and limitations of the scope of external auditing. The latter have implications for accounting regulation as applied to Islamic banks. The paper concludes with some suggestions as to how this situation could be ameliorated.

Agency theorists argue that organizations typically get little value from using employees and that they should instead use nonemployees operating fully as residual claimants. Yet, even in a context where those theorists would predict virtually no employees - taxicab organizations - they are common. What drives the use of employment relationships in these organizations? The authors show how employment relationships are linked to firm capabilities and strategic opportunities in a sample of taxicab organizations, relying on arguments about the linkage of employment to the internal liquidity of labor, organizational routines, and internal cooperation. The theoretical arguments and findings suggest what organizations gain by having employment relationships and show that integrating the agency theoretic argument with the other theoretical arguments leads toward a resource-based view of strategy and human resources. The authors highlight the importance of embedding arguments on the internal management of human resources in the strategic and competitive context in which organizations operate. Their arguments also have implications for the resource-based approach to strategy in mapping the resource space of human assets in organizations and, within that space, directing attention to how organizations gain sustainable competitive advantage through managing human resources.

Furthermore, alternative strategies that achieve moderate levels of behavior control yield similar performance outcomes. (c) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The development of the field of strategic management within the last two decades has been dramatic. While its roots have been in a more applied area, often referred to as business policy, the current field of strategic management is strongly theory based, with substantial empirical research, and is eclectic in nature. This review of the development of the field and its current position examines the field's early development and the primary theoretical and methodological bases through its history. Early developments include Chandler's (1962) Strategy and Structure and Ansoff's (1965) Corporate Strategy. These early works took on a contingency perspective (fit between strategy and structure) and a resource-based framework emphasizing internal strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps, one of the more significant contributions to the development of strategic management came from industrial organization (IO) economics, specifically the work of Michael Porter. The structure-conduct-performance framework and the notion of strategic groups, as well as providing a foundation for research on competitive dynamics, are flourishing currently. The IO paradigm also brought econometric tools to the research on strategic management. Building on the IO economics framework, the organizational economics perspective contributed transaction costs economics and agency theory to strategic management. More recent theoretical contributions focus on the resource-based view of the firm. While it has its roots in Edith Penrose's work in the late 1950s, the resource-based view was largely introduced to the field of strategic management in the 1980s and became a dominant framework in the 1990s. Based on the resource-based view or developing concurrently were research on strategic leadership, strategic decision theory (process research) and knowledge-based view of the firm. The research methodologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated and now frequently combine both quantitative and qualitative approaches and unique and new statistical tools. Finally, this review examines the future directions, both in terms of theory and methodologies, as the study of strategic management evolves. (c) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

We offer a rationale for a link between capital scarcity and franchising. Predictions respectively based on agency theory and the capital scarcity hypothesis were tested among 91 restaurant chains. Our specific focus was on whether or not variables based on capital scarcity could explain variance in firms' franchising decisions beyond what was explained by agency variables. The latter were significant predictors of franchising, and the capital scarcity variables explained additional variance, indicating that capital is among the resources related to franchising.

The author summarizes 11 hypotheses from agency theory, transaction cost analysis, and Ouchi's theoretical approach about the impact of environmental, company, and salesperson characteristics on the design of sales force control systems (outcome- versus behavior-based) and tests them on a data set of 270 German sales organizations. Many of the hypotheses receive empirical support. Sales force size, the only construct for which the author derives two opposing hypotheses, is related negatively to the use of behavior-based control in sales forces. Thus, the hypothesis derived from Ouchi's approach is supported, whereas the contradictory hypothesis from transaction cost analysis is rejected.

An enduring challenge for franchise management involves the reconciliation of (1) the franchisor's desire for standardization, consistency, and control for the preservation of its goodwill and brand equity, and (2) the franchisee's quest for autonomy, especially because franchises are frequently sold on the platform of be your own boss and have historically attracted would-be franchisees with self-employment histories and strong streaks of independence and autonomy. Building on arguments derived from agency theory, resource dependence theory, the locus of control argument, and the countervailing power premise, the present study attempts to evaluate (1) the interrelationships between the concepts of autonomy and dependence, and (2) the influence of competition, success, experience, and multi-unit ownership as determinants of the various autonomy-dependence perceptions. It is suggested that, contrary to the dominant perspective nested in the markets versus hierarchy dichotomy, which portrays the sentiments of dependence and autonomy as opposing theoretical variables (i.e., they are envisioned to exist only in high-low combinations of these two constructs), even their high-high and low-low combinations can emerge within a franchise setting, and that these diverse behavioral settings entail unique management challenges. The empirical portion of the study utilizes data drawn from the franchised channel of fastfood restaurants. The results support the emergence of all four combinations of dependence and autonomy (i.e., the traditional high-low combinations as well as the high-high and low-low combinations), suggestingthat behavioral settings of franchises are indeed richer than hitherto imagined. It appears that because franchisee-franchisor relationships encompass several domains, they each feel dependent on the other party in certain domains, and simultaneously, autonomous in other domains. The environmental factor of competition, the relationship factor of business success experienced in the franchise system, and the structural factor of multi-unit ownership emerged as significant predictors of dependence and autonomy. Notably, however, the countervailing power argument was not supported by the data. The multi-unit ownership effects were especially strong and provided a more direct test of the alignment of goals and incentives envisioned by agency theory. We conclude by identifying four categories of franchisees with distinct gestalts that franchisors would do well to learn to manage in the spirit of portfolio management.

Agency theory suggests that an efficient contract between a franchisor (principal) and a franchisee (agent) could be established by the use of selection criteria that would screen prospective franchisees based on their likely future outcomes desired by their franchisors. Franchisors can use franchisee selection criteria as a key input control to enhance the outcomes of their future franchisees. This article examines the relationship between key franchisee selection criteria such as franchisees' financial capability, experience and management skills, demographic characteristics, attitude toward business dimensions (perceived innovativeness, desire for personal development, seek work-related challenges, personal commitment to the business, and business risk-taking), and key measures of outcomes desired by franchisors (perceived cooperation, satisfaction with the business decision, and franchisee opportunism). The findings show that certain franchisee attitudes toward business can be used as an effective input control strategy by franchisors because they explain a substantial portion of the variance in franchisees' outcome desired by franchisors.

Research on the internationalization of retailing has focused on descriptive and empirical studies centring on issues such as motivations for retail internationalization and individual company experiences of the internationalization process. One particular aspect of the retail internationalization process that has remained relatively underresearched, and consequently under theorized, is market entry mode strategy. Furthermore, with a few notable exceptions, potentially interesting research from the economics of international production and corporate finance literatures has been virtually ignored in the international retailing domain. This paper represents an initial step in rectifying these deficiencies by exploring some of the issues associated with the economics-based internalization and agency theories, in the context of international retailers' market entry mode strategy. By combining market transaction costs (associated with internalization theory), together with information and monitoring costs (associated with agency theory), and thus highlighting the interlinking issue of information asymmetry, a more coherent basis is established for analysing international retailers' entry mode choice decision.

Examines the behavioural implications of the three main micro-economic explanations - resource constraint, agency theory and search cost theory - for franchising. Reviews these theories, along with the empirical evidence found to support them. Highlights the implications of each explanation upon relational quality using four relational characteristics drawn from Macneil. Uses the characteristics of power balance, anticipation of trouble, sense of unity and presentation of costs and benefits. Argues that since the motivation to franchise depends upon the specific strategy employed by the franchisor, then relational quality will legitimately differ according to franchisor strategy. Describes a model drawn by linking strategic direction, franchise motivation and relational quality. Some illustrative propositions are derived from the model. Discusses the implications of the theory for both researchers and managers. (c) 1999, MCB UP Limited.

A key element of integrated marketing communications (IMC) which has been relatively ignored is that of the organizational integration between agency and client. This paper suggests that such organizational integration is key to effective IMC and through the joint consideration of agency and interorganizational theories explores its possible underpinnings and dynamics. Based on their competing and yet complementary explanations of the agency-client relationship, propositions are offered and implications for management and research are drawn.

A substantial body of research employs agency theory and transaction costs analysis to explain ownership decisions in distribution channels. Agency theory identifies factors that prompt firms to favor behavior-based contracting over outcome-based agreements. Transaction cost economics is a complementary framework which maintains that the organizational form in a location should be the one that economizes on production and transaction costs. Prior research illustrates that independent variables (e.g. proximity to highways, dedicated assets) outlined in these theories provide a partial explanation for ownership decisions. Nevertheless, scant research has analyzed whether factors outlined in agency theory and transaction cost analysis are employed by executives when making ownership decisions. The purpose of this study is to investigate managerial rationales underlying plural contractual networks. (c) 1999, MCB UP Limited.

Industrial foundations are self-governing, non-profit institutions that own business companies. This ownership structure is found in a fair number of Northern European companies, some of them successful world-class competitors. Standard agency theory would predict foundation-owned companies to be relatively inefficient since they lack monitoring by residual claimants and access to equity finance from the stock market. Nevertheless, empirical research (Thomsen 1996) has found that Danish foundation-owned companies do no worse in terms of profitability and growth than companies with dispersed ownership or family ownership. The paper considers and tests alternative explanations of this paradox. Explanations based on tax incentives, alternative control mechanisms and product-market advantages are rejected, but some support is found for performance advantages related to family control and long-term business commitment.

Finance, ownership and control issues have received a great deal of attention in recent years as centres of interest in the 'new institutional economics'. Much of the debate has been fuelled by the inability of neoclassical economics to explain the continued existence, and increasing importance, of small enterprises. Developments in agency theory, information asymmetry and signalling theory, and transaction cost economics are identified as contributing to a new approach. The concepts distilled from a review of these developments are then used in the analyses of well-known phenomena involving small enterprises. These include capital structure and access to capital markets featuring the finance gap, the underpricing of new issues and the small firm effect. In addition, going private, by means of management buy-outs, and franchising are examined. It is seen that the economic literature on finance, ownership and control helps to explain both the advantages and disadvantages of small enterprises. Their continued existence is seen as being due to a trade-off of various costs and benefits.

In this paper, we examine agency theory's presumptions of self-interest, opportunistic behavior, and the notion of the "economic man" (or woman). We contend that the application of agency theory's presumptions to the firm may imply high costs, competitive disadvantage, and high firm risk. We suggest that agency theory's presumptions may not contribute to the interests of the principal, agent, or other stakeholders. Alternatively, we discuss socioeconomic theories' presumptions of enlightened self-interest, trustworthy behavior, and the possibility of the noneconomic person. We argue that the extension of socioeconomic theories to the firm may imply low costs, competitive advantage, and low firm risk. We contend that the socioeconomic presumptions may contribute to the interests of various stakeholders. (c) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

The ineffectiveness of several privatized firms within emerging economies underscores the importance of agency theory issues and their impact on the privatization-performance relationship. We argue that weak governance and limited protection of minority shareholders intensify traditional principal-agent problems (perquisite consumption and entrenchment) and create unique agency problems (expropriation). We suggest that postprivatization performance can be enhanced by using appropriate ownership, management, and corporate structures that mitigate agency problems in the context of weak governance, and we highlight avenues for research.

The incentive intensity of rewards (the individual marginal gains in pay triggered by increased performance) has been linked to higher effort and the attraction of talent. Determinants of incentive intensity for individual rewards have been widely examined, but determinants of incentive intensity for group rewards remain unexplored. We used agency theory to test such determinants in 663 group-based pay plans. Incentive intensity was higher when groups were small, when plans did not need to measure quality, and when management participation was high. Plans embedded in small firms and plans with longevity had higher incentive intensity.

Competitive predictions regarding the relationships between: (a) monitoring and agent tenure, and (b) performance-contingent compensation are derived from agency theory and collaborative perspectives. These results are tested in a within-industry (trucking) sample and in a cross-industry sample. The results partially support both perspectives, particularly with respect to monitoring and agent tenure. Implications of the results for theory and practice are discussed.

There is a large body of research dealing with top management compensation from an agency theory perspective. Difficulties in monitoring top management (the agent) are exacerbated in the multinational corporation, where there are significant information asymmetries between headquarters and foreign subsidiaries. Headquarters may use variable pay for subsidiary top managers to reduce the agency problems. By studying 110 foreign-owned subsidiaries located in Finland, this paper attempts to identify determinants of variable pay to the subsidiary general manager. In line with agency theory, the results suggest that the roles played by the subsidiary influence the compensation strategy used for the subsidiary general manager. However, while agency theory predicts that the cultural distance beween the home country of the multinational corporation and the location of the foreign subsidiary would have an effect on the compensation system, no such effect was found. Instead, in accordance with the institutionalization perspective, we found a significant 'nationality effect' on the use of variable pay.

The relationship between exporters and independent foreign channel intermediaries (FCIs) is complex. The present paper analyses and discusses the potential types of opportunistic behaviour that might be engaged in by foreign agents or distributors (FCIs) using an agency theory approach. A classification framework of opportunistic behaviour is developed and a detailed qualitative examination of the content of five agencydistributor agreements between Australian exporters and their FCIs. A five-category classification scheme for opportunistic behaviour was found that included (1) product, (2) price, (3) information, (4) logistical, and (5) legal opportunism. The implications of each type of opportunism for an exporter are discussed using examples obtained from ways to control opportunistic behaviour are discussed.

The purpose of this paper is to draw together the many different facets of corporate governance that have been examined in the extensive literature in both strategic management and finance. In particular, we are interested in the relationship between the typical agency theory constructs of monitoring, incentives and ownership structure, with financial performance. First, we catalog this large body of work to see where there are still unanswered questions. We find that previous work has generally focused on examining subsets of governance mechanisms, typically studying one or two governance variables in any one study. Our view is that the most critical issue still to examine, is the ability of firms to choose among a number of different governance mechanisms in order to create the appropriate structure for that firm, given the environment in which it operates. We identify a sample of firms and examine CEO compensation, CEO tenure, board composition, leadership structure and ownership structure and their contribution to both market performance, Market Value Added, and risk-adjusted accounting performance, Economic Value Added. In addition, we control for ownership by blockholders, industry performance, and firm size. We examine these measures both individually and as interactions. Our results indicate that while some of the traditional agency variables do impact performance, both individually and as interactions, industry performance is a strong and significant driver of performance for our sample of firms. We conclude that, while there is evidence to support that firms may use governance packages to deal with agency issues, further research could provide important evidence on these issues by focusing on examining a more refined, industry-level context.

This paper analyzes the link between economics and the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm. Although, historically there has been a strong link between the disciplines of strategy and economics, explicit citations of key RBV works has been disappointingly low in mainstream economics journals. However, there are substantial bodies of works that build implicitly on the ideas of the RBV, in particular the consequences of path dependency on firm behavior, to explain a number of different economic issues. The issues we review in the paper are all influenced by path dependency and include: (1) diversification and market entry, (2) corporate refocusing, and market exit, (3) explaining innovative activity among firms, (4) diversification and performance and (5) industry evolution with rapidly changing products. Furthermore, we identify a number of reasons that may have limited the explicit use of the RBV in economics, which include the problems of causal ambiguity, tautology and firm heterogeneity. Finally, potential areas for future research are identified, which include the interaction of the RBV and Agency Theory, the RBV as a dynamic theory, using the RBV to explain radical change and the application of the RBV to issues of antitrust.

This paper is a first step towards a positive theory of nonmajoritarian institutions. Delegation of powers to such institutions is best understood as a means of reducing certain political transaction costs. The precise nature of the relation between political sovereign and independent delegate has not been carefully investigated. Both economists and political scientists tend to rely on the available results of principal-agent theory. This paper shows why this approach is not entirely satisfactory. While the key problems of agency theory - hidden action and hidden information - are present in any relation based on specialisation and the division of labour, they are not central to the context investigated here. Instead, I argue that the fiduciary principle should be recognised as the central element in the governance structure of nonmajoritarian institutions.

This article develops a dynamic model of a firm in which diversification can be a value-maximizing strategy even if specialization is generally efficient. The central idea is that firms are composed of organizational capabilities that can be profitable in multiple businesses and that diversification is a search process by which firms seek businesses that are good matches for their capabilities. The theory can account for diversified firms trading at discounts compared to single-segment firms, as well as some empirical regularities that are challenging to the agency theory of diversification, such as positive returns to diversification announcements.

The corporatization reform in Chinese SOEs has been largely influenced by the Anglo-American corporate governance model, but at issues is whether or not this model suits China's current institutional and cultural contexts. Agency theory and stewardship theory are two corporate governance theories that provide conflicting assumptions about human behavior and different prescriptions about governance mechanisms. In this study we drew upon both theories and developed competing hypotheses about the relationships between board composition, leadership structure, and organizational performance in Chinese shareholding companies. We gave special attention to China's unique institutional context and its influence on board attributes. The hypotheses were tested with a sample of Chinese listed companies. Overall, the stewardship hypotheses received stronger empirical support. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

In this paper, we discuss agency theory in the context of the individual principal and agent, and also in the context of the organization and its groups. Agency theory is examined in the context of goal orientation, obligation and reciprocity, risk, and self-interest. We offer propositions given agency theory's assumptions. We also extend agency theory and offer alternative propositions based on a relaxing of agency theory's assumptions. In relaxing the assumptions of agency theory, insights from outside the agency literature, specifically from behavioral theories are used. Implications of agency theory and the extension of this theory are also discussed in relation to outcomes associated with economic exchanges. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

This paper focuses on the question of how relational rents can be created in the venture capitalist-entrepreneur dyad. It identifies how theoretical frameworks, such as agency theory and procedural justice theory, have been used to describe the relationship between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Further, it shows how other research streams, such as organizational learning theory and social exchange theory, may be integrated with research on venture capital financing. The central thesis of the paper is that relational rents can be created in venture capitalist-entrepreneur dyads through relation-specific investments and knowledgesharing routines, based on an effective governance of the relationship between both parties.

We challenge the implicit assumption that entrepreneurs are the sole owners of their young firms and we suggest that because cutting-edge innovation projects are complex, they create substantial information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and their investors. Linking previous research on governance, entrepreneurship, and innovation, we ask what forms of governance and incentive systems are conducive to spur and implement innovation among young entrepreneurial firms. Using agency theory and building on the rich literature on governance, we make eight practical suggestions regarding the governance of young entrepreneurial firms. We suggest that early and effective governance systems may help entrepreneurs and investors work in alignment with each other's best interests. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study it is argued that positive agency theory is a relevant theoretical perspective in studies of the balanced scorecard in business management because agency theory addresses implementation and organizational control issues. If the balanced scorecard is to be applied also in public management, then positive agency theory should be complemented with political economy to incorporate possible implementation and organizational control issues related to political uncertainty, common agency and implementation ambiguity. It is argued that uncritical application of the balanced scorecard in public management could result in dysfunctions common in Soviet-type, central planning. However, such dysfunctions could be reduced with certain modifications of the balanced scorecard in order to facilitate political competition to a relatively larger extent. (c) 2001, MCB UP Limited

Adapting well-established organization theories to international joint ventures (IJVs), this paper develops an overarching theoretical model of the determinants and effects of parent control of IJVs from an interpartner bargaining power perspective. Drawing upon power dependence, transaction costs, and agency theories, we argue that the relative bargaining power between IJV partners serves as the key determinant of control structure, and that control exerts a direct effect on the venture's performance. In addition, government influence and interpartner working relationship are critical factors that complicate the linkage between control and performance but may help to explain past conflicting results. Propositions regarding these relationships are formed for future empirical test, and implications and directions for future research are provided. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The paper gives an overview of major scientific approaches to inter-enterprise relationships. A distinction is made between approaches that focus on business process integration (Supply Chain Management, Costing approaches), approaches that focus on organizational collaboration (Transaction Cost Theory. Agency Theory), and approaches that focus on the business environment (Strategic Management, Network Theory, Resource Dependency Theory). Although these approaches are different with regard to their perspectives on collaboration, variables and methods, the paper shows that they are complementary tools in the analysis and design of inter-enterprise relationships.

Four theories (institutional theory [IT], resource-based theory, game theory, and agency theory) are examined and propositions formulated as to how each theory helps explain the existence of intellectual cooperation and knowledge sharing within high-tech firms. The paper examines the usefulness of existing theory and suggests new research propositions, constructs, and methods to focus on building an empirical approach towards organizational research in the high-tech arena.

This study is an extension of research which links top management team characteristics and the use of a variety of business strategies. Agency theory and information processing theory provided the framework used to investigate the complex business strategies of 219 Japanese firms in four sectors. Statistical results support our view that top team characteristics reflect important aspects of the corporate governance strategies needed to manage business strategies such as specialization, diversification and internationalization. Although there are substantial institutional differences in the business environments, it appears that there is increasing convergence in the Japanese and American approaches to corporate governance.

Relying on neo-classical economics, agency theory, transaction cost economics and institutional approaches to organization, writers on the chaebol tried to highlight or elide certain organizational variables in their expositions of the growth and change of the chaebol organization. In this contribution, theoretical problems are discussed in these perspectives in explaining the chaebol, by focusing on four organizational variables: ownership and control structures, state regulation structures, inter-firm relations and technological uncertainties. These four organizational variables, despite their strengths, are found to miss some important points that are pertinent to understanding the rise of, and the current reform actions taken by, the chaebol.

Asymmetric information and asymmetric dependency form the bases of two explanations for suboptimal performance in organized economies: managerial control loss and rent seeking. Both posit a loss of collective efficiency, but they differ in their assessment of the source of that loss in efficiency, information costs, or the possibility for arbitrary exercise of power. Both agents and principals have resources at their disposal, but the capacity of agents to engage in collective action (point 4) may have an important role in determining the distribution of benefits. Although usually discussed in dyadic terms, asymmetric information and asymmetric dependency, as explored in agency theory, imply networks of information and exchange with mutually inconsistent structures. Therefore, the problems of transitional economies can be understood by observing the formal and informal linkages among bureaucratic officials and enterprise managers. Moreover, interventions in the structure of those networks of linkages may be able to address the performance problems of postsocialist economies more effectively than macroeconomic adjustments and broad-based legal reform. This article's aims are, first, to bring the literatures on control loss and rent seeking together and to relate both to a wider literature on social networks and social institutions; second, to outline a methodology showing how the structure of social networks aids in the gathering of benefit and, therefore, how it can be used in the measurement of relative power; and, third, to document the networks of exchange among nearly 60 ministry officials and enterprise managers in heavy and light industry in one postsocialist economy, Vietnam, where state enterprise ownership persists. Specifically, we examine the nature of the relationships between (1) ministry officials and enterprise directors, (2) ministry officials and their coworkers, and (3) the managers of different enterprises. Because each of the two mechanisms of inefficiency rests on distinct social network patterns, we are able to assess the salience of each explanation. The nature of these relationships is important for understanding the past performance of the state sector in the economy of Vietnam and is key to understanding how to successfully restructure economies worldwide.

There has been growing recognition in recent years of the importance of corporate governance in ensuring sound financial reporting and deterring fraud. The audit serves as a monitoring device and is thus part of the corporate governance mosaic. The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of various corporate governance factors, such as the board of directors and the audit committee, on the audit process. Importantly, there is little professional guidance on how auditors should consider such factors when formulating an appropriate audit strategy, and there has been only one prior study on this issue (Cohen and Hanno 2000). Because there are no current specific auditing standards that relate to the effect of corporate governance on the audit process, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 36 auditors on current audit practices in considering corporate governance in the audit process. Reflecting on client experiences, auditors indicate a range of views with regard to the elements included in the rubric of "corporate governance". Most significantly, auditors view management as the primary driver of corporate governance. The inclusion of top management in the "corporate governance mosaic" is inconsistent with agency theory's prescription of the board and other mechanisms serving as a means to independently oversee management's actions to protect stakeholders. Auditors consider corporate governance factors to be especially important in the client acceptance phase and in an international context. Further, despite the attention placed on the audit committee in the academic literature, in the business community, and by regulators in different countries (e.g., Canada, United States, Australia), several respondents indicated that their experiences with their clients suggest that audit committees are typically ineffective and lack sufficient power to be a strong governance mechanism. Implications for research and practice are presented.

Application service providers (ASPs) offer multiple users a subscription-based access model via the Internet to centrally managed applications. The appeals of ASPs are the per-user-pricing models, one-to-many access possibilities to applications, IT expertise and capabilities, and value added management services. This paper argues that although the ASP model offers an electronic outsourcing solution, there are in fact many similarities with more traditional IT outsourcing. Using four case studies from exploratory research into ASPs, we illustrate the applicability of a little used contingency model from the research literature that combines resource dependency theory, resource-based theory, transaction cost theory and agency theory. From this, we develop six major propositions that customers should bear in mind when considering an ASP option. Similar to outsourcing services, ASP sourcing offers some interesting benefits, but equally entails a set of risks that practitioners should carefully evaluate when considering the 'netsourced' ASP option.

When is franchising the appropriate organizational form for implementing marketing strategy in global markets? In this paper we identify conditions under which franchising facilitates efficient transactions globally with the help of constructs from transaction cost analysis, agency theory, and franchising research in domestic contexts. Some, bases for setting initial fees and royalty payments as well as the rationale, for establishing master franchises are also explored The advantages and limitations of adopting franchising as the mode of operation in gbbal markets are briefly discussed A conceptual framework that provides an integrated multidisciplinary approach for studies of franchising from a global marketing perspective is developed.

This article focuses on the role of the family business shareholder. Based on Agency Theory, it examines the elements that influence the conflict of interests and objectives between nonemployed shareholders and the top management team and its impact on commitment to the family firm. Data were empirically obtained from a field study of 156 shareholders and executives of 10 Spanish family firms. Combining quantitative and qualitative data, investigation results show that the degree of commitment to the family business is negatively correlated with the number of family members on the board of directors. Nevertheless, the most robust and statistically significant correlation (positive) was found between the number of external board members and the commitment level of the nonemployed shareholders. Regarding the mechanisms and processes implemented, results depended on the attention that the family business paid to the institutional overlap of the three subsystems: ownership, family, and business.

The development of marketing as a discipline shows some differences between the US-dominated mainstream and theory emerging from Germany - particularly in the field of business-to-business marketing. Contemporary marketing thinking in this area in Germany is founded largely on institutional economics, with property rights theory, transaction cost economics (TCE), agency theory (AT) and information economics playing supporting roles. Based on these theories a 'leistungs' or 'value' approach has developed that permits the integration of concepts such as process thinking and services orientation in marketing with these other theories. An extended view of the system of marketing management is described that reveals new areas for marketing research and analysis in business-to-business marketing. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

This paper advances the Hunt-Vitell General Theory of Marketing Ethics as a framework for enriching current understanding of both long-term marketing relationships in general, and principal-agent associations specifically. Under economic models of agency theory, manufacturer-distributor relationships are conceptualized as principal-agent associations where both parties are assumed be motivated exclusively by short-term financial self-interest within the logical constraints of zero-sum game conditions. As a general model of ethical decision making and behavior in marketing, the Hunt-Vitell theory illustrates how ethical decisions are predicated not only upon estimations of potential benefits or outcomes (using teleological criteria), but also deontological evaluations which invoke norms and values. Furthermore, the recent ideas advanced in "relationship marketing" perspectives suggest that distribution channel associations premised upon non-zero-sum or symbiotic assumptions may be more effective and more jointly profitable. Based upon the Hunt-Vitell model, propositions are formulated that complement the understanding of agency theory within the context of marketing channel relationships, and thus, may represent a basis for more effective agency selection and interaction in marketing practice.

The concept of opportunism from transaction cost and agency theories suggests that in a normal class of students, there may be a few who will engage in opportunistic behavior, and to identify who they are will be virtually impossible. Therefore, professors engage in practices to keep students from engaging in opportunistic activities such as cheating. This article explores the possibility that some of these practices may be creating a "destructive Golem effect" in those students who would not otherwise engage in opportunistic behavior and explores ways to create Pygmalion and Galatea effects in the classroom.

This study analyzes the impact of ownership structure on R&D investments in the United States and Japan. It begins with the premise that U.S. and Japanese firms have distinct patterns of ownership that may result in disparities in R&D investments. Agency theory and stewardship theory are used to hypothesize about the relationship between ownership and R&D investments. Empirical evidence shows that the level of ownership concentration, and its impact, differ across countries. We argue that these differences result from a mixture of motives and incentives.

Current international relations theory struggles to explain both the autonomy and transformation of international organizations (IOs). Previous theories either fail to account for any IO behavior that deviates from the interests of member states, or neglect the role of member states in reforming IO institutions and behavior. We propose an agency theory of IOs that can fill these gaps while also addressing two persistent problems in the study of IOs: common agency and long delegation chains. Our model explains slippage between member states' interests and IO behavior, but also suggests institutional mechanisms - staff selection, monitoring, procedural checks, and contracts - through which states can rein in errant IOs. We evaluate this argument by examining multiple institutional reforms and lending patterns at the World Bank from 1980 to 2000.

Although uncovering the factors that lead firms to offer franchises has long been a central goal of franchising research, considerable ambiguity surrounds extant findings. In an effort to help resolve this ambiguity, we used meta-analysis to aggregate results from 44 studies containing 140 tests of ten hypotheses. The ten hypotheses reflect two theoretical perspectives-resource scarcity and agency theory. Overall, the findings offer support for several of the hypotheses grounded in agency theory, but not those grounded in resource scarcity. The results also highlight the need for future inquiry to include new theoretical approaches and richer data. (c) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Many firms have adopted outsourcing in recent years as a means of governing their information technology (IT) operations. While outsourcing is associated with significant benefits, it can also be a risky endeavour. This paper proposes a scenario-based conceptualization of the IT outsourcing risk, wherein risk is defined as a quadruplet comprising a scenario, the likelihood of that scenario, its consequences and the risk mitigation mechanisms that can attenuate or help avoid the occurrence of a scenario. This definition draws on and extends a risk assessment framework that is widely used in engineering. The proposed conceptualization of risk is then applied to the specific context of IT outsourcing using previous research on IT outsourcing as well as transaction cost and agency theory as a point of departure.

This article examines the phenomenon of plural governance, a firm's simultaneous use of market contracting and vertical integration for the same basic transaction. The author studies two particular aspects of plural governance, namely the conditions that motivate firms to deploy plural governance and the manner in which one governance form influences the other when the two coexist in a joint structure. Drawing on agency theory and information economics, the author develops a set of research hypotheses and tests them empirically in the context of industrial purchasing decisions. The results suggest that the plural governance phenomenon can be understood from the perspective of solving information asymmetry problems between buyers and suppliers. The author discusses the implications of a "make and buy" approach to extant theory of interfirm governance, relationship management, and marketing strategy in business-to-business settings.

Two theories have emerged in the managerial control literature as to the best way for organizations to ensure that managers are acting in the firm's best interest: agency theory, which stresses controlling decision-makers through monitoring and incentives aligned with organizational goals, and stewardship theory, which stresses that decision-makers will act in the organization's best interest even in the absence of controls. Much of the research investigating the utility of these two positions is based on archival data where actual decision-making can only be inferred. In this study, we utilize a laboratory methodology in order to determine if decision-makers actually make different decisions when under the types of control (or lack thereof) suggested in these two theories. The results of this study show that individuals under agency controls invest more in alternatives that maximize profits of an organization than individuals under stewardship controls.

Hostile takeover attempts oftentimes signal that a target firm has an over-diversified and ineffective corporate strategy. What does this signal mean when takeover attempts fail? Drawing from agency theory, we argue that target firms managed by independent directory boards are likely to ignore the takeover attempt and not refocus their firms' strategy. Conversely, target firms managed by nonindependent boards are more likely to view the failed takeover attempt as a 'wake-up call' and will refocus their firms' strategy so as to preserve the firm's survival. These arguments are tested using a sample of 76 firms that were targets of failed hostile takeover attempts. Logistic regression analyses confirm the predictions. This study suggests that in the aftermath of a failed takeover attempt board of director characteristics can help predict changes in corporate strategies.

Researchers use various definitions to describe the family firm. The characteristics of family firms that are stressed in each of these definitions are somehow related to family control. All characteristics together reflect a spectrum of family firm types along one core dimension: family involvement in the firm. However, it is more helpful to distinguish among family firms by using their precise type. Each particular family firm type is characterised by a set of agency relations within and between the family system, ownership system and the business system. This paper is a first attempt to apply the insights from agency theory on a highly simplified (reference) family firm situation where the father is full owner and the daughter manager of the family firm. Agency theory establishes the foundation for the optimal contract conditions between father and daughter. While real life is often characterised by bounded rationality and incomplete information, future research should help identify the "optimal contract" between the family/shareholders and management in various family firm types under these circumstances.

From this analysis, a new view of the agency relationship between institutional investors and their portfolio firms emerges, which recognizes the institutions' market power, complex role as financial intermediaries, and possible involvement in simultaneous and opposing agency contracts. We also conclude that stakeholder theorists should reconsider these newly empowered shareholders'moral standing in relation to their portfolio firms, and they should reexamine the identities and goals of these modern investors. To that end, we demonstrate that a novel, intragroup application of Mitchell, Agle, and Wood's stakeholder framework to heterogeneous institutional investors illuminates their varying levels of stakeholder salience.

In this paper we present empirical evidence on the attitudes of Taiwanese company directors on the role and function of the board of directors in Taiwanese corporate governance. Our findings arise from a questionnaire survey distributed to the directors of a sample of companies listed on the Taiwanese Securities Exchange (TSE). Our findings provide a picture of the current state of corporate governance in Taiwan. The respondents indicate that the board of directors constitutes the most important instrument in Taiwanese corporate governance and our findings endorse the important role played by outside directors in the corporate governance system in Taiwan. Furthermore, the respondents endorsed the agency theory perspective on corporate governance as they considered the presence of outside directors improved corporate accountability to shareholders. There is, however, evidence that few companies have created remuneration and audit committees. We also found that Taiwanese directors are dissatisfied with the influence of families on the corporate governance of listed companies and do not consider that outside directors on boards should be related to founding families. Overall, the directors displayed an awareness of accountability issues and a desire to improve accountability and transparency. They clearly want international harmonisation of corporate governance standards and view corporate governance reform as a means of attracting foreign funds into Taiwan. This is an important finding as it endorses the work of the OECD and other international bodies in harmonising corporate governance at a global level.

This study examines the perceptions of directors in Australian public listed companies about their access to information for their role as directors. We focus on information costs and information asymmetry. Directors' perceptions of the relationship between the composition of Boards, the perceived roles of Boards and the information requirements to fulfil those roles were explored in interviews with 45 directors from public listed companies. Implicit in Agency Theory is the assumption that independent directors have free access to the information required to fulfil their role in monitoring and control. We found, however, demonstrable evidence of information asymmetry. The central finding was that directors perceive that the CEO and Executive have the controlling power over information. The provision of appropriate information for Board decisions is perceived to hinge on the "integrity" of the CEO and Executive. This emphasis on integrity and "good companies" does appear consistent with the Stewardship Theory of governance. It raises as a question for future research the possible alternative relationships between Boards and management. The directors interviewed discussed a range of strategies they used to keep themselves informed and made observations of additions to information that they believed should be available as a matter of course.

This article is the first step toward integrating in a single framework two previously separate lines of research on major structural decisions of life insurers. The literature has previously studied the relation between capital structure and asset risk on the one hand, and the relation between organizational form and distribution system on the other hand, without integrating them. Using life insurer data for 1993-1999, we model the four key insurer decisions of capital structure, asset risk, organizational form, and distribution system as endogenous choices in a single interrelated set of simultaneous equations. The model assesses the nature of the interactions among these decisions. The model also assesses the impact of insurers' fundamental business strategy (treated as predetermined) on these choices. The business-strategy hypothesis views other key decisions as jointly determined and driven by the fundamental business strategy, once the latter is set in motion. Confirming previous studies, we find a positive relation between capital ratios and asset risk. We also find an association in the simultaneous context between stock ownership and brokerage distribution, which was not found in prior studies. Stock ownership is related to greater financial and asset risk taking, whereas brokerage distribution is associated with lower risk taking. These and other results are interpreted in light of several theories, including transaction-cost economics (TCE), agency theory, and regulatory and bankruptcy cost avoidance. Deriving from these theories, the finite risk paradigm emerges as the most comprehensive interpretation of the results, as opposed to the risk-subsidy hypothesis of the impact of guarantee funds. We also find support for the notion that the business strategy drives the capital and distribution decisions, as predicted by TCE.

Agent selection is one of the most challenging decisions faced in the implementation of organizational strategy. Despite the central importance of this decision, limited research has addressed pre-contractual evaluation of agents. The purpose of this study is to illustrate how the examination of a potential partner's network of relationships alleviates costs associated with the adverse selection problem. Propositions that underscore the influence of network quality and structure on pre-contractual uncertainty are developed. (c) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

In spite of its considerable popularity, multi-unit franchising has been considered an anomaly from an agency theory perspective. This paper addresses this anomaly by attempting a comprehensive agency theoretic explanation of international multi-unit franchising. Although past agency theoretic examinations have mostly focused on single-unit franchising, a closer examination of the international context, which is characterized by significant geographic and cultural distance between franchisors and franchisees, suggests that multi-unit franchising may be more appropriate. This paper examines several agency problems inherent in multi-unit franchising. These include: bonding, adverse selection, information flow, shirking, inefficient risk-bearing, free-riding, and quasi-rent appropriation. Consideration of each of these problems using agency theory perspective leads to the suggestion that multi-unit franchising might address agency problems better than single-unit franchising in the international context.

The aim of this article is to study the effect of diversification strategy on firm capital structure using a panel data analysis for a sample of 480 Spanish manufacturing firms during the period 1991-1994. Co-insurance effect and transaction cost arguments help to explain a positive relation between firm debt ratio and firm diversification, while agency theory predicts a negative relation. This study did not find a significant relationship between firm leverage and the degree of firm diversification, using different debt ratios, and the revenue-based Herfindahl index and the entropy measure as proxies of firm diversification. This evidence contrasts with previous studies for American and Australian markets that suggest a positive relation, according to co-insurance effect and transaction cost explanations.

This paper examines issues in the design of a co-operative member's contractual relationship with the other agents (including the remaining members) using organizational economics. The paper assumes that the central defining characteristic of a co-op is the residual claim specification. Agency theory identifies certain inherent problems of the co-op form, the horizon problem, common property problem, and non-transferability. Non-transferability both reduces the incentive to monitor and imposes limits on portfolio diversification. This paper argues that features such as claim incompleteness and non-transferability are not inherent to the co-op but may be transaction-cost economizing. The paper also argues that the pre-emptive payoff feature by which the residual claimants (the co-op members) also become fixed payoff agents can affect the risk of other agents, and is an important determinant of co-op risk. A co-op may have more than one potential residual claim base. Five generic design choices are available for handling possible multiple claim bases: battleground, pre-specified allocation, limited return, alignment, and fixed payoff. The paper uses the design of residual claims in sugar co-ops to show how a co-op can partly overcome some of the problems identified by agency theory. This illustration ties together the issues of claim incompleteness and non-transferability, pre-emptive payoff, and multiple claim bases. (c) 2003 CIRIEC.

This study examines the choice between management contracts and franchise agreements in the corporate development of international hotel companies. The fact that contractual modes of corporate development are quite prevalent in the hotel sector world-wide, in combination with the lack of research in that direction, suggests the gap in this field. This study attempts to fill this void by developing a theoretical framework in order for further empirical research to reveal important findings regarding the factors that influence the choice between franchise agreements and management contracts as a means of non-equity hotel development. It has been suggested that management contracts should be viewed as a more hierarchical form of organisation in terms of the degree of control the firm can exercise. Additionally, a more robust theoretical discussion has been provided, combining both transaction cost theory and agency theory on the decision for corporate development in the hotel industry. Finally, important factors have been identified, which influence a hotel company's choice between management contracts and franchise agreement in its corporate development, followed by propositions, therefore, set out a guideline for further empirical studies.

The Japanese system of corporate governance and in particular the role played by banks and other financial institutions have been the subject of considerable research and controversy in recent years. We estimate the impact of equity ownership by financial institutions on firm performance in Japan for 1986-1991, a period that precedes many of the problems of the ensuing decade. We find that while ownership by financial institutions is associated with unprofitable diversification, such ownership is, on balance, positively associated with firm profitability. Some implications of these findings for Japan's unique system of governance are discussed.

As franchising has increased its visibility and impact on the business landscape, it has attracted the attention of a wide variety of researchers from different academic backgrounds. We draw together much of this research by juxtaposing the two key theories used to explain franchising, resource scarcity and agency theory, with the empirical findings regarding three key franchising constructs-franchise initiation, subsequent propensity to franchise, and franchise performance. We suggest that research emphasis needs to shift toward understanding why firms initiate franchising and how franchising impacts different types of organizational performance. We also find that extant research can benefit from additional theoretical diversity and thus we offer new propositions grounded in three theories not yet widely applied to franchising.

While agency theory claims managerial self-interest creates a diversification discount, strategic theory explains that firms with certain kinds of resources should diversify. Longitudinal data on 227 firms that diversify between 1980 and 1992 reveal that the sample firms invest less in R&D and have greater breadth of technology (based on patent citations) than their industry peers prior to the diversification event. Also, acquiring firms may appear to have lower performance because of accounting conventions and because firms that use internal growth rather than acquisition pursue less extensive diversification. These findings help explain how diversification and financial performance are endogenous. Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Different theories make different assumptions about the mechanisms that govern economic transactions and there are several reviews that have summarized existing conceptual and empirical work associated with such frameworks as transaction cost analysis or agency theory. However, Macneil's Relational Contracting Theory, another major theoretical foundation of current marketing research into business relationships, has not yet received similar attention. This article provides a review of a core concept developed in this stream of literature: the norm concept. It contrasts Macneil's view of norms with the work developed in the field of marketing. As a result, the authors identify, first, a gap between Macneil's interpretation of the norm concept and the application made by marketing scholars and second, contradictions in the results obtained from empirical marketing research.

In this paper, we take an integrated view of Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) and Agency Theory (AT) in order to study the direct salesforce vs. rep decision and the design of compensation plans in German salesforces. We test, with a single data set, a set of established and new hypotheses of both theories in the context of both decisions. This allows us to assess the complementarity of AT and TCA by estimating the relative explanatory power of the two frameworks for each of the two decisions. On the one hand, we find support for most of the established hypotheses. However, the hypothesized effect of uncertainty is rejected in our data set. Moreover, we document the impact of some new variables. We also find that, while AT does not add much to explain the decision of direct vs. rep in our data, TCA is equally limiting in helping understand the design of salesforce compensation plans. Therefore, one has to be cautious in treating AT and TCA as complementary theories. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper advances the resource dependence and social networks literature by investigating a board's structural social capital created as a consequence of interlocking directorates. Using approaches and measures developed by social network analysis we compare the interpersonal directorship networks of the top 250 companies in the United States and Australia. We find that the smaller, sparser Australian network is only marginally less compact and connected than the larger US network at the firm level of analysis. However, at the director level of analysis the US network is much larger and more connected than its Australian counterpart. As a result, we argue that scholars studying the resource dependence role of boards should consider using measures of interpersonal links as well as traditional measures of inter-firm links. Understanding how boards impact on corporate performance is a question central to the corporate governance research agenda. Agency theory, for example, argues that the key way a board adds value is by ensuring the interests of the managers of the firm are aligned with the interests of the owners (Eisenhardt 1989; Jensen & Meckling 1976). A quite distinct area of inquiry, however, relates to the role that the board plays in providing access to important resources such as customers (Pennings 1980), capital (Mizruchi & Stearns 1988), the business elite (Uscem 1984) and power in general (Pfeffer & Salancik 1978). We aim to broaden understanding of the resource dependence theory of corporate governance by examining the links provided to a board by interlocking directorships. We commence by reviewing existing research on the resource dependence role of the board before outlining how the emerging construct of social capital can be adapted and applied to investigate this role. In particular, we highlight how it is the personal director network that is critical to the development of social capital rather than the corporate network (i.e. network of corporations). While this study is primarily exploratory and descriptive, we contribute to the literature by employing a new methodology to measure the 'opportunity network' that interlocking directorates provide a board within a national corporate governance system (Adams 2002a; 2002b; 2002c). We show how the formal models, procedures and techniques developed in social network analysis can be applied to individual-level networks among directors. We stress that we are not considering the formation of social capital at the individual level; rather we are examining the systemic connections of individual directors in order to illustrate the opportunity network available to a board within the national corporate governance system. A comparison of the Australian and US systems highlights the divergence in network attributes between corporate networks and the networks of interlocking directors. We conclude with implications and areas for further research.

Suppliers and buyers of R&D results perceive two exchange risks: first, the risk to achieve a lower profitability on the innovation return than the exchange partner, second, the risk of the partner becoming a competitor by unplanned, one-sided knowledge flows. Both risks motivate opportunistic behaviour. The paper deals with the reduction of the perceived supplier risks. We analyse how an option on later negotiation of an additional continuous innovation return sharing which is based on contractual hostages can lower the perceived exchange risks. An empirical study examines how effectively these hostages lower the perceived risks. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A curious ownership structure is found in Northern Europe-foundations that own and operate business companies. The foundations are non-profit entities, they have no members and no owners, and they cannot be dissolved. In many cases, these entities control more than 50% of the votes in successful international companies. Obviously, this structure completely blocks the market for corporate control, but it also violates other basic principles of agency theory and corporate finance. Nevertheless, we present evidence that a sample of foundation-owned companies listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange are at least as efficient as other listed companies in terms of risk adjusted stock returns, accounting returns and Tobin's Q. Thus, they question whether profit-seeking ownership is a necessary condition for competitive enterprise. (c) 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Different organizational theories clearly define critical organizational activities necessary for organizational survival. Recent attention to "hybrid" research that links organizational theory with MIS research has been proposed to lend new insights into strategic alignment of IT (Orlikowski & Barley, 2000; Zrnud, 2002). One gap still to be addressed relates to role expectations and skills required by the IT professional according to different organizational theories. Much of the literature on strategic alignment of IT emphasizes the value provided by the IT artifact or focuses on communication between IT and business management, rather than on the role of IT professionals inferred by critical survival activities outlined in different organizational theories. Motivated by organizational concerns related to the clarity and articulation of the role of Information Technology professionals in contributing to strategic alignment, our study reviews literature about the role of the information technology professional and the differences according to three organizational theories: Agency theory, Transaction Cost theory and Institutional theory. We then use bibliometrics and content analysis to analyze published research for implicit or explicit skill expectations and contributions to organizational survival and strategic alignment of IT. The goal of our study is to contribute to a better understanding of role conflict, skill expectations, and value of information technology professionals in organizations, and also contribute to a consolidation between information systems research and organizational studies.

Firms in mature or declining industries are faced with the challenge of redeploying their excess resources to new applications, and M&A strategies can be an important component of this effort. I consider two ways in which excess resources are applied to more attractive business opportunities through M&A, and I analyze these strategies through the lenses of industrial organization economics, resource-based view, evolutionary perspective and agency theory. In the redeployment strategy, firms seek attractive opportunities in related industries, using acquisitions to fill any resource deficiencies. In the consolidation strategy, firms combine with their competitors within the same industry. The resulting larger pool of resources provides greater opportunities for disposing off their under-utilized resources through the market, while enhancing their profitability. Either way, excess resources can find new applications, within the firm in the former strategy and through the market in the latter. I also discuss some implications for future research and practice.

This review and introduction to the Special Issue on 'Strategy Research in Emerging Economies' considers the nature of theoretical contributions thus far on strategy in emerging economies. We classify the research through four strategic options: (1) firms from developed economies entering emerging economies; (2) domestic firms competing within emerging economies; (3) firms from emerging economies entering other emerging economies; and (4) firms from emerging economies entering developed economies. Among the four perspectives examined (institutional theory, transaction cost theory, resource-based theory, and agency theory), the most dominant seems to be institutional theory. Most existing studies that make a contribution blend institutional theory with one of the other three perspectives, including seven out of the eight papers included in this Special Issue. We suggest a future research agenda based around the four strategies and four theoretical perspectives. Given the relative emphasis of research so far on the first and second strategic options, we believe that there is growing scope for research that addresses the third and fourth.

This paper argues that research in organization theory has seen a shift in orientation from paradigm-driven work to problem-driven work since the late 1980s. A number of paradigms for the study of organizations were elaborated during the mid-1970s, including transaction cost economics, resource dependence theory, organizational ecology, new institutional theory, and agency theory in financial economics. These approaches reflected the dominant trends of the large corporations of their time: increasing concentration, diversification, and bureaucratization. However, subsequent shifts in organizational boundaries, the increased use of alliances and network forms, and the expanding role of financial markets in shaping organizational decision making all make normal science driven by the internally derived questions from these paradigms less fruitful. Instead, we argue that problem-driven work that uses mechanism-based theorizing and research that takes the field rather than the organization as the unit of analysis are the most appropriate styles of organizational research under conditions of major economic change - such as our own era. This sort of work is best exemplified by various studies under the rubric of institutional theory in the past 15 years, which are reviewed here. (c) 2005 INFORMS.

Property rights theory has common antecedents with contractual theories of the firm such as transaction costs and agency theories, and is yet distinct from these theories. We illustrate fundamental theoretical principles derived from these three theories by analyzing the business case of oil field unitization. Theoretical principles and application of theory to oil field unitization are each summarized. From this, it is possible to see how property rights theory is well suited to explain business situations where inefficient economic outcomes persist. Additionally, property rights theory forges new theoretical connections with other branches of organizational economics, in particular, resource-based theory.

Purpose This research paper aims to identify and rank critical issues in IT outsourcing relationships. Design/methodology/approach A total of 11 management theories were applied in this research: theory of core competencies, resource-based theory, neo-classical economic theory, transaction cost theory, contractual theory, agency theory, partnership and alliance theory, relational exchange theory, stakeholder theory, social exchange theory and theory of firm boundaries. The main method used is case studies and survey. Case studies were conducted in three IT outsourcing relationships: ABB-IBM, SAS-CSC, and RR-EDS. Findings Core competence management and stakeholder management were found to be the most critical success factors. Future research should focus on one or two theories, explicitly laying out expectations with respect to the theories, and organizing rich data to test expectations. Originality/value This paper demonstrates that a holistic approach to IT outsourcing is needed that recognizes and emphasizes the combination of several critical success factors. The theory-based factors have both divergent and convergent implications for management. (c) 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Corporate scandals, reflected in excessive management compensation and fraudulent accounts, cause great damage. Agency theory's insistence to link the compensation of managers and directors as closely as possible to firm performance is a major reason for these scandals. They cannot be overcome by improving variable pay for performance as selfish extrinsic motivation is reinforced. Based on the common pool approach to the firm, institutions are proposed, serving to raise intrinsically motivated corporate virtue. More importance is to be attributed to fixed pay and strengthening the legitimacy of authorities by procedural fairness, relational contracts, and organizational citizenship behavior.

We reason that agency theory's behavioral assumptions may too closely reflect the US institutional context to explain the governance heritages that exist elsewhere. We propose that what constitutes opportunistic behavior and what can be done to limit it may vary due to differences in national background and formal institutions. We then test the validity of this nationally bounded model using historical sociology analysis of three nations whose corporate governance heritages are believed to differ (USA, Sweden, and France). Specifically, we review their political, cultural, and economic institutions to explore the different ways that their governance practices have evolved and infer causes for these historical variations.

American businesses and corporate executives are faced with a serious problem the loss of public confidence. Public criticism, increased government controls, and growing expectations for improved financial performance and accountability have accompanied this decline in trust. Traditional approaches to corporate governance, typified by agency theory and stakeholder theory, have been expensive to direct and have focused on short-term profits and organizational systems that fail to achieve desired results. We explain why the organizational governance theories are fundamentally, inadequate to build trust. We advance a conceptual framework based on stewardship theory characterized by "covenantal relationships" and argue that design of governance mechanisms using a covenantal approach is more effective in building trust in organizations. A covenantal relationship is a specialized form of a relational contract between an employee and his or her organization. We argue that regardless of incentives and control mechanisms carefully designed through contractual mechanisms, in the absence of covenantal relationships it is extremely difficult to build trust within organizations. We propose that organizations are more likely to build trust - both at the organizational level and at the interpersonal level - when they create reinforcing and integrated systems that honor implied duties of "covenantal relationships.".

This paper draws on field study data to provide an examination of the condominium owner/manager relationship in the Australian tourism context. Although there has been considerable growth in tourism accommodation owned through strata-title, no research examining the somewhat idiosyncratic relationship between unit owners and resident managers has been found in the literature. The peculiar nature of the relationship underlines its significance as a context in which to apply the agency theoretical model. As Australian condominium resident unit managers provide letting and caretaker services for condominium unit owners, it appears that the relationship can be justifiably viewed as a principal-agent exchange (Mills, P.K., J. Business Res. 20 (1990) 31). The study specifically focuses on strata title condominiums located in major tourism regions. This sub-sector of the condominium management industry was chosen for study because it exhibits several key attributes distinguishing it from the non-tourist-based condominium sector. For example, two different parties represent the principal (resident owners and investor owners), also a significant proportion of a resident manager's work relates to the management of short-term holiday unit letting. In light of the particular agency relationship dynamics arising in large tourist-based condominium governance, several suggestions concerning the legal environment of the industry are provided.

This article brings forward the argument that the practical implementation of a corporate governance code cannot be realized by a compliance program alone. Its relevance in everyday business is determined by the moral values of the company culture. In this context, governance is defined as a company's resources and capabilities, including the moral resources, to take on responsibility for all its stakeholders. A critical discussion of the agency theory, transaction cost theory, and organization theory shows that such an approach is possible only when a company is not perceived as a maximizing machine for shareholders' interests but as an economic form of cooperation of internal and external resources and stakeholders. An empiric study on 22 European corporate governance codes shows that the predominant majority of European codes orientate themselves to stakeholders and the company. The discussion of the empirical data reveals six basic principles that determine all European corporate governance codes: shareholder rights, transparency, voting rights, regulation of remuneration, design of organizational structures, and corporate social responsibility.

Government regulation in an industry is an intermediary in the principal-agent relationship that acts as a substitute for internal governance mechanisms. We propose a model for studying how different forms of deregulation (frame-breaking, metamorphic, piecemeal, and plodding) impact variations in the speed of adaptation of internal governance mechanisms to the theoretical predictions of agency theory and resulting performance implications. We develop illustrative propositions for a set of contingencies that moderate the above relationship. How government and firms manage the deregulatory process has important economic and social consequences.

Since the papers of Basu et al. (1985) and Lal and Srinivasan (1993), marketing academics have been interested in the design and implementation of optimal compensation plans. The literature has focused on agency theory as a foundation to help describe and understand this process. Although there has been much theoretical work on this topic, empirical evidence to support this theory remains sparse. Studies by Coughlan and Narasimhan (1992) and John and Weitz (1988, 1989) have found some early evidence that supports agency theory. In this paper we revisit the issue of salesforce compensation on both theoretical and empirical fronts. On the theory side we build a game theoretic model of salesforce compensation that accounts for risk aversion on the part of both the principal and the agent. We further show that accounting for the firm size within the analytical framework yields new insights into the nature of compensation design. The results obtained from our model, while substantiating past findings, offer some new insights into the compensation design process. In particular we find that firm demographics play an important role in the design of the optimal compensation scheme. We then use two datasets collected ten years apart by the Dartnell Corporation to investigate and test hypotheses generated by our model and the extant literature. Our results show that the basic tenets of agency theory continue to hold over time and that our new theoretical hypotheses are consistent with the data. Using the two datasets we also find that inter-temporal changes in salesforce compensation coincide with the advent and adoption of new technologies. Our research thus adds to our substantive knowledge of the drivers of salesforce compensation, while adding to the theoretical structure through taking account of the possibility of principal risk aversion.

This paper reviews and examines the development of agency theory and its components, the relationship between the principal and agent, and further explores its implications for the field of HRD. Understanding the foundations, functional utility, and implications is important both for HRD scholars and practitioners, as the field is striving to motivate productivity of employees in today's complex and dynamic workplace environment, where the ways in which business is conducted are changing. This paper contributes to our understanding of how organisational principals and agents interact and how HRD programmes and functions may benefit from the opportunity that agency theory offers to address the challenges which this phenomenon presents.

The paper offers a property rights and monitoring cost explanation for the allocation of residual income and decision rights between the carriers and truck drivers under internal governance. First, by applying the property rights theory, we argue that the structure of residual income rights depends on the importance of noncontractible (intangible) assets of the truck driver to generate residual surplus. The more important the truck driver's intangible knowledge assets, the more residual income rights should be transferred to him. Second, we controlled for the monitoring costs as an additional explanatory variable of the allocation of residual income rights. According to agency theory, the variable proportion of the driver's income should be higher where monitoring costs are higher. Third, we investigate the relationship between residual income and residual decision rights under internal governance. If the contractual relation is governed by an employment contract, residual decision and residual income rights may be substitutes because, under fiat, a certain incentive effect of the governance structure may result either from the allocation of high-powered incentives or the transfer of residual decision rights to the driver. These hypotheses were tested by using data from the Hungarian trucking industry. The data provide partial support for the hypotheses. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Elena Rocco 1. INTRODUCTION A large number of heterogeneous human relations, like transactions, delegation, teamwork, promises, are based on trust. As a consequence, different disciplines have contributed from different perspectives to the study of trust (Rousseau et al. 1998; Kramer and Tyler 1996). A shared view in this multidisciplinary debate is that is that there is no trust without risk (Deutsch 1958; Currall 1990; March and Shapiro 1987). Formal control and coordination mechanisms have been devised to reduce the amount of risk associated to trust, for example, escrow account, control procedures and hierarchical control (Thompson 1967; Mintzberg 1979). Nevertheless, these mechanisms reduce risks to the extent we can identify and predict the range of threats to trust. In the face of an unforeseeable event, either intentional or unintentional, if the trustee does not behave as the trustor would have expected to, the trust-based relation is likely to be undermined. Economic models, like the agency theory (Alchian and Demsetz 1972) and the transaction costs perspective (Williamson 1985), have focused on opportunism as the main threat to trust. Opportunistic behavior often leads to intentional actions unknown to the trustor and detrimental to his own interest (Williamson 1985; Gambetta 1988). Beyond opportunism, other elements may undermine trust. Trust may indeed be weakened by unintentional action by the trustee. For instance, the employee may act in the interest of her manager but not as he would have expected to. Similarly, tacit coordination in teams works as long as individuals can rely on each other's.... (c) Katinka Bijlsma-Frankema and Rosalinde Klein Woolthuis 2005.

This paper explores how firms finance their R&D projects. There are several instruments that can be used, however, due to information asymmetries and the combination of tangible and intangible returns that R&D projects generate, debt-financing is the worst alternative. The novelty of this paper is that it combines aspects of the resource-based view with those of the agency theory. This, in terms of a firm's decision making, is to consider that a firm's R&D investment is, on the one hand, partly determined by its financing resources and, on the other hand, a major determinant of its financial structure. The theoretical hypotheses are supported in the empirical study that makes use of a data sample of Spanish manufacturing firms for the period 1991-99. The main implication for managers that can be extracted from our study is that the most powerful financing incentive mechanism to stimulate R&D effort is to follow a deep pocket policy of internal funds accumulation.

In this theoretical paper we are investigating the important question of why, in the face of strong evidence that mergers and acquisitions (M&As) do not generate returns for acquiring company shareholders, CEOs continue to pursue these strategies. Drawing on a variety of theoretical perspectives, we argue that the firm's agents (the CEO and executives) and M&A promoters (investment bankers, lawyers and other advisors) have developed non-efficiency based relationships in the context of increased competitive pressures and a crisis in corporate ethics. The key theoretical point is that the nexus between CEOs, professional advisors and boards provides a more compelling explanation for the observed merger preference phenomenon than either the agency problem or the promoter effect on their own. Implications of the model for practice, research and theory building are discussed. (c) 2005 Yoser Gadhoum.

The purpose of this article is to provide an explanation for the contradictory evidence in the literature regarding the performance of family-owned firms. The article suggests that most of the research fails to clearly describe the "family effect" on organizational performance. The "family effect," based on agency theory and the resource-based view of the firm, is described and propositions are generated that examine the relationship between families and organizational performance. Implications for theory and research are also discussed. (c) 2006 Family Firm Institute, Inc.

This article seeks to link the domains of corporate governance, investment policies, competitive asymmetries, and sustainable capabilities. Conditions such as concentrated ownership, lengthy tenures, and profound business expertise give some family-controlled business (FCB) owners the discretion, incentive, knowledge, and ultimately, the resources to invest deeply in the future of the firm. These long-term investments accrue from particular governance conditions and engender competitive asymmetries - organizational qualities that are hard for other firms to copy, and thus, if tied to the value chain, create capabilities that are sustainable. Investments in staff and training, e.g., create tacit knowledge and preserve it within the firm. Investments in enduring relationships with partners enhance access to resources and free firms to focus on core competencies. And devotion to a compelling mission dedicates most of these investments to a core competency. When such investments are farsighted, orchestrated, and ongoing, capabilities will tend to evolve in a cumulative trajectory, making them doubly hard to imitate and thereby extending competitive advantage. Arguments are supported by making reference to the literature on corporate governance and agency theory and to emerging research on FCBs. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Despite the fact that several event studies have investigated the market's reaction to information technology (IT) investment announcements, little is known about how specific transactional risks influence the market value of a firm. This study examines stock market data to assess investors' responses to various transactional risks associated with IT outsourcing. More specifically, we develop and test several hypotheses to understand how transactional risks that arise due to a range of factors (i.e., the size of outsourcing contracts, difficulties in performance monitoring, asset specificity of IT resources, vendor capability, and the lack of cultural similarity between client and vendor firms) influence investors' reactions to IT outsourcing announcements. Our results indicate that most of these factors indeed significantly influence investors' perceptions of the risks involved in IT outsourcing. We discuss these findings in a larger organizational context and offer implications for both research and practice. In particular, our study offers a theoretical rationale for why negative reactions to IT outsourcing announcements may occur, while providing practitioners with several means by which they can increase the informational value of outsourcing arrangements.

Prior research over several decades has catalogued many positive motives underlying firms' decisions to engage in joint ventures and other forms of alliances. In this empirical analysis, we investigate whether agency problems brought about by the separation of ownership and control also stimulate the development of firms' joint venture portfolios. By focusing on joint ventures, as opposed to diversification in general or acquisitions, we address the recent debate on agency theory's domain. Results from a sample of U.S. manufacturing firms' alliance portfolios offer supporting evidence, and comparable findings are obtained for international and domestic joint ventures. Agency hazards are also found to bring about extensions of firms' nonequity alliance portfolios in both the international and domestic settings. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Despite theoretical developments in recent years, our understanding of corporate capital structure remains incomplete. Prior empirical research has been dominated by archival regression studies which are limited in their ability to fully reflect the diversity found in practice. The present paper reports on a comprehensive survey of corporate financing decision-making in UK listed companies. A key finding is that firms are heterogeneous in their capital structure policies. About half of the firms seek to maintain a target debt level, consistent with trade-off theory, but 60% claim to follow a financing hierarchy, consistent with pecking order theory. These two theories are not viewed by respondents as either mutually exclusive or exhaustive. Many of the theoretical determinants of debt levels are widely accepted by respondents, in particular the importance of interest tax shield, financial distress, agency costs and also, at least implicitly, information asymmetry. Results also indicate that cross-country institutional differences have a significant, impact on financial decisions. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - To improve the understanding of the inter-organizational dynamics of the dyadic relationships between a buyer and provider of logistics services (TPL dyads). Design/methodology/approach - Analyzes the preparation, implementation, and operation of a particular case of third party logistics (TPL) arrangements. Based on a single case study of a dyadic relationship, the paper confronts the static view of the transaction cost approach and the agency theory on "governance structures" and "contracts" by showing how "relationship governance" emerges and develops over time. Findings - TPL dyads are subject to both controllable and non-controllable forces of change, which may not always have a positive effect on the logistics performance or the relationship itself. Inter-organizational dynamics not only relate to learning, competence development, or adaptation, as suggested by other studies, but also to how the dyadic relationships are governed. As the dyad accumulates experience over time, changes will occur in the balance between the two parties in terms of goal congruence and risk preferences, which has a strong influence on the nature of contracts and other safeguards governing the relationship. Similarly, explanatory power of theories applicable to inter-organizational settings may vary as relationships emerge and develop over time. Focus on core competencies as the logic of outsourcing is followed by a period characterized by a principal-agent relationship. To ensure further prosperity of the relationship, the two companies must direct their efforts towards the logic of the network approach. Originality/value - Contributes to a cross-disciplinary fertilization of the SCM field, in particular inter-organizational relationships. (c) 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Challenging the dominant economic agency theory of corporate governance with a new discourse drawn from institutional theory, the paper analyses how management accounting is implicated in corporate governance. The proposed institutional theory of agency links the micro-institutions of the organization that are informed by the practices of management accounting with external institutional players and stakeholders. The paper identifies emerging narratives in which the management accounting profession has recognised a distinctive, post-Enron set of sensibilities. Although techniques drawn from strategic management accounting can be adapted to embed better corporate governance practices, the institutional theory of agency identifies tensions between the heroic CEO narrative and the routinization of strategy implicit in strategic management accounting.

This paper discusses the merits of purchasing firms of pursuing a focused commitment strategy (FCS) with suppliers. An FCS involves committing long-term investments with a limited number of suppliers to achieve superior performance. Drawing upon transaction cost theory, agency theory and the knowledge-based view, a basis is provided for comparisons of the benefits and risks of such a strategy. Using data gathered from 224 US manufacturing firms, support for the hypothesized trade-offs associated with an FCS is examined. The findings support such trade-offs, suggesting that operational benefits accrue from increasing levels of focused commitment beyond unfocused levels - but only up to a point. The results indicate that firms pursuing above-average levels of focused commitment may be subject to risks that offset transactional and scale-related benefits. Detriments from too much focused commitment erode the firm's manufacturing-based competitive performance. In addition, the evidence indicates that profitability and market share growth also suffer. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for managers and for future research.

This chapter reviews the interorganizational accounting literature. There are two different types of interorganizational settings that have been covered within the literature: dyadic relationships between two collaborating companies and networks where a relationship is seen as embedded in a set of relationships. The emphasis on intensive and long-term relationships can be associated with a number of interorganizational accounting practices, such as open-book accounting, target costing, interorganizational cost management, value-chain accounting, integrated information systems, total cost of ownership, nonfinancial measurement, and informal control mechanisms. Published papers within the literature have applied a mixture of theoretical models, such as transaction cost economics, agency theory, actor network theory, and the industrial-network approach.

China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) traditionally have been governed by the Communist Party. Privatization has brought greater numbers of investors who have a stake and demand a voice in how SOEs are managed. Three traditional governance perspectives are agency theory, resource dependence, and institutional theory, but China's transition introduces several additional governance approaches. Are "capitalism with Chinese characteristics" and "bureaucratic entrepreneurialism" paradoxes? Based on initial interviews of SOE executives, a survey of top managers and board chairs of listed companies, and subsequent interviews and observations in select case companies, this paper develop a taxonomy of SOE governance that now exists in China. Two of the approaches represent the extremes of the old state-centered regimes and the new shareholder-centered regimes. Considering China's historical and cultural contexts coupled with its current stage of economic transition, two additional approaches to corporate governance are to have a vacuum as neither the state nor shareholders dominate or - in unique contrast to other countries - a hybrid of both.

Most literature examining firms' make and buy decisions fails to explore when firms use both governance structures for similar transactions. We examine this phenomenon in the trucking industry, where it is common for a carrier to use both employee drivers and outsourcing at the same time. We argue that efficiency, appropriability and competition concerns lead carriers to organize on a haul-by-haul basis.We empirically examine our theory using a unique data from a small trucking firm in St Louis, MO, and find broad support for our hypotheses.We also discuss the possibility of alternative explanations of market power, capacity constraint, agency theory and property right theory for the use of make and buy. We conclude that these theories do not explain this phenomenon in the trucking industry. Thus, we conclude that it is the interaction of efficiency, appropriability and competition concerns that drive the decision to make and buy in the trucking industry.We further postulate that these concerns can manifest themselves in other industries, suggesting that our theory has applicability beyond trucking.

In an international setting, the potential conflict between the trading partners is thought to be more acute than in the domestic market, as cultural distance and ensuing misunderstandings make trading relations more complicated and demanding: the international marketer is confronted with the challenges of not only understanding the culture but also interpreting the local market information. This situation is often aggravated by limited resources put into the international marketing endeavour by the marketer. Evidently, opportunism is a serious impediment to mutually beneficial relations between business partners. Not only will it make the transaction less efficient, but also create a ground for mistrust between the partners, that eventually may lead to conflict and dissolution of the trading relations, or costly control activities involving information gathering and monitoring, incentives. In agency theory, these conflicts are curtailed through controls and/or incentives (Eisenhardt, 1989), whereas conflicts in transaction cost analysis (TCA) are sought reduced through internalisation of the transaction (Williamson, 1975, 1985). However, other levers of control than those prescribed by TCA or agency theory are available to the international marketer; flexibility (Bello & Gilliland, 1997), relationalism (Bello, Chelaru, & Zhang, 2003), relational norms (Heide & John, 1992; Zhang et al., 2003), clan control (Ouchi, 1979), relational control (de Mortanges & Vossen, 1999), and social control (Aulakh, Kotabe, & Sahay, 1996). The paper espouses this string of contributions to the exporter-middleman literature and - while testing some of their propositions in another setting (Norwegian exporters) - endeavours to widen it in three ways:(1)It introduces the role of relationship quality, and analyses the impact of different control modes and governance antecedents on this construct.(2)It extends the repertoire of governance antecedents in international business relations to include power relations and social bonds between the relationship partners.(3)It also introduces a distinction between antecedents that are "easily" manipulated in the short term by the trading partners, process drivers-social interaction, investments in relations, information exchange, and flexibility, and factors that are more difficult to change in the short term, structural drivers, such as power relations, cultural distance and resource inadequacy. We develop a conceptual framework that helps understanding how the process and structural drivers promote different control modes and relationship quality, and how these in their turn relate to relationship performance. The model is pictured in Fig. 1. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Purpose - The paper seeks to explain the collaborative intent, trust development, and conflict resolution in a headquarters-subsidiary relationship in a new product launch context in an emerging market. Design/methodology/ approach - Grounded theory development is employed through personal interviews with senior executives of selected multinational firms operating in Turkey. Findings - A major challenge in collaboration is convincing both parties to the dyad that the expertise of the other party is essential for effective collaboration. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based solely on looking at the subsidiary side of the subsidiary-HQ dyad in a single country, which limits their generalizability. Since we did not interview the HQ side of this dyad, speculations made about the possible reactions of HQ personnel to subsidiary actions must be interpreted with caution. Practical implications - The perceptions of both parties play a far more important role than the facts or perceptions of just one party when it comes to relationships and conflict resolution. Both parties need to pay more attention to the possible causes of means incongruence and take perception gaps and the other side's needs and expertise into account when approaching collaboration and conflict resolution. Originality/value - Agency theory is extended to a multinational firm-subsidiary context in order to suggest mechanisms for resolving conflict through increased communication, greater trust in each other's capabilities, and greater collaboration in meeting common challenges. A diagnostic and prescriptive framework and mechanisms are also offered through which disruptive conflict can be transformed into functional conflict and collaboration.

This study examined the effects of ownership structure on the financial performance of publicly traded newspaper companies. The results showed that the level of institutional ownership in a year was negatively associated with the subsequent year's profitability, as measured by return on equity and return on assets. Increased insider ownership in a given year was followed by decreased debt-to-equity ratio in the next year. Agency theory and financial control theory were discussed.

The primary purpose of this chapter is to present descriptive real-life case studies of different offshore-outsourced custom software development projects (that the author has actually worked for). The first case study discusses the practical issues in two fixedterm/fixed-price custom software development projects that were offshore-outsourced. The second case study discusses the practical issues in the offshore-outsourcing of a time and materials custom software development project to multiple vendors, which involved simultaneous insourcing, onshore-outsourcing and offshore-outsourcing. Furthermore, the observations and issues from these case studies are analyzed by comparing them with the paradigms of socio-economic theories that have been adopted extensively in the academic IS outsourcing literature (namely the agency theory, transaction cost theory, innovation diffusion theory, social exchange theory, and power-politics theory).

The paper further examines how the roles of "principals" and "agents" complicate the change and improvement processes and experience, and challenge the role of O.D. professionals. This paper contributes to our understanding of why, even with what appear to be the best of intentions on all sides, the principals and agents in organizations may interact to cause failure and outlines the implications of this dynamic process within the organization.

Agency Theory as the dominant view of Corporate Governance disregards that the key task of firm governance is to generate, accumulate, transfer, and protect firm specific knowledge. Three different foundations to the theory of the firm which underpin different concepts of corporate governance are discussed: The traditional view of the firm as a nexus of contracts, the view of the firm as a nexus of firm specific investments and the view of the firm as a nexus of firm specific knowledge investments. The latter view distinguishes two fundamental differences between contracting firm specific knowledge investments in contrast to financial investment: (1) A knowledge worker cannot contract his or her future knowledge in the same way as the exchange of tangible goods. (2) Only insiders can evaluate firm specific knowledge generation and transformation. We suggest a concept of corporate governance that takes investments in firm specific knowledge into account: (1) The board should rely more on insiders. (2) Those employees of the firm making firm-specific knowledge investments should elect the insiders. (3) A neutral person should chair the board. This concept provides a theoretical foundation of corporate governance based in the knowledge-based theory of the firm.

The importance of the sorting and incentive effects of PFP has been proposed and examined before, but the separate presence and importance of the two effects in isolation from higher pay levels have not to our knowledge been disentangled and directly tested. Our study demonstrated that PFP has two advantages for firms relative to FS pay: first, they attract higher-quality employees and shed lower-quality employees, and second, they motivate employees to put forward more effort. Using real-effort laboratory experiments with salient incentives, we examine the impact of pay-for-performance (PFP) versus fixedsalary (FS) compensation on productivity. PFP achieved significantly higher productivity through both sorting and incentive effects. In particular, more productive employees selected PFP, and employees on average, regardless of their preferred compensation scheme, produced more under PFP. Risk preferences were also important. Less risk-averse individuals were both more likely to select PFP and also more responsive to PFP incentives.

The recent financial crises have created a new debate about comparison and convergence of different systems of corporate governance. In particular, they have underlined poor efficiency of rule structures to achieve a good relationship between different stakeholder's rights. In line with many studies of corporate governance that emphasize the manager-stakeholders relationship as explained by agency theory, in this paper, I analyse the role of auditing as an incentive device to reduce contractual or transaction costs related to asymmetric information.Considering as a benchmark the recent US Sarbanes Oxley Act of July 2002. I describe a set of auditing principles by comparing common and civil corporate laws. First, by using multiple correspondence analysis on six countries and twenty-seven dummy variables on auditing rules, I identify the main variables that form the auditing index. Second, I test the hypothesis that a suitable rule structure can improve the capability of financial markets to estimate the fair value of firms. In particular, I analyse the problem of the effects of direct and indirect monitoring rules for managers on the market value of public companies. The results obtained highlight a different relationship between auditing principles and firm performance from that expected on the basis of the legal framework.

This paper explores the problems of managerial discretion in the non-profit sector, with special consideration to Spanish Work Accident Mutuals (MATEPs). Firstly, from Transaction Costs, Property Rights and Agency perspectives, the economic rationale of mutuals is analyzed, paying particular attention to MATEP's peculiarities and incentives in terms of competition, regulation and ownership. Subsequently, the effectiveness of governance mechanisms is discussed, showing that the status quo leaves excess power in the hands of the managers of these organizations.

This paper deals with a broad and controversial part of microeconomic theory represented by the theory of the firm. An overview of the main line of criticism of the orthodox (classical) theory of the firm and also of the theories proposed as reactions to one or more aspects of this criticism is given. However, the attention is attached to managerial theories of the firm, which are represented especially by the models of Baumol, Williamson and Marris. In each case the assumptions of the particular theory are stated, followed by graphical and mathematical exposition of its main conclusions. Finally, the paper concludes with a brief discussion of the contributions and setbacks of managerial theories.

Despite a decade since the inception of B2C e-commerce, the uncertainty of the online environment still makes many consumers reluctant to engage in online exchange relationships. Even if uncertainty has been widely touted as the primary barrier to online transactions, the literature has viewed uncertainty as a "background" mediator with insufficient conceptualization and measurement. To better understand the nature of uncertainty and mitigate its potentially harmful effects on B2C e-commerce adoption (especially for important purchases), this study draws upon and extends the principal-agent perspective to identify and propose a set of four antecedents of perceived uncertainty in online buyer-seller relationships - perceived information asymmetry, fears of seller opportunism, information privacy concerns, and information security concerns - which are drawn from the agency problems of adverse selection (hidden information) and moral hazard (hidden action). To mitigate uncertainty in online exchange relationships, this study builds upon the principal - agent perspective to propose a set of four uncertainty mitigating factors - trust, website informativeness, product diagnosticity, and social presence - that facilitate online exchange relationships by overcoming the agency problems of hidden information and hidden action through the logic of signals and incentives. The proposed structural model is empirically tested with longitudinal data from 521 consumers for two products (prescription drugs and books) that differ on their level of purchase involvement. The results support our model, delineating the process by which buyers engage in online exchange relationships by mitigating uncertainty. Interestingly, the proposed model is validatedfor two distinct targets, a specific website and a class of websites. Implications for understanding and facilitating online exchange relationships for different types of purchases, mitt gating uncertainty perceptions, and extending the principal-agent perspective are discussed.

This article examines the effects of monitoring on interfirm relationships. Whereas some research suggests that monitoring can serve as a control mechanism that reduces exchange partner opportunism, there is also evidence showing that monitoring can actually promote such behavior. The authors propose that the actual effect of monitoring depends on (1) the form of monitoring used (output versus behavior) and (2) the context in which monitoring takes place. With regard to the form of monitoring, the results from a longitudinal field study of buyer-supplier relationships show that output monitoring decreases partner opportunism, as transaction cost and agency theory predict, whereas behavior monitoring, which is a more obtrusive form of control, increases partner opportunism. With regard to the context, the authors find that informal relationship elements in the form of microlevel social contracts serve as buffers that both enhance the effects of output monitoring and permit behavior monitoring to suppress opportunism in the first place.

Family business researchers are split on whether family managers in family firms are agents or stewards. If family managers behave as agents, family firms are expected to impose agency cost control mechanisms on them, and this will improve performance. The results based on a sample of small privately held family firms indicate that family managers are monitored and provided with incentive compensation. Those who do so obtain higher performance, thus suggesting the existence of agency behavior among family managers. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Agency theory highlights losses in productivity that may occur when the interests of owners and employees are imperfectly aligned. Pay for performance has been proposed as a solution to this problem. Using a real-effort laboratory experiment with salient incentives, we compared pay-for-performance and fixed-salary compensation. The former achieved significantly higher firm productivity through both sorting and incentive effects. In particular, more productive employees selected pay for performance, and employees on average, regardless of their preferred compensation scheme, produced more under it. However, more risk-averse individuals were less likely to select pay for performance and less responsive to its incentives. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

This field study investigated contextual antecedents of free riding by franchisees on franchisor brand reputation and effects of free riding on performance in a multinational corporation's franchising network. Structural elements (increased formalization, decentralized decision-making), interactions between franchisor representatives and franchisee dealers, and market-related factors (external competition) were associated with lower levels of franchisee free riding. The findings also indicated that free riding has deleterious effects on franchisee performance. The results support theoretical arguments that both economic and social exchange perspectives are valuable in examining free riding and provide important practical guidance in designing and managing franchise systems.

As outsourcing evolves into a competitive necessity, managers must increasingly contend with the decision about which software development projects to outsource. Although a variety of theories have been invoked to study the initial outsourcing decision, much of this work has relied in isolation on one theoretical perspective. Therefore, the relative importance ascribed by managers to the factors from these theories is poorly understood. The majority of this work also masks interesting insights into outsourcing decisions by focusing on the information technology (IT) function rather than individual projects as the unit of analysis, where many of these decisions occur. In contrast, prior research at the project level has focused on predicting development performance in the postoutsourcing-decision phases of projects. The objective of this study is to examine the relative importance that IT managers ascribe to various factors from three complementary theories - transaction cost economics, agency theory, and knowledge-based theory - as they simultaneously consider them in their project outsourcing decisions. A secondary objective is to assess the cross-cultural robustness (United States versus Japan in this study) of such models in predicting project-level IT outsourcing decisions. We develop and test a multitheoretic model using data on 1,008 project-level decisions collected from 33 Japanese and 55 U.S. managers. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the relative importance that managers ascribe to the factors from these three theories, their complementarities and occasional contradictions, and offer new insights into the differences among U.S. and Japanese IT managers. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed. (c) 2007 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Common prescriptions for improving the performance of supermarket retailers center on using key suppliers as "category captains" and leveraging their resources and capabilities to implement effective category management that will both reduce retailer costs and provide a basis for differentiation. However, despite these widespread prescriptions, the potential for supplier opportunism means that supermarket retailers are either skeptical or have failed to make such category management relationships with key suppliers work. Drawing on agency, transaction costs, and network theory, we synthesize insights from qualitative fieldwork with retailer and supplier managers and primary data from 73 category managers in U.K. supermarket retailers to empirically examine antecedents and consequences of category-level focal supplier opportunism. Our findings suggest that focal supplier opportunism decreases retailer category performance and increases militant behaviors among non-focal suppliers in the category supply chain. Consistent with retailer fears, we find that focal suppliers with significant influence in retailers' category management efforts are more likely to engage in opportunistic behavior. However, our results also reveal that retailer fears that being dependent on a focal supplier will lead to greater supplier opportunism are largely unfounded, while supplier dependence on the retailer is also unrelated to focal supplier opportunism. Finally, we find that retailers' ability to monitor - but not to punish - its focal suppliers is negatively related to opportunistic behavior among focal suppliers. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Recent scandals in the business world have intensified the demand for an explanation of the causes of corporate wrongdoing. This study empirically tests the effects of mutual fund management fees and control structures on the likelihood of illegal activity within mutual fund organizations. Specific attention is given to the presence of agency duality issues in the mutual fund industry and how this influences the motivations and decisions of fund managers. Findings provide support for the hypothesized relationship that higher levels of management fees decrease the likelihood of illegal behavior. Additionally, control of the mutual fund by external management is found to have a negative impact on the likelihood of illegal activity while also acting as a moderator of the management fee-illegal behavior relationship.

The emphasis here is on the microanalytic approach which has accumulated the most systematic evidence to support its theoretical propositions. In particular, this article emphasizes theoretical and empirical contributions from organizational economics (especially transaction costs and agency theories) for both vertical integration and (vertical) contracting. Limitations and methodological challenges concerning the empirical testing of theories of vertical integration are addressed and suggestions for further research are provided. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Research on the efficacy of stock-based compensation for outside directors has documented a weak or non-existent relationship with firm performance. Other variables also influence the relationships between these two constructs. Consistent with agency theory, we show, for a sample of 450 Standard & Poor 500 firms over the 1995-97 period that the use of director stock options and grants ratios was more strongly associated with positive performance in firms with (a) higher investment opportunities, and (b) weaker external monitoring. These findings have implications for compensation committees in the structuring of director compensation. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper presents a model for the governance of radical innovation (RI) efforts within the firm. A longitudinal study of 12 large established companies committed to develop and institutionalize a radical innovation capability are used to inform our work. Thus the firm, rather than the RI project, is the unit of analysis for this work. We draw on Agency Theory, Firm Level Governance, Stewardship Theory and Stakeholder Theory as well to enrich the model. We find that none of these theoretical frames adequately describes the issues faced by companies as they build governance systems to oversee high risk, high uncertainty innovation portfolios. A series of propositions is offered based on the data analysis and extant literature that address board composition, decision style and decision processes that, we believe, enhance a company's ability to generate and commercialize radical innovations.

The purpose of this study is to test cost management behavior of small restaurant firms and identify whether managers of these small restaurants behave differently depending on their management and ownership structure. The sample was comprised of 87 small restaurant firms identified from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances (SSBF). Cost of doing business, size of staff, and five performance measures were used as dependent variables. Independent variables included management and ownership type. Study findings identified significant differences in the profit margin depending on management type and ownership percentage of the primary owner. We also find that the cost of doing business (total expenses) varies depending upon single-family majority/minority ownership and the ownership percentage of the primary owner.

Corporate governance (CG) needs to acknowledge the intentional part of governance, where an actor of governance uses the set of corporate governance mechanisms in order to influence the agent to create a performance that will satisfy the interest of the principal. This paper offers a conception of this activity through the concept of governance strategy. The concept is based on a property right approach and derived within the context of agency theory, stressing the interest and the capacity of the principal. It is applied to two empirical organisations seldom investigated in CG research: the organisation of multinational corporations in a business group and the organisation of a riding school in a democratic not-for-profit association, thereby extending the relevance of the concept from corporate governance to organizational governance. The empirical analysis indicates the relevance of the conception and suggests further extension through hypotheses of governance strategy related to environmental influence, accessibility of governance mechanisms and momentum of mechanisms.

Agency Theory is normally used to explain the relationship between the managers of a corporation and its owners, or shareholders, and to legitimate the payment of share options, and other remuneration mechanisms, to those managers on the basis that this will align the interests of the managers of a corporation with those of its owners. The paper aims to argue that this outworn legitimation is not just based on a bankrupt theory but is actually deleterious to corporate performance, managerial behaviour and the relationship between managers, shareholders and other stakeholders. The approach is to examine the behaviour of the managers of The Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies ("Shell") as they have continued to reinterpret accounting regulations, reclassify oil reserves and re-report past and probable/possible future performance of the company. The argument is predicated in the assertion that in the relationship between owners and managers of such a corporation there are actually no principals and therefore there can be no agents. Furthermore, the rewards structure developed from the theory provides a motivation for managerial misrepresentation leading to a situation in which principles are defunct. The Social Contract between all stakeholders to a corporation has been reinvigorated as a basis for sustainable performance, with consequent implications for the behaviour of all parties to the contract. The paper illustrates that evidence abounds showing that corporations do not have any sense of social responsibility and do not feel constrained by any kind of ethical code, no matter what their corporate literature states, but that there are an increasing number of stakeholders to organisations who are demanding accountability - and forcing corporations to respond accordingly.

Governance theories typically envision a unidimensional continuum between markets and hierarchies, ignoring true hybrids that are market-like in some ways yet hierarchy-like in others. Our theory derives hybrids from cross-task synergies in a multi-task principal-agent model.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the connection between earnings management and corporate social responsibility (CSR). We argue that earnings management practices damage the collective interests of stakeholders; hence, managers who manipulate earnings can deal with stakeholder activism and vigilance by resorting to CSR practices. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a multi-national panel sample of 593 firms from 26 countries between 2002 and 2004, we find a positive impact of earnings management practices on CSR; this relationship holds for different robustness checks. Also, we demonstrate that the combination of earnings management and CSR has a negative impact on financial performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study draws on a generalized agency theory where managers are seen as the agents of all stakeholders and the earnings management literature to highlight that CSR can be used to garner support from stakeholders and, therefore, provides an opportunity for entrenchment to those managers that manipulate earnings. As such, it suggests new avenues of research for both the corporate governance literature, as well as for the stakeholder perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights for policy makers and managers interested in enhancing CSR. For managers, our findings suggest that projecting a socially-friendly image in order to disguise earnings management cannot be sustained over time due to the detrimental effect on financial performance. In addition, this study provides a warning signal to policy makers that certain practices geared toward raising a firm's CSR may simply be a mechanism for hindering other devious practices.

Using panel data on 275 German exchange-listed companies I examine the relationship between founding-family ownership and firm performance. By separating the family effect from general blockholder effects, the paper shows that family firms are not only more profitable than widely-held firms but also outperform companies with other types of blockholders. However, the performance of family businesses is only better in firms in which the founding-family is still active either on the executive or the supervisory board. These findings suggest that family ownership is related to superior firm performance only under certain conditions. If families are just large shareholders without board representation, the performance of their companies is not distinguishable from other firms. In addition, the results indicate that other blockholders either affect firm performance adversely or have no detectable influence on performance measures. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We use agency theory to examine the influence of ownership structure on the relationship between financial slack and R&D investments, highlighting how that relationship might differ depending on the identity of the owners, and their potentially different interests. In doing so, we extend the scope of agency theory by examining the principal-principal conflicts of interests that may exist among different types of owners. Using a sample of Korean manufacturing firms in R&D-intensive industries between 1998 and 2003, we find that financial slack has an inverted U-shaped relationship with R&D investments. Furthermore, that relationship varies depending on the presence of different types of owners. Family ownership positively moderates the relationship between financial slack and R&D investments, whereas domestic institutional investors and foreign investors negatively moderate that relationship. Our results show that distinguishing among different types of owners is instrumental in enhancing our understanding of the nature of the relationship between financial slack and R&D investments.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This is a cross-sectional study of the relation between corporate governance and voluntary disclosure in Ireland. Research Findings/Results: We report clear evidence that voluntary disclosure increases with the number of nonexecutive directors on the board. Firms that have a nonexecutive chairman make greater voluntary disclosures than other firms. This finding is not robust to the inclusion of other explanatory variables. We find no evidence that ownership structure is related to voluntary disclosure. Theoretical Implications: The results regarding nonexecutive directors are interpreted as independent boards facilitating a reduction in information asymmetry between owners and managers. While this supports the predictions of agency theory, the absence of evidence that ownership structure influences voluntary disclosure does not. It is posited that sociological and organizational factors (e.g., informal networking) that pervade the Irish market mitigate against our disclosure measure capturing all aspects of voluntary disclosure. Furthermore, indirect evidence is provided that there are other costs and benefits to disclosure that vary across firms and may outweigh agency costs in many situations. We conclude that while agency theory has some explanatory power for voluntary disclosure, it cannot explain all the cross-sectional differences in voluntary disclosure by Irish public limited companies. Practical Implications: The results support the attention paid by regulators to the proportion of nonexecutive directors on the board. However, the costs and benefits to disclosure vary across firms. Regardless of agency considerations and regulatory guidelines, firms will ultimately formulate their disclosure policy with reference to overall marginal costs and marginal benefits.

We contribute to multiple agency theory by examining cases in which ventures making initial public offerings (IPOs) have managerial agents on their boards whose goals conflict with those of the investment bank agents hired to underwrite the stock. Underwriters have an incentive to underprice IPOs to maintain strong ties with institutional investors. We develop theory on agent differences based on time horizons and risk taking by managerial agents as framed through behavioral agency theory. Examining governance mechanisms, we find both monitoring by board insiders and board experience decrease underpricing. Furthermore, underpricing increases when venture capitalists have prior ties with underwriters. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

The objective of this paper is to provide a more comprehensive view of corporate governance than that considered by the traditional agency literature predominately employed in auditing and accounting studies of governance. Specifically, we discuss three widely recognized additional theoretical perspectives: resource dependence, managerial hegemony, and institutional theory. Resource dependence is developed in the strategic management literature and focuses on the contribution of governance mechanisms as a vehicle to help a firm achieve or further its strategic objectives. In contrast with the agency and resource dependence perspectives which offer a functional view of governance, the managerial hegemony perspective views the board and its attendant committees as being under the control of management and hence could be potentially viewed as dysfunctional from a stakeholder viewpoint. Finally, institutional theory, developed in the sociology of organizations and organizational behavior literatures, suggests that it is necessary to understand the substance of the interactions between different governance parties and how these parties use at times symbolic gestures and activities to maintain their form to all relevant parties. Although the value of using multiple theoretical perspectives with respect to governance has been well recognized in the economics and behavioral literatures, this is the first paper that we are aware of that examines the effect of using alternative theories of governance on auditing issues that are influenced by the governance structure of a firm. In addition, we examine how these theories provide a useful basis for reconciling conflicting findings in the existing agency-based audit-related governance literature. Finally, we provide examples of how these alternative theories provide important new insights to issues in auditing research and practice.

We develop a conceptual model of the career horizon problem of CEOs approaching retirement and discuss its implications on firm risk taking, specifically in engagement in international acquisitions. Based on prospect theory and agency theory, we emphasize the legacy conservation and wealth preservation concerns of CEOs and investigate how their holdings of in-the-money unexercised options and firm equity accentuate or mitigate the career horizon problem. The model is tested in the context of international acquisitions with a sample of 293 U.S. firms over a five-year period (1995-1999). We find that a longer CEO career horizon is associated with a higher likelihood of international acquisitions. We also find that CEOs nearing retirement with high levels of in-the-money unexercised options and equity holdings are less likely to engage in international acquisitions than CEOs with low levels of in-the-money options and equity holdings. The study raises important considerations about the implications of CEOs ' equity and in-the-money option holdings on firm risk taking at various stages of their career horizon.

This study examines the role of business familiarity in determining how software development outsourcing projects are managed and priced to address risks. Increased business familiarity suggests both more prior knowledge, and hence reduced adverse selection risk, and increased implied trust about future behavior, and hence implied reduced moral hazard risk. Preferring high business familiarity partners may also alleviate concerns about incomplete contracts. By reducing these risks, higher business familiarity is hypothesized to be associated with higher priced projects, reduced penalties, and an increased tendency to contract on a time and materials rather than a fixed price basis. These hypotheses were examined with objective contractual legal data from contracts made by a leading international bank. Integrating trust theory into agency theory and into incomplete contract theory and examining unique contract data, the contribution of the study is to show that the premium on business familiarity and the trust it implies is not in directly affecting price, but, rather, in changing how the relationship is managed toward a tendency to sign time and materials contracts. Implications about integrating trust into agency theory and incomplete contract theory, as well as implications regarding trust premiums and software development outsourcing, are discussed.

Privatization research lacks an understanding of the scope and nature of informal service delivery relationships between nonprofits and local government. This article reports on a study of local service delivery partnerships in Georgia using survey and interview data. In addition to assessing the frequency of noncontractual partnerships, this study builds on B. Guy Peters's definition of public-private partnerships to delineate the control-formality dimensions of these partnerships more clearly. The agency theory notion that a trade-off occurs between formality and control is also tested. The findings show that most public-private partnerships involving nonprofits are led by government agencies, and they are only weakly collaborative in the sense of shared authority or resources. Often, community norms substitute for formal service agreements. The study concludes with suggestions for further research regarding trust and behavioral norms in public-private partnerships.

In a world that is flat, where all clients and providers can easily transact with one another, offshoring represents the proposition that information technology providers from low-wage nations can now underbid providers from high-wage nations and win contracts. We examined a particularly flat "world" - an online programming marketplace - and found that this profound tilt to low-wage nations is overstated. We analyzed the entire history of transactions at one of the major online programming marketplaces, a marketplace for outsourcing small IT projects. The data spanned 38 months and included over 263,000 bids by over 31,000 providers from 70 countries on over 20,000 small IT projects requested by over 7,900 clients from 59 countries. Contrary to the world-is-flat proposition, the data in this particular site show some client preference for domestic providers. However, the largest group of clients, the American clients, are a marked exception to clients in the rest of the world: they give relatively less preference to domestic providers. In a sense, the American clients have a higher preference for offshore providers. Among non-American clients the preference for domestic providers is mitigated when both client and provider are from an English-speaking nation. Relative bid price, onften very low already, also determines the winning bid, as does the ratio of purchasing power parity (PPP) between the country of the client and the country of the provider. Nonetheless, the strongest determinant of the winning bid is client loyalty: the client gives very strong preference to a provider with whom there has been a previous relationship, regardless of whether the provider is offshore or domestic.

An important feature of most franchise chains is that they simultaneously use franchised and company-owned outlets. In this study, I show that the relationship between the resources provided to outlet managers and the financial performance of franchise chains is contingent on their governance structure. Specifically, opportunism and knowledge considerations seem to prevent chains with a large proportion of franchised outlets from fully leveraging resources such as a valuable brand name and tacit business practices. On the other hand, brand name value and business practices tacitness are not directly related to the proportion of franchised outlets in chains. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Aftermarket sales and profits are becoming an increasingly important part of an original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) business model. Because replacement parts often do not require further manufacturing, OEMs act as intermediaries in the aftermarket. As with any intermediary, the OEM must concern itself with suppliers disintermediating its supply chain selling replacement parts directly to the OEM's customers. We frame supply chain disintermediation (SCD) as a principal-agent contracting problem between an OEM buyer and a supplier. Hypotheses relate contract conditions, goal incongruence, supplier capabilities and contract enforcement to SCD. The data are collected from the aerospace industry using a multimethod study, combining an Internet-based survey with archival data. Causal modeling with structural equation modeling (SEM) shows general support for the hypotheses. Particularly, SCD is positively related to buyer-supplier goal incongruence. The agency model offers insights that differ from previous transaction-cost-based models of buyer-supplier relationships. OEM buyers with a lucrative aftermarket should consider aligning goals through incentives rather than relying entirely on economic hostages associated with specific assets.

This paper deals with different organisational forms of collaborative procurement and provides insight into when to use which form. Different forms from the literature are compared with empirical examples to give an overview of forms, which are then described in terms of strategy, skills and organisation. Whilst acknowledging variations, the paper distinguishes between two main forms: virtual networks and third-party organisations. Using empirical data and four theoretical perspectives (transaction cost economics, resource-based view, contingency theory, agency theory), the paper reflects on when which form can be used and presents an overall framework to help choose an organisational form.

Achieving competitive advantage through a broader consideration of stakeholders of the firm is examined. The inclusion of other significant organisational actors such as managers and employees as stakeholders capable of creating competitive strategic advantage for the firm is considered. Findings indicate that competitive advantage within an economic perspective may be garnered by establishing a broader conceptualisation of stakeholders of the firm. It is concluded employees may be characterised as hybrid stakeholders, as they are a mix of residual risk bearers and input suppliers of strategically highly relevant resources and that ways of articulating employee voice is a key element of gaining competitive advantage. The aim of this paper is to analyse internationally operating modern public corporations from an agency theory point of view with the focus on the role of a suite of stakeholders including shareholders, managers and employees. The economic reasoning demonstrates that the employees' voice is an important component of business from a strategic perspective irrespective of the type of institutional environment present in any given country.

How should corporate directors determine what is the 'right' decision? For at least the past 30 years the debate has raged as to whether shareholder value should take precedence over corporate social responsibility when crucial decisions arise. Directors face pressure, not least from 'ethical' investors, to do the 'good' thing when they seek to make the 'right' choice. Corporate governance theory has tended to look to agency theory and the need of boards to curb excessive executive power to guide directors' decisions. While useful for those purposes, agency theory provides only limited guidance. Supplementing it with the alternatives - stakeholder theory and stewardship theory - tends to put directors in conflict with their legal obligations to work in the interests of shareholders. This paper seeks to reframe the discussion about corporate governance in terms of the ethical debate between consequential, teleological approaches to ethics and idealist, deontological ones, suggesting that directors are - for good reason - more inclined toward utilitarian judgments like those underpinning shareholder value. But the problems with shareholder value have become so great that a different framework is needed: strategic value, with an emphasis on long-term value creation judged from a decidedly utilitarian standpoint.

Agency theory has been the dominant framework for a theoretical conceptualization of corporate governance. According to this view, the governance problem of uncertainty about managerial behavior can be solved by assuming opportunistic behavior and setting up governance mechanisms to curtail opportunism. However, the adequacy of agency theory has recently been challenged because distrust-based governance mechanisms that are in line with the theory's recommendations have been ineffective to avoid managerial misconduct. Moreover, agency-based control and incentive systems have even been accused of being harmful. Stewardship theory has been proposed as an alternative approach. Building on a contrasting assumption about managerial behavior, this approach recommends trust-based governance designs that may, however, result in a one-sided and potentially disadvantageous system, too. On the basis of an in-depth analysis and critique of both theories this paper explores ways to either separate or combine the rival approaches. Due to shortcomings of these strategies a new perspective for the design of corporate governance systems is presented that opens the possibility of overcoming the theoretical tension.

Purpose - This paper aims to describe an application of key concepts in agency theory to organizational development. Specifically, it seeks to highlight that formal control systems, the ways to regulate employees' performance, are associated with an important factor for organizational development - the capacity for improvement. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a literature review on organizational development and agency theory, and an empirical examination of the relationships between bureaucratic control systems, task programmability and the organization's capacity for improvement. The hypotheses of interrelationships among different control systems, task programmability and the capacity for improvement were tested with a sample of 237 employees in the service industry. Findings - Results indicate that input control is a significant factor in determining an organization's capacity for improvement, and task programmability moderates the relation between a bureaucratic control and the organization's capacity for improvement. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on a cross-sectional self-report study. It is advisable to include managers' assessment of subordinates' capacity of improvement in further research. Originality/value - The effect of formal controls on organizational performance was controversial. This paper reveals the moderating role of task programmability in a control-performance relationship. In doing so, this paper sheds light on how a manager can enhance his/her subordinates' performance on organizational improvement through different control tactics.

Purpose - A strong and repeating theme in sales force automation (SFA) tool research is perceived usefulness. When salespeople perceived high levels of SFA tool usefulness, they report higher intent and actual use. The authors aim to apply agency theory to the concept of perceived usefulness (from the technology acceptance model) to explain why salespeople adopt some forms of SFA and reject still others. A set of hypotheses are proposed and tested revealing that salespeople will decide to use a SFA tool because they perceive it to be useful to themselves (i.e. PUsp) and to their management (PUsm). Design/methodology/approach - Based on responses from 105 salespeople, the SFA tools they used were categorized as either outcome-based (i.e. helping salespeople achieve their selling outcome goals) or activity-based tools (i.e. helping management monitor selling activities/behaviors). Regression analyses were used to test six hypotheses relating salespeople's usage of each category of tools (the dependent variable) to the salesperson perceived usefulness constructs (both PUsp and PUsm - the independent variables). Findings - The findings confirm that SFA tool use (either outcome-based or activity-based) is a function of both forms of perceived usefulness (i.e. PUsp and PUsm). Furthermore, when PU sp is high, the salesperson is more likely to use outcome-based (versus activity-based) SFA tools over a longer period of time. Practical implications - The paper validates agency theory as a useful paradigm for understanding salesperson SFA tool adoption. Salespeople will use SFA tools that they view as useful to their productivity and that the sales manager's influence over the salesperson's use of SFA tools may not be as important. To encourage use, firms need to emphasize how a SFA tool can meet salesperson needs. Originality/value - The paper is the first to hypothesize and test the relationship between perceptions of SFA tool usefulness and actual usage by considering salesperson perception of usefulness to themselves (PUsp) and perception of usefulness to their sales manager (PUsm).

Purpose - This paper aims to provide a comprehensive empirical assessment of major contemporary corporate hedging theories, i.e. financial theory, agency theory, stakeholder theory and new institutional economics. Design/methodology/approach - Hypotheses regarding the determinants of hedging are tested on a sample of 150 companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The panel covers a period of five years (2001-2005). Unlike in previous research the tests are organised around theories rather than individual hypotheses. In addition to classic tests, CART analysis is used to verify hypotheses. Findings - The results show low empirical verification of all theories considered. However, the results support some single hypotheses. Tests identified currency exposure, market-to-book value, IT and service sectors and size as being determinants of hedging. Research limitations/implications - The results provide evidence for the low usefulness of contemporary theories. New models are needed to explain hedging behaviour more accurately. Practical implications - The results identify characteristics shared by firms that use hedging. Companies considering implementing hedging can check whether they share these characteristics. Originality/value - This paper adds to risk management research by providing strong empirical evidence of theory verification status. It can serve as a base for future conceptual research.

Building on agency and prospect theory views, many researchers have analyzed the executive risk-taking behavior. They have usually put in evidence the role of the mechanisms of corporate governance. In this research, we try to point out that even managerial entrenchment does matter. We consider the non financial firms that are listed in the Tunisian Stock exchange during the 1996 - 2006 period. To reveal the managerial risk taking, we apply factor analysis so as to construct a global index. To find out the impact of managerial entrenchment on risk-taking, we consider the ownership of the manager, his experience within the firm as well as his age. The size of the firm is also worth investigating while exploring managerial risk taking. The results are somewhat robust to different specifications. They may enhance and extend the agency-based corporate governance literature on executive risk-taking. But above all, they may shed some light on the emerging markets context namely the Tunisian one.

Theory is fundamental to how we understand the empirical world, and cases present a wonderful opportunity to both learn from and challenge current theory. The author juxtaposes the specifics of the case of the Polish-based restaurant operator with current franchising theory to offer two propositions. The first, grounded in the dominant agency theory, suggests that franchising allows a company to expand without the expense of the personnel necessary to operate international units. The other, based on an emerging symbiosis perspective, proposes that franchisor and franchisee need each other to adapt an already successful operating system for the new home market. One possible reason that the Polish franchise failed may be based on inadequate autonomy allowed the Polish franchisee. (c) 2008 Cornell University.

Based on the work of Berle and Means (1932), Coase (1937), Arrow (1971), and others, agency theory emerged in the 1970s to explain economic relationships under conditions of uncertainty and less-than-perfect information. It has become a widely used theoretical lens in strategic management research, with applications intended to inform research about corporate governance (Finkelstein and D'Aveni, 1994; Walsh and Kosnik, 1993), CEO compensation (Barkema and Gomez-Mehia, 1998), firm performance (Brush, Bromiley, and Hendrickx, 2000; Li and Simerly, 1998), firm risk (Bloom and Milkovich, 1998; Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia, 1998); and strategic decisions such as diversification (Kochhar, 1996; Markides and Singh, 1997) and mergers (Holl and Kyriazis, 1997; Reuer and Miller, 1997).

Using takeover protection as an indicator of corporate governance, this study examines how an exogenous shift in power from shareholders to managers affects corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Two competing hypotheses are entertained. The shareholder view predicts that stronger takeover protection will lead to a decrease in corporate attention to shareholders and non-shareholding stakeholders alike, as managers divert resources from share-holders to the pursuit of their private interests. The stakeholder view, in contrast, predicts that stronger takeover protection will increase corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Because catering to non-shareholding stakeholders contributes to the long-term value of the firm, managers will be more likely to attend to those stakeholders when relieved from short-termism triggered by the threat of hostile takeovers. Using a sample of 878 U.S. firms from 1991 to 2002, the study finds that an exogenous increase in takeover protection leads to higher corporate attention to community and the natural environment, but has no impact on corporate attention to employees, minorities, and customers. Additional analyses show that firms that increase their attention to stakeholders experience an increase in long-term shareholder value. These findings provide additional evidence that relief from short-termism is a likely source of the increase in corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders following the increase in takeover protection.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: This paper extends the theory of bundles of corporate governance mechanisms to address agency issues within the Anglo-Saxon system of corporate governance. The focus of our study is to detail the role of firm performance as a key determinant of how the governance mechanisms of monitoring and incentive alignment serve as complements or substitutes in addressing agency issues. Previous research has looked at these mechanisms in isolation from each other, with limited regard for the contingencies of firm performance and external monitoring. We propose that it is best to look at these mechanisms as a bundle of mechanisms to protect shareholder interests, and that firm performance is a key determinant of the composition of this bundle. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce firm performance as a critical contingency that heightens shareholders' concerns over governance issues as they seek to retain control over adverse selection and moral hazard problems. We propose that when firms are performing poorly, outside monitoring by institutional investors can complement internal monitoring by boards of directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We examine governance bundles under both agency and stewardship theoretical lenses to tie together previous empirical research and advance theory. In specifying the role of firm performance in determining the mix of mechanisms within the governance bundle, we reconcile prior disparate findings as to whether or not these governance mechanisms act in a complementary or substitutable fashion. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The conceptualization of these governance mechanisms has practitioner merit in analyzing the challenges that board members face managing agency conflicts through the mix of governance mechanisms, given different levels of firm performance. Our research also shows that, under conditions of poor performance, shareholders can provide effective external monitoring that can improve the overall governance effectiveness of the firm.

There is considerable variation across countries in both the extent to which large publicly listed firms are family-owned and the dominance of such family-owned firms in stock markets. The literature presents competing theoretical viewpoints on what influences such country-level variation. On one hand, institutional economists suggest that institutional voids can have a strong influence. On the other hand, cultural sociologists suggest that a country's culture can have a strong influence. One type of institutional void is a lack of institutional norms and regulations needed for monitoring contracts (which can discourage owners from hiring professional agents for top management positions in their firms) and another type of institutional void is a lack of financial credit availability in the country. Cultural dimensions include collectivism (i.e. cohesion within in-groups/families) and power distance (i.e. inequalities in society). This country-level empirical study suggests that both national culture and institutional voids influence family ownership patterns around the world, and that institutional voids moderate the influence of national culture. National culture has a stronger influence when a country has institutional voids; however, the influence of national culture weakens when institutional voids are overcome. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Agency theory addresses problems created from the separation of principals and agents in modern corporations. Some agency theorists have investigated the exact relationship between control mechanisms (monitoring and bonding) and suggested that they work as substitutes. We posit that, although monitoring and bonding may be concurrent substitutes in a system of governance, monitoring intensity is positively related to bonding (i.e., compensation) so that over time, they are complements rather than substitutes. In particular, we suggest that increased monitoring intensity shifts risk to managers, who then require greater compensation to offset their increased employment and career risk. Accordingly, they reinforce each other in a negative cycle such that monitoring leads to increased pay, which in turn leads to increased monitoring due to complaints of excessive pay. The result is that in today's economic environment society often criticizes executive pay without realizing that, in part, higher compensation is an outcome of prior increased monitoring intensity. These findings are particularly important as elected officials are increasingly under pressure to monitor and limit executive compensation. An understanding of this relationship also has implications for executive risk taking and entrepreneurial activities.

Manuscript Type: Editorial Research Question/Issue: This essay identifies some key issues for the analysis of corporate governance based on the articles within this special review issue coupled with our own perspectives. Our aim in this issue is to distil some research streams in the field and identify opportunities for future research. Research Findings/Results: We summarize the eight papers included in this special issue and briefly highlight their main contributions to the literature which collectively deal with the role and impact of corporate boards, codes of corporate governance, and the globalization of corporate governance systems. In addition to the new insights offered by these reviews, we attempt to offer our own ideas on where future research needs to be targeted. Theoretical Implications: We highlight a number of research themes where future governance research may prove fruitful. This includes taking a more holistic approach to corporate governance issues and developing an inter-disciplinary perspective by building on agency theory while considering the rich new insights offered by complementary theories, such as behavioral theory, institutional theory and the resource-based views of the firm. In particular, future corporate governance research needs to be conducted in multiple countries, particularly in emerging economies, if we want to move closer to the journal's aim of producing a global theory of corporate governance. Practical Implications: Our analysis suggests that analytic and regulatory approaches to corporate governance issues should move from a "one-size-fits-all" template to taking into account organizational, institutional and national contexts.

In a broad sense, corporate governance is about how firms should be governed so that they are run effectively and efficiently. This paper takes a broad perspective on corporate governance mechanisms and considers possible synergies between corporate governance and international business (IB) research. We summarize the papers included in this Focused Issue, and draw out their main contributions to the literature. In so doing, we compare and contrast the four theoretical perspectives concerning corporate governance and IB adopted in the five papers: i.e. transaction cost economics, the resource-based view, agency theory, and institutional theory. Finally, we highlight five research themes (international diversification, business groups, entry modes, subsidiary mandates, and new international ownership structures) where future work explicitly addressing governance issues may prove fruitful.

Purpose The goal of this paper is to provide a broad foundation for future research in the area of strategic sourcing. Design/methodology/approach The foundation is derived by drawing from various wellestablished organizational theories. Specifically, strategic sourcing was viewed from the perspective of institutional theory, resource dependence theory, network theory, systems theory, resource/knowledgebased views of the firm, transaction cost economics, agency theory, strategic choice theory, sociocognitive theory, and critical theory. Findings By viewing strategic sourcing through the lens of ten organizational theories, this research provides multiple insights into many interrelated strategic sourcing questions, such as when to make, buy or ally, how many and which suppliers, and how to manage sourcing relationships. The paper offers a rich and diverse foundation to foster future theorybuilding activities in sourcing and supply management research. Originality/value While some of these theory bases have been utilized, to some degree, in the supply management research, the paper offers a more holistic perspective of theoretical insights for strategic sourcing. Each of these organizational theories could be utilized as a foundation for future studies. Further, the paper offers competing and/or complementary theory bases to enhance possible insights into many strategic sourcing questions such as when to make, buy or ally.

This article uses agency and stewardship theories to explain different motivations for contracted providers to properly use service monitoring tools. To examine different motivations for proper tool use, seven case studies were conducted on early childhood programs in three communities in Upstate New York. The case studies specifically focused on the reporting forms that the early childhood programs completed. Data sources included (1) interviews with government agency and contracted provider employees, (2) content analysis of key documents relating to the service monitoring tools, and (3) attendance at meetings between government agencies and contracted providers on the service monitoring tools. This article finds support for both agency and stewardship theories.

We use agency theory to predict the influence of related and unrelated product diversification on a firm's level of debt financing. Further, we argue that the link between diversification and capital structure is moderated by the environment in which firms operate. Using SAS PROC MIXED, we fit a mixed-effects model to our unique six-year longitudinal dataset (1995-2000) of 245 publicly listed Singapore firms. Our data spans the period of the Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998). We find that firms pursuing unrelated product diversification take on less debt financing in stable environments, but more debt financing in dynamic environments. Using longitudinal structural equation modeling, we find a reciprocal relationship between a firm's product diversification strategy and its debt financing level. (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Entrepreneurs with firm-specific human capital represent both a potential source of competitive advantage and a threat to appropriate the rents that are ultimately generated by a new venture. This situation presents interesting agency and resource dependence challenges. While potential investors in these ventures will want assurances that their interests are protected, they will also want to ensure that these key entrepreneurs remain with the organization. Using agency theory and resource dependence theory, we examine the types of governance mechanisms that are implemented in firms going through an initial public offering comparing those ventures which indicate a dependence on these critical entrepreneurs versus those that do not. Our analysis reveals that ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs are associated with higher insider and outsider ownership by the board, greater start-up experience by the board, greater use of contingent compensation, and greater use of involuntary departure agreements.

While both financial and behavioral theories suggest that cash holdings may be beneficial to R&D-intensive firms, agency theory would suggest that strong monitoring may be needed to ensure that cash holdings are not squandered. We contend that transaction cost economics provides a valuable lens for understanding the performance implications of cash holdings because not only does it explicate the benefits and costs of cash holdings in a single unified theoretical framework, but it further clarifies how environmental uncertainty critically moderates these relationships. Empirical tests on a large sample of US corporations yield strong support for our theory. (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Contracts are a ubiquitous part of the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Despite this, they are poorly understood by practitioners and academics. This paper empirically tests a conceptual model of the contract that seeks to improve our understanding of contracts. This model argues that the contract should be viewed as a managerial tool that provides the structure within which we accomplish the project tasks. The choice of the appropriate contract facilitates a process that allows the parties to achieve superior performance. The model views the contract as a multidimensional instrument that addresses three critical questions: (1) what is the structure of the organizational relationship between firms; (2) what is the disposition of risk and reward for involvement in the project; and (3) how will conflicts between firms be resolved? This paper empirically examines the first two dimensions. In order to address these distinct but intertwined questions, theories from Transaction Cost Economics and Agency Theory are brought to bear. The results of the study suggest that the conceptual model explains some of the variation in project performance, and therefore holds promise as a strategic management tool. (c) 2009 ASCE.

Prior research has located the issue of "professional" conduct with consultancy predominantly within the relationship between the manager and the consultant. However, recent studies provide indications that dealing professionally with consultancy may fail because of goal divergences between the individual managers and the organization. The first aim of this article is to re-examine this assumption theoretically, by drawing on agency theory, and empirically, by focusing on a single case study. Through this approach certain attitudes exhibited by managers are identified, which hinder dealing with consultancy in a professional manner across the entire organization. This observation motivates the second aim of the article: since the managers' attitudes deviate from the company's goals in dealings with consultancy, the adequacy of governance measures needs to be analyzed. Several researchers have observed that companies primarily use control-based measures, like central procurement rules or policies, to govern managers dealing with consultancy. However, these measures are not readily accepted by managers. In view of the above, this study investigates alternative measures, which are summarized as incentive-based measures.

Purpose - The primary purpose of this paper is to verify the importance of psychological ownership in the organisational context of a franchise by testing predicted relationships concerning feelings of ownership towards branding, legal ownership of complementary assets, organisational commitment, and a willingness on the part of franchisees to diffuse a franchise brand to peers. Design/methodology/approach - Evidence is presented from an empirical study on the largest taxi franchise fleet in Taiwan. Two formal questionnaires/surveys were conducted in May 2005 and September 2005, from which data were collected from 147 franchisees. Regression analysis is employed to test seven hypotheses. Findings - The empirical results demonstrate that analysing the psychological ownership of a franchise brand from two dimensions (i.e. the degree of psychological ownership and the self-centred propensity towards psychological ownership) sees an increase in explained variance in organisational commitment and brand diffusion in the context of the franchise organisation. It also illustrates that both dimensions of psychological ownership are negatively affected by the ownership of the non-brand-specified complementary assets owned by a franchisee. Research limitations/implications - The majority of previous research has investigated the phenomenon of franchising from the perspective of the agency theory or of resource scarcity; and has focused on the franchisor's concerns. A major implication of this study indicates that these perspectives, while essential, are insufficient in explaining the growth through franchising strategies. Researchers need to consider how to integrate asset ownership (or property rights) and affect elements in order to influence a franchisee's cognition and behaviour entrepreneurially. A limitation of this study is that it is conducted within the respective boundaries of cultural, professional, and industrial factors. Practical implications - This study indicates that entrepreneurs can achieve better brand diffusion effects for franchise growth if they engage in merging the structures of asset ownership and psychological ownership. Originality/value - This is the first paper to examine the psychological ownership of branding within the setting of a franchise organisation and highlights the importance of a sense of ownership in entrepreneurship.

Agency theory postulates that an organization needs to achieve a balance in its organizational architecture, to develop its activities and to attain its objectives effectively. The non-profit organizations have the same requirements in their internal organization, although measurement of their efficiency is a very complex task. This paper has a twofold objective: first, to evaluate the relationship between a balanced organizational architecture and the level of efficiency and, secondly, to show that the DEA methodology is an adequate tool for measuring the efficiency of non-profit organizations. We estimate this relationship with a sample of non-governmental organizations involved in the international cooperation sector (NGO). The information was collected by means of personal interviews in 2003. The results show that NGOs with a more balanced organizational architecture have higher levels of efficiency.

There exists a gap in the literature available in the area of supply chain management (SCM) studies, on providing theoretical support for explaining the existence and the domain of SCM. This study, explores eight SCM theories and views for SCM studies: resource-based view, transaction cost theory, knowledge-based view, strategic choice theory, agency theory, institutional theory, systems theory, and network perspective. The main objective of this paper is to provide a framework for the developments of SC theories, and elaborate the possible ways that these theories can be applied to the case of Business to Business (B2B) e-Marketplace (EM) enabled supply chain. The case of EM is selected as one of the most recent collaborative tools in SCM studies and describes how the current SCM theories can be employed. (c) Common Ground.

In the 1990s, the role of the chief executive officer (CEO) of major United States corporations underwent a profound transformation in which CEOs went from being bureaucrats or technocrats to shareholder partisans who acted more like proprietors or entrepreneurs. This transformation occurred in response to changes in the competitive environment of U.S. corporations and also to the agency theory argument that high levels of compensation by means of stock options helped to overcome the agency problem inherent in the separation of ownership and control. Some critics charge that this new CEO role is objectionable for a variety of reasons, which may also be applicable to the current financial crisis in which CEO misconduct may have played a part. These objections are based largely on a team production model of corporate governance, which is held by these critics to be superior to the standard agent-principal model. This article examines the objections offered by critics of the changed role of the CEO and argues that their negative assessment of this development and their use of the team production model to support their conclusions are not warranted. CEOs have changed from hired hands to co-owners, and this change may have contributed in some measure to the current financial crisis. However, in determining the morally preferable role of the CEO, care must be taken not to discard what is sound in the changed role. (c) 2009 Business Ethics Quarterly 19:4 (October 2009).

How do export producers and intermediaries structure their dyadic relationships? This study examines the factors that guide the behaviour and relationships between export producer and intermediary dyads. We examine both sides of a dyadic transaction and develop an export producer-intermediary behaviour typology by using a grounded theory method through qualitative interviews. We propose three forms of export producer-intermediary dyads based on the degree of information sharing, intensity of price negotiation, level of transaction costs, and partner satisfaction and propensity to export directly. These three forms are as follows: (1) competitive, (2) cooperative and (3) mismatched relationships. Copyright (c) 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This work focuses on analyzing the economic factors that influence the consumer's distribution channel choice. With this aim, we use the Agency Theory in order to understand the influence of related problems such as information asymmetries and opportunism. All of this is taken into account to examine the booking process of a particular tourism service: a hotel overnight. The analysis of a sample of 1,029 tourists who had made their booking either through Internet or through traditional channels has revealed interesting findings: (1) the main sources of uncertainty in the phases prior to the purchase choice are determined by the lack of trust towards the Internet, (2) signals emitted by firms to mitigate information asymmetries contribute to build trust towards the company chosen, and (3) trust towards selected firms shows how the buyer makes the reservation through the channel with the lowest perceived risk.

A good understanding of the nature of the firm is essential in developing corporate strategies, building corporate competitiveness, and establishing sound economic policy. Several theories have emerged on the nature of the firm: the neo-classical theory of the firm, the principal agency theory, the transaction cost theory, the property rights theory, the resource-based theory and the evolutionary theory. Each of these theories identify some elements that describe the nature of the firm, but no single theory is comprehensive enough to include all elements of the nature of the firm. Economists began to seek a theory capable of describing the nature of the firm within a single, all-encompassing, coherent framework. We propose a unified theory of the firm, which encompasses all elements of the firm. We then evaluate performances of Korean firms from the unified theory of the firm perspective. Empirical evidences are promising in support of the integrative theory of the firm. (c) 2009 Institute of East and West Studies.

This paper examines the relationship between corporate governance characteristics and corporate financial distress. There are two main theoretical factors of interest: the structure of the monitoring process, and the personal characteristics of non-executive directors (NEDs). The first approach is basically agency-theory oriented, and emphasises relationships that complicate proper control, such as dependents on the board (Jensen, 1993). The second approach refers to the resource dependency theory, which focuses on the quality of the director(s) involved (Hillman and Dalziel (2003). The relevant relationships are tested on a newly built database consisting of 52 listed companies in the Netherlands that became financially distressed in the period from 1993 to 2003 and a control sample of 167 listed companies. We collected data on NEDs such as age, education, dependency, other board positions (and chairmanships), workload, and the number of executive and non-executive board members. A positive relationship with financial distress was found to exist if the average workload of NEDs on the board was high, or if there was a foreigner on the board. If one of the NEDs has inside knowledge, this is negatively related to financial distress. As a final conclusion, the hypothesis originating in resource dependency theory, which is that the human characteristics of NEDs are important in avoiding financial distress, cannot be rejected with regard to the Netherlands as examined in the period from 1993 to 2003.

The aim of the paper is to set the agency problem into a broad context of New Institutional Economics with an emphasis on historical connections. In the first section, I explain the historical evolution of basic theoretical concepts like the theory of firm, the theory of market process and the theory of property rights. The second section is dedicated to the explanation of the general concept of agency problem extended with the problem of asymmetric information leading to adverse selection and the problem of moral hazard, in context of previous historical connections. In the last section, the author provides some suggestions for the further theoretical and empirical research. (c) Vysoka Skola Ekonomicka V Praze.

As a consequence of the paradigm shift from an industrial society to an information society, the role of the entrepreneur ought to change from being an inventor of product/services to become a value creator. Hence, the focus of entrepreneurial ventures should be shifting towards creating viable business models rather than superior product/services. One major implication of the shift of entrepreneurial endeavour from product/services towards creating new business models is that hands on investors behind companies' have to be involved closer to the inception of new ventures in order to contribute to their portfolio companies.

Should a landlord adopt a wage labor, a crop sharing or a fixed-payment land rental contract with a particular tenant? The emergence of the agency theory to the contract choice in the 1970s and 1980s has generated a substantial body of theoretical and empirical research on why and under what conditions each contract is chosen. This paper reviews the literature on the contractual arrangements in agriculture, focusing on the principal-agent theory. After reviewing the agency theory we provide a synthesis and integration of the main contributions to contract choice in agriculture, highlighting current controversies over results. We find this theory provides a coherent and useful framework to answer sharecropping questions, but we also observe that there is weak empirical support for many of the central tenets of agency theory that need to be addressed. Finally, we discuss the implications of these issues and outlining directions for future theoretical and empirical work.

The implementation of teamwork has been growing steadily in the last decade. Companies suppose that the use of teams improves their performance and supports the achievement of their strategic goals. The high relevance of teams in the business world is reflected by an increasing literature on teamwork, team success and the management of teams. One central question concerning the management of teams is the design of pay systems, especially of performance-based pay systems for teams. This aspect has not yet been fully explored in the literature with regard to the agency problems that are associated with managing teams and teamwork. This paper aims to close that gap by exploring how performance-based pay systems for teams should be designed from an expanded agency theory perspective with regard to possibly arising agency problems.

We draw from legal theory to offer a fundamental rethinking of agency theory along three key dimensions: redefining the principal from shareholders to the corporation, redefining the status of the board from shareholders' agents to autonomous fiduciaries, and redefining the role of the board from monitors to mediating hierarcha. These dimensions contrast with classic agency theory, offering novel conceptions that can inform further theorization and empirical research in corporate governance. (c)Academy of Management Review.

Purpose: In view of a lack of understanding of the consequences of performance-based contracting (PBC), this paper aims to reveal deeper insights into the mechanisms inherent to PBC and explore which benefits and uncertainties may result for providers and customers. Design/methodology/approach: Conducting a comprehensive literature review and drawing on insights from agency theory as a framework, the auhtors analyzed a broad range of academic publications on the benefits and uncertainties of PBC and developed testable propositions from the provider's and the customer's perspective. Findings: With PBC, in comparison to the conventional selling and supporting of machinery or equipment, the manufacturers are more likely to acquire customers for highly innovative technologies, to increase their profit, and to improve customer loyalty. Manufacturers, however, have to deal with uncertain revenues and costs which affect their profit. The customers are more likely to receive increased performance at decreased costs. Concerning the performance, however, the customers enter into an uncertain relationship of dependence. Originality/value: This is the first paper to analyze the benefits and uncertainties of PBC in manufacturing industries systematically from an agency theory perspective. The paper further develops extant research by outlining the mechanisms of PBC and relating the benefits and uncertainties that are scattered over a broad body of literature. The paper proposes several promising avenues for further research. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: This study examines the influence of firms' ownership structure on corporate reputation. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a panel of firms in Spain for 2000-2007, we found that ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholder erodes corporate reputation, whereas contestability of the main shareholder's power enhances it. Insider ownership shows a non-linear relationship with corporate reputation, with lower corporate reputation at low and very high levels of insider ownership. Finally, if the largest shareholder is either a pressure-resistant or a pressure-sensitive institutional investor, as opposed to other types of largest shareholder, corporate reputation is lower. This last finding markedly differentiates our sample of firms in Spain, a civil law country, from firms in common law countries such as the US and the UK, where studies have found a positive relationship between institutional investors and corporate reputation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Drawing on signaling and agency theories, our paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to analyze the influence of ownership structure on corporate reputation in civil law countries. Practitioners/Policy Implications: This study suggests that managers and directors should recognize how each characteristic of ownership structure influences the expectations of stakeholders. Low levels of ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholders, low differences in ownership concentration between first and second largest shareholders, and moderate levels of insider ownership are positive signals that should be communicated to foster corporate reputation. High levels of ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholders or high differences in ownership concentration between first and second largest shareholders impair corporate reputation and should be compensated by introducing corporate governance mechanisms that favor corporate reputation, such as increasing the number of independent directors or avoiding CEO duality.

Opportunism, or self-interest seeking with guile, is often witnessed in human behavior, and it bedevils human interactions and relationships. Organizations expend considerable effort to reduce opportunism. Agency theory espouses formal contracts as effective constraints on opportunism; however, a consultant's use of tacit knowledge subjects clients to information asymmetry that is not amenable to formal contracts. The principal-professional lens was developed to accommodate the presence of tacit knowledge, but it ignores formal contracts and, like agency theory, ignores the existence of principal opportunism. This examination of information systems (IS) consulting notes that when information asymmetry is present, both clients and consultants sometimes behave opportunistically. The level of information asymmetry, the type of knowledge, and the level of contract specificity in an IS consulting engagement determine the mixture of legal and social constraints that are efficacious. Based on these revelations and the inadequacy of other theories, a theoretical model of relationship constraints is developed to explain the interplay between signaling and screening, knowledge type, contract specificity, and the levels of information asymmetry in predicting adopted constraint mechanisms. For researchers, this new model offers a lens to study opportunism from a knowledge-based perspective, whereas for practitioners it offers the possibility of forestalling a decline in markets due to rampant opportunism.

In this article, we examine the evolution of multi-unit franchising (MUF) research and develop an integrative model for the franchisor's choice of ownership strategy between single-unit and multi-unit franchising. Although several empirical studies were published on MUF in the last two decades, the research deficit primarily results from the lack of theoretical foundation of this ownership strategy. We extend the literature in the following way: First, based on the transaction cost view of governance mechanism, we examine the influence of environmental uncertainty on the choice of ownership strategy. Second, we develop hypotheses based on the resource-based and organizational capabilities view. Third, we investigate the influence of contractibility of resources and organizational capabilities on the choice of ownership strategy. Finally, we apply the screening theory and argue that specific investments of MUF have an ex-post bonding function, based on transaction cost reasoning, and an ex ante screening function.

This study examines if the CEO duality influences firm performance in Bangladesh. It also examines the interaction of industries in influencing the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. From an observation of 825 firm years the study uses a 2-stage least square regression (2SLS) analysis. The finding is that there is a negative (non-significant) relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. However, when the industry interaction terms (the role of industries as moderating variable) are added, the CEO duality and firm performance is found to vary across industries. The findings of this study suggest that the CEO duality and firm performance is contingent; no single leadership structure is universal; both the leadership structure has cost and benefits. It is beneficial in some situation supporting the stewardship theory while it is not in other situations supporting the agency theory. This study contributes to the literature on CEO duality and firm performance in the context of developing countries.

While much has been written on specificity (e.g., in texts on new institutional economics, agency theory, and team production theory), there are still some insights to be learnt by business ethicists. This article approaches the issue from the perspective of team production, and will propose a new form of corporate governance: enlightened corporate governance, which takes into consideration the specific investments of employees. The article argues that, in addition to shareholders, employees also bear a residual risk which arises due to their specific investments. This residual risk presents a valid and legitimate basis for residual claims. In this way, employees can be seen as residual claimants due to the fact that their income depends upon a hazardous quasi rent. Therefore, this article will call on the fiduciary duty of board members to protect those employees who are exposed to such residual risks and may thus be vulnerable as a result. This leads to a fundamental change of perspective on the "theory of the firm" - a change which will adopt the theories of new institutional economics, agency theory, and team production theory in order to promote business ethics research. Against this background, enlightened corporate governance aims to follow the criterion of specific investments as a legitimate basis for residual claims. Furthermore, it seeks to understand the consequences for board members, and to promote the sharing of control and ownership. The article will close with some discussion of the implications and future prospects for business ethics. (c) Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

We develop a theory of advertising agency compensation, client evaluation and switching costs, with extensions to agency theory. When clients are exposed to high switching costs, they become more vulnerable to the risk of agency costs. In response, clients can select compensation and evaluation decisions that convey fairness, signal their commitment, and invite agency reciprocity. With high switching costs, outcome-based compensation and formal evaluation procedures are likely. High switching costs are associated with signifi'cant relationship investments, mature relationships, large clients, formal evaluation, and with clients that use their agencies as strategic partners. Clients surveyed in North America support the theory. (c) 2010 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

We study how interorganizational systems (IOS) such as electronic markets and other enabling information technologies that facilitate broader interfirm transactions affect the extent of outsourcing in firms. We do so by modeling firms in a three-tier value chain consisting of buyers, intermediaries, and suppliers, who can interact using IOS that lower the procurement search costs associated with finding appropriate trading partners. In the context of complex business-to-business (B2B) search, we study how decreasing search costs affect a firm's decision to insource or outsource the procurement function, depending on whether the search process is information intensive or communication intensive. Variation in search costs changes the transaction costs of interaction between firms, as well as the contracting costs associated with outsourcing, owing to changes in the costs of moral hazard for delegated search. We study these effects in a new model that integrates search theory into the principal-agent framework, and establish that the optimal outsourcing contract has a simple "all or nothing" performance-based structure under fairly general assumptions. Our model predicts that when B2B search is information intensive, IOS will facilitate an increase in outsourcing, market-based transactions, and a reduction in the vertical scope of extended enterprises. In contrast, when B2B search is primarily communication intensive, IOS will lead to tighter integration and an increase in the vertical scope of the extended enterprise. Our research suggests that the nature of the information technologies and of the business activities supported by IOS are crucial determinants of the organizational and industry changes they induce, and our results have important implications for a variety of industries in which both technological and agency issues will influence the eventual success of global IT-facilitated extended enterprise initiatives.

Many works have analyzed franchising and identified the major research lines regarding the scientific works published until that moment (Elango and Fried, 1997; Diez de Castro and Rondan, 2004). The present paper tries to follow this process. Moreover, it is identified the theories used by researchers to study franchising -agency theory, resource scarcity theory, risk extension theory, contractual theory, transaction cost theory, as well as signaling theory-, and explained its contributions to the literature. Subsequently, four research lines are highlighted in conjunction with main literature about the topic, and emphasized those studies developed by Spanish researchers under the form of papers, conference proceedings, books, book's chapters, as well as dissertations. In doing so, we attempt to offer a whole vision about franchising literature from the 60s up to date.

Theory and practice of technology transfer and entrepreneurial behaviour of academics are novel. We draw upon the literature of business models, transaction costs, professional and organisational culture and of agency theory to formulate a framework for a technology transfer business model. We present the range of options used by universities and we examine the spin out option, as context and contrast to the MUAS approach. The case of the MUAS is presented. It illustrates the conceptual framework developed and has thus far been successful in its specific environment. Replication might require adaptation, but this particular approach can offer useful lessons. Tentative hypotheses for research on business model adaptation are derived from the study.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the influence of corporate governance and internationalization on research and development (R&D) investments in USbased international firms. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws from agency theory to examine the influence of corporate governance mechanisms and internationalization on R&D intensity by the use of longitudinal data from 1991, 1994, 1997, and 2000 in a sample of large, manufacturing US firms with international operations. Findings - The paper finds that CEO total compensation is positively associated with R&D intensity, whereas equity voting power, insider ownership, and duality are negatively associated. Research limitations/implications - The findings regarding insider ownership confirms agency theory, in that agents will tend to make decisions to maximize their own utility and thus would be expected to reject R&D investments. In terms of duality, the augmented discretion that CEOs assume when they also hold the chairmanship position may reduce the monitoring function of the board, making it easier for the CEO to avoid engaging in shortterm risky ventures. Additionally, CEOs are likely to demand larger salaries when faced with risky decisions because their employment stability and reputation are at stake. Practical implications - Boards concerned with firm innovation should focus their decisions on CEO salaries on total compensation rather than on shortterm performance. Total compensation may motivate CEOs to commit to R&D investments that lead to innovations despite the risk of failure and detrimental impact on shortterm profits. Firms should be cautious in granting ownership to board members. Although ownership often stimulates commitment to strategic decisions, overinvolvement of board insiders may result in risk aversion, leading to decreases in R&D efforts. Originality/value - This paper extends the literature by integrating agency theory and organization learning in a comprehensive framework, showing that governance and internationalization play a significant role in firm R&D intensity.

Efficient information management is of high relevance for the success of young and entrepreneurial service companies. These ventures face a high level of uncertainty due to their lack of knowledge about market development, customer acceptance and customer behaviour. In consequence, one of the main marketing challenges is to deal with and thus lower uncertainties perceived by service entrepreneurs and their customers. Following the information economics approach, we argue that efficient information management can be theoretically framed as an essential ingredient to entrepreneurial marketing. A qualitative empirical study is used to verify the findings and to gain deeper insights into the marketing information management of young and entrepreneurial service ventures.

This paper considers the role of opportunism in three contractual theories of the firm: rent-seeking theory, property rights theory, and agency theory. In each case I examine whether it is possible to have a functioning contractual theory of the firm without recourse to opportunism. Without opportunism firms may still exist as a result of issues arising from (incomplete) contracting. Far from posing a problem for the theory of the firm, questioning the role of opportunism and the ubiquity of the hold-up problem helps us understand more about the purpose and functions of contracts which go beyond mere incentive alignment.(c)2010 Mohr Siebeck.

The emergence of an understanding of labour as the basis of value is traced from ancient Greek authors to classical political economy and Karl Marx, and the subsequent eclipse of the theory in neoclassical economics is then charted. While the ancient Greeks did not have a concept of labour as a measure of value, in Scholastic authors the notion was fixed that labour and cost of production determine value. Labour assumed a central role in Adam Smith, but it was with David Ricardo that a fully blown labour theory of value was achieved. Marx gave the concept its philosophical dimension, tying it to a critique of classical political economy. The labour theory of value came under attack in neoclassical formulations which in the end effected the analytical disappearance of labour in several ways. Labour became just another factor of production, with marginal productivity regulating its price. Then factors of production and final goods became analytically equivalent as sources of subjective utility, especially in the context of general equilibrium theory. In disutility models of labour supply, labour was substituted by its absence, 'leisure'. Finally, attempts were made to explain the employment relationship as an application of agency theory, moving away from the pure commodity model of labour. Nevertheless, all these theories failed to account for what became the Achilles' heel of neoclassicism - namely the indeterminacy of the labour contract.

While the process of pursuing an initial public offering (IPO) provides new capital with which new ventures might pursue significant opportunities, research suggests that many IPO firms decrease in value subsequent to the new offering. Using an agency perspective, we argue that the IPO process itself may not only raise direct governance costs (due to increased monitoring and bonding), but may also create a distraction for managers who need to remain focused on the strategy to effectively use a large infusion of capital from the IPO. Likewise, we argue that governance participants, especially board members, will be distracted by the work necessary to take the firm public and, as such, may not be focused on the strategic monitoring necessary for continued firm's viability. This lack of monitoring may also allow managerial opportunism to be more prevalent, especially given the large amount of capital available to managers once the IPO is completed. Accordingly, we argue that excessive governance costs (both direct and indirect) may be associated with the IPO process and subsequent IPO firm performance.

This article has two main aims. One is to reconcile Berle and Means' conclusions in 1932 about management control in large US corporations with the earlier views of Thorstein Veblen, who from much the same starting point reached a seemingly contrary position. The explanation offered in terms of changes in financial control puts many subsequent developments in a different light. The other aim, drawing on the views of Paul Samuelson about product market competition, is to question the precise contribution of the 'financialization of corporate strategy' to the institution of 'the era of shareholder value'.

This paper provides a foundation for future marketing research on sustainability through the application of nine prominent organizational theories. Specifically, we consider the implications for sustainability offered by transaction cost economics, agency theory, institutional theory, population ecology, resource dependence theory, the resource-based view of the firm, upper echelons theory, social network theory, and signaling theory. We consider how each theory can help researchers to better understand the ways that firms engage in sustainable marketing and business practices, and we develop insights that emerge from simultaneous examination of complementary or competing theoretical perspectives.

This paper argues for a greater focus on an agency theory (AT) perspective in understanding corporate governance in multinational enterprises (MNEs) since, despite recent developments, the traditional internalization theory approach limits our understanding of the behaviour of these firms. We analyse the contribution of an AT perspective to understanding various aspects of corporate governance in MNEs: internationalization, international joint ventures (IJVs), headquarters-subsidiary relationships, and new forms of global business groups. From this analysis, we suggest that even with the emerging AT literature's focus on the role of ownership as a key governance factor, there is substantial need for research on several key corporate governance mechanisms; namely, the role and nature of dominant owners, the composition of boards of directors, the separation of CEOs and board chairs, executive remuneration, and the role of the market for corporate control. There is scope to examine further the implications of different institutional environments for AT perspectives on the behaviour of MNEs. (c) 2010 The Authors.

Purpose: This paper aims to construct a comprehensive theoretical framework for interpreting voluntary IC disclosure practices by organizations. Design/methodology/approach: Four most-commonly used theories in the area, namely agency theory, stakeholder theory, signalling theory, and legitimacy theory, were integrated in terms of the interrelated concepts relating to voluntary IC disclosure. Findings: The constructed theoretical framework includes three concepts: to reduce information asymmetry; to discharge accountability to various stakeholders; and to signal organizational legitimacy and excellence (or superior quality) to society, which are seen as motivations for organizations to disclose their IC on a voluntary basis. Research limitations/implications: The framework ignores some other theoretical perspectives which are also relevant to voluntary IC disclosure; the framework is not justified by any empirical evidence. Originality/value: This research is the first attempt to construct a comprehensive theoretical framework for the voluntary disclosure of IC; the constructed framework can be employed as a theoretical foundation for future empirical studies in relation to voluntary IC disclosure.

Little research has examined the performance implications of the parent-child relationship post spin-off. Although the parent provided oversight of the child prior to the spin-off, effects of post spin-off links to the child remain unclear. Applying transaction cost and agency theories, our study of 142 firms spun-off between 1986 and 1997 examines how oversight and ownership by the parent firm influence stock market performance post spin-off. We find that while child firms benefit from some links to the parent, having too many links is negatively related to performance. The findings suggest that there is a balance between having too much parental involvement and not enough. Our study extends understanding of post spin-off child firm performance and provides valuable insights for both parent and child firms. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study uses organizational theory to explore why nonprofit organizations conduct evaluations and how they use evaluation information. According to rational choice theory, managers of nonprofit organizations will conduct evaluations to make sure they are making good decisions about how to improve their services and achieve their goals. Yet, according to data gathered about the experiences of 31 nonprofit organizations, this assumption about the evaluation practices of nonprofits rarely holds true. Rather, other organizational theories, such as agency theory, institutional theory, resource dependence theory, and stewardship theory, which make different assumptions about how organizations operate and how managers behave, provide a more accurate description of why nonprofits engage in evaluation and how they use evaluation information. The findings from this study are important because they help to identify strategies that would encourage nonprofit organizations to use evaluation in more productive and meaningful ways.

The broad range of activities undertaken in a hotel, combined with its high labour intensity and volatile demand, signify a predisposition particularly suited to outsourcing. In this paper, transaction cost economics (TCE) theory, agency theory and the broader outsourcing literature are drawn upon to inform the distillation of 20 outsourcing/insourcing motives. The relative significance of these motives is examined using interview and survey data. While broad support is provided for the TCE model, it is apparent that the model does not constitute a robust framework with the capacity to comprehensively account for outsourcing behaviour.

Offshore outsourcing of administrative and technical services has become a mainstream business practice. Increasing commoditization of business services and growing client experience with outsourcing have created a range of competitive service delivery options for client firms. Yet, data from the Offshoring Research Network (ORN) suggests that, despite increasing market options and growing client expectations related to service quality and cost efficiency, clients typically renew provider contracts and develop longer-term relationships with providers. Based on ORN data, this paper explores drivers of this phenomenon. The findings suggest that providers promote contract renewal by making client specific investments in software, IT infrastructure and training, and by involving clients in outsourcing operations, thereby increasing relation specific joint equity and creating opportunities for client monitoring and control. Interestingly, these strategies apply to routine rather than knowledge-intensive tasks, and are more likely to be applied by large rather than small providers. Surprisingly, high degree of contract specification makes contract renewal less likely. The paper contributes to the growing literature on strategic outsourcing of business services and the importance of governance mechanisms addressing "hidden costs" as well as "hidden benefits" of offshore outsourcing relationships.

Application service providers (ASP), who host and maintain information technology (IT) applications across the Internet, emerged as an innovation in the way IT services are delivered to client firms. In spite of many potential benefits of this model, ASPs experienced business failure and high rates of exit. Drawing on agency theory, we argue that the efficiency of contracting arrangements between ASPs and client organizations is an important determinant of ASP survival. We test this prediction using a unique data set combining multiple sources that allows us to track an ASP from the year of founding through the beginning of 2006. Contractual misalignment, or adopting contracts mismatched with the underlying agency costs, significantly lowers the probability of survival of service providers in the ASP marketplace. The impact of misalignment is particularly severe when coupled with adjustment costs that impede the transition to aligned contracts. To account for potential heterogeneity in ASPs' knowledge of contracting, we test for endogenous self-selection of ASPs in the relationship between contractual misalignment and survival. Our results are robust to a variety of model specifications as well as alternate explanations of survival from multiple theoretical domains. (c) 2011 INFORMS.

Successive layers of supervisor-subordinate relationships in organizations often distort information, increase monitoring costs, and lead to a cumulative loss of control. This paper discusses how some organizations can reduce their internal hierarchy by slicing it into two components and substituting the supervisor-subordinate relationship with an independent contract. This substitution allows the organization to shift its lower-level hierarchy to the contractors. These contractors are less likely to indulge in moral hazard, which can further reduce the size of hierarchy required. The paper examines this theory in the domain of multi-unit franchising and tests the hypotheses with a longitudinal data set. (c) 2011 New York University.

This work shows how tenets of agency theory can be linked with institutional analysis to improve their explanatory power in the context of an emerging country such as Brazil. This study assessed the authors' propositions in a single-case analysis of a Brazilian multiple family firm. The results show that in the initial phase, characterized by less severe agency problems, the firm's competitive advantage matured, supported by the strong presence of trust derived from an extended family structure. As the company grew in complexity, the informal monitoring mechanisms that characterize collectivist societies allowed agency problems to escalate. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

This paper examines the performance effects of family ownership and influence on board structure and its composition in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO) in the North African region. Using a unique and comprehensive hand-collected sample of 63 locally listed IPO firm's from across North Africa we find considerable evidence of a sizeable differential between family and non-family controlled firms. I find considerable evidence supporting increased participation of family members at board level while contrastingly the wider dispersion of family ownership facilitates monitoring and surveillance and mitigates underpricing. Equally in line with the extended network and relationships involved in family firms business angels provide the optimal form of governance in contrast to the more formal private equity and venture capital industry.

Although discretion among employees at organizations' lower levels seems to be increasing, it is uncertain whether this is a desirable HRM policy. To understand this issue better, this study tests competing organization theory predictions about the performance consequences of middle managers' perceived discretion. Discretion is defined as the freedom of action or decision authority available in managing subordinates. Survey data from a multinational, European sample of research and development (R&D) units were used to assess the effect of managers' perceived discretion on unit performance. The results show that a combination of ecology theory and strategic choice theory best predicts the relationship between discretion and unit performance. Greater perceived managerial discretion was linked to increased unit performance in a relationship moderated by managerial experience and limited by unit size. These findings have implications for HRM theory and practice, particularly regarding policies related to empowerment and leadership development. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study attempts to highlight the paradoxical aspects of top management power contests within customer firms that outsource information technology (IT) work. Intraorganizational power theory forms the overarching theoretical basis for this study. The focus is on the antecedents and consequences of the relative power of business executives (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer) versus IT executives (Chief Information Officer, Head of IT) in the governance of IT outsourcing. Evidence from a field survey supports the existence of a paradox. When a firms financial performance has been poor and the firm did not have a sizeable IT workforce, the business executives give themselves greater power and sideline the IT executives. Paradoxically, rather than leading to positive consequences, such power play weakens outsourcing performance. Outsourcing performance is best when power is solely with the IT executives group, a close second best when power is divided between the two groups (joint decision making), and worst when it is solely with the business executives group. Overall, when it comes to the outsourcing of IT work, business executives might find reasons to justify increasing their own power and reducing the power of IT executives, even though this can ultimately be detrimental to outsourcing performance. These findings lend credence to case studies and practitioner articles that have reported such occurrences. Managerial relevance statement: Under pressure due to their firm's poor performance, business executives often blame IT executives by labeling in-house IT as a cost burden. IT executives are sidelined in decisions related to IT outsourcing due to suspicions that IT executives would be overprotective of their turf. Here, business executives might argue that they are acting in the interest of their firm. Paradoxically, findings suggest that an increase in dominance by business executives leads to a decrease in outsourcing performance. Hence, IT executives need to make a strong case with various stakeholders that they deserve considerable power in the governance of IT outsourcing. (c) 2011 IEEE.

Agency theory provides a valuable lens for understanding the role and importance of many varied governance mechanisms. We argue that transaction cost economics (TCE) provides a complementary theoretical lens for studying corporate governance because it illuminates the various contingencies that moderate the importance of alternative governance mechanisms. Using agency theory, we argue and find evidence that the confluence of advancing CEO age and large CEO stock holdings will cause the CEO to become overly risk-averse. Moreover, we use TCE to more fully explicate the ensuing performance consequences as well as the contextual factors that critically moderate this relationship. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Franchisors monitor their franchisees to ensure that the latters' performance is consistent with the franchise agreement. Though agency theory suggests that monitoring and subsequent corrective action lead to improved performance and reduced opportunism, the psychology literature argues that, in certain circumstances, monitoring can "crowd out" the very behavior it was designed to eliminate (i.e., opportunistic behavior). Our results show that the extent and ease of monitoring reduce the crowding out effects of monitoring, whereas monitoring enforcement heightens these effects. Our findings also show that the exchange norm of relational solidarity fully mediates these effects. (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The aim of the study is to explain the determinants of contractual completeness in franchise relationships by formulating and testing various propositions derived from transaction cost theory, agency theory, property rights theory, organizational capability theory and relational view of governance. The degree of contractual completeness depends on behavioural uncertainty (negatively), trust (positively), franchisees' specific investments (negatively), environmental uncertainty (negatively), intangibility of system specific know-how (negatively) and contract design capabilities (positively). The hypotheses are tested with a data base consisting of 52 franchise systems in Austria. The empirical results support the hypotheses regarding behavioural uncertainty, trust and intangible system-specific know-how. (c) 2011, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

This article considers the 'obvious' relationship between human capital (HC) and agency theory (AT) with two goals in mind. First, to show how principal-agent theory (PAT) - the AT variant most understood by agency theory - clarifies HC as a way of describing individuals in the organizational context. Second, to explore how PAT's own shortcomings illuminate possibilities implicit but underexplored in the HC literature; for while a workplace relationship between PAT and HC seems obvious, it is conceptually complicated. The article begins with a review of the two concepts' history and the research programs from which they emerged. After considering the PAT-HC interaction, it shows how HC might contribute to the theory of the firm. Many see the firm as a socioeconomic context in which HC and agency issues collide under management's direction as other forms of capital enter the mix. (c) Oxford University Press 2011.

The choice of the financial policy is one of the most important decisions that the company will ever take. It consists on determining the optimal capital structure of the companies. Recently, the capital structure has increasingly gained importance sine many companies have experienced financial distress and bankruptcy caused by the last financial crisis, it has drawn the interest of many researchers and it was a subject of considerable debate in both theoretical and empirical studies. This paper analyzes the explanatory power of some of the theories that have been proposed in the literature to explain changes the in the capital structures across companies. In particular, this study investigates capital structure determinants of companies traded on Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange based on a panel data set over 2008 and 2009 comprising 33 companies from different industries. In the literature, there are many potential factors that could affect the capital structure such as: the tangibility (asset structure), the non-debt tax shield, the profitability, the size, the expected growth, the uniqueness, the income variability, the industry classification dummies, the ownership structure and the age of the company. The purpose of this study is to examine the link between a number of potential capital structure determinants and the debt level of the companies included in our analysis. In the financial literature, there are several measures of the financial leverages (long-term, short-term, and convertible debt divided by market and book values of equity) but because of the non availability of the data, we will limit our study to the leverage measures in terms of the book values rather than the market ones. Our book leverage measures are decomposed into short-term and long-term debt ratios to highlight the magnitude of the components of the capital structure. At the first look of the capital structure of the companies, we can easily confirm that they are on average highly leveraged but it stays to determine the relationship between the potential determinants of the capital structure and the different leverage measures.

This paper deals with the relationships between plural form and performance in franchising networks in Europe. It is proposed that a franchisor's life cycle stage and human capital assets influence the relationship between plural form and performance. The model has been estimated using panel data on 41 publicly listed European franchising networks in the 1998-2007 period. The proportion of network-franchised units to the total number of its units in its distribution system is used as the indicator of its plural form (franchise proportion). Following an instrumental approach, the network performance is measured at the franchisor level by its industry-adjusted Return on Assets (ROA) and a relative stock market valuation measure of intangible human capital is used. The early results show that the impact of franchise proportion on performance is greater for franchisors with high intangible human capital compared to franchisors with low intangible human capital. Overall, results provide support for the contention that the franchisors' performance is contingent on the "fit" between governance structure (franchise proportion) and resources (critical human assets). In contrast, evidence that the governance/performance relationship is contingent on life cycle stage or franchisor's age is not found. However our results suggest that franchisor's age could weaken the relationship between franchise proportion and performance. These results might suggest that younger franchisors with high human capital should increase their franchise proportion to enhance their financial performance.

This book provides a framework for the study of financial ethics built on a broad review of research published in finance and economics journals. This book demonstrates that ethics is already an important part of financial research, and therefore the approach taken here is more of a "rediscovery" of the ethical dimension of financial economics. The book adopts a positivist framework for the field of financial ethics within which it is proposed that many "finance" problems are actually "ethics" problems; and that many economic phenomena can be explained as mechanisms for controlling moral risks. The text discusses several examples in which an ethics-centered approach to understanding economic phenomena is similar in spirit to other frameworks which have been applied in positive financial research including: the framework used for understanding corporate governance mechanisms as devices for mitigating agency costs and "moral hazards" in contractual relationships; the transaction "governance structure" framework that can explain the existence of hierarchies relative to markets when opportunistic behavior is assumed; and the roles of reputation and corporate culture in making credible commitments of trust in exchange. The book argues that these "financial ethical technologies" are not mutually exclusive but, rather, mutually enriching ways to deepen our understanding of the same economic phenomena. They are financial technologies because they enhance economic value; and, they are ethical technologies because their value enhancing contributions are produced by mitigating moral risks in exchange.

A model of switching costs is applied to ad agency-client relationships using agency theory. Switching costs are comprised of set-up costs that create barriers to switching to new agencies and exit costs that are barriers to severing relationships with current agencies. Switching cost theory offers insights into why large clients can maintain agency relationships. A survey of American clients shows how client size is associated with set-up and exit costs. These relationships are explained through diversity and scope of services, the creative risk associated with major brands, and the need for more sophisticated monitoring, each acting as switching barriers, extending longevity.

The objective of this study is to explain the franchisor's choice between single-unit and multi-unit franchising. We employ a comparative case analysis method to compare the theoretical patterns with the empirical patterns of the governance forms. We selected two multi-national franchise networks based in Austria. Our findings suggest that franchisor's multi-unit franchising strategy can be explained by monitoring costs, franchisee's transaction-specific investments, franchisor's system-specific assets, and franchisor's financial resources scarcity.

In international franchising the control over franchisees' actions is becoming increasingly difficult. Franchisors must allocate a certain portion of decision rights to franchisees to enable effective decision making and maximize residual income, while still retaining control over the network. This conceptual paper combines the perspectives of the property rights, agency theory and transaction cost theory to reveal the differences in the allocation of decision rights between master franchising and direct/multi-unit franchising, as well as to understand the franchisors' choice between these two modes when entering new markets. The property rights theory predicts that the allocation of residual decision rights depends on the impact of intangible knowledge assets on the residual surplus generation. The agency theory hypothesis suggests that the decision rights allocation is influenced by the monitoring costs due to the information asymmetry between the headquarters and the foreign local partners. The analysis involves two determinants of monitoring costs: the geographic and cultural distances of the host markets. Finally, under the transaction costs view, attention is directed towards environmental and behavioral uncertainty, as determinants of the entry mode choice and the allocation of decision rights.

This study examines if the CEO duality influence the firm economic performance in Bangladesh and the moderating effects of board composition in the form of outside independent directors. While doing so, it examines the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance during the pre appointment of outside independent directors and post appointment of outside independent directors (the role of other corporate governance mechanism as moderating variable). The finding is that there is there is a negative (non-significant) relationship between CEO duality and firm performance before appointment of outside independent directors in the board. However, independent leadership structure and firm performance is found to be positively related following the acquisition of resource (outside independent directors in the board) supporting the 'resource dependence theory'. The findings of this study partially support the 'agency theory' and 'resource dependence theory' but do not support the stewardship theory. This study contributes to the literature on CEO duality in the context of less a developed country.

Stock options are theoretically adopted to better align the interests of the managers and shareholders, thereby reducing agency costs, and consequently increasing corporate performance. The critical question is whether stock options have this impact in practice. Consequently, this study investigates if stock options attribution has impact on corporate performance of Portuguese listed firms on the Euronext Lisbon. The results suggest that stock options grant is negatively related with firm's performance. Hence, this study corroborates the rent extraction hypothesis, the crowding-out hypothesis and the multi-tasking effect, which suggest that stock options may affect adversely firm's performance.

Using two theoretical approaches-agency theory and trust theory, this paper analyzes the banking relationship between branch manager and loan officer of a bank branch in India. The analysis is performed across five dimensions-supervisor subordinate relationship, delegation of authority, assumption of risk in lending, goal congruence and mutual dependence. This analysis provides a theoretical foundation for examining bank relationships in India. The role of culture in this relationship is also examined as it is an important contributing factor in business relationships in India. Since Trust theory can explain situations involving multifaceted relationships such as one between branch manager and loan officer using stakeholders' perspective, this study concludes that the trust theory is a better descriptor of the banking relationship between branch manager and loan officer in Indian banks.

While principal-agency theory has greatly facilitated our understanding of governance and management in the hollow state, close examinations of how system designs affect agency problems has been rare. The purpose of this study is to explicitly investigate the effects of different contract configurations on agent shirking, which is a common problem in third-party service delivery arrangements. Florida's recent statewide privatization and reconfiguration of its child welfare service delivery system are analyzed for this purpose. Data were collected through intensive document reviews and interviews with the public managers and the contract agents who were involved in the reform. Major structural components of the redesigned system (such as overall contract configuration, procurement policies, oversight mechanism, payment methods, and vendor governance structures) are examined and compared with those of the old system. The results of the analysis suggest that the Florida reform installed several structural devices intending to curb agent shirking that plagued the old system. The most significant changes involve a transition of the contracting scheme from a fragmented quasimarket based on dyadic contracting to an integrated service network based on a managed care model, a shift of the focus of the contract oversight from compliance and process to service outcomes, and a transfer of programmatic and financial risks and uncertainties from the government to vendors. Further, the findings of the study reveal some unintended consequences of the reform. For example, the reconfigured system that empowers communities also promotes local parochialism that hinders the government's statewide policymaking ability. The reform that consolidates contracts into the hands of a few large vendors under a standardized contract management system unites the vendors around their common interests to confront their government principal.

Human capital (HC) may be defined as the stock of valued skills, knowledge, insights, and so on, controlled by an individual: the attributes of the relevant individual that are valuable in an economic context. It yields services such as labour services, management services, or entrepreneurship. While this overall perspective cuts across organizational economics perspectives-such as transaction-cost economics (TCE), property rights/incomplete contracts theory, and agency theory-the specific terminology applied here is particular to TCE. This article surveys TCE as it pertains to HC, concentrating on: the work of TCE's most prominent flag-bearer, Oliver Williamson; the precursors of his work; and the various operationalizations and extensions of his approach. Also briefly discussed is the property-rights approach, which, like TCE, rests on the notion of incomplete contracting and the need to safeguard transactions under such conditions.

The business and public policy arena began a paradigm shift towards more competition and efficiency about 1980. The lure of innovation, creativity and more freedom captured our spirit. Deregulation, privatization, contracting out, franchising, reengineering and reinventing followed. Entrepreneurial management was thriving. Along the way dysfunctions of excessive competition and efficiency became increasingly apparent. In the world of business, public policy and finance, we had to deal with the savings and loan crisis which many argue cost taxpayers $500 B. Then came: Enron, Andersen, Worldcom, Tyco, Global Crossing, Qwest, Adelphia and more. Increasing standards have been applied to control these problems, such as new legislation like Sarbanes-Oxley and McCain Feingold, and legal actions like those of Elliot Spitzer in New York and Attorneys General in other states as well. Our seeming passion to save a few dollars with efficiency management led to overuse of under trained Argenbright and Wackenhut security screeners at airports contributing in part to the terrorism disaster of 9-11. Implementing more effectiveness and collaboration oriented organizations to enhance security and safety was realized with the development of the Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. FEMA's collapse with Hurricane Katrina is an example of abandoning the effectiveness and collaboration emphases that had made FEMA a strong organization not long before. Overemphasizing efficiency at the time of Katrina became a model for organizational collapse. The authors in the first edition of this book were contacted and given an opportunity to update their material or decline to be included in the second edition. They all reviewed and modified their material as appropriate. Several new authors and their manuscripts were also added. This second edition has changes by the following. Al Hyde and Dorothy Olshfski have a chapter on Service Quality in the Internet Economy. Linda de Leon has added Enron, Andersen and similar cases to her Ethics and Entrepreneurship chapter. Arie Halachmi has substantially increased his chapter on Agency Theory and Transaction Analysis. And Bill Waugh has updated his chapter dealing with perceptions of evil from hurricanes to his chapter dealing with university governance. Van Johnston and Claire-Lauren Shultz have a new chapter on Hurricane Katrina and FEMA. Chapters on Entrepreneurial Budgeting, Information Technology and Reinventing Government by Tom Lynch with his colleagues Peter Cruz and Cynthia Lynch; and on Privatization by Paul Seidenstat; And on Optimizing Productivity through Privatization and Entrepreneurial Management by Johnston remain much as they were, and provide a solid base for the rest of the book. An addition that brings a new dimension to the book is a chapter on The Greening of Industry Through Government Supervised Self Regulation by Dan Mazmanian and Daniel Press. Dan Mazmanian is the current President of NASPAA and the Bedrosian Chair in Governance at the University of Southern California. He is also the former Dean of the School of Policy, Planning and Development at USC. Daniel Press is Professor and Chair of Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz. The Second Edition of ENTREPRENEURIAL MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY also has a new Part IV featuring a new chapter by Wendy Haynes, President of the American society for Public Administration, and her colleague Robert Wright. Haynes and Wright use the new Entrepreneurial Management and Public Policy Integrative Model developed for this edition of the book for an extraordinary analysis of the development of the Department of Homeland Security. In the final chapter, Johnston develops the integrative Entrepreneurial Management and Public Policy Model and applies it to: NASA (the Challenger and Columbia disasters; Terrorism (1993 World Trade Center attack and the 9-11 disaster); business, public policy and finance (the S & L Bailout and the Enron, Andersen et al financial ethics collapse; and FEMA (the Northridge Earthquake and Hurricane Katrina).

Most research linking compensation to strategy relies on agency theory economics and focuses on executive pay. We instead focus on the strategic compensation of nonexecutive employees, arguing that while agency theory provides a useful framework for analyzing compensation, it fails to consider several psychological factors that increase costs from performance-based pay. We examine how psychological costs from social comparison and overconfidence reduce the efficacy of individual performance-based compensation, building a theoretical framework predicting more prominent use of team-based, seniority-based, and flatter compensation. We argue that compensation is strategic not only in motivating and attracting the worker being compensated but also in its impact on peer workers and the firm's complementary activities. The paper discusses empirical implications and possible theoretical extensions of the proposed integrated theory. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Grounded in agency theory, this study examines how franchisors' ex ante contracts and extracontractual incentives influence their ex post monitoring and enforcement efforts and how combinations of the ex post governance mechanisms drive franchisee behavior. Integrating three archival data sources and a survey of 206 franchisees across eight automotive brands, the authors find that franchisor reliance on contractual completeness appears to result in reduced ex post behavior monitoring and enforcement efforts, while contractual one-sidedness is associated with higher levels of behavior monitoring but reduced enforcement. Extracontractual incentives, when offered to the franchisee, are associated with increases in monitoring and enforcement. In isolation, franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts are ineffective in eliciting desired franchisee behaviors. However, different combinations of franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts affect franchisee compliance and opportunism, sometimes with counterproductive results. The study provides an initial baseline of understanding on how ex ante governance characteristics and combinations of ex post governance mechanisms function to facilitate or deter franchisee compliance and opportunism.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the influence of firms' ownership structure on their technological innovation performance. First, we have examined whether ownership concentration positively influences technological innovation performance. Then we have investigated the primary reasons for the results derived from the first stage of our analysis by circumstantially exploring the impacts of four different ownership types. Research Findings/Insights: Using five sets of cross-sectional data, consisting of 301 Korean firms, we found that ownership concentration does not have a significant effect on firm technological innovation performance. However, some ownership types (e.g., institutional and foreign) do have a positive effect. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Drawing on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective, our paper is the first to consider a comprehensive treatment of the effect of ownership types on innovation in an emerging country, in particular in contrast to previous studies that have focused on advanced economies. Since only partial predictions suggested by agency and resource dependence perspectives were supported, it appears that neither theory adequately captures the ownership-technological innovation performance relationship. Thus, we suggest that future research should explore the question through a different theoretical lens to better understand the impact of ownership types. We suggest that transaction cost economics can be another path to approach the phenomenon. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that managers should recognize how each characteristic of ownership structure (types) influences the building of firm-specific capabilities for innovation. Policy makers and managers should be aware of the impact of the complete range of ownership types on technological innovation performance when they implement corporate governance reform with greater effectiveness. It also suggests that successful technological catch-up and innovation not only require policies for upgrading technology capabilities, but also the setting up of a suitable supporting ownership structure that favors innovation of firms in emerging countries. We suggest that successful technological catch-up and innovation require a supporting ownership structure. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: The paper aims to explain how agency theory can be used to inform our understanding of the dynamics surrounding supply chain behaviours and relationships. Design/methodology/approach: A structured review of the literature using a three-stage refinement process is used. The articles were sourced through online databases and keyword classifications, such as "agency theory", "principal-agent relationships" and "supply chain management". The search initially identified over 86 articles. After further screening these were reduced to 19 for final assessment and comparison. Findings: Despite agency theory's prevailing descriptive and predictive qualities there is scarcity in its application to the SCM discipline. The authors posit that agency theory provides valuable insights for relationship engineering within supply chains where social, political, legal and behavioural dynamics dominate. Practical implications: It is a critical task for managers to understand and mitigate abnormal behaviours across the supply chain. Agency theory serves this need by providing them with a useful tool to respond to transaction cost dilemmas through contractual and non-contractual remedies. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies that examines the current state of agency theory application in the SCM literature and suggests potential avenues for future research.

The prevalence of ownership concentration in Asian firms presents a challenge to the influential agency theory-based understanding of the role of corporate boards. In this paper we develop and test hypotheses about board attributes and firm performance that reflect Asian institutional conditions. We present the first meta-analysis of the relationship between board attributes and performance of Asian firms using a varied set of meta-analytical techniques on a database of 86 studies covering nine Asian countries. First, we find that board structure and composition preferences are influenced by the identity of the concentrated owner. Second, consistent with US data, we find very limited evidence of a direct relationship between board attributes and firm financial performance in the Asian context. Third, we find that the relationship between board structure and composition and firm performance is mediated by the revealed strategic preferences of Asian firms specifically by the level of R&D investment.

We offer an institution-based view to the classic inquiry on the relationship between family business and firm performance, which has been dominated by traditional theories such as agency theory and the resource-based view. Specifically, we argue that institutions define family business characteristics such as ownership concentration and family management, and also affect the performance of family business. Our research contributes to a reconciliation of prior inconsistent findings and calls further attention to the embedded nature of family business in institutions.

Corporate governance research indicates that corporate boards of directors may be overly beholden to management, which can be detrimental to firm value creation. Drawing upon agency theory and the governance law literature, we examine the effects of a new SEC rule designed to lessen managerial power by increasing large, long-term shareholders' influence in the director nomination process. We predict and find support for a positive overall market reaction to the rule's announcement as well as a greater reaction for firms with characteristics that suggest compromised board independence or greater CEO control. Moreover, we examine the implications of greater shareholder voice for another key stakeholder group, firm bondholders, and find evidence that it is also value increasing. We conclude by discussing important implications for theory and practice. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Plural forms exist when managers use two owners to perform one activity. Franchising is a plural form explained by agency theory, however, the theory is unable to explain two franchisor actions: 1) allowing franchisees to own multiple outlets and 2) co-locating company-owned and franchised outlets. We use research that describes a symbiosis between company-owned and franchised outlets to extend agency theory and explain these actions. Our investigation of ownership patterns among 4,339 outlets of 16 plural form franchisors is consistent with our theory that multi-outlet franchising is cost efficient and that co-location occurs when franchisors fill market gaps left by franchisees.

The authors leverage insights and theories from the extensive interfirm (business-to-business, or B2B) alliance literature to explore the effect of the sectors of the partners on the governance of infrastructure public-private partnerships (PPPs) as compared with B2B alliances. Their analysis suggests that the sectors of the partners have an important impact on PPP governance, not only because the sector constrains the availability of some governance mechanisms but also because it makes alternative mechanisms available or relevant to the partners. Specifically, the authors predict that PPPs will avoid equity structures and will rely, instead, on less complete and more complex alliance contracts; a restricted scope of activities; and nonequity hostages, such as metagovernance mechanisms or stakeholder involvement. Contrasting with B2B alliances, their analysis also suggests that trust-based governance mechanisms will play a minimal role in the governance of PPPs. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: Recently, an increasing number of Internet users have begun to purchase various products, both secondhand and new, from online auction websites. However, some Internet users are still hesitant to purchase products from these websites. Moreover, the factors affecting male and female users' intention to shop on the websites may be different. Past studies have indicated that uncertainty is a major determinant of online shopping behaviors and may have different effects on men's and women's purchase intentions. Therefore, to explore the differences, this study seeks to propose a research model based on uncertainty and agency theory. Design/methodology/approach: This study included members of the Yahoo! and PChome online portal sites in Taiwan as research subjects. A web survey was conducted, and data were collected from a total of 313 bidders of online auctions. The casual model was validated using partial least squares (PLS) techniques. Findings: Gender moderated most of the relationships in the research model. The analysis results showed that the factors influencing men's and women's uncertainty are different. In addition, uncertainty has stronger influence on men's intention to purchase products from online auction websites. Practical implications: This study contributes to a theoretical understanding of the factors that promote men's and women's intention to purchase products from online auction websites. From a practical perspective, insights provided by this study can help online auction service providers understand buyers' concerns and eliminate the sources of the uncertainty. Originality/value: The primary value of this paper lies in providing a better understanding of male and female behaviors on online C2C market, and investigating the gender differences in the factors that influence the consumers' purchase in online auctions.

This paper argues that conflicting incentives among managers may impede potential knowledge-sharing benefits from vertical integration. I study knowledge-based agency costs from vertical integration in car leasing, where manufacturer-owned captive lessors compete with independent lessors. Both organizational forms must acquire and integrate diffuse knowledge to accurately predict vehicle depreciation-a condition critical for profitability. Using a data set of 180,000 leases, I compare contracts of independent and captive lessors across car models, market conditions, and product life cycles. I find that managers in vertically integrated firms have conflicting incentives on whether to accurately and completely share proprietary knowledge, and show that these incentives appear to generate agency costs inconsistent with corporate profitability as managers selectively use and share knowledge for personal gain. The findings suggest that most knowledge benefits of vertical integration will be nullified when managerial interests are incompatible with the profit concerns of the firm. (c) 2012 INFORMS.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether corporate governance plays a role in influencing a firm's choice of financing, i.e., equity versus debt. We hypothesize that the likelihood of equity financing increases with governance because of a reduction in agency costs between investors and managers in these firms. While the reduction in agency costs occurs for both equity and debt financing, we argue that there is a more significant effect on equity financing. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of over 2,000 US equity and debt issuances over the period 1998 to 2006, we find that our measures of corporate governance effectiveness have a positive impact on the likelihood of choosing equity compared to debt. This association is more pronounced in small firms where information asymmetry is higher between managers and investors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings refine and extend the pecking order hypothesis, which suggests that firms will issue equity as their last resort because of the high information asymmetry associated with equity financing. We provide some of the first evidence that the pecking order hypothesis can be mitigated by corporate governance. Specifically, we find that the likelihood of issuing equity increases as governance increases. Further, we find that where agency costs due to information asymmetry are greater, the positive impact of governance on the likelihood of equity financing is also greater. That is, in support of agency cost theory, we find that firms facing high agency costs benefit the most from investing in corporate governance mechanisms that lower the agency costs. We are not aware of any prior study, published or unpublished, that has documented this result. Practitioner/Policy Implications: From a practical perspective, our study suggests that firms wishing to access equity capital markets should pay attention to their corporate governance. Specifically, by investing in corporate governance systems, firms facing high agency costs may be able to obtain easier access to not just debt but also equity markets. From a practice standpoint, in the years prior to securing financing, firms should consider making improvements to their governance (e.g., changes to board structure and/or auditor), carefully weighing the costs of making these improvements against the benefits of securing better and cheaper access to equity markets.

We provide a framework for examining the trade-offs between socio-environmental, organizational, and managerial goals. Using this framework we examine management choices under agency and stewardship theories. We advance a theory of social stewardship to explain behavior inconsistent with both agency and stewardship. We illustrate that social stewardship behavior by managers and principals, while best from a societal perspective, is not a viable management approach under current business and regulatory conditions. This conclusion is vital to public policymakers who seek to foster socially desirable behavior by publicly traded companies. (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Research Question/Issue: What determines venture capitalists influence on the governance of firms? How do venture capitalists shape the governance of their investees? Are venture capitalists governance practices consistent across countries? These important questions are under-investigated in the extant literature. In this study, we shed light on the effects of venture capital investors on a large set of governance decisions and we discover the existence of striking cross-country differences. Research Findings/Insights: We test our conjectures on a unique hand-collected questionnaire-based dataset of 164 companies in five countries and two regions (Europe and the US). Our empirical results show that there is a strong and positive relationship between VCs' funding and their influence on some factors like decisions on CEO hiring, executive compensation, board decisions and appointments. Employee incentives are also positively related to the proportion of VC funding. On the other hand, results show that the proportion of VC funding is only marginally significant in explaining VC influence on strategy direction and investment planning. Our analysis though, offers a remarkably different view after splitting data into European and American subsamples. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results provide a novel view of the functioning of the Venture Capital industry and its degree of pervasiveness in the management of portfolio companies. Adopting a unique dataset, we add new evidence on detailed governance decisions, thus supporting the idea that the incremental contribution of a professional investor to a new venture is largely exceeding the capital infusion only. Finally, we show that governance decisions exhibit significant country effects. This evidence supports the view that a global theory of corporate governance cannot rely on a single interpretation framework such as agency theory, but needs to be integrated with predictions from alternative views such institutional theory. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Corporate governance is the essential mechanism allowing proper management of financial and corporate resources by aligning incentives of employees and investors, thus enabling oversight and control on companies. Yet, corporate governance rules and mechanisms are costly and have different effectiveness across countries. Our results provide guidance to investors in selecting the appropriate set of governance provisions conditional on a set of investment-specific factors. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into efficient entities has been an important approach in transition economies. However, the transition literature reveals little about how control structure affects firm performance of transformed SOEs. Drawing on agency theory, we distinguish three modes of control in transformed SOEs: state-controlled, dispersedly controlled, and privately controlled modes and argue that actual control after transformation plays a critical role in determining performance. Examining the impact of different control modes in China, we find that the key is who controls the transformed firm. Non-state-controlled (dispersedly controlled and privately controlled) firms are more likely to have enhanced post-transformation performance and reduced agency costs than state-controlled firms.

Venture capitalists (VCs) increasingly rely on elaborate formal contracts and incentivization through share ownership to manage their relationships with the entrepreneurial firms in which they invest. This study analyses the impact of a high degree of such 'neoclassical contracting' on entrepreneurs' trust in their VC backers. The results from a sample of 86 Dutch entrepreneurial firms indicate not only that a high degree of neoclassical contracting tends to erode entrepreneurs' trust in their VCs, but also that the use of more informal, relational contracting fails to moderate the negative association between a strong focus on neoclassical contracts and trust. However, entrepreneurs do welcome some level of monitoring, which highlights the enduring tension between trust and control, and the need for VCs to strike a productive balance.

This article analyses the appointments of outside directors to family firm boards within a sample of 423 observations (year/firm) regarding Italian publicly listed companies. The aim is to test predictions which suggest that efficient performance of control and service tasks by outside directors has positive effects on a company's capacity to raise capital and to grow. Unlike agency theory, which affirms that independents are efficient when performing functions of control, this article suggests that the adoption of outside directors who are also independent has no effect. The results of this research demonstrate that outside directors who have close ties with banks maintain valuable social capital with bankers in periods when such social capital is threatened by large investment policies requiring a great amount of bank financing.

To date, we have only partially begun to develop an understanding of the channels through which innovation is facilitated within organizations. Although talented individuals are pivotal to supporting knowledge accumulation and renewal, they may be more willing to contribute new ideas if they expect to reap some of the gains that these ideas generate for the firm. In considering this perspective, this paper addresses whether organizational incentives affect innovation, and considers the conduits through which this link is established. In particular, this paper uses agency theory to address whether performance-based pay and performance-based promotion foster firm innovation. Our analysis relies upon a survey of 370 Brazilian manufacturing and services firms. Based on estimations of two-stage models, our results indicate that promotion is a more useful tool for encouraging innovation than pay. In addition, there seems to be a threshold above which the use of performance-based promotion is marginal. (c) 2012 Brazilian Administration Review. All rights reserved.

There is currently intense debate in academic circles regarding the principles that have long sustained traditional economic theories in the teaching of business management. One of the most controversial questions being discussed is the concept of human nature as driven primarily by self-interest. Profit maximization and governance mechanisms in order to protect shareholders' interests have become the essence of all good business management practices. This article proposes a change in direction towards a broader and, at the same time, more realistic perspective with respect to the individual's values within the sphere of the teaching of business management.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

The paper deals with development of a general theory of the firm. It discusses the demand for such a theory, reviews existing approaches to its generalization, and offers a new variant of general theory of the firm based on the contract theory. The theory is based on minimization of opportunistic behaviour determined by the material structure of production (a classification of ten structural factors is offered). This framework is applied to the analysis of three boundaries problems (boundaries of the job, boundaries of the unit, boundaries of the firm) and five integration dilemmas (vertical, horizontal, functional, related, and conglomerate).

The aim of this study is to explain the performance consequences of the adoption of a Chief Operating Officer (COO) position by drawing from agency theory. Although, prior research has documented a performance penalty associated with the use of this position, we currently have an incomplete understanding of the factors explaining this penalty. This study suggests that the delegation of CEO decision rights to the COO is explained by information transfer and agency considerations. Largely consistent with agency theory, our empirical analysis suggests information transfer considerations are related to the likelihood of COO adoption, while CEO ownership and board characteristics mitigate the related performance penalty.

This article serves two purposes: to review how the agency and real options perspectives inform us about the venture capital staging decision, and to examine whether the staging decision differs between domestic venture capitalist (VC)-led and foreign VC-led investment projects. The article proceeds as follows. First, it reviews how agency theory informs venture capital staging decisions and analyzes whether domestic VCs and foreign VCs differ in using staged financing to address agency concerns. Then it considers how real options theory informs venture capital staging decisions, and examines whether domestic VCs and foreign VCs differ in using staged financing to tackle project-specific uncertainty and market volatility. It discusses the methods for the empirical test and presents empirical results. It concludes with a discussion of the study for research and practice. (c) 2012 by Oxford University Press.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reconcile alternative managerial views regarding self-serving behavior in organizations: while some propose that such behavior is commonplace and detrimental to performance, and suggest policies to counteract such conduct, critics contend that such policies generate distrust and diminish performance. The authors integrate elements from agency and interactional justice theories, and hypotheses that managerial attitudes not related to self-interest can influence behaviors often attributed to the desire to curb self-interest, and vice-versa. Design/methodology/approach - The authors employ structural equation modeling based on survey data from 387 team-leaders from both Brazil and the USA. Findings - An asymmetric relation is found in the aforementioned theoretical "cross-talk:" managers concerned with self-interest tend to devise policies solely focused on curbing self-interest, while managers concerned with justice not only adopt justice-enhancing practices but also certain incentivizing agency-related practices which jointly increase performance. Research limitations/implications - By proposing and testing theoretical interactions between agency and justice theories, support is found for both enthusiasts and critics of self-interestedness, but pointedly they occur in different domains. Practical implications - The results suggest that managers should foster interactional justice, promoting incentivizing agency-related behaviors that may be interpreted as justice-seeking, while avoiding those that send a message of distrust. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first empirical papers directly addressing the ongoing debate raised by Ghoshal and others on the merits of managerial theories based on the assumption of self-interest.

This present work is an exploratory analysis of network governance models that are characterised by widespread distribution of decision-making and control, auditing and supervisory functions in company structure, frequently through stakeholder engagement in the management system. In the study, we verify the way in which NG can involve stakeholder representatives in the governance bodies and in the decision-making process, also preventing opportunistic behaviour of management, according to the stakeholder-agency theory. A case study of network governance is presented regarding the Spanish cooperative Eroski - a self-governing organisation, with direct participation by representatives of the various stakeholder categories in the main governing bodies. In the conclusions, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the network governance system and its implications for theory and practice and we describe an incremental approach, on an entirely voluntary basis, for implementing this governance model in other corporations, including non-cooperative ones.

The aim of this paper is to measure the degree of the managerial entrenchment and to study its impact on the performance of the firm. The model of the entrenchment's degree is based on both the personal characteristics of the manager and on the ownership structure of the firm. According to our empirical studies carried on 815 firms during the period 2001-2004, the entrenchment's degree depends significantly on the age and on the tenure of the manager as well as on the relative power of the managerial ownership. Moreover, the relationship between the managerial entrenchment and the performance of the firm is not linear. It takes the form of a harmful entrenchment then of a beneficial one as the entrenchment's degree increases. This result shows that the managerial entrenchment is not always harmful to the shareholders' wealth. Empirically, by exceeding a certain critical level (0.81), the managerial entrenchment becomes beneficial to the shareholders. (c) 2014 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

This article contrasts three views or paradigms of the business enterprise and of critical management issues regarding governance. The first two are the agency and contracting paradigms. These dominate most discussion of the governance of corporate activities. The third is the capabilities perspective, which is starting to gain attention in the literature. Agency theory highlights how incentives should be crafted and governance activities focused to bring about better performance for shareholders when ownership and control are separated. Transaction cost economics highlights, as does agency theory, the importance of opportunism. But it adds asset specificity considerations that are also relevant to organizational design choices, including governance mechanisms. The capabilities perspective focuses less on managing opportunism and more on harnessing and managing opportunity. In that sense, it is closer to the essence of capitalism.

We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory and propose that cross-national comparison of corporate governance should consider how the nature and extent of agency relationships differ across different institutional contexts. Building on prior governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory we argue that performance outcomes of boards of directors, ownership concentration, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Institutions may also affect the extent of complimentarity/substitution among different firm-level governance practices producing patterned variations in firm-level governance mechanisms. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational outcomes of various governance practices.

Despite increased attention given to family firms in the theory of organization and management, the value of family governance in emerging markets is not clearly understood. We draw insights from agency and institutional economics perspectives to address the debate on whether family governance fills or abuses the void left by weaker market and legal institutions. We propose a dual focus on the pattern of family control and weak institutions to reconcile these opposed assessments. We analyze how various combinations of family control over ownership, strategy, and operations yield different benefits and costs for the operational performance of firms in the absence of strong market and legal institutions. The uneven development of market institutions across industries and the impact of independent directors reinforce the importance of separating different patterns of family control. We find support for our hypotheses when tested on a data set consisting of all publicly listed firms in Taiwan between 1996 and 2005. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of family businesses in emerging markets, highlights the importance of weak institutions in shaping relative agency costs, and illuminates the differential effects of independent directors.

Principals who delegate tasks to agents face the perennial challenge of overcoming agency problems. We investigate whether feelings of ownership among senior managers in the absence of formal ownership can align agents' interests with those of principals, thus turning agents into psychological principals. Using a moderated mediation model, we find that psychological ownership is positively related to company performance through the mediating effect of individual-level entrepreneurial behaviour. We also find that the effect of psychological ownership on individual-level entrepreneurial behaviour and, ultimately, company performance is weaker for high levels of monitoring compared to low levels. These findings offer important contributions to agency, psychological ownership, and entrepreneurship literatures.

This study addresses a major gap in our knowledge about the allocation of information technology (IT) decision rights between business and IT units at the application level, including the governance of applications delivered on-premise versus those delivered with a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. Building on the findings from a multicase qualitative study of organizations that had adopted the same SaaS application, we draw on three theoretical lenses (agency theory, transaction cost economics, and knowledge-based view) to develop a theoretically grounded model with three organization-level factors, three application-level factors, and application-level IT governance. Hypotheses derived from the model, as well as a set of differential hypotheses about factor influences due to on-premise versus SaaS delivery, are tested with survey responses from 207 firms in which application-level governance is operationalized with two dimensions: decision control rights (decision authority) and decision management rights (task responsibility). Three antecedents (origin of the application initiative, scope of application use, business knowledge of the IT unit) were significantly associated with application governance postimplementation, and the on-premise/SaaS subgroup analyses provide preliminary evidence for the mode of application delivery as a moderator of these relationships. Overall, this study contributes to a growing body of research that takes a more modular approach to studying IT governance and provides theoretical explanations for differing application-level governance designs.

We develop the concept of stakeholder salience to account for stakeholders who should matter to the firm, even when managers do not perceive them as important. While managers are responsible for attributing salience to stakeholders, they can overlook or ignore stakeholder importance because of market frictions that affect managerial perceptions or induce opportunism. When this happens, corporate financial and social performance can suffer. Thus, we propose that the perceptions of organizational and societal stakeholders should also codetermine the salience of the focal stakeholder to the firm. We also propose that stakeholder dialogue can reduce the impacts that market frictions can have on managerial perceptions of stakeholder interests that should matter to the firm. Finally, we discuss how the refined conceptualization of stakeholder salience might have better predictive validity, be more normative, and make instrumental and normative stakeholder theory more convergent.

Franchise relationships are prone to conflict. To safeguard the rights of individual franchisees, several states have legislated greater franchisor disclosure (registration law) ex ante and/or franchisor "termination for good cause" (relationship law) ex post. The impact of regulatory oversight on franchisor-franchisee conflict, however, remains unclear. Relying on agency theory arguments, the authors first assess the influence of the regulatory context, both by itself and in combination with the franchise ownership structure, on the incidence of litigated conflict. Conditional on litigation, they also predict the impact of franchise regulation on both the parties' litigation initiation and resolution choices and the resulting outcomes. The authors test the hypotheses using a unique multisource archival database of 411 instances of litigation across 75 franchise systems observed over 17 years. The results indicate that the regulatory context, by itself as well as in combination with the franchise ownership structure, significantly shapes parties' conflict management choices. The authors also find evidence of a trade-off between prevailing in the particular conflict and achieving franchise system growth objectives. (c) 2013, American Marketing Association.

Corporate investors can provide valuable resources to their new venture investees, but their interests may conflict with those of independent venture capitalist (IVC) coinvestors. We explore how the preferences, resources, and influence of corporate investors vis-a-vis their IVC coinvestors affect their selection of investment opportunities and subsequent nurturing of new venture investees. We show that corporate investors tend to fund new ventures with greater pre-funding innovative capabilities and new ventures receiving corporate funding exhibit greater post-funding rates of innovation compared to those funded solely by IVCs, particularly when their corporate investors are highly reputable relative to their IVC coinvestors.

Quality-related incidents involving contract manufacturers (CMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent. The quality management (QM) literature, however, has focused mostly on QM within a single firm. Thus, the need for data-driven research on managing quality with outsourced production is evident. We investigate the use and effectiveness of external failure penalties and audits of CMs' facilities to manage inter-firm quality. Building on agency theory and extant QM literature, this study addresses two research questions: (i) whether the control mechanisms of quality audits and contractual external quality failure penalties are substitutes or complements in use and (ii) whether they are substitutes or complements in their effectiveness at aligning the quality interests of customers and their CMs. Our analysis uses dyadic data gathered from brand-owning firms and their CMs representing 95 contract manufacturing relationships in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated industries. The results indicate that more severe external failure penalties correspond to a lower use of facility audits (i.e., they are substitutes-in-use). We also find that both external failure penalties and facility audits have a unique positive effect on the CM's perception of relative quality importance. Finally, some evidence supports the hypothesis that each mechanism is more effective in the presence of the other (i.e., they are complements-in-effectiveness).

This study examines if Chief Executive Officer (CEO) duality reduces the firms' agency cost in Bangladesh. The agency costs are measured as two efficiency ratios: 'expense ratio' and 'asset utilization ratio'. The finding is that, there is no significant relationship between CEO duality and agency costs. These findings imply that, duality may have given the CEOs enormous powers; it may have reduced the check and balance or board's ability to exercise the governance (monitoring) function, which is not helpful to enhance firm efficiency. This study contributes to the global debate on CEO duality and provides a new avenue of knowledge on CEO duality and firm efficiency in the context of an emerging economy.

The philosophy of science offers two different perspectives on how empirical findings contribute to knowledge accumulation. The "law-statement" perspective interprets contributions to the extent that empirical research confirms or refutes general axioms of theory. Alternatively, the "model-theoretic" perspective recognizes contributions from models that improve scholars' ability to represent the world of managers. Management scholars often have limited awareness of the philosophical tradition underlying the model-theoretic perspective, and, consequently, useful contributions from improved models of important phenomena may be overlooked. Drawing on model-theoretic philosophy, we identify three ways in which empirical research contributes to theoretical knowledge without necessarily verifying or falsifying theoretical axioms, through the grafting, contextualizing, and repurposing of representational models. We provide examples of each by focusing on studies investigating incentive alignment. Finally, we discuss how the model-theoretic perspective contributes to an ongoing discussion about improving theoretical precision in management research. (c) Academy of Management Review 2013.

We propose that CEO compensation and tenure moderate the relationship between multinational corporations' (MNCs) R&D intensities and their percentages of equity ownership in international joint ventures (IJVs). Transaction cost economics (TCE) suggests a positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, but this relationship has not been confirmed consistently in prior research. We examine the moderating effects of CEO compensation and tenure on the relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, thereby bringing more nuanced explanations from agency theory and upper echelons theory into the discussion. Our proposed relationships were tested using a sample of 202 IJVs formed between U.S. MNCs and foreign partners in high-tech industries for the period 1993 to 2003. We found an overall positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and the percentage of equity ownership in IJVs. Moreover, CEO tenure and bonus compensation each weaken the positive R&D intensity-equity ownership relationship in our sample, while CEO stock options compensation amplifies it. These findings indicate that CEO compensation and tenure influence decision making about equity ownership in IJVs, suggesting that scholars and boards of directors should consider these CEO-related factors when evaluating strategic decisions regarding IJVs.

Formal controls are an essential part of organizational design, and are theorized to positively influence organizational performance. Mello and Hunt ([2009] Transportation Journal, 48:20-39) were the first to suggest using formal controls to influence truck drivers' behavior. Extending the salesperson control literature, they documented an underresearched method of formal control that we term technology control, whereby firms use on-board and communications technology to influence drivers. We build on their work by investigating the contingent effects of formal controls that influence the behavior of truck drivers and thereby influence the operational performance of firms in the U.S. motor carrier industry. Our work integrates the monitoring aspect of agency theory with the theory of operant conditioning and the theory of psychological reactance to develop a rationale for hypothesized contingent effects of formal controls on motor carriers' operational performance. We collected primary data pertaining to the controls used to influence truck drivers' behavior from a large sample of U.S. motor carrier firms. The results of our analyses using nonlinear structural equation modeling suggest a complex set of relationships between formal controls and operational performance. Our results shed light on scenarios where using technology to monitor driver behavior can result in positive and/or negative organizational outcomes.

Public-private partnerships (PPP) are increasingly popular around the world. A number of studies have been conducted on the risk factors and risk allocation in PPP, but they ignored the underlying forces which drive project stakeholders' behaviour when transferring risks. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the manifestation and antecedents of opportunistic behaviour in PPP projects. Using delinquency theory, transaction cost economics and agency theory, a conceptual model of antecedents of opportunistic behaviour in PPP is developed. A meta-analysis of 20 PPP case is conducted. It is found that self-interest seeking and asset specificity are the most important factors in motivating parties' to act opportunistically. Superordination and externalization are the two significant forces in justifying opportunistic behaviours in PPPs. In addition, risk occurrences have a direct relationship with opportunistic behaviour.

This paper builds on agency theory and contract incompleteness theory to explore the ethical relation between owners and contractors in the construction process. Using factor and multivariate analysis, it transpires that cost, quality, time/past performance, and information available about the project are important factors that should be taken into account in any future contract between the owner (the principle) and the contractor (the agent). The results provide important empirical and theoretical implications in identifying the contractual elements of incomplete contracts, which, if considered, are expected to reduce the agency theory problem, while at the same time enhancing the ethical relationship between owners and contractors.

Managing uncertainty is critical for the survival, growth, and profitability of service firms. Despite its importance, the extant literature largely ignores how firms respond to service uncertainty. To address this gap, this study develops and tests a conceptual model of uncertainty by integrating the literature on signaling and organization theories. The conceptual model identifies two salient sources of uncertainty in the firm-customer interface, i.e., (i) performance ambiguity, and (ii) input uncertainty. Given performance ambiguity, customers face an adverse selection problem because they cannot judge service quality ex-ante. Signaling theory suggests that firms may deploy signals such as certification and customer bonds to mitigate adverse selection. Managers also need to minimize the negative effects of input uncertainty engendered by the variable nature of customer demand. Based on the organization theory literature, formalized procedures and routines represent the general solution to input uncertainty. I empirically investigate whether managers' responses are congruent with the hypothesized model by analyzing data collected from 287 managers in automotive service organizations via a mail survey procedure. Overall, results of empirical tests conducted via the Latent Variable Structural Equations (LVSE) method provide unequivocal support for the hypothesized consequences of customer uncertainty. I discuss the implications of this study for services research and outline future research directions. (c) 2013 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.

The separation of ownership and control observed in large corporations is common to other organizations such as large professional partnerships, financial mutuals, nonprofits, and cooperatives. This separation gives rise to control and influence cost problems in cooperatives. However, it is not observed in all Brazilian agricultural cooperatives, where certain members have both residual claim and formal control rights. In this article, we examine the allocation of decision management and control rights and the determinants of ownership structure in a sample of Brazilian agricultural cooperatives. Using survey data, we employ multivariate regression techniques to empirically investigate the factors determining the allocation of ownership rights and the separation of ownership and control. Our findings do not lend strong support to agency theory, but they help inform research seeking to shed light on the determinants of decision rights allocation in agricultural cooperatives.

This chapter summarizes the theory and empirics of capital structure for life insurers and health insurers. The large literature on explaining capital structure for nonfinancial firms is not explicitly applicable to insurers because of the differences in the structures, setting, and the premium financing of insurers. Nevertheless, the fundamental capital structure question is carefully adapted from the debt versus equity theories used for nonfinancial firms to the risk versus capital theories in insurance. The switch follows naturally from the customer-based model of insurer financing. The predictions of agency theory, transaction-cost economics, pecking order, debt-equity trade-off, bankruptcy cost, risk subsidy, and other theories are developed and summarized into the "finite risk" and "excessive risk" hypotheses. The interrelationships between the capital and risks of life and health insurers are examined in this light. For the last two decades, insurers operated under the finite risk paradigm, even during the 2008 financial crisis. (c) Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013. All rights reserved.

Development new technologies and researches are considered as a vital strategic source and they will not add value to the countries economics unless they become commercialised. So selecting a suitable commercialisation strategy is considered as a strategic selection and accordingly the importance of the factors affecting this selection is more obvious. In this study, using a mix method, as well as applying agency theory; firstly, the local Factors Affecting the Selection of Iran special commercialisation strategy in 41 young biotechnology companies in Tehran province were identified through interview and then a questionnaire was prepared integrating these factors and the factors extracted fro m the existing literature and was distributed among a larger sample in order to obtain the integrity. Finally, after analysing the questionnaires, the factors affecting the selection of each introduced commercialisation strategy were identified. Copyright (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Considerable attention has been focused on the ways in which emerging market firms can obtain and mobilize the knowledge and resources required for innovation. Innovation is a particular challenge in emerging markets because of inadequate external institutions. In this study, we focus on the importance of ownership structure, and in particular on ownership type diversity and ownership concentration. Using transaction cost and agency theories embedded in an emerging market context, we argue that ownership structure provides an important mechanism by which firms can assemble and direct the resources necessary for innovation in the context of inadequate external institutions. Specifically, we hypothesize that ownership type diversity improves innovation performance and that increasing ownership concentration has the same effect, but only up to a point. Using a panel dataset of 487 and 475 Chinese listed companies during 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 respectively, we find supportive empirical evidence for our hypotheses. Our findings also suggest that ownership type diversity is a more important factor in explaining innovation performance than ownership concentration, although most of the extant literature focuses on the latter.

Academics, politicians, and journalists are often highly critical of U.S. firms for holding too much cash. Cash holdings are stockpiled free-cash flow and incur substantial opportunity costs from the perspectives of economics. However, behavioral theory highlights the benefits of cash holdings as fungible slack resources facilitating adaptive advantages. We use the countervailing forces embodied in these two theories to hypothesize and test a quadratic functional relationship of returns to cash measured by Tobin's q. We also build and test a related novel hypothesis of scale-dependent returns to cash based on the competitive strategy concept of strategic deterrence. Tests for both of these hypotheses are positive and show that returns to cash continue to increase far beyond transactional needs. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The objective of this research is to assess the impact of IT outsourcing on Information Systems' success. We modeled the relationships among the extent of IT outsourcing, the ZOT (the Zone of Tolerance), and IS success. We justified our model using the expectancy-disconfirmation theory, the agency theory, and transaction cost economics, and we empirically tested it using structural equation modeling with responses from IS users. We found significant direct and indirect effects (through the service quality) of outsourcing on IS systems' perceived usefulness and their users' satisfaction. Whereas the extent of outsourcing is negatively related to the service quality and perceived usefulness, the ZOT-based IS service quality is positively related to the user satisfaction.

This paper theoretically evaluates why profit-loss sharing (PLS) contracts in Islamic banking fails and its potential for improvement within the scope of the New Institutional Economic Theory (NIE). The objective of the evaluation is to draw conclusive theoretical arguments of whether Islamic banking institutions in Malaysia should act as either financial intermediaries or entrepreneurs. Further, we analyze this issue from the perspective of agency theory, financial intermediation theory and entrepreneurship theory with four economic agents in the Islamic banking sector, namely entrepreneurs, depositors, shareholders, and the Islamic banks. Specifically, the first three economic agents represent the asset (equity-based financing), liability, and equity of the Islamic banks, respectively; while the latter is the Islamic banks, which act as a separate legal entity. Finally, we suggest that PLS contracts would best be positioned if Islamic banks play the role of genuine entrepreneurs. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Extant theories agree that debt should inhibit diversification but predict opposing performance consequences. While agency theory predicts that debt should lead to higher performance for diversifying firms, transaction cost economics (TCE) predicts that more debt will lead to lower performance for firms expanding into new markets. Our empirical tests on a large sample of Japanese firms support TCE by showing that firms accrue higher returns from leveraging their resources and capabilities into new markets when managers are shielded from the rigors of the market governance of debt, particularly bond debt. Furthermore, we find that the detrimental effects of debt are exacerbated for R&D intensive firms and that debt is not necessarily harmful to firms that are either contracting or managing a stable portfolio of markets.

Purpose: A severe problem in supplier selection refers to moral hazard: suppliers not behaving in the expected way once contracted. Principal-agent theory could provide insights on how to reduce this problem. Because buyer-supplier relationships can be interpreted as principal-agent situations, the application of agency theory should facilitate improved supplier selection. Although theoretically compelling, empirical tests verifying this assumption are not prevalent. Regarding the advancement of theory, this paper tests whether both ex ante and ex post information asymmetries influence moral hazard. In particular, in the context of a globalizing economy with a subsequent increase in information asymmetries as a problem in supplier selection, this conceptual approach may be contributive.Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a set of 87 buyer-supplier relationships to conduct a test, applying a partial least squares model with latent variables. A particularity of the data set is that it contains information on ongoing as well as on discontinued relationships.Findings: The analysis indicated that both ex ante information asymmetries (operationalized by a reputation variable) and ex post asymmetries (operationalized by a monitoring variable) have shown to be significant and strong antecedents explaining the occurrence of moral hazard. Interestingly, and opposed to the common assumption, the length of a relationship and the amount of direct meetings have not revealed any explanatory significance. Buyer dependency hardly showed influence on supplier opportunism.Research limitations/implications: Data were collected from a multitude of buyer-supplier relationships from a single firm in the chemical-pharmaceutical industry. Generalizations to other industries still need to be tested. Socially desirable answering behavior cannot fully be excluded because relationship discontinuation is not a desirable situation. In terms of theory implications, this research adds to the notion that both hidden action and hidden intention can lead to moral hazard.Practical implications: An agency-based analysis can be operationalized with the help of an agency-based supplier classification portfolio. It might be of particular value to firms to discuss those suppliers that scored high in risk of opportunism but did not (yet) reveal any signs of moral hazard. Finally, the strong explanatory powerof reputation alerts buyers to pay more attention to behavioral information on the (potential) supplier available in the market.Originality/value: Analyzing the occurrence of moral hazard and including terminated relationships adds to the emerging stream of literature on relationship discontinuation in B2B markets. Further, the strong empirical results may encourage researchers to elaborate on principal-agent theory-based assumptions, adding another layer of explanation to buyer-supplier relationships. Findings show that reputation is unduly neglected as supplier selection criterion in current theory and practice. Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The incentive dilemma refers to a situation in which incentives are offered but do not work as intended. The authors suggest that, in an interorganizational context, whether a principal-provided incentive works is a function of how it is evaluated by an agent: for its contribution to the agent's bottom line (instrumental evaluation) and for the extent it is strategically aligned with the agent's direction (congruence evaluation). To further understand when incentives work, the influence of two key contextual variables-industry volatility and dependence-are examined. A field study featuring 57 semi-structured depth interviews and 386 responses from twin surveys in the information technology and brewing industries provide data for hypothesis testing. When and whether incentives work is demonstrated by certain conditions under which the agent's evaluation of an incentive has positive or negative effects on its compliance and active representation. Further, some outcomes are reversed in the high volatility condition. (c) 2013 Academy of Marketing Science.

This paper examines the evolution of the international franchise research with special focus on the governance modes of the international franchise firm and develops a new model for the franchisor's choice of the international governance modes. International governance modes in franchising refer to wholly-owned subsidiaries, joint venture franchising, area development franchising and master franchising. Although many studies on the governance modes of the international franchise firm have been published in the last two decades, no prior study develops an integrative framework that investigates the determinants of the international governance modes by combining organizational economics and strategic management perspectives. Specifically, this study explains the governance modes of the international franchise firm by applying transaction cost theory, agency theory, resource-based and organizational capabilities theory and property rights theory.

Purpose - With the licence season 2013/2014 onwards Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Financial Fair Play (FFP) fully came into force. Among other things, FFP demands from the clubs to operate within their own revenues in order to counteract the increasing over indebtedness in European club football. The purpose of this paper is to cast further light on the relationship between UEFA and the clubs as the main actors of FFP and to derive implications to UEFA to improve the efficacy of this regulatory intervention. Design/methodology/approach - This paper explicitly examines the case of FFP from an agency theory perspective. A positivist agency approach is applied in order to describe and explain (potential) problems in the relationship between UEFA and the clubs. Findings - The paper demonstrates that the relationship between UEFA and the clubs corresponds in many aspects to a classic principal-agent problem. A potential conflict of interest between both actors is outlined which together with asymmetric information creates incentives for opportunistic behaviour on the part of the clubs. The necessity of a stronger emphasis and communication of the economic and sport ethical legitimacy of FFP is detected. Practical implications - It is suggested that UEFA should consider taking a more proactive stance and endeavour to prevent non-compliance not only by limiting the opportunities to do so but also by providing information as well as education. Originality/value - FFP is supposed to have ground-breaking consequences for European club football. This is the first paper to systematically examine (potential) agency problems inherent in FFP.

The purpose of this research is to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for interpreting Shariah governance mechanism in Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). After reviewing existing theories that were used to explain the phenomenon of corporate governance, three most commonly used theories in the corporate governance and Shariah governance area namely agency theory, stewardship theory and stakeholder theory were used and integrated based on their interrelated concepts and their relationship with Shariah governance. The constructed theoretical framework includes five concepts, namely accountability, disclosure and transparency, competency, confidentiality and independency among the key functionaries in Shariah governance, which are perceived to be the principles of Shariah governance. This research is among the first attempts to build an integrated theoretical foundation for Shariah governance in IFIs and the developed theoretical framework can be used as the basis for interpretations and comparisons on the ideal versus practical situation of Shariah governance in IFIs.

The terminology, definition and context of project governance have become a focal subject for research and discussions in project management literature. This article reviews literature on the subject of project governance and categorises the arguments into three schools of thought namely the single-firm school, multi-firm school and large capital governance school. The single-firm school is concerned with governance principles related to intra-organisational projects and practice these principles at a technical level. The multifirm school addresses the governance principles concerned with two of more organisations participating on a contractual basis on the same project and focuses its governance efforts at the technical and strategic level. The large capital school considers projects as temporary organisations, forming their own entity and establishing governance principles at an institutional level. From these schools of thought it can be concluded that the definition of project governance is a function of stakeholder complexity and functional positioning in the organisation. It is also evident that further research is required to incorporate other governance variables and related theories such as transaction theory, social networks and agency theory. The development of project governance frameworks should also consider the complexity of projects spanning across international companies, across country borders and incorporating different value systems, legal systems, corporate governance guidelines, religions and business practices.

Should responsibility for strategic planning and execution be assigned to the same manager? Should a firm have a chief operating officer with responsibilities distinct from those of the chief executive officer? How does the division of labor affect managerial opportunism? This paper uses a formal agency-theoretic model to address these questions and present a new theory of the division of managerial labor. Building on Penrose's typology [Penrose E (2009) The Theory of the Growth of the Firm, 4th ed. (Blackwell, Oxford, UK)], the theory identifies when to assign (i) entrepreneurial services, which relate to strategic planning and the acquisition of resources, and (ii) managerial services, which relate to execution, to the same generalist manager rather than to different specialists. The analysis reveals the critical importance of separability, i.e., whether a supervisor can separately observe the outcomes of entrepreneurial and managerial services. If managers and their supervisor have symmetric information about separability, hiring a generalist dominates because managerial services, which are easier to assess, reduce the scope for opportunism associated with entrepreneurial services, which are harder to assess. Conversely, if managers have better information regarding separability and the probability of separability is low, hiring specialists dominates because hiring a generalist allows the potential for opportunism associated with entrepreneurial services to contaminate the provision of managerial services. Even so, the benefits of hiring a generalist may be restored if the services are sequenced appropriately. An implication of such sequencing is that a firm will grow in fits and starts, giving rise to a "Penrose effect" even if labor market frictions do not impede the assimilation of new managers.

We examine how time preferences impact the financing decision of firms. We hypothesize that the degree of long-term orientation in a country is positively related to the use of bank relationship lending. Based on a thorough theoretical investigation and an extensive empirical analysis using a large, worldwide dataset, we find strong support for our hypothesis on the role of time preferences for financial intermediation. Our results are robust to controlling for other determinants of the choice of debt financing as well as to applying alternative variables and different estimation methods. Firms in long-term orientation countries appear to prefer relationship bank financing, since it is usually available for the long run and will not be withdrawn quickly in response to adverse developments. This allows managers to preserve a more strategic view and pursue longer planning horizons. (c) 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Unlike most other mature industries, family firms, partnerships, and cooperatives dominate the agricultural production sector, with few corporations and limited access to capital derived from a source other than retained earnings and existing owners. However, the use of external equity capital in agriculture has increased dramatically since 1990. This funding source allows farms to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities not easily financed by debt. Following O. Williamson, we view debt and equity as alternative governance structures and argue that transaction cost economics offers insights on firms' financial structure beyond those provided by agency theory. We relate capital structure to asset specificity, a particularly important attribute in agricultural production. We construct an international dataset of agricultural companies receiving external private equity and show that the attributes of the assets involved in production are important determinants of financial structure.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

In this study, we examine the interactions among cooperation and five other factors that affect supply chain performance in the context of third party logistics services. We develop a new research model, with degree of cooperation as a mediating construct and test the model's six research hypotheses using structural equation modelling. The data are from 105 manufacturing firms in Taiwan. The results show that the major factors contributing to cooperation are, in order of importance, self-control costs, transaction frequency and external uncertainty. The findings demonstrate that supply chain members should reinforce their collaborative behavior and activities and enhance cooperation in supply chains to achieve higher levels of performance overall in third party logistics services.

Independent franchisees work cooperatively with service franchisors to strengthen the franchisor's brand name. However, agency theory predicts that franchisor inputs such as brand names and operational routines might be harmed by franchisees' free riding. In addition, previous literature has addressed the issues of strategic group emergence and performance differences between groups in recent decades. Thus, this study builds upon an emerging symbiotic view of franchising behind agency theory and incorporates a strategic groups level of analysis to investigate whether franchisees have strong incentives to maintain standards as franchisor seeking market penetration. By investigating potential brand equity differences among service franchisors for Taiwanese telecommunications service chains, this study found that different strategic groups exist in service franchising chains. From replication testing, the current results demonstrate that service franchising brand equity heterogeneities exist among franchisors within and across strategic groups. Therefore, this study broadens agency theory's explanation of service franchising. (c) 2014 (c) 2014 Taylor & Francis.

This chapter examines the theoretical foundations of Governance Ethics and in doing so, it challenges pertinent aspects of the standard economic theory of the firm, in particular the exclusion of ethical and political aspects from the epistemic interests of economics. Governance ethics has to be understood as a contribution to the development of a new economics of organization. Its aim is to combine foundations and findings of ethics, social theory, organization theory and economics of governance in a productive way in order to improve the practical relevance and the theoretical explanatory force of an economic theory of the firm. What is at issue is the integration of organizational, social, psychological, cultural and above all moral phenomena in an economics of governance which takes an interdisciplinary understanding of economics and a comprehensive concept of governance as its starting point. This endeavor is based on the assumption that a general and at the same time application-oriented theory of economic organization and monitoring cannot be achieved without this ethical, social-theoretical and organization-theoretical extension of standard and mainstream economics.

This chapter is based on the theoretical integration of stakeholder management in a governance approach and attempts to answer questions on the boundaries of a firm, the nature of its relationship to society and the nature of the firm in general. The basic assumption is that the firm can be understood as a social form of governance for bilateral and multilateral, contractually organized stakeholder relationships. In this outline stakeholders are self-interested owners of resources who form a team for the utilization of these resources and the creation of economic added value as long as a cooperation rent can be achieved for all the participants. As the owners of resources, stakeholders constitute and reproduce a team through their transactions and they are not, as a wide-spread assumption in the discussion suggests, to be understood as "claimant groups" external to the firm but as its internal assets, whose efficiency and effectiveness for the team and its members depend on the form and the organization of its governance structure. In this theoretical perspective economic cooperation is always the result of social cooperation and stakeholder dialogues, multi-stakeholder forums, deliberative discourses etc. represent an opportunity for managing the resources of a team, which is needed because of the specific nature of the resources involved in the implementation of a particular transaction. In this sense corporate governance cannot be restricted to a monitoring function. Instead it must be seen as the capacity to lead, manage and monitor the resources of a cooperative project designed to generate factor income and a cooperation rent. This approach implies that stakeholder management is a fundamental strategic task of corporate governance and not simply the business of a firm's communication department. This includes participation in networks of stakeholders which have the task of contributing to the solution of the social and hence also of the economic problems of the firm.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

We explore one prolific type of service triad, the franchise triad, involving three primary stakeholders: the franchisor, the franchisee and the customer. In this triad, franchisees use their affiliation with the franchisor's brand to attract customers to their local outlets. In exchange for the right of assuming the identity of the brand, the franchisee pays the franchisor royalties and retains residual profits. Applying Agency Theory, this paper examines the inherent conflict of interests between a principal (i.e., franchisor) that controls and manages brand equity as a shared resource and an agent (i.e., franchisee) that retains pricing right and profits from the identity of the brand by interacting directly with customers. We empirically isolate the effect of triad structure on outlet performance by matching two unique datasets. One set of data captures operational performance in the form of aggregated online review scores and the other financial performance including average daily hotel rate and revenue per available room. We find that franchisees charge higher prices than their corporate counterparts even when controlling for operational performance. Even though franchisees charge higher prices they maintain similar financial performance in terms of revenue per available room. These results suggest that the triad structure plays a significant role in franchisees' ability to free-ride on shared brand equity and have important managerial implications for effective outsourcing, contract design and performance evaluation for a wide range of service industries.

Relying on an alternative theoretical framework (i.e. institutional theory), rather than the dominant agency theory, this paper examines the connections between corporate governance mechanisms and good practices, as informed by an empirical and contextual analysis. On the basis of research methods triangulation, this study presents nine specific antecedents of good corporate governance in weak institutional settings (Nigeria). The study proposes how each of these antecedents must be understood, articulated and harnessed, on the basis of relevant institutional peculiarities, in order to address contextual governance challenges. This study adds to the institutional theorising of good corporate governance, by paying attention to the context (African), efficiency (instrumentality) and legitimacy (symbolic) in explaining the firm-level drivers of good governance practices in an international business environment.

Collaborating with a supplier in a buying firm's new product development (NPD) project is commonly advocated and adopted, but does not always improve project performance. Some pre-existing collaboration contexts, such as buyer-supplier NPD projects, are especially exposed to supplier opportunism due to the uncertain nature of the collaboration process. Adopting agency theory and transaction cost theory perspectives, we examine: (i) contextual antecedents and project consequences of supplier opportunism and (ii) if these causal influences vary in different cultural and institutional contexts. Using a survey sample of 214 United States (U.S.) and 212 Chinese buying firms' responses about buyer-supplier NPD projects, we find that supplier opportunism is significantly influenced by the task and relational contexts. We also show that supplier opportunism damages both design quality and efficiency, two aspects of project performance. When comparing U.S. to China, we find that task and relational contexts have a greater impact on supplier opportunism in the U.S., but design efficiency is less hurt by supplier opportunism there. Finally, we show challenges of preventing supplier opportunism in certain NPD collaboration contexts, and offer solutions for overcoming these challenges. (c) 2015 Decision Sciences Institute.

Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries--often labeled "lack of transparency"--between top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high.

In many business schools, the field of strategic management has been elevated to the same status as more traditional subject areas such as finance, marketing and organizational behaviour. However, the field is rather unclearly delineated at present, as a result of the heavy usage of borrowed theories, a phenomenon we discuss in this article. For strategic management to become a legitimate subject area, truly at par with the more conventional fields taught in business schools, we recommend much stronger selectivity when borrowing theories from other areas of scholarly inquiry than management, as the foundation of empirical work. We propose a new model consisting of seven quality tests to assess whether proper selectivity is being applied when 'importing' concepts from other fields than management. Our perspective has major implications both for future, evidence-based strategic management research and for the field's key stakeholders such as strategy teachers, practitioners and policy makers - who rely on research outputs from strategy scholars.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems are increasingly used in construction projects. Theoretically, these systems provide greater transparency and access to construction project information and, in doing so, should reduce the information asymmetry that commonly arises in construction contracting relationships. This typically occurs when suppliers of products and services opportunistically take advantage of the client due to the imbalance in information. The article therefore explores whether or not the high level of information content offered by BIM and the potential for sharing that information among contracting parties means that the information asymmetry can be alleviated using BIM. In order to investigate this, evidence was collected through three purposively sampled case studies of large principal organizations undertaking projects in Australia - each representing a different type of customer in the supply chain on construction projects. Our findings suggest a gap between the theoretical potential and practical application of BIM to reduce information asymmetry. The study found that, although BIM has the capability to reduce information asymmetry, it has not reached a mature enough stage in the Australian construction industry to clearly confirm that it actually reduces the problem. There is even a degree of evidence that, under certain circumstances, a reverse asymmetry may exist in which a client has the technical knowledge to more successfully analyze the BIM model (relative to the organizations they contract with) and then use the resulting information to their own opportunistic advantage.

We combine the formalism of a principal-agent framework with a value-based analysis in order to investigate the micro-foundations of business partner selection and the division of value in contracting relationships. In particular, we study how the key contracting parameters such as efficiency, transactional integrity, incentive alignment, and gaming affect outcomes when buyers face competing suppliers. We show that integrity and efficiency increase value creation and capture for all parties and are complements. While incentive gaming is unambiguously bad for value creation, and reduces buyers' value capture, it can benefit some suppliers. For alignment, we find that neither party has an incentive to use fully aligned performance measures that maximize total value creation. We conclude by analyzing buyers' and suppliers' incentives to invest in integrity. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper explores corporate social responsibility (CSR) within the franchising sector. More specifically, using regulation theory, stakeholder-agency theory, transaction cost analysis, and literature on plural form, along with an empirical study conducted on the franchising sector in the French market, we find significant and positive relationships between chain size and the extent of corporate social disclosure (CSD) on franchisors' websites and between the percentage of company-owned units within the chain and the extent of CSD on franchisors' websites. Moreover, though findings reveal that 86.03 percent of the 136 sampled franchisors communicate about at least one of their CSR activities on their websites, differences in terms of highlighted categories (e.g., environment, human resources, and products) and the extent of available CSR information exist.

This study investigates how franchising chains use advertising to enhance coordination and improve their control over prices set at franchised outlets. We argue that chains use price advertising to inform customers about their desired prices, thereby influencing franchisees to adopt the advertised prices although they are not contractually required to do so. We test our hypotheses using rich outlet-level price data collected before and after a U.S. nationwide advertising campaign by McDonald's. Our findings indicate that advertising is an effective mechanism that franchising chains use to improve their control over franchisees, enhance uniformity, and reduce franchisee free-riding.

Recently, outside blockholders, external owners that hold 5% or more of their firms' outstanding common stockholdings, have been pressuring their firms to engage in divestiture activities. This study considers whether the influence of those owners also extends to how the divestiture is implemented, whether through spin-off or sell-off. Tests of an agency theory model using data from 205 divestitures show that the adoption of spin-offs or sell-offs is associated with the amount of outstanding common stockholdings held by outside blockholders and the size of the unit divested. Spin-offs are used more frequently when outside blockholders own more of the divesting firm's stockholdings and the divested unit is larger, while sell-offs tend to be selected when outside blockholders own less stock and the divested business is smaller. Consistent with agency theory expectations, spin-offs would allow the blockholders to decide whether to hold or sell their interests in the divested firm, a decision they could make in accordance with their individual portfolio risks. Sell-offs of small units could be used to preserve organizational diversity and produce proceeds that would help the divesting firm's managers pursue their self-interests. Overall, outside blockholders appear to shape how divestitures are done, even if they cannot directly intervene in their firms' operations. (c) The Author(s) 2012

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines how separation of cash flow and voting rights influences performance of firms affiliated with large family business groups. Complementing the dominant view grounded in agency theory, we suggest that the separation of cash flow and voting rights has positive influence on firm performance in the context of large family business groups. Research Findings/Insights: Using the data from the large family business groups in Korea, or Chaebols, between 2003 and 2010, we found that the separation is positively associated with firm accounting performance, but not with market performance. We also found that the effect of the separation is moderated by analyst coverage, R&D expenditure, and sales share in the business group. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study reveals that in the large family business groups, the context in which the separation most frequently occurs, the separation not only induces the controlling minority shareholders to pursue private benefits of control but also accompanies financing benefits from active use of the internal capital market. In addition, this study notes the importance of addressing the endogeneity in the analysis of the relation between ownership structure and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers planning to enforce/revoke the regulation on the separation of cash flow and voting rights in the pursuit of corporate governance reform especially in countries with poor shareholder protection.

Purpose - This study aims to examine the role the structure of corporate boards plays in the failure of the firm. Specifically, it examines whether the remuneration committee is related to corporate failure in the UK. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 failed and 269 non-failed UK-listed non-financial firms between the periods of 1994 and 2011. This study used pooled cross-sectional, fixed and random effects LOGIT models to estimate whether corporate failure is related to remuneration committee in the UK. Findings - The findings indicate that corporate failure is negatively related to the independence of the remuneration committee chairman and remuneration committee's effectiveness but not remuneration committee's presence, size and meetings. However, a positive and significant relationship was observed between corporate failure and remuneration committee independence. Practical implications - The findings of the study provide support for the appropriateness of agency theory as analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of remuneration committee, especially the independence of the remuneration committee chairperson, as a board monitoring device, in the context of corporate failure. Originality/value - The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance by establishing the likely causes of corporate failure in the UK. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This chapter provides a synoptic description of the main theories that see inter-organizational relationships as coordination and control issues: the Transaction Costs Economics theory, the Agency theory and the Resource Dependence theory. These three theories share the idea that inter-organizational relationships are founded on opportunism and bounded rationality, and that organizations seek to control the critical aspects of their business network interactions in order to pursue their goals. These three theories are often considered as complementary in literature, since they often provide opposite predictions in similar cases. Scholars interested in e-marketplaces and in the inter-organizational impacts of the Internet have mainly focused on the Transaction Costs Economics theory so far; this theory has undergone important evolution and hybridization processes, and is then more thoroughly described than the other two in this chapter.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider the way in which agency theory has crowded out other approaches to understanding the governance of modern businesses. The paper rescues the meaning and context which informed the American corporate governance reform movement originally and demonstrates how the economically predicated agency approach became dominant in academic considerations of corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach - Both primary and secondary sources were considered in a Foucauldian history of ideas approach. Findings - Other approaches to corporate governance have been pushed out of the mainstream of corporate governance discourse by an economic model which excludes many of the key issues which informed the notion originally. Practical implications - Dominant academic attitudes to corporate governance have occluded other ways in which the governance of corporations can be understood. Originality/value - Previous accounts of corporate governance have ignored the alternative approaches represented before agency theory became dominant. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Top management of a multidivisional firm needs to strike a balance between providing transfer pricing autonomy to divisional managers and retaining some level of control to prevent dysfunctional behavior. Little empirical evidence exists on how top management makes this trade-off. Drawing on agency theory, we predict that transfer pricing autonomy is influenced by intermediate product standardization, foreign investment, tax rate difference, and the weight on firm-level performance measures in the divisional manager's performance evaluation. We also predict that the extent of mismatch between transfer pricing autonomy and organizational characteristics leads to lower perceived fairness and perceived transfer pricing effectiveness by divisional managers. Using data collected from a cross-sectional survey of 210 divisional managers, we find results consistent with our predictions. (c) 2015, American Accounting Association. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This paper aims to explore organizational structure, efficiency and evolution, and its relationship to bureaucracy. A new mathematical model is utilized to generate theoretically consistent relationships between economic performance and organizational scale and structure, and to develop a taxonomy of organizational structure. Design/methodology/approach: A systems approach is used to model structural evolution and generate consistent, testable hypotheses concerning organizational sustainability and financial performance. This theoretical treatment seeks to reconcile contradictory views of bureaucracy, modeling both positive and negative impacts on performance and behavior. A variant of agency theory is used as an organizing paradigm, based on three competing organizational needs: control, autonomy and ownership of consequences. Findings: Simulations reveal that organizations evolve through five stages of development: from an entry (flat/parallel) stage, through a hybrid or mixed stage, to the massively serial (hierarchical) stage. As firms evolve, the risk/return ratio first falls as employment expands, but later rises as higher levels of hierarchy appear. Eventually, organizational complexity rises sufficiently to produce lower levels of managerial ownership of consequences and professional autonomy, as well as higher levels of control, leading to a collapse of organizational efficiency. A subtle variation of agency theory is revealed: upper-management may maximize organizational depth, increasing salary differences between levels. Originality/value: This paper uses an internally consistent, deductive framework to elucidate relationships between task complexity, skill level, industry life-cycle and firm age - providing the first known attribute-based metric for organizational complexity. This approach is reminiscent of Perrow's (1999) non-mathematical treatment of organizational systems complexity. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between employee share ownership (ESO) and employer-provided training. To be more specific, as both ESO and involvement practices can contribute to developing human capital, the paper addresses the question of whether they are substitutes or complements in the relationship with training. Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical hypotheses are tested using the French nationally representative establishment-level survey, REPONSE, which is similar to the British WERS. The sample consists of 1,523 establishments. Findings - The results are consistent with studies conducted elsewhere (e.g. in the UK) and provide novel findings, thereby suggesting a complementarity between ESO and involvement practices with bundles of practices becoming increasingly more complex as training expenditures increase. Research limitations/implications - To provide further insights, future research that uses more precise information regarding ESO plans is needed. Practical implications - Results can provide HR managers with valuable information regarding the organisational characteristics necessary to ensure a fertile ground for their training expenses. Originality/value - The paper reflects a growing awareness that human capital development and share ownership plans may be related and that this relationship might be a more compelling explanation for share ownership plans than the standard agency theory. The contribution of ESO plans to the development of employee competencies may be at least as important as their possible effects on employee motivation and effort.

This study examines how organizational form (corporate or franchised store) and local market characteristics (competition, size and risk of sanctions) influence retail stores' likelihood of selling alcohol to minors. Drawing on agency theory, we hypothesize that franchised stores are more likely than corporate stores to sell alcohol to minors. We also examine whether local market competition, risk of sanctions, and market size influence the relationship between franchising and alcohol sales to minors. We test the hypotheses with data collected by minors attempting to purchase alcohol in retail stores. The results offer partial support to the theoretical predictions and have implications for retail chains and regulators. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the main, project management subscribes to an objective view of the organisation, relatively free of political and psychosocial tensions. But, this may be misleading in the context of projects where the stakes are numerous and complex. The article views the project from three perspectives: the conventional rational perspective, with the prism of the mandate; the atypical political perspective, with the prism of the principals; and the atypical psychosocial perspective, with the prism of the agents. It emerges that the rational perspective may be sufficient to assess and manage a project when efficiency prevails in both the parent and the client organisations. However, the project manager would be better served to use an integrative approach that also includes the political perspective when the organisations involved have differing expectations regarding the project, as well as the psychosocial perspective when project team members have a great deal of autonomy.

The Shariah law makes Amanah (trustworthiness) a fundamental obligation for all the contractual parties. From the agency theory perspective, we, thus, investigate managerial trustworthiness in capital structure decisions of Shariah firms and compare it with those of Non-Shariah firms, in the light of Islamic principle of Amanah (trustworthiness). Specifically, we examine whether capital structure of Shariah firms is partially influenced by managerial ownership under the motivation of self-interest. Using the data from Pakistan, our results show that, unlike Non-Shariah firms, leverage ratios in Shariah firms are insensitive to the varying degree of managerial ownership, indicating absence of managerial opportunism in financial decisions of these firms. For the Non-Shariah firms, on the other hand, our results confirm findings of previous research which reveal that managers manipulate leverage ratios in their own interestat the cost of firm value, indicating the severity of agency conflicts among these firms. Invoking agency theory, we argue that certain firm characteristics (such as lower free cash-flows and lesser liquidity), achieved through Shariah compliance, help Shariah firms mitigate agency conflicts. These features persuade managers to behave less opportunistically than their counterparts in Non-Shariah firms as shown from their financing choices. The results are important for understanding nature of the two types of firms studied and the cross-sectional differences between the capital structure choices of these firms. Besides, our findings have also implications for growing number of Shariah compliant firms and a new clientele of Islamic investors who have entered capital markets due to the Islamic image of Shariah firms in Muslim majority country like Pakistan.

This chapter is based on research (Van Meerveld, 2012; Van Meerveld et al., 2012) and the practical experiences of the second and third authors of this chapter in facilitating forward commitment procurement projects conducted as part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) Innovation for Sustainability Programme and the Low Carbon Building (LCB) Healthcare Network. Although the application of forward commitment procurement (FCP) is limited to a few pilot projects, the outcomes demonstrated are most promising in that they have delivered innovative solutions into the market. Two of the case studies have led to the development of new and innovative solutions and one is progressing towards early adoption of an innovative solution. The chapter applies a theoretical framework in order to examine in more detail how the FCP methodology works, and to provide insights into how the process could be improved and replicated. Its focus is on the role of the market engagement phase of the FCP process. The chapter adopts a case study approach following Yin (2009), and is aimed at answering the following question: What are the effects of adopting the forward commitment procurement framework on the risks perceived by public sector customers and suppliers in projects concerning public procurement for innovation? Procurement involves transactions which involve agencies in the form of customers and suppliers. Therefore, agency theory and transaction cost economics are used to develop the theoretical framework.

The aim of this article is to study the impact that the economic crisis has on the Corporate Social Responsibility actions which Spanish listed companies are carrying out to test if they are really committed to its approach or not. To do so, we base our work on the Slack-Resources Hypothesis and Agency Theory which provide the theoretical framework to explain the different behaviours. The variation of the CSR actions and Financial Performance were analysed before and during the crisis in order to determine the situation of each company. The results show that the majority of Spanish listed companies have maintained or increased their social engagement even though their Financial Performance has decreased due to the crisis. Most of them have a Reference Shareholder. (c) 2015, Universia Holding. All rights reserved.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore product adoption beliefs and actions of a large retail food organization with both corporate-owned stores and privately held franchise stores. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used a case study approach involving survey data collection from 190 corporate-owned and licensed retail outlets that were members of a large, single organization. Ordinary least squares regression and mean differences (t-tests) were used to test the data. Findings were elaborated upon based upon structured interviews. Findings - Corporate-owned retail outlets invested heavily in food safety innovation, while franchised retail outlets pursued minimal investment to retain product flexibility. The level of adoption is contingent upon ownership structure, as well as institutional forces emanating from the corporate environment, the customer, and peer organizations. Research limitations/implications - The findings offer greater insight into methodological issues associated with measurement of new product adoption in particular. The authors have shown that it is critical for researchers to clarify the level of analysis of the study. Quantitative survey analysis revealed both safety and economic motivations to be desirable issues in product adoption considerations. However, when quantitative and qualitative results were combined, very different outcomes were realized as ownership structure differences appear to dominate product adoption decisions. Therefore, when conducting plural organizational form research, the data gathering efforts must be carefully undertaken to ensure that critical drivers of phenomena explored are not overlooked. Practical implications - Adoption of new product adoption involves the complex interplay between ownership structure/control, economic cost/benefit, managerial choice, and societal norms. Often, organizational research relating to adoption of new processes and innovations collects individual-level data. However, this study shows that adoption decisions occur at multiple levels and that the ownership/structural context must be considered. Social implications - The study has implications from social innovation/responsibility perspectives. Recent press regarding food safety has put pressure on food processing establishments to consider methods of reducing food safety breaches. No doubt, this has alerted the consumer to potential risks in food processing and influenced their preferences in favor of food safety innovations. Nonetheless, perceptions of the importance of "safety" can be interpreted in a variety of ways, leading to differingcourses of action. Interviews with corporate-level executives revealed that they preferred both corporate-owned and franchised retail outlets adopt case ready (CR) meats to stem safety concerns. Yet, this aspiration diffused throughout the organization differently. Originality/value - Multiple organizational structure forms operating within the same organizational entity, or "plural form" organizations, offer unique opportunities for examination. Applying various theoretical lenses, including agency theory, the resource-based theory, and institutional theory, the authors offer rationale for why different structural types within the same corporate entity may differ in their beliefs and actions concerning product safety, cost, and adoption.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore post-acquisition compensation management and examine how the two most commonly used theories to explain CEO stock option exercise, agency theory and CEO overconfidence, expect CEOs to manage their stock options following an acquisition. Design/methodology/approach - Using logistic regression analysis, the authors investigate whether CEOs are more or less likely to exercise options following an acquisition, and the effect which CEO tenure and acquisition history may have on option exercise. Findings - The results suggest that CEOs are more likely to exercise options following an acquisition. The authors also find that CEO tenure and acquisition experience are both linked to an increase in option exercise. Research limitations/implications - The findings suggest that future research should expect agency effects to outweigh overconfidence effects when considering CEO stock option exercise behavior within the post-acquisition firm context. Practical implications - This paper advises directors and shareholders about whether agency concerns or overconfidence are of greater concern and how CEO tenure and past acquisition history may influence post-acquisition CEO stock option exercise behavior, offering information valuable in designing effective corporate governance. Originality/value - This paper is among the first to explore how CEOs manage their options following an acquisition and finds that CEOs are more likely to exercise stock options following an acquisition. Post-acquisition compensation management is an important, though overlooked, consideration in improving acquisition performance. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The problem of managerial control and the concept of corporate governance have long been the subject of researches, often linked to widely known organizational theories (transaction cost theory, agency theory ...). But it seems that these analyzes, especially because they are too focused on relations with the shareholders and neglect the examination of "managerial discretion", can only incompletely account for the status and the actual behavior of top managers. The author proposes to follow various paths to overcome this situation by enriching the narrow approaches that are dominant today. (c) 2015, Lavoisier.

In this work-in-progress paper we address the issue of governance forms and its influence on performance in distribution channels. We use the typology from Mintzberg to define different dimensions of governance form and its implications on performance. To address these issues we draw on transaction cost theory, principal-agency theory and the theory of interfirm trust. (c) 2015, Academy of Marketing Science.

The paper investigates the relationship between organizational trust and a firm's market value through the perspective of company size. The paper addresses the theoretical and empirical gap regarding the effects of organizational trust on a firm's value by embarking on stewardship and agency theories. This provides a theoretical framework to extend the understanding of an organizational trust's influence on a firm's market value based on company size considering the extent to which a firm's size plays a role in determining the market value effect. Furthermore, the effects of firm size on an organizational trust's impact on market value were tested empirically through a moderation analysis drawing on a sample of 198 firms listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It has been found that there is no significant association between organizational trust climate and a firm's market value. However, what materialized from this investigation, as predicted, is that the aggregate impact of the internal trust climate on market value depends on company size. Specifically, it is reported that high trust diminishes the value of big firms, but at the same time contributes to a firm's value in the case of small firms. Although these results might seem surprising, they are supported by arguments derived from the stewardship and agency theories distinguishing the possible positive and negative outcomes of organizational trust under different conditions.

Previous studies have not examined the performance of multi-unit franchise systems. The paper addresses this research gap by investigating franchisor performance of multi-unit franchise system from an organizational economics perspective by using data from Germany and Switzerland. According to the agency theory they show that under a strong brand name free-riding risk may be reduced through MUF and hence MUF positively influences the performance the systems. In addition, the data support the transaction cost hypothesis that environment uncertainty is negatively related to the performance of MUF systems. Furthermore, using property rights theory, they show that intangible local market assets are negatively and intangible system-specific assets are positively associated with MUF performance. Finally, the results indicate that decentralization of decision making has a positive performance effect on MUF systems. (c) Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

The organization of interfirm networks, such as alliances, joint ventures, cooperatives, franchise and retail chains, has become an important research topic in the field of organizational economics, strategic management, and organization theory. Organizational economics refers to the application of agency theory (Blair and Lafontaine 2005), property rights theory (Hart and Moore 1990; Baker et al. 2008) and transaction cost theory (Williamson 1991; Marcher and Richman 2008; Meiseberg and Ehrmann 2013; Mumdziev and Windsperger 2013), and strategic management as well as organization theory refer to the application of resource-based theory (Barney and Clark 2007), knowledge-based theory and organizational capability theory (Teece et al. 1997; Nonaka et al. 2000; Helfat et al. 2007), real options theory (Reuer and Tong 2005, 2007) as well as the relational governance perspective (Dyer and Singh 1998; Gulati 2007; Arranz and Fdez. de Arroyabe 2012; Griessmair et al. 2014). More recently, a promising research direction is the use of multi-theoretical perspectives to explain formal and relational governance issues in interfirm networks (e.g. Combs and Ketchen 1999; Poppo and Zenger 2002; Mayer and Salomon 2006; Mesquita et al. 2008; Hendrikse and Feng 2013; Jell-Ojobor and Windsperger 2014).

The ownership of corporations has been studied in multiple disciplines and using diverse theoretical frameworks for several decades. Despite a wealth of research, both research gaps and contradictory findings are common. This is partly due to the fragmentation of the foci of individual studies. We synthesize the work done to date through a content analysis of 145 articles and 523 effect size estimates. On the basis of this review, we develop an integrated perspective to understand how institutional, government, family, executive, and board ownership affect a variety of firm outcomes. We conclude by offering new theoretical and contextual directions to better understand the role of ownership in shaping firm outcomes. (c) 2016, (c) The Author(s) 2016.

We examine the unique nature of agency problems within publicly traded family firms by investigating the earnings management decision of dominant family owners relative to non-family. To do so, we draw upon literature demonstrating that family owners are loss averse with respect to the family's socioemotional wealth, or the affective endowment derived from firm ownership and control. Our theory and findings suggest that potential reputational consequences of earnings management lead family principals to engage in less of this practice relative to non-family firms, and that founder family firms are less likely than non-founder family firms to use earnings management. Moreover, the family-firm effect varies with the firm size, the degree of CEO entrenchment, and the firm's stock structure. We provide important insights regarding differences between family and non-family principals in the use of unethical accounting practices, thereby extending agency theory and advancing an underdeveloped research area.

In prior research which explores the relationship between organizational slack and corporate social performance (CSP) it is implicitly assumed that slack is homogeneous and positively affects CSP. In this study we build on recent research which argues that slack is heterogeneous and can be conceptualized as financial, human resources, and innovational in nature. We view the slack-CSP relationship from both organizational and agency theory perspectives. We propose that different slack conceptualizations and the contrary assumptions of aforementioned theories hold divergent implications for CSP. We test our hypotheses on a longitudinal sample of public corporations in the United States and confirm this divergent impact. Our results suggest that the relationship between organizational slack and CSP is more complex than previously understood. We discuss the implications of our findings for the slack-resource hypothesis of CSP. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: While anecdotal evidence suggests that performance-based contracts (PBCs) may foster innovation in buyer-supplier relationships, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms is limited to date. The purpose of this paper is to draw on transaction cost economics and agency theory to develop a theoretical model that explains how PBCs may lead to innovation. Design/methodology/approach: Using data on 106 inter-organizational relationships from the Dutch maintenance industry, the authors investigate how the two main features of PBCs - low-term specificity and performance-based rewards - affect incremental and radical innovation. Findings: The authors find that term specificity has an inverse-U-shaped effect on incremental innovation and a non-significant negative effect on radical innovation. Furthermore, pay-for-performance has a stronger positive effect on radical innovation than on incremental innovation. The findings suggest that in pursuit of incremental innovation, organizations should draft contracts with low, but not too low, term specificity and incorporate performance-based rewards. Radical innovation may be achieved by rewarding suppliers for their performance only. Originality/value: The findings suggest that in pursuit of incremental innovation, organizations should draft contracts with low, but not too low, term specificity and incorporate performance-based rewards. Radical innovation requires rewarding suppliers for their performance only. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In the public sector, the strategic quest for IT-based innovation often starts by hiring a successful private sector CIO and hoping his or her prior experience will transfer. However this often ignores the existence and influence of other entities and IT governance structures that form the innovation ecosystem. Applying the legal view of agency theory to the U.S. state innovation ecosystem and using a crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (csQCA) approach, we investigate factors that are associated with public sector IT-based innovation. We find that CIO characteristics, structural oversight mechanisms, CIO relationships with authorities, and the state environment combine to form configurations that lead to both high and low performance.

Deadlines are common in product development and are often felt to be too harsh-many development efforts are still worth continuing at the time of mandated termination. We examine the value of deadlines from the agency-theoretic perspective. We consider a firm that pays an agent to lead product development activities. The chance of success depends on the viability of the project and the effort of the agent. As the project proceeds without success, doubts grow as to whether the project is viable. To motivate continued effort, the firm must promise the agent a generous reward if success is achieved during the late stage of development. However, rewarding late success undermines effort incentives in the early stage. The firm may find it more profitable to impose a hard, early deadline to eliminate the agent's dynamic incentive to procrastinate. We derive conditions under which the firm should impose such deadlines. (c) 2016 INFORMS.

With the aim of achieving an advanced understanding of current research on unrelated diversification and providing fruitful groundwork to foster active interchange between disciplinary traditions, this paper detects articles from two relevant research streams; i.e., strategic management and financial economics. We first provide a brief overview of management thinking on unrelated diversification strategy. Then, we present a conceptual map that offers a comprehensive appreciation of unrelated diversification strategy antecedents (i.e., environmental and institutional, organizational value-enhancing, and managerial drivers), implementation process (i.e., managerial complexity, misallocation of resources, and structural inertia), and consequences (i.e., diversification premiums and discounts). Finally, we unpack the major gaps in our current knowledge that may help refocus the research agenda on unrelated diversification strategy and revamp the apparent waning proclivity of this issue.

Purpose: This paper argues how Islamic altruism and reciprocity can enhance or drain the supply of Islamic equity finance. The paper also analyzes the feasibility of Islamic equity finance through the lens of new institutional economics (NIE) and transaction cost economics (TCE). Design/methodology/approach: One of the salient contributions by NIE is to support the proposition that effective contracting depends greatly on institutions in terms of "rules that constrain economic behavior", including informal or intangible institutions, such as religion, culture and customary practices. This paper draws on the theoretical contributions of the NIE and TCE and applies some of these contributions to an analysis of general altruism and reciprocity in Islamic economies. Findings: It is said that solutions based on the Islamic injunctions (collectively termed as spiritual quotient) could serve to mitigate agency risks. However, in theory, the Muslim principal (particularly fund providers) is exposed to higher agency risk unless appropriate rules of protecting the right of the principal (or of punishing the agent when its opportunistic behavior is revealed) are devised, because the Muslim fund providers have the divine obligation to share risks in enterprise under the profit-loss sharing (PLS) scheme as well as to share a portion of income with the poor or those entrepreneurs who face difficulties in fund-raising. Originality/value: Many scholars refer to the lack of the "formal" institutions that hinder the sound development of Islamic venture capital (VC). This paper contributes to shedding an analytical light on the unique feature of the Muslims' "informal" constraints which make them hesitate to invest in Islamic VC. To develop the Islamic VC market, this paper provides a theoretical background to suggest how important it would be for the national financial system to devise some tangible provisions by installing enterprise-friendly regulations as well as adequate incentive and protection mechanisms consistent with Islamic principles.

This study aims to investigate the influence of board interlocking in income smoothing practices in public companies with shares traded on the BM&FBOVESPA. To achieve this objective we adopted a sample comprised of 58 Brazilian companies included in the Bovespa index. The study is classified as empirical and analytical and uses as a proxy for income smoothing a metric called the "smoothing factor" (SF), obtained through the factor analysis technique using the metrics EM1 and EM3 from Leuz, Nanda and Wysocki (2003). As independent variables we employed indicators of social network analysis. From a theoretical point of view, the study is relevant and innovates in making the connection between the resource dependence theory, the agency theory and board interlocking. In practical terms, the study shows the effects of the constitutive elements of corporate social networks, arising from the board interlocking structure, on income smoothing accounting practices. Regression with panel data using fixed effects showed that the constituent elements of corporate social networks tend to influence the practice of smoothing in the sample used. The results of the study show that companies that share board members with other organizations which smooth their results tend to adopt this organizational practice more easily, which can be explained by: (i) companies causing variations in performance due to operational decisions or financial reporting choices; and (ii) managers making use of discretionary practices in the reporting of profits.

In this study, we investigate how persuasiveness of self-Assessment-based post-completion auditing (PCA) reports on capital investment is constructed. We examine what makes companies consider that information in these reports rises to an acceptable quality level. The investigation was motivated by extant agency theory (AT) informed literature suggesting that self-Auditing will entail obvious risks for the quality of PCA reports in terms of data manipulation. We employed actor-network theory as our method theory. The empirical evidence of our case study came from 24 semi-structured interviews and the analysis of the construction of 22 PCA reports of strategic investments in one of the major European forest companies. We add to the capital budgeting literature by identifying and discussing the role of various conditions affecting the construction of persuasiveness of PCA reports. We maintain that the existence of three conditions (i.e. An appropriate collective process, alignment with relevant external/internal reference points, and following of formal guidance) can play a major role in facilitating the production of a persuasive PCA report. Additionally, the paper is able to make sense of the complex process of fabricating the persuasiveness of PCA reports, which would remain a black box when examined from the AT viewpoint only.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide insights into the conduct of recruitment process outsourcing (RPO), based on a real-life case study of one company in Malaysia. The paper analyses the company's process of recruitment outsourcing from beginning to end, in three sections: RPO decision, RPO implementation and RPO outcome. Design/methodology/approach - The case study was carried out through semi-structured interviews with relevant respondents, including the country HR manager, the HR staff and operation managers in the organisation, plus with the RPO provider. Findings - The key findings, from a theoretical and academic viewpoint, are that RPO decisions and implementation cannot be fully or properly explained by one theory, but are better explained by integrating transaction cost economics, the resource-based view and the Agency Theory. The study also highlights the importance of involving end users in the RPO process. Research limitations/implications - While this single case study gives a clear, in-depth insight into the issues in this particular instance, future research extending to a wider range of organisations would serve to expand the findings and provide more generalisable results. Practical implications - Practitioners and service providers should be able to draw valuable lessons from the experience of Tech-solution, particularly from the different perceptions and levels of satisfaction about the service provider's performance between internal HR and the internal end users (operation managers). Originality/value - This paper provides a specific and detailed analysis of RPO implementation in practice. It also addresses the call for more RPO outsourcing-specific research in the extant literature. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

A key decision for the design of principal-agent agreements is how much control or authority the buyer (or principal) should be allowed to exercise in relation to the seller (or agent). Historically, agency theory has viewed exchange agreements as ranging from those in which the buyer has very high authority over the seller (formal authority) to those in which the buyer and seller are relatively independent so there is little or no authority relation (market exchange). However, some principal-agent agreements reverse the authority relationship usually assumed in agency theory by allowing the seller to exercise authority over the buyer. The authors study this unexplored type of agency agreement and refer to it as "authority relinquishment." Using data collected from interviews with clients and guides on commercial high-altitude mountain expeditions, the authors identify conditions that make authority relinquishment likely. They also identify the benefits and drawbacks of authority relinquishment and compare them with the benefits and drawbacks of two frequently studied approaches to managing agency relationships - formal authority and authority decentralization.

Given the growth of franchising globally, now is an important time to consider the international expansion trends of franchisors. This study examines current trends in the international expansion plans of United States franchisors using a unique data set drawn from 438 announcements on the International Franchise Association's website made by 85 franchisors over nine years. The findings describe the scope, duration, markets, entry modes used, and expansion rationale. Contrary to past practices, United States franchisors are more focused on expanding into the emerging markets of Asia rather than the developed markets of the West. It appears that they are attracted by the growth in these markets. Finally, the results are used to summarize the key trends in international franchise expansion and to generate propositions for future research. Some limitations and implications for practice are discussed. (c) 2016, Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Blockholders impact strategic firm decisions because they are better at monitoring managers than dispersed shareholder groups. Nevertheless, we do not sufficiently understand how preferences of different blockholder types impact strategic firm decisions. We discuss this in the context of takeover premiums offered for publicly listed firms. Prior studies have argued that managers are often tempted to offer excessively high premiums. Consistently, blockholders might better control managers and ensure lower premiums. To better understand the impact of blockholder preferences, we focus on the special case of family firms. Specifically, drawing on the behavioral agency model, we hypothesize that bidders with family blockholders offer lower premiums than bidders with other blockholders or bidders without blockholders. Our empirical results support our hypotheses based on a sample of 149 takeover offers. (c) 2015, (c) The Author(s) 2015.

Stock options (hereafter SOs) have been extensively investigated by the literature. The debate has been mainly grounded in the agency theory that has interpreted these tools as mechanisms to align the conflicting interests of managers and owners towards the shareholder value maximization. However, the latest empirical evidence suggests that SOs are often used by opportunistic managers to extract rents to the detriment of shareholders. In addition, literature identifies the perceived cost as a further theoretical lens to interpret the use of SOs. Despite the growing interest around the topic, the research is still fragmented and fails to present a comprehensive picture on the factors that affect the aim of SOs. Our literature review attempts to fill this gap by providing a systematization of the studies on the topic. The paper concludes by presenting the theoretical and practical implications of the study and suggesting directions for future research. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The purpose of this article is to examine the Intellectual Capital (IC) disclosure strategies of high-tech companies under different theoretical perspectives (agency, signalling and proprietary costs theories). According to the agency theory, the failure of traditional financial statements to report the 'soft assets' would lead knowledge-intensive firms (where the components of IC are structurally higher) to provide a higher level of disclosure in order to reduce the greater information asymmetries with external firm agents. However, because of the highly proprietary nature of IC information (proprietary costs theory) as well as the relevance of IC information to externally signal the key sources of superior quality of a company (signalling theory), different IC disclosure strategies may be adopted by managers of intellectual-capital-rich firms, depending on the particular motivations associated with firm-specific characteristics of these companies. Therefore, this study aims to better understand which theoretical framework under examination (if any) is best at interpreting the observed IC disclosure policies of high-tech companies. To this end, we deduce, and test, a set of hypotheses in accordance with the theoretical frameworks considered. The study also takes into account the effects of changes in the governmental regulation concerning non-financial information that occurred during the period examined. The empirical analysis is conducted on all Italian high-tech listed companies and based on longitudinal data (of 5 years: 2007-2011). By using longitudinal data and the population of all of the high-tech Italian companies, the analysis overcomes the well-known limitations of the sampling and the cross-sectional data that provide snapshot results. The findings reveal that the companies' disclosure strategy primarily depends on the specific category of the IC information. In particular, the results suggest that the proprietary costs theory prevails in explaining the companies' disclosure behaviour on internal IC information. The signalling theory prevails in the explanation of the communication strategies about external IC most likely to enhance investors' confidence in the intangible key value drivers relating to relational capital. Finally, for companies examined, higher levels of ownership diffusion represent the primary incentive to disclose human capital information to reduce agency/monitoring costs (in presence of higher leverage) or signal to the market the superior quality (in presence of higher profitability). This article extends the existing empirical literature on IC disclosure behaviour in high-tech industries by analysing the disclosure strategies of high-tech companies under different theoretical perspectives including proprietary cost theory. In addition, the comprehensive regression model (with specific two-way interaction terms) used in this study expands on the extant approaches for the analysis of IC disclosure determinants allowing to capture some aspects that could be omitted when only the explanation variables taken separately are considered. This study has practical implications for various parties, such as regulators. It provides empirical evidence for the primary limits (relating to the proprietary costs) to an introduction of mandatory law requirements regarding the information on internal structure of IC. In particular, our findings prove that companies exposed to the threat of competitive disadvantages prefer not to provide - by formal channels, such as annual reports - additional internal IC information.

Previous research has established that, in addition to provision of financing, venture capitalists (VCs) may add value to new ventures via different types of management support. In this paper, we propose that transaction cost economics (TCE) may complement other theoretical frameworks (e.g., agency theory, the resource-based view, knowledge-based theory, and resource dependence perspective) in explaining CEOs' polar and ambivalent appraisals of the benefits and costs of different types of VC support and the overall value of VC assistance. Following TCE, we approach VC-funded new ventures as hybrids of markets and hierarchies. Hence, we assume that VCs help their portfolio companies both to externalize, or learn to better operate under the market mode of governance, and internalize, or learn to better operate under the hierarchy mode of governance. We propose that VCs use external support to facilitate venture externalization and use internal support to facilitate venture internalization. Based on structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis of data from an online survey that generated 104 valid responses from CEOs of VC-funded new ventures, we establish that CEOs associate VCs' external support positively with the perceived benefits of VC assistance and negatively with the perceived costs of VC assistance. In contrast, CEOs associate VCs' internal support positively both with the perceived benefits and costs of VC assistance. We also demonstrate that CEOs' assessments of the perceived benefits and costs of VC assistance are, respectively, associated positively and negatively with their appraisals of the overall value of VC assistance. Finally, we ascertain that CEO experience is related negatively to CEOs' appraisals of the overall value of VC assistance. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.

Agency theory, despite its influential normative prescriptions, has been subject to a long-standing critique from management scholars for being theoretically inconsistent and empirically unsubstantiated. The article examines how agency theory is rooted in contractarian theory of the firm that by and large renders extant corporate law irrelevant and instead emphasizes the auxiliary benefits of the market (i.e. financial markets). What is addressed as 'the market for corporate control', based on the ceaseless pricing of the shares and bonds issued by public firms, is portrayed as a more effective mechanism for disciplining managers and monitoring the corporate system than corporate legislation and court ruling. This argument, derived from elementary neoclassic economic theory, turns a blind eye to the historical roots of corporate law and overstate the ability of the, e.g., shareholders to assess managerial decision-making on basis of information available in the market. Ultimately, agency theorists and contractarians, in their pursuit of free-market capitalism, seek to disconnect the corporate system from the authority and regulatory control of the state.

Traditional agency theory (principal-agent conflict) has been a widely-accepted theoretical perspective for understanding corporate governance practices in developed economies. Institutions in these economies are characterized by effective contract enforcement, disperse ownership, separation of ownership, and control and protection of minority shareholders' rights. However, the principal-agent relationship, alone, may not be appropriate for analyzing corporate governance in emerging-economy institutional contexts, in which these institutional characteristics are often absent, weak, or poorly implemented. Scholars characterize corporate governance in emerging economies as having a conflict of interest between controlling and minority shareholders, known as the ''principal-principal agency model''. This relatively new sub-field has attracted the attention of scholars across disciplines including finance, economics, and strategy. The present chapter attempts to synthesize and review conceptual and empirical developments regarding principal-principal conflicts, and suggests possible directions for future studies.

Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: The purpose of this study is to ascertain the effects of valuable resources on two factors: the competency to reduce clients' transaction costs and the performance of export intermediaries. The impact of intermediaries' competency to reduce clients' transaction costs on performance is also investigated while the moderating effect of intermediaries' learning orientation on resources, competency to reduce clients' transaction costs, and performance is further examined. Design/ Methodology/ Approach: A postal survey of 400 export intermediary firms was conducted. Samples were accessed from the official database of the Department of Export Promotion, the Ministry of Commerce, Thailand. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses of the study. Research findings: Based on the three theoretical framework of transaction cost theory, agency cost theory and resource-based theory, results show that resources positively affect both intermediaries' competency to reduce clients' transaction costs and performance. It is also noted that intermediaries' competency to reduce clients' transaction costs positively impact on performance. In addition, no moderating effect of learning orientation is found. Theoretical contributions/ Originality: This study is an original attempt to examine the moderating effect of learning orientation on three factors: the relationship among resources, the competency to reduce clients' transaction costs, and performance. Practitioner/ Policy implications: The results show export intermediaries' resources and competencies improve their performance. This will indirectly facilitate export promotion efforts. Research limitations/ Implications: This study surveyed the export intermediary firms in Thailand. Future research may be conducted on a larger scale by focusing on other ASEAN countries as well as survey the performance of firms using export intermediaries. (c) 2016, University of Malaya.

This research seeks to contribute to neo-institutionalism by connecting cognitive variables of the decision maker to the decision maker's ability to take non-isomorphic action. The insights developed in this article are based on the study of a business school in India, and the case study method has been adopted with participant observer technique. The study shows that organisations are sometimes exposed to more than one of the isomorphic forces--coercive, mimetic, and normative, the forces acting together or against each other. In such situations the decision maker is sometimes required to adopt non-isomorphic actions, which signify a departure from the dominant force. I have used the concepts of institutional theory and stakeholder-agency theory, and the evidence in the case, to argue that the decision maker needs the cognitive ability of systems thinking in order to adopt non-isomorphic actions. Two attributes, moral agency and self-efficacy, act as moderators in influencing the decision maker's ability for non-isomorphic action. A model has been developed based on the above propositions.

Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to philosophically address the issue of managerial opportunism and to describe the paradox of the opportunistic executive, particularly when the CEO could be considered as a "criminal-to-be". Design/methodology/approach-It will be seen to what extent governance mechanisms really contributeto prevent managerial opportunism, particularly through compensation packages ("financial carrots"). Then, Oliver E. Williamson's viewpoint will be analyzed on opportunism, as his theory has largely influenced the way agency theories actually define managerial opportunism. Williamson was thinking opportunism without referring to philosophical works. The gap in exploring three basic types of opportunism will be filled: the Smithian egoist, the Hobbesian egoist and the Machiavellian egoist. Findings-The Smithian egoist tries to reach an equilibrium between self-interest and compassion, while the Hobbesian egoist is motivated by self-interest, desire of power and the attitude of prudence. The Machiavellian egoist is always searching for power and makes followers' fear arising. The way governance mechanisms and structures should be designed and implemented could be quite different if the CEO actually behaves as a Smithian, Hobbesian or Machiavellian egoist. CEO's propensity to commit financial crime could largely vary from one type to another: low risk (Smithian egoist), medium risk (Hobbesian egoist) or high risk (Machiavellian egoist). Research limitation/implications-Smith's, Hobbes' and Machiavelli's philosophy was chosen because the agency theory sometimes refers to it, when defining the notion of opportunism. Other philosophies could also be analyzed to see to what extent they are opening the door to opportunism (for example, Spinoza). Originality/value-The paper analyzes managerial opportunism from a philosophical viewpoint. Whether executives are Smithian, Hobbesian or Machiavellian egoists, their opportunism cannot give birth to similar behaviors. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper discusses the cause of the conflict between principal and agent, looking for answers in the disciplines of biology, particularly in the science of criminal anthropology. A setting has been made between the findings of the agency theory and white-collar crime theories, reinterpreting the actions of the agent from their configuration between instinct, heritage and personality. The results in the biological sciences could provide new interpretations and explanations in administration science, moving towards better interpretations of the conflict through more empirical content theories. Overall, despite the ongoing conflict between the parties, their dynamic boosts the results sought by the principal. (c) 2016 Universidad ICESI. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Business enterprises lie at the core of ecosystems that drive economic development and growth in market economies; yet, until recently, mainstream economics has mostly treated firms like homogeneous black boxes run by opportunistic managers. The field of strategic management has developed a more nuanced approach to the understanding of how firms are created, organized and grow, how they innovate and compete and how managers manage. One of the leading paradigms in the field is the dynamic capabilities framework. In this paper, contrasts and complementarities are drawn between dynamic capabilities and economic theories of the firm, including transaction cost economics and agency theory. Connections to the Cambridge school are highlighted, including the duality between Keynes's 'animal spirits' and the dynamic capabilities entrepreneurial owner/manager. Leibenstein's x-inefficiency is juxtaposed here with d-ineffectiveness. Knowledge-based theories of the firm consistent with Cambridge conventions emerge. Intellectual exchange between strategic management and economics is encouraged to help improve the intuition behind models of firms and the economy. (c) The Author 2017.

It discusses the theoretical aspects of agency theory and the various concepts and issues related to it and documents empirical evidences on the mechanisms that diminish the agency cost. The conflict of interest and agency cost arises due to the separation of ownership from control, different risk preferences, information asymmetry and moral hazards. The literatures have cited many solutions like strong ownership control, managerial ownership, independent board members and different committees can be useful in controlling the agency conflict and its cost. This literature survey will enlighten the practitioners and researchers in understanding, analysing the agency problem and will be helpful in mitigating the agency problem.

It is well known that firm-level corporate governance practices vary mainly between rather than within countries, but country-level factors such as legal and financial institutions explain less than 50% of this cross-country variation. In this article we show that two dimensions of national culture-individualism and uncertainty avoidance-capture about 90% of the country fixed effects and outperform the country-level explanatory variables used in prior literature. We argue that culture works through a tradeoff between managerial expertise and certainty of control, a tradeoff largely overlooked by prior literature, that captures a country's preference for the Anglo-Saxon approach versus the direct control approach for governance. Consistent with this argument, we find that the effect of culture on corporate governance varies across firms with different needs for managerial expertise and certainty of control. We also find that culture interacts with other factors to determine firm-level governance. (c) 2017 Academy of International Business. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we provide an introduction to the Special Issue entitled 'Divide and Rule? The Emergence and Implications of Increasingly Disaggregated and Dispersed Headquarters Activities in Contemporary Firms'. The purpose is two-fold. First, we propose a conceptualization of headquarters activities as a dynamic system in which activities can be distributed organizationally and spatially. We explicitly break with the dominant view of the prior research on 'the headquarters' as a single, identifiable unit in one specific location. Second, building on the manuscripts accepted for publication in this Special Issue, we outline research implications and put forward an agenda for research on the emergence and continuous management of disaggregated and dispersed headquarters systems.

This article examines whether agency or stewardship is the more effective form of managerial governance within family firms. Synthesizing arguments regarding the differential tendencies of nonfamily versus family managers and the bifurcated manner in which they are likely to be governed, we propose asymmetric responses to agency versus stewardship mechanisms. Our empirical results provide evidence challenging common assumptions regarding the behavior exhibited by nonfamily versus family managers and the mechanisms by which each is governed. Although our findings also provide evidence of response asymmetry, they nevertheless point to the greater effectiveness of stewardship over agency governance irrespective of a manager's family affiliation.

Conventional agency theory typically focuses on a unidirectional problem, in which an agent behaves opportunistically against the interests of a principal. Yet, this conceptualization is too limited to fully describe all aspects of principal-agent relationships. This article presents a more comprehensive framework explaining a potential three-directional problem--that is, (i) agents behave opportunistically against the interests of principals, (ii) principals behave opportunistically against the interests of agents, and (iii) relationships between agents and principals representing confluence of interests affect the interests of third-party stakeholders. The article provides evidence of these problems, describes their unique characteristics, and outlines implications for society. It concludes with a discussion focusing on the implications of the proposed framework for purported governance solutions, the ongoing debate between shareholder and stakeholder views of the firm, and business practices.

Research Summary: While the notion of subsidiary autonomy has received considerable attention within the international business literature, extant research is yet to comprehensively distinguish between the different types of subsidiary autonomy. This article outlines a key type that is independently claimed by the subsidiary, 'assumed autonomy,' and makes the following contributions: first, we outline the causes for this type of autonomy. Second, we elucidate how assumed autonomy is viewed by the head office. In doing so, the article also challenges previous applications of agency theory within the subsidiary-headquarters context, arguing the need for a refined, more nuanced interpretation in this setting to reflect a revised set of agency theory assumptions. Managerial summary: Despite representing a key issue in subsidiary management today, the types of autonomy that may be acquired by, or available to, a subsidiary are not yet fully understood. This article aims to reduce the confusion in this respect by outlining a key type of autonomy that is 'assumed' by the subsidiary without explicit delegation from the head office. We explain the reasons why this type of autonomy may be developed by the subsidiary and also how it is likely to be viewed by the head office. We anticipate that this will in turn have significant implications for the ongoing viability and value of the subsidiary within the multinational, and it highlights the importance of head office managers adopting a more open-minded approach to proactive subsidiary behavior.

In this study we introduce a justice perspective to examining the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards over the allocation of firm residuals that ultimately determines CEO compensation. Framing CEO pay as the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards focuses attention on the power of CEOs to increase their share of firm residuals in the form of increased compensation, and the diligence of boards of directors to constrain CEO opportunism. Framing this negotiation through a theory of justice offers an alternative perspective to the search for pay-performance sensitivity. We predict and find that as board diligence in controlling opportunism declines and CEO power increases, CEOs are increasingly able to capture a larger portion of firm residuals relative to shareholders. This finding supports critics who charge that CEO pay violates norms of distributive and procedural justice. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Contract farming (CF) agreements are presently being restructured to form part of more complex Inclusive Business (IB) set-ups. Additional instruments, alongside CF, are implemented to overcome the challenges of CF and to adapt to the policy environment in which the different stakeholders operate. This paper develops a theoretical framework that gives insight into how these complex entities are structured and operate in a developing country context. This theoretical analysis takes a holistic approach by adopting elements of existing theories to form a new critical research paradigm: (i) Resource Dependence Theory to incorporate the wider operating environment in which the two cases operate, (ii) Transaction Cost Economics to explain the internal efficiency of the different models, and (iii) Agency Theory to account for the safeguard mechanisms. This new framework is then tested on two complex IBs that aim to integrate smallholder farmers into the commercial value chain, but which have each implemented a different institutional set-up developed around CF arrangements. It finds that a high dependence by the offtaker in the first case study stimulates a higher level of commitment and investment by this stakeholder in the contract arrangement. In turn, this increases the asset specificity aspect, which then requires safeguards to ensure the smallholders adhere to the contractual agreement. A higher dependency in this particular study also resulted in a higher number of smallholders being engaged in the contract, requiring mechanisms to efficiently monitor and coordinate them.

Purpose - The objective of this study is to understand the linkages among executive compensation, corporate governance and performance of the Indian family and non-family firms. Further, the study also analyzes the level of shareholding pattern of the Indian family firms on their performance and the executive compensation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have collected panel data of the companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The data set consists of 284 companies (both family and non-family) for the period 2005-2014. The authors have made use of a dynamic panel data model with generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation to formulate the hypotheses and used fixed-effects regression model to check the robustness of our findings. Findings - The authors find support for the agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory in the paper. Specifically, variables related to executive compensation, corporate governance (board size, proportion of independent directors on board, chief executive officers duality and other directorships held by the executive directors outside the company), firm performance (Tobin's Q), leverage and shareholding pattern of the family are significant in this study. Practical implications - The study has practical implications for all stakeholders of the family and non-family firms, especially in the emerging market economies. It can be used as a reference guide by various other stakeholders of the family firms, viz., customers, educators, tax authorities, government and society. Originality/value - The authors confirm that their research is original and provides valuable insights on the Indian family firms. The authors study cross-holding of directorships, inter alia, in the Indian family business groups. As most of the previous studies in the Indian context ignored this important aspect, this study is unique in nature. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine an association between board demographics and corporate performance using a sample of Pakistani firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange in the 2014 year. Design/methodology/approach: This study is unique in that corporate performance is examined using a mixture of performance measures: accounting-based measures (return on assets), market-based measures (Tobin's Q, earnings per share, and total return) and economic profit measures (economic value added). Findings: The results of this research show a significant positive relationship between board size, minority representation on the board and the appointment of a family director and enhanced firm performance. However, contrary to expectations, the authors also find that instead of adding value, the appointment of independent directors to Pakistani firm boards negatively impacts firm value. Originality/value: This study adds to a growing body of empirical evidence that suggests that agency theory-based corporate governance recommendations adopted in developed economies may not be relevant to emerging economy firms.

The term 'concurrent sourcing' refers to the practice of a firm to simultaneously make and buy the same components. This paper presents an agency model for explaining how and when concurrent sourcing reduces the likelihood of external supplier opportunism. In the proposed model, the external supplier's expected costs of opportunism are determined as a product of four factors. These four factors are: buyer's likelihood of discovering supplier opportunism, buyer's internalised quantity as reaction to supplier opportunism, asset specificity of external supplier's investments, and multiplier effects. Each of these factors are explained and discussed in the paper. The paper also offers a number of theoretical and managerial implications. Copyright (c) 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Information asymmetry in an employment relationship is much researched in the organization studies literature because of its consequences for employment contracts, compensation, and rent appropriation by the involved parties. However, its psychological antecedents have not been adequately addressed so far. We conceptually investigate the psychological drivers of supervisor-subordinate information asymmetry by primarily invoking social exchange theory. Whereas agency theory examines how information distribution is driven by self-interest seeking, social exchange theory emphasizes how individuals may be motivated to fulfill social obligations and not by exclusive self-interest seeking. This paper advances several propositions regarding the influence of a subordinate's and supervisor's psychological variables, such as relational identification, disposition for relational trust, assumed similarity, and the shaping techniques used by a supervisor on information asymmetry. In doing so, it highlights the underlying social exchange (social attraction and reciprocity), and the cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes. The influence of the psychological variables on information asymmetry may be moderated by contextual factors, such as interactional justice climate in teams, agency costs, and the type of employment relationship.

The rapid institutional changes taking place today, including the emergence and global spread of new institutions bring to the fore the question of how new institutions develop. From the 1990s onwards, a new technical term has begun to spread in the literature: institutional entrepreneurship, reflecting the revaluation of people's activity in institutional change. The aim of the paper is to answer the questions regarding this kind of entrepreneurship. How does institutional entrepreneurship emerge, how can we interpret and define this phenomenon? What kind of driving forces are behind it? How does it work in the real economy? The novelty of the paper is in addressing institutional entrepreneurship as the result of a special ability and activity of actors to combine different, already known elements for building up new institutions. The study introduces the characteristics of institutional entrepreneurship, using the example of the sharing economy, by contrasting sharing as an alternative to conventional market solutions. The paper also demonstrates how the institutional entrepreneurship of sharing changes its socio-economic environment, from mobilization of unused resources through perception of ownership to the increase of the growth potential of the economy.

This chapter reviews the various ways in which the author has sought to explore and understand accounting as an instrument of accountability. As a chronic feature of daily life accountability could be seen as pervasive, as largely taken for granted, but nevertheless as central to social life. Within accounting and finance, agency theory assumptions of the self-interested and opportunistic nature of the individual remain highly influential. Such assumptions are taken to capture an essential aspect of human nature. Accounting homogenises in the way in which the diverse activities of production, sales, marketing, research and development and so on, are thereby re-presented in purely economic terms - as costs, revenue, investment and so on. The changed use of accounting information to create accountability around profit centres within ELB, along with the sense of shared destiny that the project of company survival created, served only to increase the power of the small corporate head office of Conglom.

This paper extends Jensen and Meckling's agency cost theory. A clockwise rotation of their budget constraint represents better performance by agents compared to owners and higher firm values. This extension incorporates Alchian and Demsetz's view of the firm, wherein firm values increase when managers are employed. It is then sub-optimal for owner-managers to directly expropriate non-pecuniary benefits through the firm as in Jensen and Meckling. It is instead Pareto optimal that owner-managers who seek to expropriate non-pecuniary benefits do so using the firm's higher value, and trading it for the non-pecuniary benefits they desire in the open market.

Purpose: Shareholders and managers can work in a hierarchy in which principals attempt to control the actions of agents to achieve the wealth objective. Alternatively, shareholders and managers can work together as a cooperative team in which shareholders provide financial capital and managers provide human capital. The authors aim to examine the different implications for value creation provided by the two approaches. Design/methodology/approach: By comparing the literature on the value implications of the incomplete contracting framework and control arrangements in principal-agent hierarchies, the authors identify deviations from optimal outcomes and suggest solutions. Findings: The review indicates that a cooperative framework has some advantages over the hierarchical model. The stability of human capital and the relationship between managers and shareholders can be enhanced when shareholders provide capital in increments which vest over time and latitude for renegotiation of agreements is built into contracts. Practical implications: By surrendering control using stock options programmes, managers are free to invest in relationship-specific assets. Shareholders can control the provision of capital by withdrawing investment if insufficient returns are realized, i.e. if stock options do not meet vesting requirements. The market can then be left to do its work. Originality/value: This paper provides an original review of literature on cooperation and hierarchies in the shareholder-manager relationship and proposes solutions to identified deviations from optimal outcomes.

Multinational companies are continually seeking innovative methods to compete globally. In the 1980s, top managements were judged on their ability to restructure the corporation and, in the 1990s, on their ability to identify, cultivate and exploit the core competencies (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990). In the 2000s, managers are expected to deal with changes in the times and uncertainties surrounding their companies. To improve efficiency companies seek innovative strategies. One innovative strategy that was exploited in the 1990s was outsourcing. In this chapter transaction cost theory (Coase, 1937; Williamson, 1975), agency theory (Jensen and Meckling, 1976), and signalling theory (Ross, 1973) are used tounderstand the economic and behavioural aspects of outsourcing and the implications of outsourcing for accounting practices.

Corporate entrepreneurship requires senior executives to evaluate proposals for investment and projects from corporate entrepreneurs. Properties of technology make this evaluation difficult, creating a knowledge gap. Whether through opportunism, overconfidence, and overconfidence, corporate entrepreneurs are likely to induce overinvestment in projects, perhaps at the expense of corporate goals. In this paper we analyze this problem using the tools of agency theory, and identify a solution, staged commitment, used and useful in many areas of business. (c) 2018 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

Important corporate governance mechanisms such as ownership concentration and debt used by the large firms can affect firm performance and value in developed markets. The mixed findings - which are non-conclusive in the literature - pertaining to these relationships pose questions about the exact nature of the relationships between these mechanisms and firm value. Moreover, the mixed findings in the literature have resulted in the endogeneity issue of the former becoming central to discussions in corporate governance and corporate finance studies. The research in this book focuses on the dynamic endogeneity issue to investigate whether this issue influences the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm value in the largest Australian firms based on agency theory. The study investigates this issue through three different advanced econometric models and tests based on agency theory: two-way fixed effects (FE) and the two-step system known as the generalised method of moments (GMM). The book concludes that dynamic endogeneity is not a serious issue in influencing the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm value in the largest Australian firms. These models can be applied to other countries for investigating similar corporate governance and finance issues. (c) 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes an agency model for headquarters-subsidiary relationships in multinational organizations with headquarters as the principal and the subsidiary as the agent. As a departure from classical agency theory, our model is developed for the unit level of analysis and considers two root causes of the agency problem--self-interest and bounded rationality. We argue that in the organizational setting, one cannot assume absolute self-interest and perfect rationality of agents (subsidiaries) but should allow them to vary. We explain subsidiary-level variation through a set of internal organizational and external social conditions in which the headquarters-subsidiary agency dyad is embedded. We then discuss several agency scenarios reflecting various levels of self-interest and rationality that lead to different manifestations of the agency problem. The proposed framework can inform more relevant applications of the agency perspective in organizational studies and motivate future research. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

The dynamic capabilities approach explains how firms create and sustain competitive advantages in dynamic environments if they exhibit technical and evolutionary fitness. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are not only exposed to industry dynamism, but also to dynamism in the different country environments in which they operate. Understanding the dynamic capabilities of MNEs thus requires analyzing not only the firm dimension, but also the country dimension and firm-country interactions of international business. Building on the analytical disaggregation of dynamic capabilities into: (1) sensing opportunities (or threats), (2) seizing (or neutralizing) them via expedient investments, and (3) transforming the firm and its resources and capabilities accordingly, we conceptualize the relationships between the dominant logics behind MNEs' sensing, seizing, and transforming and evolutionary fitness. First, we propose that a dominant logic behind sensing, based on an application of resource-based view thinking to the international business context (which we develop to separately explain the three component parts of MNEs' competitive advantages, i.e., non-location bound firm-specific advantages, country-specific advantages, and location bound firm-specific advantages), positively moderates the effect of sensing processes and routines on evolutionary fitness. Second, we propose that a dominant logic behind seizing, based on internalization theory thinking, positively moderates the effect of seizing processes and routines on evolutionary fitness. Third, we propose that a dominant logic behind transforming, based on a broad agency perspective extended to the international business context, positively moderates the effect of transforming processes and routines on evolutionary fitness.

This study examines reverse supply chains in the electronics industry. The analysis characterizes the flow of resources among firms in a reverse supply chain in the Norwegian electronics industry. The study subsequently examines influences of governance mechanisms and culture on the social, ecological, and economic performance in the supply chain. Based on principal-agency theory, the authors implicate collaboration, monitoring, and specific assets as determinants of the interfirm culture operating in the reverse supply chain. The interfirm culture and collaboration serve as antecedents to triple bottom line performance. Data collected with Norwegian electronics collectors indicate that collaboration and interfirm culture influence ecological, economic, and relational components of sustainable performance.

This study empirically investigates the relationship between two key supplier performance measurement and management practices (i.e. monitoring and incentives) and suppliers' operational performance. Grounding on agency theory, a theoretical framework is proposed identifying the mediation effect of goal congruence and supplier opportunism within the direct relationship between monitoring/incentives and suppliers' operational performance. Related hypotheses are tested by applying structural equation modelling on a final sample of 305 responses, collected from a cross-country survey. Results uncover a nuanced and insightful picture: both monitoring and incentives positively affect the suppliers' operational performance. Goal congruence does not result as a significant mediator whereas supplier opportunism mediates the monitoring-performance relationship and the incentives-performance relationship. However, contrary to expectations, providing incentives to suppliers increases the chances of opportunistic behaviours, which in turn diminishes suppliers' operational performance. While the key empirical evidence supports the general positive impact of monitoring and incentives on performance, incentives appear as a double-edged sword due to their potential counterproductive effect in increasing supplier opportunism.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of corporate governance internal mechanisms on tax disclosure in non-financial firms in Malaysia. Managerial ownership and incentive compensation are used as proxies to reflect corporate governance conduct. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses panel data set to analyse 286 non-financial listed companies on Bursa Malaysia for the years 2010-2012. Tax disclosure was gathered from the financial statements, particularly in the consolidated of tax expenses. Tax disclosure was measured using modified effective tax rate reconciling items. Multivariate statistical analyses were run on the sample data. Findings: This study finds that managerial ownership and incentive compensation do not significantly influence tax disclosure. On the other hand, it is found that there are significant positive associations between each of firm size and industry dummy, and tax disclosure. This means that company-specific characteristics are important factors affecting corporate tax disclosure. Research limitations/implications: This study extends the work of previous studies by suggesting that the signalling theory and the agency theory are the main theories concerned with tax disclosure and corporate governance. The authors add an additional appreciation of the contribution of corporate governance from the interested parties' tax disclosure evaluation in the Malaysian environment. Practical implications: The evidence found by this study has important policy and practical knowledge implications for the authorities, researchers, decisionmakers and firm managers. The findings provide them with some relevant insights on the importance of corporate governance practices from the companies' perspectives and contribute to the discussion of who verifies and deduces from tax disclosure directed by companies. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to examine the influence of the corporate governance internal mechanisms on tax disclosure in a developing nation like Malaysia. Although this paper focuses on a single country, it contributes significantly to the debate about tax disclosure in relation to "comply or explain", as suggested in the Code of Corporate Governance. This study shows that companies are trying to avoid as far as possible disclosing tax-related information. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The existing literature has focused heavily on investigating the effect of corporate social performance (CSP) on financial performance (FP) but has not paid sufficient attention to an inverse causation of the relationship. Moreover, while some of the literature argues that FP positively affects CSP, based on the slack resources theory, others have found negative effects of FP on CSP, supporting the managerial opportunism perspective. Thus, this paper aims to address the impact of FP on CSP. Further, this study examines the moderating role of franchising to better understand the relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses and expands the models derived from the CSP literature to confirm the effects of FP on CSP with the moderating role of franchising within the restaurant industry. Using two-way fixed effects models, it effectively addresses important problems embedded in the panel data. Findings: The findings show a positive effect of FP on CSP, which is inconsistent with Park and Lee's (2009) findings and supports the slack resources theory. Further, the interesting results show that the impact of FP on CSP diminishes as a firm franchises more, supporting the double-sided moral hazard framework of the agency theory. Originality/value: This paper fills the lacuna in both the existing literature on the relationship between CSP and FP and the franchising. This study contributes to enhancing restaurant practitioners' understanding of the double-sided moral hazard of agency theory unique to franchising context. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study illustrates how control-ownership wedge impacts the monitoring role of the corporate board through the quality of audit services in Turkey. Turkey has made essential amendments in the field of external audit in order to enhance the quality of the financial report and integrate its own capital market with that of the EU. It would be of interest to examine the influence of these changes on clients' demand for high quality audit. The agency theory is integrated with the resource dependence theory to show that boards possess distinct incentives and ability to demand high quality audit to monitor management activities. Logistic regression and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) were used for regression estimations. The results indicate that board demographics, cognitive and structural diversity of board of directors, audit committee characteristics and audit quality are complementary and control-ownership wedge weakens the relationship between them which is an unfavorable outcome for minority shareholders. Thus, this study proposes that regulators should increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance in Turkey to accommodate the unique features of wedge firms and provide a protected environment for minority shareholders.

Purpose: This study aims to identify the factors that lead non-financial companies listed in the UK to use an internal audit function (IAF) as a monitoring mechanism. Although the use of an IAF in the UK is voluntary, no prior research has examined the drivers for using one. Design/methodology/approach: Financial and non-financial data were collected from the annual reports of 332 UK non-financial companies listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) Main Market. Univariate tests and multivariate logistic regression tests were used to test the research hypotheses. A theoretical framework based on both agency theory and transaction cost economics (TCE) theory was used to explain the economic factors affecting the use of an IAF. Findings: The study provides evidence that firm size, level of internal risks, agency problem between owners and managers and existence of an effective audit committee are associated with the existence of an IAF. Thus, the need to have strong internal control and risk management systems and to reduce both internal and external agency costs drives companies to have an IAF. These results suggest the importance of IAF as an internal corporate governance tool and the effectiveness of UK governance regulations in monitoring the effectiveness of internal control systems. Practical implications: Given the importance of the IAF's corporate governance role, the study provides some policy implications. Regulators should pay more attention to the issue of maintaining an IAF, especially by large companies, the relationship between the IAF and other governance parties, especially the audit committee, and the disclosure of more relevant information about the IAF's characteristics and practices. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the factors affecting the existence of the IAF within the UK's distinctive regulatory approach of "comply or disclose reasons". Furthermore, it provides a theoretical framework that explains how both the agency theory and TCE theory can interpret the adoption of internal audit.

This paper investigates the influence of corporate governance on the performance of modern Chinese firms. Prior studies were inconclusive about the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. Little research investigates the performance implications of board structure in the post-institutional-transition era in China. Based on agency and resource dependence theories, this paper examines the impacts of board composition and leadership structure on the performance of Chinese manufacturing firms that went public on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges in 2010. The findings show that separating the posts of CEO and chair promotes better performance. However, appointing a larger proportion of outside independent directors to the board insignificantly affects performance. This research provides partial support for agency theory and extended insights into corporate governance in emerging economy firms. Copyright (c) 2017 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In a study of life science firms, we find that, in accordance with predictions drawn from agency theory and behavioral agency theory, CEO stock ownership is negatively associated with licensing while CEO stock options are positively associated with licensing. Furthermore, by combining theoretical insights from the capabilities literature with both agency theory and behavioral agency theory, we predict that a key measure of capabilities in the licensing context--a firm's alliance experience--significantly influences the ways in which CEO equity incentives impact licensing. More specifically, we find that, in accordance with our theoretical predictions, alliance experience positively (negatively) moderates the relationship between CEO stock ownership (CEO stock options) and licensing. Our study contributes to the wider literature on the determinants of licensing by examining whether licensing is sensitive to CEO equity incentives. We also extend the capabilities literature on licensing by examining the contrasting influences of a firm's alliance experience on the relationship between CEO equity incentives and licensing. Our findings also inform behavioral agency-based research on the effects of equity incentives by highlighting the usefulness of a capabilities perspective in augmenting our understanding of the behavioral role of CEO equity incentives.

Entrepreneurship research tends to focus on individuals and their actions. However, some entrepreneurial activities are borne and maintained through the efforts of several parties in entrepreneurial partnerships such as franchisor-franchisee relationships. Due to their very nature, these partnerships include economic and social exchanges. Such exchanges received limited attention in entrepreneurship literature. To address this omission, this study first delves into the theories of economic and social exchange to illuminate their relevance for entrepreneurial partnerships. Next, this paper puts forward an agenda for future research agenda based on the tenets of interdependent reciprocal exchange in entrepreneurial partnerships. This research effort has a potential to spur future studies on the use reciprocity in other areas of entrepreneurship such as social entrepreneurship and international entrepreneurship.

Public services have been subjected to processes of deregulation, competition, and privatization in many countries worldwide. One popular reform has involved focusing on competitive procurement. This context, where public and private organizations jointly deliver the service in a dyad, makes the market orientation of public services highly complex. The main elements of market orientation-intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination and responsiveness- have shown themselves to be valid and of significance in both the private and public sectors. Nevertheless, the empirical context of the public sector involves a complexity that has been poorly addressed in market orientation research. In this study, we research the Swedish public transport industry and survey buyer and provider organizations in order to determine how market-orientated activities are approached in public-private service dyads. We present three theoretically-underpinned relationship types - buyer dominated, provider dominated and collaborative - which we suggest as having implications for market-oriented activities. A survey of public transport authorities' (buyers, n = 48) and operators' (providers, n = 49) market orientation activities reveals the concurrent prevalence of characteristics from all three relationship types, as both parties try to dominate the relationship while also engaging in collaborative efforts. Drawing on our theoretical framework and our empirical results, we conclude that there are legitimate differences in the perspectives of buyers and providers, and that these differences, if acknowledged and properly managed, can provide valuable resources in the development of a joint market orientation in complex public-private settings.

This special issue focuses on empirical and theoretical papers that help us to better understand the strategy and governance of entrepreneurial networks, such as franchise chains, alliances, and cooperative networks. The following central themes are covered: (I) Which formal governance mechanisms do entrepreneurial networks use in order to reduce transaction cost/agency cost and to increase strategic value? (II) What is the role of relational governance mechanisms (such as information exchange and social ties) for the performance outcomes in franchise chains and cooperatives? (III) Which alliance strategies do entrepreneurial firms pursue to realize a competitive advantage, and what is the impact of resources and capabilities on performance outcomes of entrepreneurial firms. To address these issues, insights from organizational economics (transaction cost theory, agency theory, signaling theory), strategic management perspectives (resource-based, knowledge-based and organizational capabilities theory), entrepreneurship theory and the relational governance view are used.

At a worldwide level, the outsourcing has become crucial Nowadays. In logistics, we mostly found outsourcing that demands flexible contractual devices that deal with the continuous relationship between the customer-provider. Whereas, most of the outsourcing logistics researches ignore the relationship between outsourcing logistics and the contractual agreements that govern the performance taking into account that those contracts are structured to improve the performance of the companies. The objective of this paper is to question about the objective of the contract to succeed the outsourcing logistics relationship and to synthesize the contractual devices that mostly promote the success and the continuous progress. We will be using afterwards, the transaction cost theory, the resources theory and agency theory, in terms of the contractual complexity, so as we can demonstrate that this relationship is moderated by specific nature of the assets used to perform the outsourced activity within the uncertainties surrounding, the strategic aspect and the performance expectation.

Accountability is a pivotal concern of applied social science. This article asserts that in many situations a full explanation of the sources of accountability requires the application of concepts from sociology and management science, in addition to those from the market-based approaches inspired by economics. The article describes the market-based approach to accountability exemplified by agency theory, applies it to school reform and derives several predictions about the likely success of market-based approaches to school reform, and documents the lack of evidence supporting the contention that programs for school choice will markedly improve teacher work effort and performance (as measured by student test scores). The social actor approach, rooted in sociological and management theories, is introduced and used to describe the pressures and norms operating in the public schools that foster accountability even in the absence of competition between schools for students. The article concludes with some implications for practice and research on public sector accountability. (c) The Author(s) 2015.

Leveraged buyouts (LBOs) are corporate restructuring transactions involving the transfer of whole companies or company divisions to new owners. This chapter reviews the agency and entrepreneurship perspectives of LBOs and outlines arguments concerning their impact on jobs and wages. The seminal work of Jensen provides an agency theory perspective through which LBOs have traditionally been understood. The entrepreneurial perspective is the impact of the LBO governance structure and the role that private equity (PE) firms play in their interaction with portfolio firms. While the theoretical perspectives provide an academic framework for understanding the impact of LBOs on jobs and wages, the nature of the PE business model has also received attention for how it impacts on jobs and wages. Davis et al. conduct one of the most comprehensive studies to date by analyzing the employment effects of PE-backed LBOs at both establishment and firm levels.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the interaction between the structure of the top management team, takeover defense mechanisms and firms rate of collective actions. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses elements of agency theory, prospect theory and competitive dynamics research to develop a model for examining heterogeneity in the rate of collective actions among firms in the technology sector. A sample of 299 firm-year observations arrayed into panel regression analyses is used. Findings: The findings from this study show a positive relationship between the size of the top management team and the count of collective actions when takeover defense mechanisms are present. Further this study finds a negative relationship between top management team ownership and collective actions when these same takeover defense mechanisms are present. Additionally, the female ratio of the top management team is negatively related to collective actions. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of technological firms. These relationships may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other elements of the firm's governance structure (i.e. board of directors or shareholders) may play an important role in the strategic decision-making process. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by linking several blocks of literature, top management team literature, competitive dynamics literature and corporate governance literature, into a model to examine firm structural characteristics on the heterogeneity in the propensity to formulate collective actions among firms.

This chapter provides an overview of the variety and trends in Management buyouts (MBOs) types or organization. It outlines the theoretical perspectives that have been advanced to explain buyouts. From an academic perspective MBOs have been largely viewed through three theoretical perspectives: agency theory, behavioral theory, and an entrepreneurial perspective. Historically, agency theory has dominated our theoretical understanding of MBOs. Although founded in 1986, the germination of the seed that was to become Centre for Management Buyout Research started in 1979 in a conversation between colleagues about divestments between parent corporations. The chapter discusses some general comments regarding the future prospects for MBOs and private equity (PE). Critics argue that PE-backed buyouts are more likely to fail or enter financial distress as a result of the high amounts of leverage taken on at the time of the deal. The chapter also presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in this book. (c) 2019 selection and editorial matter, Mike Wright, Kevin Amess, Nick Bacon and Donald Siegel.

The role of private equity (PE) firms in buyouts has mainly been developed from the perspectives of agency theory and entrepreneurship theory. This chapter focuses on the part of this literature that has analyzed the effect of buyouts on capital expenditures, other types of investment, and financing constraints. Policy makers are often concerned that these leveraged buyouts make portfolio firms over-indebted. They are also concerned that PE investors have a short-term planning horizon and therefore cut investments, especially those with a long-term character. PE firms can contribute to reducing under- investment in firms with growth perspectives and reducing over-investment in firms with managers that tend to waste free cash flow. The chapter summarizes the effects of buyouts on investment from a theoretical point of view. It introduces the empirical methodology employed by empirical studies and related findings. The chapter discusses methodological problems in the existing literature and suggestions for future research, and the final section concludes.

This paper focuses on the practical coexistence of agency and stewardship theories. By analysing the three dimensions of government structures, compensation schemes, and monitoring activities, we show that this coexistence is possible due to several situational factors. Using field research data, we examine the causes of this coexistence and the effects it has on the efficiency and effectiveness of corporate governance, and question the practical sustainability of this dualism. We conclude that coexistence is possible but is unsustainable, and it would be wrong to support such a situation for a long period of time. We discuss paths of potential action and their implications for key stakeholders. (c) 2018, University of Belgrade.

The business enterprise is the prime institution in economic development and growth; yet, until recently, mainstream economics has mostly treated firms as homogeneous black boxes managed by untrustworthy agents. Using economic principles, the field of strategic management has developed a nuanced approach to understanding how firms are created, organized, and grow; how they innovate and compete; and how managers manage. That approach has yielded a theoretical framework known as 'dynamic capabilities'. Contrasts are drawn between dynamic capabilities and other approaches to the theory of the firm, including transaction cost economics and agency theory. The application of capability theory allows intellectual blinders to be removed and an understanding of differential firm-level resource allocation and performance to emerge. This brings a richer conceptual understanding of the nature of the business enterprise and its management consistent with evolutionary and behavioural economics. Policy insights into governance, inequality, economic development, and the wealth of nations follow. (c) 2017, (c) 2017 New Zealand Association of Economists Incorporated.

The purpose of this study consists in analyzing the existing literature on international business from all the research papers published in Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS) during the period of time comprised between 2000 and 2015. The authors apply bibliometric methods to that end -in particular, document citation and co-citation analyses (DCAs)- so that they can try and identify the main research lines within the aforementioned scientific field or domain; in other words, the 'intellectual structure' of the discipline examined. Social networks analysis was also used to carry out the representation or visualization of such structure or knowledge base. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the research undertaken, since the study field still keeps its characteristic diversity and interdisciplinarity or the need to integrate a variety of theoretical frameworks or approaches into the development of a widely-accepted theory about the field under study become evident. Amongst these theories would be the new institutional theory, the strategic theory or perspective or others such as the transaction cost theory or the agency theory, applied to the context of internationalization and to the field of international business, on whose integration the future development of this field may largely depend.

Our paper draws attention to a neglected channel of corruption--the bribe payments by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). This is an important phenomenon as bribe payments by SOEs fruitlessly waste national resources, compromising public welfare and national prosperity. Using a large dataset of 30,249 firms from 50 countries, we show that, in general, SOEs are less likely to pay bribes for achieving organizational objectives owing to their political connectivity. However, in deteriorated institutional environments, SOEs may be subjected to potential managerial rent-seeking behaviors, which disproportionately increase SOE bribe propensity relative to privately owned enterprises. Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of fostering democracy and rule of law, reducing prevalence of corruption and shortening power distance in reducing the incidence of SOE bribery.

The negative association between risk and return is paradoxical because risk-averse managers should only expose themselves to higher risk for higher returns. The paradox is resolved, however, if we recognize that risk-averse managers may be taking decisions that pose risk for shareholders and not for their own careers. We draw on the career concerns literature to explain why decisions that pose risk to shareholder returns can enhance managerial careers. We provide evidence that the risk-return paradox is exacerbated by agency problems that contribute to career concerns (i.e., CEO career horizon), and mitigated by various governance mechanisms that curb the agency problem by aligning managers with shareholders (such as monitoring by the market for corporate control, large block owners, institutional owners, vigilant board, and CEO incentive alignment). Our study sheds light on the role of career concerns and corporate governance in resolving the risk-return paradox. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Ownership structure has been identified as a critical governance component due to its effect on firm performance. Within ownership structure, issues of institutional shareholders, cash flow rights of controlling owners, and ownership discrepancy have not been examined in the tourism sector. The current study uses listed tourism firms in Taiwan to empirically examine how these three variables influence firm performance. Results show a positive effect on return on assets and Tobin's Q from the presence of institutional shareholders and cash flow rights of controlling owners. Ownership discrepancy has a negative effect on Tobin's Q. The present results can make contributions to agency theory and principles for good governance. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Following the agency theory, this paper contributes to the literature on board independence as a mechanism to mitigate agency costs by investigating the impact of independent minority directors on firm value in a principal-principal setting. Independent minority directors might alleviate agency costs associated to the risk of self-dealing transactions and, in turn, increase firm value. However, since non-controlling shareholders are also self-interested, particularly for firms characterized by strong uncertainty about future financial results and high information asymmetry, independent minority directors might negatively impact firm value by creating frictions within the board, increasing the risks of potential hold-ups by minority shareholders and limiting the ex-ante incentives of the block-holder to undertake profitable idiosyncratic investments. By examining a sample of Italian listed companies, we find some evidence about a positive relationship between the proportion of independent minority directors and firm value. Although weaker, a positive relationship between the proportion of independent minority directors and firm value is also found for firms characterized by high information asymmetry and--therefore--exposed to the risk of opportunistic actions by minority shareholders against the dominant shareholder. Our results shed new light on the relationship between board composition and firm value in a concentrated ownership setting, revealing the role played by independent minority directors in mitigating agency costs.

This article presents a partial survey of the literature of the burgeoning area of cultural finance with a view of how respective investigations and results are explicitly or implicitly framed in relation to either normative institutionalism or intended rationality. Studies are examined by comparing national culture as influencing financial systems either by shaping the norms of behavior and concomitant logic of appropriateness, or, alternatively, shaping environments so as to impact the incentives for differing actors to maximize their utilities. For the cultural dimensions of the Hofstede framework, suggestions are made regarding deploying future studies within an intended rationality or normative institutionalism framework. This taxonomy also highlights the role of national culture with respect to transaction costs and agency costs, and is relevant to many cultural finance studies. The developing area of cultural finance can benefit from examining investigations, results, and discussions with regard to the contrasting perspectives of normative institutionalism and intended rationality.

Corporate boards are responsible for ensuring that managers enact policies that are in shareholders' best interests, and managers are responsible for implementing strategies that are not only profitable but also responsive to changing legal and societal demands and the resource needs of the firm. In this paper, we use the theoretical lenses of corporate social responsibility (CSR), the resource-based view, and agency theory to investigate the relationship between corporate governance structure and the implementation of supportive lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) policies. We analyze 10,233 firm-year observations and 1,594 unique firms, and our results demonstrate that LGBT-supportive policies are positively associated with firm performance. We also offer new insight into why not all firms adopt such policies. We exploit the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as an exogenous shock that increased board independence, and our difference-in-difference estimation shows that firms forced to raise board independence in 2002 were less likely to invest in LGBT-supportive policies. Results suggest that human resource management (HRM) policies can be guided by CSR and resource-based views in the pursuit of wealth maximization, but agency conflict may also be a concern for external majority boards. We discuss implications for HRM research practice and corporate governance regarding LGBT policies in organizations. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This research aims to show that the non-financial reporting tool collides with nexus of constraints which we will qualify as a "trilemma": (1) the constraint linked to the complexity, the irreducibility and the scalability of corporate social responsibility (2) the constraint linked to inherent stakes of non-financial reporting (3) the constraint linked to company expectations. The inscription of the tool within the nexus of constraints can be more or less effective, depending on how the points of convergence or friction are managed between the different constraints. In this way, three categories of possible pitfalls appear. Idealistic reporting, lay reporting or technical reporting. To conclude we discuss the possibility that Integrated Reporting < IR> can be an "optimal" solution between these pitfalls and the limits of this possibility.

To create transparency on the rising plethora of Shadow IT (SIT) and Business-managed IT (BMIT) research, this paper reviews how existing research in the field uses reference theories. A review of 107 SIT and BMIT literature items shows that 52 (49%) of the literature items drew on 37 reference theories for theory testing and theory building. The remaining 55 (51%) literature items did not base their research on reference theories. To guide theorizing in future SIT and BMIT research, this paper argues in favor of 'category-spanning' reference theories, i.e., reference theories already used across the SIT and BMIT research categories 'causing factors,' 'outcomes,' and 'governance of SIT and BMIT.' The paper identifies four category-spanning theories: (1) transaction cost theory, (2) agency theory, (3) loose coupling theory, and (4) technological frames. Analyzing the prior use of these reference theories in SIT and BMIT, the paper at hand suggests and discusses extensions for their application in future SIT and BMIT research. In addition to the category-spanning reference theories, the theory of workarounds seems to be highly applicable. Due to the novelty of the research field and the explorative character of most existing studies, the paper calls for enhanced theorizing in the field of SIT and BMIT since currently most of the literature items do not build on reference theories.

We argue that vertical interlocks in Chinese state-owned business groups are important mechanisms for coordination and information exchange between the apex firm and affiliated firms, and that they are also mechanisms for government owners of the business groups to exercise control. By combining resource dependence theory with elements from transaction cost economics and agency theory, we propose that the need for interlocks increases the higher the level of government ownership. The central government is therefore more likely to use vertical interlocks than the provincial governments, which again are more likely to use vertical interlocks than the municipal governments. We develop three hypotheses based on these arguments. A regression analysis of a hand-collected data set finds strong support for our hypotheses. Our results shed light on coordination and governance issues within the state-owned sector in China and on an important means for mitigating these issues used by the government owners and firms affiliated with state-owned groups.

The Problem: Agency theory has been empirically studied in other fields of study such as economics, political science, sociology, and management. Although a proposal for inclusion of agency theory to test training and development outcomes was made in human resource development (HRD)-related publications, little research has been conducted and published in HRD-related literature. The Solution: This review of agency theory offers a description of the elements and factors associated with the principal-agent relationship that have been theorized and empirically tested in other fields of study. Much of the theoretical implications are transferable to HRD. The principal-agent relationship should be empirically tested in HRD situations and interpreted through an HRD lens. The Stakeholders: The review of the principal-agent relationship in other fields is expected to benefit HRD researchers, practitioners, principals, and agents in organizations by providing insight into the orientation, elements, and influence of principal-agent relationships.

Moral hazard can hinder both the realization and the effectiveness of research and development (R&D) supply relations. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no empirical studies investigating the determinants of moral hazard under the specific circumstances of R&D supply relations. Based on a study on 104 cases, this article will help to fill that gap. The results not only confirm information asymmetries as determinants, as predicted by principal-agent theory, but also reveal surprising effects of additional factors. Thus, we show that the general explanation of moral hazard needs to be adapted to the specifics of a concrete exchange situation. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This chapter analyses the relationship between ownership structure and leverage, providing an integrated theoretical approach that combines traditional financial theories, agency theory, and recently developed theories relating to non-financial preferences. The results show that, after controlling for endogeneity, being a family firm has a positive effect on the propensity to incur debt. These findings add to the existing body of literature and underline the need for a multi-theoretical approach when explaining the capital structure of family firms. The authors apply panel data methodology to control for individual heterogeneity of family firms. The chapter uses a sample of Spanish firms operating in the tourism industry. (c) 2020, IGI Global.

This study aims to investigate the impact of the ownership hierarchy on the retention of cash. Ownership structure has dissimilar from each organization as some firms have surplus cash holdings and some firms have fewer cash holdings. This study examines the pattern of shareholding in Pakistan and its consequences on holding of cash. Trade-off theory, peaking-order theory, and agency theory have already hashed out the sensation between cash holding and ownership structure. Fixed Redundant likelihood test, Hausman Test and Panel Data Regression model are used to compute the final results. This study involves 74 non-financial firms to investigate the prime effects. The data have been taken from the biggest database of Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100 index Pakistan and company financial reports from the period 2006 to 2017. Significant findings of this paper are based on two different research questions. First, how the pattern of shareholding has an impact on the decision of cash holding? Second, how the boundaries of the firm affect cash holding? These findings imply that cash holding and ownership structure are a vital element of the firm's financial policy. This paper concludes that there is a negative and substantial relationship between cash holding and the pattern of shareholdings and the boundaries of the firm have an imperative effect on the holding of cash.

Organizational control is used to coordinate the activities and align the interests of independently managed marketing channel firms, which should result in better performance (i.e., disciplining effects of control). Yet, some research suggests that control may have unintended, crowding out effects, such as increased opportunism. Using meta-analytic techniques, the authors attempt to reconcile these contradictory findings and provide some empirical generalizations about control in marketing channels. Based on transaction cost economics and agency theory, hypotheses regarding the antecedents and consequences of control in marketing channels are developed and tested. The results show that environmental uncertainty and transaction specific investments are related positively to both outcome and process control. Performance ambiguity, in contrast, is related negatively to output control. In general, the results support the disciplining effects of organizational control in marketing channels through reduced opportunism and enhanced performance. One exception is the positive, crowding out relationship between process control and opportunism. (c) Charles A. Ingene, James R. Brown and Rajiv P. Dant 2019.

Capital structure is the outcome of market conditions, financial decisions taken by the firm, and credit rationing of fund providers. Research on the capital structure of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has gained momentum in recent years. The present study aims to identify key contributors, key areas, current dynamics, and suggests future research directions in the field of the capital structure of SMEs. This paper adopts a systematic literature review methodology along with bibliometric, network, and content analysis on a sample of 262 studies taken from the Web of Science database to examine the research activities that have taken place on this topic. Most influential papers are identified based on citations and PageRank, along with the most influential authors. The co-citation network is developed to see the intellectual structure of this research area. Applying bibliometric tools, four research clusters have been identified and content analysis performed on the papers identified in the clusters. It is found that the major research focus in this area is around theory testing--mainly, pecking order theory, trade-off theory, and agency theory. Determinants of capital structure, trade credit, corporate governance, and bankruptcy are also the prominent research topics in this field. Also, this study has identified the research gaps and has proposed five actionable research directions for the future. (c) 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

With supply chain finance gaining more prominence in practice and drawing increasing attention from researchers, the question arises how this emerging discipline can build on existing theoretical conceptualisations. However, few studies have incorporated theoretical frameworks and there remains therefore a gap in literature. To fill this gap, the study reviews five theories on their suitability for supply chain finance: transaction cost economics, agency theory, network theory, collaborative networks and social exchange theory. A Scottish focus group consisting of practitioners involved in supply chain finance provided empirical data for the evaluation. The findings suggest that there is supporting evidence for using agency theory, network theory, transaction cost economics and social exchange theory as theoretical frameworks for studying phenomena of supply chain finance. Furthermore, the results indicate that the conceptualisations based on agency theory should be extended with 'reverse principal-agent theory' to fit with the contingencies of supply chain finance. The frameworks of collaborative networks are found less suitable. In addition to these theoretical considerations, the focus group discussion also points out that the financial department's collaboration with other departments involved in the primary supply chain process in firms needs to be improved. To achieve this training and supplier development, particularly for smaller firms, is seen as key. These outcomes have informed a research agenda for research groups, early career researchers and doctoral students. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: Supply chains are becoming more complex and uncertain, yet existing theories are predominately based on empirical research of dyads overlooking triadic settings. This study aims to bridge the gap between supply chain theories and praxis, this study examined multi-sourcing triads in terms of coordination, collaboration and integration. Design/methodology/approach: Transaction cost economics, resource-based view in conjunction with social capital theory and agency theory were used to develop a research framework. Abductive, comparative research examined four triads. The triads comprised four retailers (EU, USA, Japan and one with a global presence), one third-party logistics provider (3PL) and 103 suppliers in textiles and the clothing industry. Findings: All multi-sourcing triads achieved efficient coordination via network configuration showing varying degrees of collaboration and integration. Three research propositions were developed as follows: transaction complexity and dynamics necessitate triad coordination and control by the 3PL; relational and structural embeddedness emerge when actors invest in triad-specific resources and capabilities; information, relational and structural asymmetries may trigger bridge transfer and affect triad integration and performance. Research limitations/implications: Empirical research on multi-sourcing triads complements existing research on logistics and service, transitive triads to uncover how triad coordination, embeddedness and power asymmetries affect supply chain performance. Future studies should examine the interrelationships between triad embeddedness, asymmetries and relational capital. Practical implications: Compared to logistics or service triads, B3B triads excel in relational and structural embeddedness and offer unique production-distribution solutions that create value to end-consumers and triad actors. Originality/value: B3B triads are a unique conceptualization in supply chain management that extends the concepts of logistics triads and service triads. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Stakeholders expect focal firms to improve their environmental performance. While firms may be able to accumulate the environmental expertise needed to achieve this goal internally, doing so may require significant time and resource commitments. Alternatively, buyer firms can leverage their suppliers' existing environmental expertise and gain access to such expertise when they purchase products and services from these suppliers. The purpose of this study was to develop and test theory regarding under what conditions suppliers' environmental expertise influences a buying firms' procurement spend with these suppliers. We ground our study in transaction cost economics and agency theories and empirically test our hypotheses using a unique buyer-supplier dyadic data set. We find that buyer firms are willing to increase their overall business spend with suppliers that have strong environmental expertise, particularly when the buyer firms are more profitable and have higher levels of absorptive capacity. However, we find the opposite effect when the buyer firm's executive compensation is linked to the firm's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Likewise, we also find that the buyer firm's environmental concern ratings negatively moderate the relationship between the supplier's environmental expertise and the buyer's procurement spend with the supplier.

Corporate political activity (CPA) is an important area of research due to the high level of CPA in which many firms engage. Prior research has focused on the demand side of the political market. In this paper, we consider how choices made by CEOs regarding their interaction with the supply side of the political market can have performance implications for the firm. In particular, we argue that where CPA focuses less on supporting extreme ideologies, these investments in CPA will be positively associated with higher performance, and thus are more effective. Next, relying on agency theory, we argue that firms in which top managers are less likely to behave opportunistically will engage in such effective CPA. We test our theory on a panel of archival data generated by combining business data with political records, and we find strong support for our arguments. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Global apparel brands that source production from less developed countries are increasingly exposed to risks that arise from human rights violations. Despite widely publicized factory safety failures, reactionary regulatory efforts remain inadequate. This situation is commonly attributed to unyielding downward price pressure imposed on factories by Western brands. To address this problem, this research develops a comprehensive cost model for low-cost apparel production following a total cost of ownership approach. Comprehensive production data for cotton T-shirts from nine Bangladeshi factories provide the basis for model construction. The model reveals that materials generate the bulk of production costs (77%) for a T-shirt, in contrast to worker wages which generate only 2 percent of the total production cost per unit (e.g., 16 cents out of a $8USD retail price). The TCO provides fundamental insights, grounded in real data, to guide policy and regulation among stakeholders in high-risk, low-cost supply chains. Based on the research context, results are considered through the lens of agency theory to provide managerial implications for relevant stakeholders. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper explores the development and articulation of the agency and stakeholder theories of the firm and their corresponding logics of shareholder wealth maximisation and stakeholder interest optimisation. We note how these two perspectives have been viewed as diametrically opposite normative, instrumental and descriptive theories, despite efforts by some authors to find common ground. Each has served as a basis for firm governance. We explore the relationship of the agency and stakeholder theories to the conceptualisations of the roles of boards of directors, and how both theories hold value in understanding two board functions/roles: control/monitoring roles and service roles (which covers both resources and strategy).

This study investigates the impact of the asset-light strategy on dividend policy using a sample of large international publicly-listed companies (399 firm-year observations) operating in the hotel and restaurant industry over the 2006-2018 period. Taking the perspective of agency theory, we posit that the asset-light strategy in conjunction with significant growth is a context in which high agency conflicts arise. Using Tobit and OLS models, our results indicate that adopting an asset-light strategy only impacts dividend policy for firms with high growth. More interestingly, the positive impact of the asset-light strategy on dividend payouts occurs for firms with substantial growth if institutional ownership is low. In such situations, significant potential agency conflicts (due to high free cash flows) coupled with the lack of monitoring from institutional investors lead firms to use dividends as a monitoring tool. Finally, a change analysis supports our main findings. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Corporate governance plays a decisive role in the financial performance a firm. While the majority of the firms in China and India are owned a managed by its promoters, the present study attempts to examine the impact of ownership structure and board characteristics on firm value for these two economies. The study employs panel data methodology with industry and time fixed effects on a sample of 1,042 firms listed in National Stock Exchange India and 450 firms listed in Shanghai Stock Exchange of China. The study finds promoter ownerships to positively impact a firm's value creation process, while institutional investors exert a negative influence. Although CEO duality enhances firm value in China, the results show otherwise for Indian firm Additionally, while board independence is positively correlated to firm value India, it has a negative effect on firms in China. Finally, the study finds that larger board size contributes favorably toward better decision making. (c) 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited

Purpose: This paper contributes to the capital structure literature by examining the impact of financial leverage on firm performance and also the extent to which firm size and crisis matter in the leverage -performance relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 2403 Indian firms during the period 1995-2014, generating a total of 19,544 firm-year observations, panel econometric methods are employed to test the leverage-performance relationship. Findings: Drawing insights from agency theory and using Tobin's Q (TQ) as our main measure of performance, the authors uncover that financial leverage is negatively and significantly related to firm performance. The authors also observe that the impact of financial leverage on firm performance is lower for smaller firms than larger ones. Finally, the authors show that the 2007/08 financial crisis had no significant impact on the relationship between financial leverage and firm performance. Originality/value: The paper provides fresh evidence on the impact of leverage on performance, particularly from the Indian context. This study is also among the first studies to examine the role of firm size and financial crisis in the leverage-performance relationship. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to answer the research question: How do cooperative organizations perform when created by government fiat in an emerging market? Through the use of institutional and agency theory, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the efficiency of the cooperative form of organization and investor-owned firms-investigating how the social-political structures in a community affect the efficiency of cooperatives vis-a-vis investor-owned firms. This paper also attempts to offer a better understanding of how government quality and organizational size influence performance outcomes between different organizational forms specifically in the Philippines. Design Methodology Approach: The empirical analysis of this study was conducted among electric distribution utilities in the Philippines. Firm-level data was generated for 133 distributors, consisting of 119 electric cooperatives and 14 investor-owned companies. Panel data regressions were ran to test all hypotheses. Findings: Cooperative organizations operate at a less efficient rate than investor-owned firms in the Philippines, even when controlling for firm-specific factors such as size, customer density and profitability. In addition, the efficiency of these cooperative organizations is more strongly influenced by the quality of the local government than investor-owned firms. Originality Value: Positive externalities generated by the propagation of cooperatives on local communities may be based primarily on our understanding of how cooperatives have functioned largely in western contexts. Within the context of Southeast Asia, where national socio-political structures may be more dysfunctional, this paper observes that there is an equivalent negative externality caused by the tendency of cooperatives to replicate the political mismanagement of the community around it.

This study examined the strategic planning process used in U.S. public company boardrooms, with a particular focus on companies that used board-level Strategic Planning Committees (SPCs) as opposed to those that engaged the full board in strategic planning oversight (which we call "strategic planning overall" or "SPO" firms). Based on interviews with 8 SPC members and 12 directors from SPO firms, we found a number of similarities in SPC and SPO processes, as well as a number of key differences. Overall, it is clear that there often can be a fundamental tension between management and directors with respect to the responsibility for strategic planning. There also can be significant information asymmetries arising from agency theoretic assumptions requiring board independence and arms-length interactions. Organizational scope may, within limits, constrain these assumptions. Such conditions increase both resource and information processing demands on the board, creating a need for greater formality in the board's strategic planning processes. These demands increase the need for paradoxical approaches that can accommodate greater flexibility in board-management interactions. The paradox lies in the board's ability to simultaneously meet and balance agency theoretic, resource dependence based and information processing demands. The contrasting organizational logics that are in play result in paradoxes that influence whether and in what form a board-level SPC should be constituted. The evidence suggests that constituting and structuring SPCs to embrace more collaborative interactions between the board and management could be helpful in dealing with the contrasting requirements and tensions that arise in certain firms. Embracing paradoxes and modifying governance approaches to include collaborative interactions with management may also help in ensuring that the board's strategic planning processes are equipped to deal with the challenges that confront the organization. Ultimately, individual company directors will need to determine whether and in what form a board-level SPC would add value to their governance structure and processes. Our interview-based evidence suggests that firm size and director experience are important considerations in the choice of how the board should oversee strategy. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the strength of corporate governance influences the firm's ability to retain their key knowledge workers or inventors. Design/methodology/approach: This paper links agency and innovation theory to develop the hypotheses. Agency theory predicts that the interests of employees are counter to those of firm owners. The authors predict that as shareholder power grows as corporate governance strengthens, inventors who are highly productive, and those who pursue risky but valuable exploratory innovation will leave the firm. Given prior scholarship in innovation theory establishing the critical contributions that new knowledge creation and exploratory innovation make to firms' competitive advantage, the authors consider whether stronger firm-level corporate governance leads to the erosion of the firm's competitive advantage. The hypotheses are empirically tested using generalized least squares estimation on a data set that combines data on firms, their patents and the governance provisions these firms adopt. Findings: Using a 10-year sample of publicly traded US firms, the authors find that stronger corporate governance erodes the very foundation of a firm's innovation capabilities. Stronger corporate governance reduces management job security, which makes managers more risk-averse. This heightened "managerial myopia" results in increased departures of highly valuable inventors employed by the firm. The authors show that these departing inventors are more productive inventors than those who remain and engage in more exploratory R&D than the remaining inventors at the firm. Originality/value: The findings raise questions on the appropriateness of the adoption of governance provisions strengthening shareholder rights in firms pursuing innovation.

Board gender diversity is a keenly debated topic in both management practice and academic discourse. This study examines the influence of board gender diversity on firm financial performance in four ASEAN countries. Adopting agency and resource dependence approaches, board gender diversity's interactions with three mediating organizational variables are evaluated against four organisational performance measures. Partially supporting agency theory and resource dependence theory, the results suggest that board gender diversity are only positively associated with sales to fixed asset ratio and sales per employee ratio. The BGD's effects at the organisational level are mediated distinctly by firm size, ownership structure, and industry nature respectively, and by the multivariate interaction among these variables. The results of this paper support the findings of other studies that found a partially significant link between the board gender diversity and the firm's performance. Decision-makers in society and politics, therefore, need to be aware of the empirical evidence indicating that stimulating organisational environment may need to be configured before the valuable outcomes of gender diversity can be achieved.

This book examines tax transparency as part of multinational enterprises' corporate social responsibility (CSR). It considers revelations like the Panama and Paradise Papers that shed light on corporations' tax practices and the growing public dissatisfaction, resulting in legislative projects, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) base erosion and profit shifting. Tax transparency is defined as companies' voluntary disclosure of numerical tax data (e.g. taxes paid by country) and other tax-related information (e.g. tax policies). It is set apart from tax avoidance and tax evasion to clarify the often-blurred concepts. In this book, tax transparency is placed in a historical context and possible drivers and hindering factors to tax transparency are investigated. Tax transparency is discussed in the light of socio-economic theories (stakeholder, legitimacy, institutional theory and reputation risk management), as well as economic theories (agency theory, signalling, proprietary costs) and information overload theory. The book provides examples of tax transparency development of the largest multinational enterprises in five countries (France, Germany, UK, Finland and USA) in six years, 2012-2017, a period featuring increased media coverage of tax matters and legislative movement in the OECD and the European Union. The future of tax transparency is discussed in light of quality characteristics, assurance of information and potential use of artificial intelligence. Companies' managers and tax and CSR specialists benefit from the book by gaining insight into how to design transparent, high-quality tax reporting. Assurance professionals can use information about the quality criteria of tax transparency. Regulators can track historical development and see examples of voluntary tax transparency in companies' reporting. Scholars and students obtain theoretical framework for analysing the tax transparency phenomenon and the ability to distinguish between the concepts of tax transparency, planning, avoidance and evasion.

Orientation: Agency theory predicts that agency relationships are subject to the principal-agent problem. Other theories also suggest that executives may tend to maximise sales revenues, or expand their spans of influence through growth, at the expense of the net value of the firm or its profitability. Research purpose: The purpose of this study is to test which forms of company performance are associated with higher executive variable pay ratios or determine the proportion of variable director remuneration to total remuneration. Motivation for the study: The extent to which variable remuneration is associated with different types of firm performance is unclear. Research design, approach and method: This study applies a simple panel regression model to test the extent to which the variable ratio of total director remuneration contributes differently to increases in firm revenue, total assets, return on assets, or measures of Tobin's Q. These relationships are tested for listed companies on South Africa's Johannesburg Stock Exchange, South Africa, for the years 2011-2014. Main findings: Variable remuneration is found to be negatively and strongly related to total revenue and negatively and weakly related to total assets (the gross measures of performance). In contrast, variable remuneration is weakly and positively related to Tobin's Q, a measure which better reflects the interests of shareholders than gross measures. Practical/managerial implications: Firms in this context should seek to strengthen the linkages between variable remuneration and forms of performance that reflect the interests of stakeholders. Contribution/value-add: In the wake of global and local governance failures, this study suggests that the use of the variable component of executive remuneration might be helpful in aligning stakeholder interests. Further research might seek to better understand the causal mechanisms that underlie these findings. (c) AOSIS (pty) Ltd. All rights reserved.

The field of corporate governance can to a large extent be traced back the aftermath of the Great Depression 1929. The problem which led to the crash of the stock market was described as a division between control and ownership. The problem was described as managerialism. The thesis of managerialism inspired agency theory which has been synonymous with corporate governance theory. The theory focuses on the shareholder perspective and the importance of maximizing profits. Although corporate legitimacy has become a more important concept within institutional theory, it has had limited influence on the corporate governance discourse. That is, however, likely to change as the importance of the stakeholder perspective is growing. To align corporate governance with stakeholder perspective and strive for corporate legitimacy will have profound effects on the role of boards and corporate governance.

Part-time and temporary employees and contractors become a major cybersecurity threat for organizations due to the ephemeral nature of their engagement. Compared with full-time employees, they may be less commited to the welfare of the organization and, therefore, less willing to engage in security recommendations to protect it. Perceived psychological ownership is an important factor that shapes employees' security behaviors. The endowment effect also explains employees' tendencies to overvalue information that belongs to them, and conversely, extend fewer protections to information that they view as belonging to others. Thus, employees may be more motivated to safeguard their own information than organizational information. From a principle-agent perspective, this study investigates how three types of employees perceive organizational and personal information, and how different employees make decisions about protecting their own versus organizational information.

We critically review the literature on state-owned multinationals to clarify previous arguments and guide future studies. The content analysis of prior research reveals that state-owned firms differ from private firms in their internationalization: they are motivated by national strategic objectives, select more challenging countries, and use acquisitions more intensively despite adverse market reactions. The analysis also reveals conflicting predictions on the level of internationalization; some studies find that state-owned multinationals internationalize more while others find the contrary. We introduce one solution to these conflicts by classifying theories into two camps based on the balance between the costs and benefits of state ownership. One camp suggests a disadvantage of stateness (agency theory, resource dependence theory, and neo-institutional theory). Another camp promotes an advantage of stateness (economic development, resource-based view, and institutional economics). We conclude by outlining three promising relationships in the study of these firms: (1) relationships internal to state-owned multinationals and the balancing of stakeholder demands; (2)relationships between state-owned multinationals and government and the influence of the political system; and (3) relationships between home and host country governments and the impact of their dynamics on state-owned multinationals.

Research Summary: Venture capital firms (VCs) must simultaneously manage a range of relationships with investors, investees, prospective buyers, and co-investors who frequently exert divergent influences on when investments should be exited. The greater weight of one particular relationship can lead a VC to exit an investment earlier than would maximize returns for that investment. In this study, we utilize a global sample to examine how VC firms' investment duration decisions are shaped by firm-specific and environmental factors. Our findings suggest that VCs are less patient and exit faster when they have less experience, invest in more institutionally challenged host countries, or are foreign and invested in an emerging economy. Importantly, while co-investing with other VCs increases patience in advanced economies, this effect disappears in emerging economies. Managerial Summary: Agency theory explains why firms commonly capitalize on information advantages created by conditions of uncertainty to prioritize their own private interests over those shared with partners. This article introduces a framework, based on multiple agency theory, to examine the factors shaping the duration of venture capital firms' investments. Our findings, based on a sample of deals across 33 countries, suggest greater patience when host country market institutions are more advanced and venture capitalists themselves have more experience. In emerging economies only, we find that patience is increased by being local or from a foreign country with similarly challenging institutions. Importantly, while co-investing with other venture capitalists increases patience in advanced economies, this effect disappears in emerging economies. (c) 2021 Strategic Management Society.

We investigate firm-level determinants of capital structure using a large sample of 4,284 Japanese firms over a 19-year period (i.e., over 61,000 firm-year observations), a hitherto less examined sample for this purpose. We conduct our analysis and interpret our findings predominantly within the pecking order, the trade-off and the agency theoretical frameworks. We uncover three new findings. First, our evidence indicates that insights derived from the extant literature on capital structure are cross-national and are applicable in the context of Japan, despite the unique characteristics of Japanese firms. Second, financial crisis significantly impacts the relationship between leverage and firm-level determinants, particularly accentuating the effect of asset tangibility and growth. Third, product market competition significantly impacts the observed relationship between firm-level determinants and leverage. Our results are robust, controlling for the joint effects of competition and crisis. (c) 2020 The Authors. International Journal of Finance & Economics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Sustainable supply chain management practices can be particularly difficult to implement when the responsibility for sustainable procurement (SP) rests with buyers employed by a contractor, rather than an in-house procurement team. Yet there is no extant research that investigates the effect of outsourcing on SP. To address this research gap, this paper uses multi-case study data to explore the impact of outsourcing versus in-house implementation modes in the pursuit of SP. The findings suggest that each implementation mode has distinctive challenges and facilitators. However, by considering Transaction Cost Economics, results reveal that the advantage of outsourcing to professionals, with well-established SP expertise, brings information asymmetries in developing initial outsourcing contracts, which can lead to poorer sustainability performance than initially expected. Furthermore, when applying Principal Agency Theory, results suggest that sustainable performance can be improved in the long term through the effective design of well-constructed contractual relationships as SP maturity increases.

Purpose: In the wake of certain corporate scandals, many stakeholders are questioning if current high levels of executive remuneration, world-wide, are in fact related to company performance. After the implementation of King III in 2010, there has been an expectation that governance has improved in South African companies. If so, empirical testing should find executive remuneration to be positively related to forms of performance that reflect an increase in company value, like Tobin's Q, or return on assets, rather than measures such as total revenue. Design/methodology/approach: Agency theory predicts that if executive remuneration is not carefully designed to maximise the value of the company, executive directors will tend to maximise revenue instead. To test this prediction, hand-collected panel data from Johannesburg Stock Exchange company reports are linked to company performance data to test this prediction, across the years 2010-2017, post King III. Findings: Results challenge certain important assumptions. Generalised method of moments tests find total revenue, rather than value added measures of performance such as Tobin's Q or return on assets, to predict executive director remuneration. This is notwithstanding the significance of Tobin's Q in testing based on ordinary least squares. Implications of these findings for the field are derived and discussed. Originality/value: Unique findings suggest that complacency about the relationships between executive director compensation and company performance is unwarranted. In light of a decline in the country's international rankings on the quality of its corporate governance, a renewed focus on the effectiveness of human resource compensation strategy may be necessary in this context.

Although innovation can be a critical source of competitive advantage, research has found that debt can erode management's willingness to invest in R&D. In this article, we employ a stakeholder bargaining power perspective to argue that this effect is most pronounced when the firm's bonds are concentrated in the hands of bond blockholders. Furthermore, we contend that the temporal orientation of bondholders influences this relationship. Specifically, while it is commonly assumed that bondholders have a limited temporal orientation that induces them to focus on short-term value appropriation, we argue that some bond blockholders adopt a long-term temporal orientation. This orientation, in turn, makes them more inclined to support long-term value creation for the firm in the form of enhanced investments in R&D. Moreover, while agency theory suggests that there is an inherent conflict of interest between shareholders and bondholders, our results suggest that the temporal orientation of investors (i.e., both shareholders and bondholders) matters much more than whether they invested in the firm's equity or its debt.

Purpose: Bundled mode of public-private partnership (PPP) procurement has been a widely advocated governance structure of infrastructure delivery. The purpose of this paper is to identify the various aspects of how this bundling phenomenon has to be played out in practice and examines the implications of such decisions. Design/methodology/approach: A longitudinal case study with an Indian municipal solid waste (MSW) PPP project provides the necessary evidence on the identification of constructs which are deemed important in the decision making of bundling in PPP MSW projects. Transaction cost economics theory, agency theory and auction theory informed the development of theoretical constructs. The longitudinal case study used interviews, observations and documents analysis. Findings: This study has highlighted the complexity inherent in bundling decision, arising out of the relatively scanty rationale by which stakeholders first developed. Not only they are very different from the practice, but also many assumptions are proved otherwise. Poor sectoral developments, hindrances arguably caused to innovation, increase in transaction cost and a decrease in the competition along with ex post characteristics such as unfavourable transaction attributes made bundling a too early proposition to Guwahati MSW project. This study suggests that strong liability of the bundling phenomenon was the above the rationale of typical PPP bundling benefits envisaged in the extant literature. It also shows that poor practice and decision making by immature clients would lead to project failure. Research limitations/implications: A cognitive map emerged from the study on the failure of Guwahati project. An empirical generalisation can be attempted using multiple contrasting case studies to make the theory more acceptable. Practical implications: The case illustrated why naive clients should not try PPPs in a bundled model. Accordingly, the developed framework would help the governments to create the right projects catalysing the bundling benefits and harness the full potential of private sector participation in future PPP projects. Originality/value: The current study would be novel in advancing the theory of bundling in PPP projects. This would be of interest to academia and to industrial practice and policy.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the link between national culture and investment efficiency through a cross-country study. Based on a sample of 3,216 firms operating in 23 countries and observed over the 2009-2018 period, the study uses national culture Hofstede dimensions and overinvestment as operationalised in Biddle et al. (2009) model. To this end, a logit model and a GMM regression are applied. The results indicate that individualism and masculinity dimensions reinforce the likelihood that managers overinvest and tend to increase overinvestment levels since people from these cultures are known by their individual and money-oriented aspirations. However, managers from power distance cultures and high uncertainty avoidance engage less in overinvestment. This study provides additional cross-country factors that explain overinvestment not determined by agency theory. Manager's investment decisions are not only perceived through an objective financial perspective but also through beliefs and perceptions which are inherited from a manager's culture.

Technology licensing is an important form of exchange in business-to-business markets. Licensees consider licensing technologies as a key mechanism to expand their technological asset base and to innovate. Even though exchange is the central focus of marketing academia, technology licensing contracts as a form of exchange have been largely overlooked. We take some steps to fill this void by studying the role of governance in licensing contracts. We rely on governance and specifically agency theory to study two-sided moral hazard problems in technology licensing. The two-sided nature of the problem is reflected in the presence of both upstream monitoring (i.e., the licensee monitoring the licensor) and downstream monitoring (i.e., the licensee being monitored by the licensor). We demonstrate that the effects of monitoring on licensee value creation are conditional on the licensee's experience in licensing. Specifically, we observe that, conditional on the licensee having accumulated a high level of licensing experience, upstream process monitoring and downstream output monitoring increase licensee market value while downstream process monitoring reduces licensee market value. Interestingly, we find no support for similar moderating effects of partner-specific experience. We rely on a unique database of original licensing contracts, historical data on past licensing contracts, and stock price data to analyze the value created by individual licensing contracts. The combined results may help licensees draft more valuable contracts. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: Classical assumptions of agency theory (AT) fall short of providing satisfactory answers to modern management and organizational knowledge (MOK) problems, and there is a need for extending the scope of the field. This article aims to compare modern AT assumptions with the agency perspective of Islamic historical political treatises (namely, siyasetnamas) and point out how AT can be furthered. Design/methodology/approach: This article applies content analysis method to find out agency perspectives in Islamic political treatises and then compare them with those of the basic AT assumptions to find out similarities and differences between them in explaining agency problems. Findings: The agency perspective in siyasetnamas are based on the following assumptions which could contribute to the development of AT with their emphasis on (1) responsibilities beyond contracts, (2) entrustment rather than ownership, (3) shared societal responsibility rather than conflicting individual interests, (4) importance of self-control for both principals and agents and (5) trust discourse which emphasizes inner virtues rather than control discourse. Originality/value: Agency perspectives cannot be considered independent of cultural imprints. By introducing siyasetnamas' agency perspective, this article makes an effort to suggest implications for how to further modern MOK based overwhelmingly on individualistic cultural assumptions to rediscuss agency problems from the viewpoint of specifically the emerging markets in which collectivist culture plays an important role in social and economic life. In this respect, siyasetnamas' agency perspective based on the notion of entrustment seems, arguably, to be a better fit to the contextual realities and managerial practices of emerging markets.

Although risk management is prevalent in organizations, agency theory studies on contractual relationships in firms fail to address it. Risk reduction is mostly discussed within the context of monitoring, understood as insight into the activities of subordinates. Hence, this literature review discusses 18 main analytical studies on monitoring, reviewing whether they can be reinterpreted as depicting risk management, thereby allowing for the transfer of gained insights. Accordingly, only Meth, B. (1996). Reduction of outcome variance: optimality and incentives. Contemp. Account. Res. 13: 309-328 and Durr, O., Nisch, M., and Rohlfing-Bastian, A. (2020). Incentives in optimized teams for projects with uncertain returns. Rev. Account. Stud. 25: 313-341, can be reinterpreted as such, bearing the following risk management implications: (1) risk management is vital for firms, as firm's risk affects employee incentive contracts, firm's utility, and optimal firm size; (2) risk attitudes of risk managers are crucial for designing incentive contracts, with incentives necessary for more (less) risk-averse agents to encourage risk-taking (risk reduction); and (3) risk management should be delegated as a task separate from other managerial activities. The other studies do not depict risk management. Therefore, many research subjects remain open, such as organizing risk management in hierarchies, delegating risk management as a task and incentivizing it when a firm's outcome is unavailable for contracting, and establishing the connection between the performance measures and the risk of a firm.

There is a growing concern towards full integrity of Halal food and its traceability as supply chains become global. This research identifies the current traceability challenges for the food supply chain in Malaysia to comply with Halal requirements. We position these challenges in the context of institutional theory and agency theory. Our manuscript directly addresses Duan et al.'s (2020) call for studies grounded in actual real-life data to address Blockchain implementation in Halal food chains. As such, we propose a novel traceability framework built on Blockchain derived from real-life Blockchain implementation in three distinct Halal supply chains. The technology with smart contract is proposed with inputs from three Blockchain software providers with the aim to create a conceptual framework that integrates both Halal processes and technologies to improve traceability of Halal food supply chain from farm to fork.

Over the last 2 decades, the literature on corporate governance and sustainability has increased substantially. In this study, we analyze 468 research studies published between 1999 and 2019 by employing three clustering analysis visualization techniques, namely keyword network clustering, co-citation network clustering, and overlay visualization. In addition, we provide a brief review of each cluster. We find that the number of published items that fall under our search criteria has grown over the years, having surged at various times including 2014. We identified three main thematic clusters, which we have called (1) corporate social responsibility and reporting, (2) corporate governance strategies, and (3) board composition. The weighted average years that major keywords appear in the literature published over the last 2 decades fall into a period of 4 years between 2014 and 2017. This is due to the massive increase in the number of publications on corporate governance and sustainability in recent years. By means of chronological analysis, we observe a transition from more abstract concepts--such as 'society,' 'ethics,' and 'responsibility'--to more tangible and actionable terms such as 'female director,' 'board size,' and 'independent director.' Our review suggests that corporate governance and sustainability literature is evolving from quite a conceptual approach to rather more strategic and practical studies, while its theoretical roots can be traced back to a number of foundational studies in stakeholder theory, agency theory and socio-political theories of voluntary disclosure.

Interorganizational fraud, or fraud that occurs between organizations, is a critical component of supply chain fraud and supply chain relational risk, yet empirical evidence on the scale of interorganizational fraud and its antecedents remains scant. Despite its hidden nature, interorganizational fraud can have major implications for supply chain performance. Based on the theories of transaction cost economics, agency theory, and the fraud triangle, widely used in accounting and auditing research, five potential antecedents of supply chain fraud are considered and compared with reported losses due to interorganizational fraud. The data collected via a survey questionnaire with a sample of 151 supply chain employees in manufacturing demonstrate that informants estimated median losses due to interorganizational fraud to be 9% of their firm's total revenue. The most common types of fraud reported include product quality fraud, pricing/invoicing fraud, and corruption. Using a two-step generalized method of moments technique for estimation, the results found that transactional complexity, competitive pressures facing the supply chain, and weak firm ties were significantly related to interorganizational fraud, and that supply chain monitoring and ethical sourcing were not significantly related to interorganizational fraud. These findings contribute to the research on relational risk, supply chain risk management, and opportunism. (c) 1988-2012 IEEE.

This article proposes a conceptual mapping to outline salient properties and relations that allow for a knowledge transfer from the well-established greenwashing phenomenon to the more recent machinewashing. We account for relevant dissimilarities, indicating where conceptual boundaries may be drawn. Guided by a "reasoning by analogy" approach, the article addresses the structural analogy and machinewashing idiosyncrasies leading to a novel and theoretically informed model of machinewashing. Consequently, machinewashing is defined as a strategy that organizations adopt to engage in misleading behavior (communication and/or action) about ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI)/algorithmic systems. Machinewashing involves misleading information about ethical AI communicated or omitted via words, visuals, or the underlying algorithm of AI itself. Furthermore, and going beyond greenwashing, machinewashing may be used for symbolic actions such as (covert) lobbying and prevention of stricter regulation. By outlining diverse theoretical foundations of the established greenwashing domain and their relation to specific research questions, the article proposes a machinewashing model and a set of theory-related research questions on the macro, meso, and micro-level for future machinewashing research.

Digital technologies are increasingly changing the nature of competition and generating externalities that impact society. On the one hand, digitalization allows organizations to create substantial economic value in shorter periods of time through improved economies of scale, scope, and learning, resulting is increasing returns on capital and competitive concentration. On the other hand, ensuing societal concerns with inequities, regulatory lapses, and lack of transparency and truthfulness represent significant challenges for effective corporate governance. This article addresses the consequences to stakeholders that emerge from the digital economy, discussing how traditional governance mechanisms are ill-equipped to subvert negative externalities. We offer a stewardship-based model of corporate governance as a solution to the pressing problems plaguing consumers, employees, and other salient stakeholders of digital business excesses, with an emphasis on truthful disclosures, enhanced transparency, improvements in equitable allocation of organizational resources, and heightened trust relationships. The focus is on the positive role that organizational leaders can play as exemplars of virtuous stewardship in a highly networked society. The article redefines a modern view of stewardship in a digital economy and applies its principles to the four Ts of virtuous stewardship, a practical corporate governance model that encompasses truthfulness, transparency, trust, and technological equity.

Supplier audits are frequently criticized for lacking authenticity and objectivity. Technology-enhanced audits (TEA) offer a potential solution to supplier audit problems by enabling enhanced analytical, visualization, modeling, and predictive capabilities. This paper explores the potential of Industry 4.0 practices in enhancing supplier audit authenticity and efficacy, as well as reducing supplier monitoring costs. The application of Industry 4.0 in supplier auditing is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper adopts an exploratory approach building on an extensive review of the literature. The paper builds upon an inductive-deductive approach to explore how the individual technologies underlying Industry 4.0 can be leveraged to enhance supplier audits. Based on insights from the literature, the paper develops propositions outlining the role of Industry 4.0 in supplier audit authenticity, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. The paper builds arguments against the backdrop of traditional audits' limitations and illustrates how TEA can overcome many of these limitations. TEA can enhance the authenticity and efficacy of supplier audits, while also reducing supplier monitoring costs. TEA are most effective in an Industry 4.0 environment where the use of technologies is supported with governance structures. The application of Industry 4.0 can make supplier audits more transparent and value-adding, benefiting both the buyer and supplier. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are explored. Suppliers can leverage TEA to create opportunities for strategic differentiation, enhance transparency and trust, and stand out from those who view audits solely as a cost. Buyers can use TEA to enhance audit efficacy, enhance insights into supplier operations, cut monitoring costs, and improve their competitiveness. TEA is a new generation of supplier auditing that has the potential to bring fundamental changes to current auditing models and make audits genuine, authentic, prospective, and insightful while building on Industry 4.0 principles.

Studies find that oil-rich African countries (OACs) suffer slow socio-economic growth and development. The petroleum operations in these countries are also primarily in the hands of multinational corporations (MNCs). Motivated by their profit maximisation prospects (PMPs), the MNCs face significant corporate social responsibility (CSR) dilemmas with reference to their contribution to the socio-economic growth of these African economies. Even though there are few studies on CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP) within the African context, little or no attention has been paid to how and the extent to which MNCs' PMPs, CSR and CFP interact to affect the socio-economic growth of OACs. Drawing from legitimacy, institutional, and agency theories we employ a panel data approach covering 14 years (2003-2017) to understand the drivers of these PMPs, how PMPs affect corporate ethical considerations, and CFP and their implications on OACs' socio-economic growth. We find that PMPs of MNCs within OACs impede their CSR commitment. There is a significant positive relationship between CSR and CFP; efficient CSR practices impact CFP positively, and MNCs' contribution to OACs' socio-economic growth is significantly constrained by weak institutional environments. We conclude that institutional reforms and strategic investment in CSR could foster rapid socio-economic growth and development within OACs. Our study contributes to policy and knowledge on MNC's PMPs, CSR practices, CFP and literature on business ethics and the natural resource-curse. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd

Numerous theoretical and empirical studies have investigated the phenomenon of venture capitalists' involvement in new ventures. However, there has been a lack of attention to the VCs' involvement in corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues with respect to Moroccan venture-backed firms. The purpose of the study was to examine the dynamic behaviour of venture capitalists (VCs) and the mediating role of trust in the entrepreneur/VC relationship using the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. From the exploratory factor analysis, VCs involvement was determined to have three dimensions (strategic involvement, managerial involvement, and CSR involvement). The findings exhibited a significant positive impact of interaction frequency, trust, and VC involvement on performance. The study also concluded that the interaction frequency affected trust negatively. While the study has corroborated previous research, it has several recommendations to decision-makers in the venture capital industry in order to strengthen cooperation between the entrepreneurs and VCs. Implications for theory, limitations, and avenues for future research are discussed. (c) 2021 Denfar Transnational Development INC.

Prior work on solutions has often neglected double agency relationships. However, exchanges in solution business enable suppliers and customers to be in the agent and the principal position. Outcome-based pricing (OBP) is supposed to mitigate suppliers' opportunistic behavior; however, customers are often not willing to accept OBP. Drawing on a cross-industry survey with 172 managers of business-to-business firms, we show that the degree to which customers accept OBP in response to supplier opportunism depends on the customers as well. First, the interaction between perceived supplier opportunism and customers' opportunistic mindset on customer acceptance of OBP is negative. Second, customer switching costs and customer firm size reflecting the customers' dependence and bargaining power also intensify the double agency problem, making customers less likely to accept OBP. In addition to theoretically enriching literature on solutions and contracting from an agency perspective, this research provides new insights for managers into the appropriateness and implementation of OBP.

This paper uses new and unique bank-level data to investigate whether board governance determines executives' remuneration and if the pay-governance relationship changes across bank ownership groups in India. The findings based on dynamic pay model estimated using two-step system GMM approach reveal that (i) past pay levels hold significant predicting power for the future level of executives' pay, (ii) executive remuneration is significantly responsive to forward-looking market-based profitability measures, and (iii) individual board attributes play a significant role in pay setting in the Indian banking industry. Frequent board meetings and a more significant proportion of female directors on board moderate the executive remuneration packages. The results further infer that the board's monitoring abilities considerably differ across ownership groups, with boards play a more prominent role in private banks, while boards of public sector banks lack adequate autonomy to determine executives' pay. The results validate the "managerial power" approach, suggesting that any weaknesses in governance structure (especially in private banks) may inhibit bank boards from effectively performing their monitoring functions in optimal pay fixation.

Multinational corporations (MNCs) are considered as dispersed structures of power, in which diverse headquarters (HQ)-subsidiary power relationships collectively influence performance and management. Yet, few studies have accounted for the subsidiary portfolio characteristics shaped by the entire set of differentiated HQ-subsidiary power relationships, and little is known about their effect on the performance and management decisions of MNCs. Drawing on agency and resource dependence theories, this study investigates how the power structure of the MNC, or the pattern of power distribution in the subsidiary portfolio, affects MNC performance and expatriate utilization. Results from a comprehensive panel of Korean MNCs show that the degree of power concentration in the subsidiary portfolio has inverted U-shaped relationships with MNC performance and the use of expatriate control. However, the results also reveal that these relationships vary between manufacturing and downstream subsidiary portfolios. These findings suggest that the structural characteristics of the subsidiary portfolio are important determinants of MNC performance and management. This study opens an important new avenue for international business scholarship by explicitly conceptualizing the MNC as a portfolio of differentiated subsidiaries and by examining the consequences of the subsidiary portfolio characteristics.

Within MNCs' foreign subsidiaries financial slack, i.e., uncommitted financial resources in excess of those needed for current operations, may incur costs for headquarters. These costs may emanate from subsidiaries' decision to forego investment opportunities and stockpile cash instead, which, in turn, may lead to fewer resources being available for redistribution within the organization. From an agency theory perspective, headquarters can minimize these costs through monitoring mechanisms. While agency theory is considered theoretically appropriate for the study of the headquarters-subsidiary relationship, it reflects a rather undersocialized manifestation of human behaviour, which in turn limits its applicability. In this paper, we attempt to address this limitation by suggesting and empirically exploring that the effect of monitoring mechanisms is dependent (1) on the different types of monitoring used, and (2) on subsidiaries' external embeddedness. Drawing on empirical evidence from 94 subsidiaries of foreign multinationals operating in Greece, we provide some initial evidence on the differential impact of monitoring through expatriates and monitoring through bureaucratic processes. Most importantly, we show that subsidiaries' structural embeddedness moderates both associations. In doing so, we reveal that whether subsidiaries behave opportunistically or as good citizens is partially determined by the social context in which they are embedded. An unexpected finding concerns the positive effect of the origin of the CEO on subsidiaries' financial slack for expatriates compared to local managers. This finding underscores the importance of the CEO identity, and highlights the need for future research exploring its effect on subsidiaries' performance. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

In the wake of technological innovation, supply chain transparency has become a concrete avenue for long-awaited improvements to supply chain processes and practices. Transparency is of particular interest to Supply Chain Finance; however, it is yet empirically unknown whether and how benefits would materialise. Being at the interface of finance and operations, Supply Chain Finance aims at improving the inter-company management of financial flows. Nowadays, different financing schemes are offered foremost by cooperation between financial institutions and fintechs. Uncertainty remains on whether and how supply chain transparency would benefit these schemes to allow the adoption of more sophisticated, higher-value schemes. By applying the Gioia method, we analysed a series of interviews with experts from the Supply Chain Finance industry regarding transaction cost economics, agency theory, and dynamic capability. The resulting series of pragmatic, theory-grounded but practice-inspired propositions untangle the relationship and barriers between supply chain transparency and Supply Chain Finance. The propositions provide advances in the theoretical understanding of Supply Chain Finance and uncover relevant directions for future research. This poses the base for actionable results in future research and leads to an impact in research by addressing the concerns and tensions raised by Supply Chain Finance experts.

The purchaser-provider co-operation model is a way of increasing efficiency and quality in healthcare services. Risks associated with this model, including goal misalignment and information asymmetry, are managed through control mechanisms. Based on data from 12 clinical commissioning groups (purchasers of cancer care) in the English National Health Service, this paper describes the control mechanisms used to facilitate purchaser-provider co-operation and identifies good practices in using different control mechanisms. Effective control mechanisms were found to include stakeholder involvement (social control); co-operation and partnerships with providers (process control); and monitoring and service outcome measures for provider (outcome control). The paper fills an important gap in the literature--little scholarly attention has to date been paid about how purchaser and provider relationships are managed ex post and how performance is affected.

Corporate governance developed to maintain the accountability, stability, and performance of corporations. It has evolved to concern not just the financial health of the company, but its social and environmental impact. There is considerable international institutional diversity in corporate governance. The role and significance of market institutions varies among different governance systems. This work provides a concise insight into the defining impulses of late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century corporate governance evolving through a series of competing epoch-making paradigmatic contests. The present paradigm highlights a shift towards corporate sustainability involving the corporate delivery of long-term value in financial, social, environmental, and ethical terms. In analysing the purpose of the company and the definition of value creation, the hegemony of agency theory and shareholder primacy is challenged. More expansive theoretical explanations are considered which recognise the deeper values companies are built upon, the wider purposes they serve, and the broader set of relationships they depend upon for their success. This book will be of value to researchers, scholars, and students in corporate governance, sustainability, business, and accounting. Managers, professionals, and other general business readers will also find this text of interest. (c) 2023 Thomas Clarke.

Purpose: In a volatile agricultural postharvest market, producers require more personalized information about market dynamics for informed decisions on the marketed surplus. However, this adaptive strategy fails to benefit them if the selection of a computational price predictive model to disseminate information on the market outlook is not efficient, and the associated risk of perishability, and storage cost factor are not assumed against the seemingly favourable market behaviour. Consequently, the decision of whether to store or sell at the time of crop harvest is a perennial dilemma to solve. With the intent of addressing this challenge for agricultural producers, the study is focused on designing an agricultural decision support system (ADSS) to suggest a favourable marketing strategy to crop producers. Design/methodology/approach: The present study is guided by an eclectic theoretical perspective from supply chain literature that included agency theory, transaction cost theory, organizational information processing theory and opportunity cost theory in revenue risk management. The paper models a structured iterative algorithmic framework that leverages the forecasting capacity of different time series and machine learning models, considering the effect of influencing factors on agricultural price movement for better forecasting predictability against market variability or dynamics. It also attempts to formulate an integrated risk management framework for effective sales planning decisions that factors in the associated costs of storage, rental and physical loss until the surplus is held for expected returns. Findings: Empirical demonstration of the model was simulated on the dynamic markets of tomatoes, onions and potatoes in a north Indian region. The study results endorse that farmer-centric post-harvest information intelligence assists crop producers in the strategic sales planning of their produce, and also vigorously promotes that the effectiveness of decision making is contingent upon the selection of the best predictive model for every future market event. Practical implications: As a policy implication, the proposed ADSS addresses the pressing need for a robust marketing support system for the socio-economic welfare of farming communities grappling with distress sales, and low remunerative returns. Originality/value: Based on the extant literature studied, there is no such study that pays personalized attention to agricultural producers, enabling them to make a profitable sales decision against the volatile post-harvest market scenario. The present research is an attempt to fill that gap with the scope of addressing crop producer's ubiquitous dilemma of whether to sell or store at the time of harvesting. Besides, an eclectic and iterative style of predictive modelling has also a limited implication in the agricultural supply chain based on the literature; however, it is found to be a more efficient practice to function in a dynamic market outlook.

The majority of projects - even ultimately successful ones - run into significant problems during their development. While organizations have a variety of mechanisms at their disposal to correct projects that are experiencing difficulties, one of the most radical is replacing the project manager. Replacing a project manager 'mid-stream' involves a major change to an ongoing project with the potential benefits of onboarding an individual with a different perspective or set of managerial and/or technical skills. Using agency theory as our critical evaluative lens and a qualitative data collection methodology, we interviewed 19 key informants who had experience as part of project manager replacement efforts. This article reports of the dynamics of replacing project managers, identifying the critical decision criteria and mechanisms involved in such decisions. We found that three themes emerged with regard to project manager replacement decision making: 1) replacement is a common correction practice for troubled projects; 2) replacement is viewed by decision makers and team members alike as a message for change; and 3) in reestablishing processes and trust in governance, project size is an important moderator when deciding on a course of action. We finally propose a process model, based on our analysis, which identifies the critical antecedents, effects, and consequences of project manager replacement. (c) 1988-2012 IEEE.

Purpose: This paper examines whether ownership type has a moderating influence on dividend payouts during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis with respect to changes in profits. Future uncertainties because of the pandemic will result in a perceived need for liquidity within the company, but retaining cash may be risky for shareholders who could look for less risky alternatives. The dividend payout strategy is thus even more closely related to the overall type concentration and strategy of the owners during the crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The effects are explored and tested on early data from 2019 to 2020 of Finnish companies using ANCOVA while controlling for profitability and sector variables. Findings: A significant effect on dividend payout during the COVID crisis was found when the companies are dominantly held by individual owners validating early suggestions on such an influence. Therefore, this study contributes further to the academic debates on the influence of ownership concentration in times of crises. This study lists certain sectors which experience diminished profits during such a crisis which pinpoints sector separation in future discussions. Research limitations/implications: This study explores early data from a specific context in the Nordic countries. However, it does so out of purpose as explained in the paper. Practical implications: Ownership type and concentration matters when it comes to dividend payout decisions under uncertainty with regard to changes in profit. Investors need to accept these behavioural insights into their decisions. Originality/value: This study examines the signalling effect of dividends by analysing how actual or anticipated change in profitability due to a crisis is reflected by owners and leads to dividend payout decisions under uncertainty.

Purpose: This study aims to determine the moderating role of trust on the influence of export incentives over importer role performance. The mediating role of importer role performance and the impact of export incentives on exporter performance have also been investigated. Design/methodology/approach: This study used survey as the main data collection method to obtain data from 105 executives of exporting firms. An official database of export firms was provided to this study by the Department of Export Promotion, Ministry of Commerce of Thailand. Findings: Significant partial moderation effect of trust on the impact of export incentives over importer role performance has been seen. Also, this study found a partial mediating role of the importer role performance in mediating the association of export incentives and exporter performance. In addition, export incentives in the form of credible channel policies and price and financial incentives have been found to have a significant positive effect on importer role performance. Practical implications: This study will be of practical value for practitioners or managers of export firms because it is essential to enhance trust with importers and select the appropriate export incentives for importers. This could enhance competitiveness of the export firms. Originality/value: This is an original attempt to investigate the role of trust as moderator in influencing the impact of export incentives on importer role performance. Also, this study initially ascertains the mediating effect of importer role performance in mediating the effectiveness of both monetary and non-monetary incentives on exporter performance.

Purpose: This article examines the influence of market opportunity, risk, and distance on the choice of destination country for Mexican franchises. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are developed under the theoretical approaches of institutional theory, agency theory, and transaction costs theory and were contrasted on the data obtained from 52 Mexican international franchisors operating in 37 countries as of 2016. This study uses linear regression with ordinary minimums using the STATA 13.1 software. Findings: The results reveal that a larger market size, a greater level of economic freedom, and a smaller geographic distance are determining factors in the choice of destination country. No statistical significance was found in the variables GDP per capita, level of democracy and cultural distance. Originality/value: This research contributes to the theoretical and practical field. On the theoretical side, this study integrates institutional theory, agency theory, and transaction cost theory to evaluate the factors of the destination country that influence the internationalization process of the franchise. Another contribution of this study is to apply theories and models of developed economies to the process of internationalization of franchises in an emerging economy. Additionally, this study is based on a model that considers the distance, opportunities and risks that are considered by Mexican franchisors in the selection of the international markets in which they maintain operations. This study contains important practical implications that can serve as relevant information for decision-making in the franchise sector and its internationalization. This data is valuable for new models of Mexican franchises that decide to start their internationalization process. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Recruitment is one of the most important human resource functions for organizational success and survival. While organizations increasingly use headhunters to recruit employees, little research has focused on client-headhunter relations. This paper draws on agency theory and interviews with 130 contingency-based headhunters and corporate clients to examine clients' opportunistic behaviors and how headhunters sought to mitigate these opportunistic behaviors. Our analysis shows that clients used several headhunters in search assignments, negotiated and refused to pay placement fees, contacted candidates directly, changed search criteria and terminated search assignments, and used headhunters to poach employees from their competitors. Our analysis also shows that headhunters used various social interaction and contract-based approaches to mitigate these behaviors, which affected recruitment-related outcomes. This paper contributes to the literature by providing the first agency theory-based study on clients' opportunist behaviors, bringing principals into agency theory-based research, and showing that clients' opportunism affects recruitment-related outcomes.

Purpose: This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework for further understanding the risks embedded in co-creation services in high-contact service transactions. It delineates behavioral and economic perspectives focusing on agency costs, risk behavior, compensation structure and provides a context in which information is processed. Design/methodology/approach: Following an extensive review of the literature, propositions are advanced that relate an agent's risk behavior to information processing, compensation and the propensity to engage in co-creation. These propositions provide a complementary context for understanding risks in the co-creation process. Findings: The propositions detail how a service agent's information processing can be enhanced if the customer's expected utility from transactions is maximized by managing the agent's risk behavior and earnings potential. A compensation structure that balances fixed base and variable pay can motivate risk-taking and the agent's propensity to engage in co-creation. Originality/value: This paper extends the understanding of agency risks in the co-creation of hospitality services that integrates economic and behavioral perspectives with information processing. Theoretical implications include a broader context of the risks underlying co-creation. Practical implications relate to how earnings potential could be maximized by considering the agent's risk behavior and the expected utility arising from such transactions.

Purpose: Third-party logistics providers (3PLs) have significantly evolved during the last decades, yet their role within a supply chain triad has been overlooked; this study examines empirically the 3PLs' role using four established theories: resource-based view, social capital perspective, agency theory and transaction cost economics. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the role of 3PLs in four supply chain triads, using the case study approach. Sources of evidence include interviews and secondary data. Findings: The 3PL had different roles in multi-demand triads as service developer, customer adaptor and customer developer. The 3PL, by offering advanced services, became a service developer. The 3PL as a customer adaptor offered customised services and gain the client's trust. As a customer developer, the 3PL acted on behalf of its client in expanding its operations and meeting competitive needs. Research limitations/implications: The results of the case study methodology can only be generalised to similar types of 3PL. Supply chain triads are an emerging research field; theories like the resource-based view and transaction cost economics are established in the dyadic context and require further elaboration when applied in triadic contexts. Practical implications: The findings provide practical insights into the role that 3PL can play in supply chain triads, how they can upgrade their role by long-range planning and extending their services to create supply chain efficiency. Social implications: Understanding the 3PL's role in triads can improve how companies and economies respond to crises like the recent pandemic outbreak. Originality/value: It uncovers three different 3PL roles in supply chain triads by using four established theories. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.
