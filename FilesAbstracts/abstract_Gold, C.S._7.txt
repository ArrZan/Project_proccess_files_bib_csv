Timing and distribution of attack on East African highland banana (Musa AAAEA) by the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was studied in a field trial at a farm 25 km NE of Kampala, Uganda. Weevils were released at three densities (5, 20 and 40 females per mat) in 324 m2 banana plots (cv Atwalira) that had been established 18 months earlier and maintained relatively free of weevils. Two weeks after release, entire mats were removed and examined for weevil eggs and first instar larvae. At a density of 20 weevils per mat, oviposition occurred on 25% of plants less than 6 six months old (suckers) with an average of three eggs (range 0-16) per infested plant. At the same time, 85% of flowered plants were attacked with mean oviposition of 15 eggs (range 0-41) per plant. An inverse relationship existed between weevil population density and eggs/female/plant. Five females per mat produced an average of 7.2 eggs per flowered plant, whereas 20 females produced 15 eggs per flowered plant and 40 females produced 12.5 eggs. This suggests the existence of density-dependent factors in weevil oviposition. Over 90% of the oviposition occurred in the base of the pseudostem, with the remaining eggs found in the corm and roots near the soil surface. However, in stands displaying high mat, (a condition in which part of the corm appears above the soil surface) more eggs were found on the corm than pseudostem.

The effects of host and non-host plant odours on the foraging responses of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), were investigated in the laboratory through arena and olfactometer bioassays. Contrary to previous reports that banana rhizome and pseudostem were the most attractive parts to the weevil, dead leaves were most preferred. Comparison of dead banana leaves with dead leaves of other plants showed that attractant odours were present in yam, cocoyam and dead grasses but absent in cocoa and soybean leaves. Complete leaf senescence while the leaf was attached to the mother plant proved necessary for the development of the dead-leaf-based odours but the involvement of microbial organisms could not be demonstrated. It is possible that dead-leaf-based attractants could be used in combination with microbials such as entomogenous fungi and nematodes in integrated management of C. sordidus.

The horizontal and vertical distribution of plant parasitic root nematodes on banana (Musa AAA cv. Valery) was determined in a sandy clay loam in Costa Rica. Root samples were taken from soil blocks at distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem, from 0 to 120 cm depth at intervals of 15 cm, and from plants of 120, 150, 180 or 210 cm high (non-flowering), plus a set from plants at flower stalk. The horizontal distance from the pseudostem affected the percentage of Radopholus similis, Pratylenchus spp., and total nematodes (R. similis + Helicotylenchus spp. + Meloidogyne spp. + Pratylenchus spp.). There was a significant effect of soil depth on the density of each genus. An interaction between soil depth and plant height and with horizontal distance was found for R. similis and total nematodes. For the three horizontal distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of each genus decreased with soil depth. Higher percentages of R. similis and total nematodes were found at 0 to 30 cm horizontal distance from the pseudostem than at greater distances in the upper 30 cm of the soil profile. Therefore, samples for monitoring nematode populations in bananas should be taken within a horizontal distance of 0 to 30 cm from the plant base and down to 30 cm deep from the soil surface. Additional studies are needed to relate the nematode population density at this sampling point to yield.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

Host location, acceptance and larval success were studied in a mixed cultivar trial consisting of three East African cooking bananas, two East African beer banana and Kayinja (an exotic cultivar used for beer making). Weevil damage to the endemic cultivars was 5 to 25 times higher than that of Kayinja. Capture of weevils in pseudostem traps at the base of banana mats was highest for Kayinja, while egg density on Kayinja was similar to that of four endemic cultivars. Therefore, host location and acceptance do not appear to be factors in host plant resistance. In contrast, larval survivorship indices were 10 to 23 times higher in endemic cultivars than in Kayinja suggesting that larval success may be an important factor in resistance to banana weevils. Timing of attack was similar among cultivars. Oviposition occurred throughout the banana cycle with egg density increasing with plant age. These data provide a possible explanation of differences in weevil attack found among banana cultivars in Uganda.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

Controlled studies to determine the efficacy of pseudostem trapping in reducing adult populations of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), were conducted under farmer conditions in Ntungamo district, Uganda. Twenty-seven farms were stratified on the basis of C. sordidus population density (estimated by mark and recapture methods) and divided among three treatments: (i) researcher-managed trapping (one trap per mat per month): (ii) farmer-managed trapping (trap intensity at discretion of farmer); and (iii) controls (no trapping). Intensive trapping (managed by researchers) resulted in significantly lower C. sordidus damage after one year. Over the same period, C. sordidus numbers declined by 61% on farms where trapping was managed by researchers, 53% where farmers managed trapping and 38% on farms without trapping; however, results varied greatly among farms and, overall, there was no significant effect of trapping on C. sordidus numbers. Moreover, there was only a weak relationship between the number of C. sordidus removed and the change in population density. Trapping success appeared to be affected by management levels and immigration from neighbouring farms. Although farmers were convinced that trapping was beneficial, adoption has been low due to resource requirements.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) survives as an endophyte in a wide range of plants, offering substantial protection against tunneling insect pests. Although current research indicates that the fungus can live as an endophyte in tissue-cultured banana plants, there is no information on the efficacy of endophytic B. bassiana against the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Our study aimed at determining the effects of endophytic B. bassiana on oviposition rate and populations of the banana weevil, and their plant damage. Screenhouse studies were undertaken in which 8-week-old B. bassiana-inoculated tissue-cultured banana plants [cultivar Kibuzi, Musa spec. (Musaceae), genome group AAA-EA] were infested with female banana weevils. Five days after plant infestation with the banana weevil, there was no effect of B. bassiana on oviposition rate and egg hatchability. However, after 15 weeks, the presence of B. bassiana as an endophyte in banana tissues greatly reduced banana weevil populations and their damage to plants. Between 53.4 and 57.7% of the banana weevil adults died because of B. bassiana infection, resulting in a reduction of plant damage by 29.1-62.7% depending on plant part. Beauveria bassiana was re-isolated from different plant parts, but to a greater extent from the roots and rhizomes than from pseudostem bases. Artificial inoculation of B. bassiana in banana plants caused no negative impact on banana growth. Our study demonstrated for the first time that endophytic B. bassiana reduced populations of C. sordidus and the plant damage they cause, and can thus be an alternative method for effective delivery of this fungus to banana plants for the management of C. sordidus. © 2008 The Authors.

The banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus, is the most important insect pest of banana and plantain in the world. Cultural control methods were investigated over 2 years in southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Harvesting at ground level and dissection of remnants (treatment 1), and covering the base of the mat (entire plant consisting of several meristems) with soil and moving debris to the inter-row (treatment 2), were compared to a positive control that involved treatment of plants with a registered pesticide (treatment 3), and a negative control that involved harvesting at 150 cm from the collar with no soil or sanitation amendments (treatment 4). Yield, weevil damage and pseudostem girth of plants were measured from August to November annually, while adult beetle densities were assessed over 4 weeks in October/November and April. Nematode samples were taken and analysed in October/November every year. Damage parameters included the coefficient of infestation, the percentage coefficient of infestation (PCI) at two intervals, the summed PCI value, the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder and cortex, and the mean cross-sectional damage percentage. A randomized block design with three replicates was used in the trial. The parameters were similar before the onset of the trial. Fruit yield and plant girth, corrected by nematode densities, were not significantly different in any treatment, nor were the nematodes controlled. Soil cover and recession of remnants was the only effective treatment, significantly reducing the CI, but not the adult density or the other damage parameters. Soil cover showed promise as a cultural control method because it only needs to be applied seasonally and reduced the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder, the damage parameter most closely related to yield, by 14%. © 2008 The Authors.

The banana weevil (BRW), Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is the most devastating pest of banana in most production areas, which limits production and productivity of bananas throughout the world. Numerous chemical insecticides are available commercially to manage this pest. However, it was more expensive and undesirable for the management of this pest. In this study, the effect of commercially available neem-based botanical insecticide neem gold on BRW was studied under laboratory condition. The weevils were separately maintained up to 96 hours on neem gold treated banana rhizomes. The total and differential haemocytes count; total body protein and fat body protein profile were performed using SDS-PAGE. 33.33% of C. sordidus were settled on neem-gold and significantly (P<0.05) caused minimum mortality (6.7%) whereas 66.6% weevils preferred the untreated pseudostem. However, treatment reduced both total haemocyte count (40%) and various haemocytes level. The total body protein and fat body protein analysis shows that 4 KDa to 163 KDa molecular weight and 144 to 7 KDa molecular weight polypeptides respectively are present. Consumption of neem gold impregnated banana pseudostem reduced the total body protein polypeptide to 8 KDa whereas the fat body polypeptide increased from 161 to 8 KDa. These results suggested that neem gold could be used as insecticide against C. sordidus. © JBiopest.

Cost implications and lack of knowledge for ideal pest control practices are among the major factors limiting banana and plantain (Musa spp.) production in Nigeria. A trial was designed to control banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus), a major insect pest, and termites (Microtermes spp.), an occasional pest, by low-cost methods. The main plot treatments included the cultivars TMPX 5295 and TMPX 7152-2 (AAA genotypes) and 'Agbagba' and 'Red Ogoni' (AAB genotypes). Treatment combinations of mulching with neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves, application of poultry manure, and minimal application of insecticide (chlorpyrifos) constituted the subplot. The split-plot trial was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Numbers of weevils and termites were monitored in 2004 and 2005. Significantly lower weevil numbers were observed in plots treated with insecticide or neem mulch (with or without manure) compared with the untreated control (with or without manure). Weevil and termite numbers observed in insecticide treated plots were not significantly lower than those in the neem mulched plots during the plant or first ratoon crops. Significantly higher weevil larvae numbers were observed in the control plants (2.2 plant-1) compared with those that received insecticide or neem mulch applications (maximum 0.4 plant-1). In the first ratoon crop, significantly lower numbers of adult weevils and larvae were observed in cultivars with an AAA genotype than in the Red Ogoni cultivar. Cultivar had no significant effect on termite infestations. The interaction of treatments and cultivars significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced weevil number in the crop but did not reduce termite numbers. Significantly higher mean total fruit yields (minimum 15 t ha-1) were obtained from the insecticide and neem treated plants compared with the control (maximum 11 t ha-1) at the end of the first ratoon crop. The treatments showed prospect in the control of banana weevils.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

1 The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major pest in banana (Musa spp.) growing areas. The weevil is known to be relatively sedentary and closely associated with its host plant but little is known about the species' ability to migrate between banana fields and in nonhost habitats. 2 Mark-recapture experiments were conducted to assess the weevils' migration potential, possible differences between the sexes, and the relative attractiveness of pseudostem and pheromone baits. 3 One thousand two hundred marked weevils were released in the nonhost habitat at five distances (5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 m) from fresh pseudostem, and from pitfall traps baited with 45 mg of sordidin. 4 Two hundred males and 200 females were marked and released at five distances (5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 m) from the pheromone traps. 5 Distance and distance/bait interactions had a significant effect on recaptured weevils (binary logistic regression). The two baits were almost equally attractive to weevils in the range 0-10 m, whereas the pheromone was more attractive in the range 10-100 m. 6 Distance, bait and distance/bait interactions had a significant effect on the time elapsed from release to recapture (regression with life data) but the pattern observed was not consistent. 7 There was no significant difference between males and females with respect to distance or time elapsed from release to recapture. 8 The results obtained in the present study show that the migration potential of the banana weevil is greater than previously reported. This should be taken into account when new banana fields are established with clean planting material. Published 2011. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

Nutrient composition, secondary plant substances and other host quality characteristics govern resistance and influence herbivore feeding. The current study was carried out to compare aspects of feeding behaviour and food utilization of banana weevil (Germar) (Coleptera: Curculionidae) larvae feeding on banana cultivars with different levels of resistance. In the first study, penetration times of larvae into tissue of seven banana cultivars (two susceptible, three intermediate and four resistant) were compared. Day-old larvae were placed on corm or pseudostem tissue of these cultivars and time taken to penetrate the tissue was recorded. Larvae generally took longer to tunnel into resistant cultivars, although Yangambi Km5 (resistant) did not fit this pattern. In the second set of studies, food consumption and growth of larvae were compared on cultivars: (i) Kisubi (resistant) vs. Atwalira (susceptible); and (ii) Mbwazirume (intermediate) vs. Kayinja (resistant). Day-old larvae were offered weighed pieces of corm that were changed every 4-7days. At each corm change, weights of the larvae, corms and frass were measured. Changes in corm and larval weight were calculated to determine larval growth and amount of tissue consumed. Larvae feeding on resistant cultivars had lower consumption and growth rates and longer developmental duration. It was concluded that low food consumption rates contribute to delayed development of larvae feeding on resistant cultivars. Differences between resistant and susceptible cultivars in food utilization may be of limited consequence for the cultivars tested. This is one step in identifying the factors influencing weevil development rates in cultivars of different resistance levels. If these factors are identified, they can be targeted in breeding for resistance. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.

Context: Banana is one of the most important fruits crops among the different fruit crops in the agricultural and its intensively cultivated in all over the parts of Bangladesh especially in northern part. Many species of plant parasitic nematodes are association with banana root systems and are mainly responsible for controlling the banana productions to greater extend. Objective: Keeping in view of the disturbing nature of the nematode pest, the present study was undertaken to examine the biodiversity of plant parasitic nematodes associated with banana intensively grown in northern districts of Bangladesh. Materials and Methods: The collection of nematodes was conducted in the banana growing areas of Bogra, Natore, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Gaibandha districts. In each area, banana fields of different commercial cultivars were chosen for collection of soil and root samples. From each field 10 plants were selected randomly for sample collection. Each subsample consisted about 1 kg of soil and 20 g of fleshy roots taken from a single mat from a depth of 10-30 cm and from three equidistant points (40-50 cm) around the pseudostem Nematodes were extracted from soil by Cobb's sieving technique and from root by Mechanical maceration technique, and processed by Seinhorst's slow dehydration method. Fixing was done in boiling lactophenol cotton blue and finally by formalin glycerin solution. Dehydrated nematodes were kept in glycerol-ethanol solution and mounted permanently on glass slides. Identification was done up to species following the keys. Results: Among the plant parasitic nematodes ten species belonging to nine genera, six families of a single order, viz. Helicotylenchus dihystera, Rotylenchulus reniformis, Meloidogyne incognita, Hoplolaimus galeatus, Tylenchorhynchus mashhoodi, Tylenchorhynchus annulatus, Criconemoides sp., Hemicriconemoides cocophillus, Cephalenchus emarginatus and Aphelenchus avenae were encountered. Among the non-parasitic nematodes 15 genera belonging to seven families and three orders viz. Acrobeles, Acrobeloides, Aporcelaimus, Aporcelaimium, Aporcelaimellus, Cephalobus, Dorylaimus, Dorylaimoides, Discolaimus, Discolaimium, Discolaimoides, Indodorylaimus, Mylonchulus, Iotonchus, and Rhabditis were found to be associated with soils in banana field. It was found that species H. galeatus, C. emarginatus and M. incognita were present in all the surveyed areas. Four species of parasitic nematodes viz. C. emarginatus, H. cocophillus, Criconemoides sp. and A. avenae and 5 genera of non parasitic nematodes viz., Aporcelaimium, Aporcelaimellus, Discolaimium, Discolaimoides and Indodorylaimus are reported for the first time in Bangladesh. Conclusion: Present investigation have clearly indicated that the association of plant parasitic nematodes especially the most an important nematodes species like Hoplolaimus galeatus, Cephalenchus emarginatus and Meloidogyne incognita would cause severe economic yield loss to banana plantation in the study area.

The pseudostem weevil (Odoiporus longicollis) is one of the most dangerous pests in banana crop. On farm and laboratory experiments were carried out at the Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Pechiparai, Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu, India during the period 2010-2011 to assess the bio-efficacy of Beauveria bassiana, Azadirachtin 10000 ppm and monocrotophos (spray and injection) insecticide against pseudostem weevil, Odoiporus longicollis Oliver (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in Red banana. Injection of monocrotophos @ 4ml/plant registered the highest per cent reduction (76.07%) followed by the injection of Azadirachtin 2ml/plant (70.0%), application of B. bassiana @ 25g on the pseudostem trap (56.75%) and monocrotophos spray (38.39%). However, application of monocrotophos (4ml/plant) and Azadirachtin (2ml/plant) by stem injection proved to be more effective than by spraying of monocrotophos. Stem injection of monocrotophos, Azadirachtin and the application of B. bassiana recorded the highest per cent mortality of 96.15, 84.74 and 75.36%, respectively, after 96 hrs of application. All the treatments were found to increase the fruit yield with better cost benefit ratio. © JBiopest.

The present study was conducted in two successive seasons (2009/2010 and 2010/2011) on the first and second ratoons of Williams banana plants cultivated in loamy clay soil under flood irrigation at a private orchard located at Tanta, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt. Four planting densities (ranged from 933 to 1400 plants feddan-1) were examined to study their effect on vegetative growth, flowering, yield and fruit quality of Williams banana. Banana plants grown at close spacing had taller pseudostem than plants grown under wide spacing. The highest yield per feddan was obtained from plants spaced at 3×2 in with two plants per hole, followed by those at 3×1 in, with one plant per hole since it was 34.07 and 30.33 tons in the first ratoon and 34.80 and 31.50 in the second ratoon for both planting distances, respectively. Earliest bunch shooting and minimum days for harvesting were recorded with planting distance 3×4 in with three plants per hole and bunch emerged earlier (12-13 days) than bunches produced from plants spaced at 3×1 in with one plants per hole in both first and second ratoons, respectively. Heaviest bunches were harvested from plants at 3×4 in spacing with three plants per hole. Increasing yield per feddan by this planting distance could be attributed mainly to the increasing number of plants in the area unit. The highest finger weight, length, Total Soluble Solids (TSS%) and total sugars% were produced from plant spaced at 3×4 in with three plants per hole. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.

The aim of this study was to assess the transmission of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana among adults of banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) in the field. C. sordidus healthy adults were marked and released on the basis of banana plants. Two days later insects marked and inoculated with the entomopathogenic fungus were released in the same area. Pseudostem traps were placed at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days for recover of released insects and to evaluate the mortality. It was observed that 3.7% of the non inoculated insects died due to pathogen infection caracterizing B. bassiana transmission between inoculated and healthy insects due to an increase in natural pre-existing prevalescence that was 0.3% of infected insects.

Banana xanthomonas wilt (XW) caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm) attacks all banana cultivars. Xcm in inflorescence-infected Pisang Awak plants with wilting male bud bracts is restricted to the upper parts of the true stem; therefore, cutting these plants at the pseudostem base has been recommended to prevent further Xcm spread. In order to fine-tune existing control strategies, this study examined the movement of Xcm into plants and mats, in relation to disease incubation period. Mature Pisang Awak and East African highland (AAA-EA) plants were inoculated with Xcm through abscission wounds of female bracts, male bud bracts, male flowers, a combination of male bud bracts and flowers, and by cutting male buds with a contaminated machete. Thirty plants per genotype and treatment were monitored for 24 months for disease symptoms. An additional 68 AAA-EA and 33 Pisang Awak plants were sampled weekly to assess the rate of Xcm spread within the plants. All floral entry points resulted in disease, with the highest incidence in combined male bract and male flower abscission wound inoculations. The study confirmed the systemicity of Xcm, with the pathogen able to live within the mat for long periods (5-16 months) without causing disease. Reliance on disease symptom expression to manage XW is therefore not sufficient. The long incubation period in lateral shoots may explain the current resurgence of the disease in locations where the disease was thought to have been successfully eradicated. © 2012 The Authors Plant Pathology © 2012 BSPP.

Terra) of the "Recôncavo" and southern regions in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The virulence of 32 B. bassiana isolates against C. sordidus was determined under laboratory conditions. Three isolates (CNPMF 407, CNPMF 218, and CNPMF 416) were selected for evaluation under field conditions in plantations located in the counties of Mutuípe and Wenceslau Guimarães. Population of C. sordidus was estimated every 15 days by using pseudostem traps. The efficiency of the three strains of B. bassiana was compared to chemical control (carbofuran, 4g/trap) and absence of control. Carbofuran caused around 90% of adult mortality after 12 months, with a reduction in the population of C. sordidus since the first evaluation. A low number of trapped insects was observed in the fungus-treated plots, suggesting the efficiency of the isolates in controlling the C. sordidus population. The strain CNPMF 218 was the most efficient in controlling C. sordidus adults in both locations, causing around 20% mortality, leading to 40% population size reduction after 12 months. © 2013 Marilene Fancelli et al.

Small-scale banana producers in Tanzania are facing constraints caused by the destructive activities of the banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus Germar). Many currently used methods of addressing the problem are ineffective or too expensive for local farmers to implement. Materials and methods. A combination of two integrated pest management (IPM) tools (regular trapping in combination with field sanitation) was tested at two farmer-managed sites (Bujela and Kyimo) and one researcher-managed site (SUA-Morogoro). Treated areas were surrounded by untreated control areas where no trapping and limited sanitation was done. Changes in population densities were estimated by the mark-recapture procedure and the Lincoln index. Results and discussion. After eight months, weevil populations in the cleaned and trapped areas had been reduced by 33% (Bujela), 33% (Kyimo) and 74% (SUA). The change in population sizes in the control areas differed greatly, possibly due to discrepancies in field management between farmers' and researchers' practice. Trap types, areas and sites affected the number of weevils captured. Disc-on-stump (DOS) traps captured more weevils than corm disc (CD) and pseudostem (PS) traps. Weevils responded more strongly to traps in the clean area at SUA compared with the other two sites, probably because the more rigid sanitation practices at SUA meant that volatiles from the traps were less likely to be masked by volatiles from surrounding residues. Conclusion. Regular trapping with field sanitation can greatly reduce populations of banana weevils, but strict adherence to method execution is required in order to gain favourable results. © 2013 EDP Sciences.

An attract-and-kill approach based on pellets from soybean or palm stearin fats blended with the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. sensu lato and the aggregation pheromone sordidin (Cosmolure®) was tested against the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The viability of B. bassiana conidia, blended with hydrogenated oil and exposed for up to 150 min to heating at 50 °C, was not affected and the aggregation pheromone did not undergo any decomposition. Conidial viability in pellets decreased by 50% after an average of 15.1 and 9.1 days at 25 and 40 °C, respectively, when packaged in polypropylene bags. Active packaging (hermetic bag + O2/moisture-absorbing sachet) increased the shelf lives almost 10 and 6 times at 25 and 40 °C, respectively. In olfactometer bioassays, fat pellets amended with pheromone (sordidin, 1% wt/vol) were highly attractive to C. sordidus adults for up to 15 days, after which the pheromone release rate had decreased by about 90% and pellets were no longer attractive. Pellets with pheromone and conidia were as attractive to C. sordidus as banana rhizomes, and considerably more attractive than pieces of pseudostem. In no-choice experiments conducted in boxes, survival of insects exposed to fungus-impregnated pellets was affected by fat type (soybean fat vs. palm stearin) and bioassay temperature (25 vs. 30 °C), with results favoring soybean fat pellets at the higher temperature (96.9% of mortality after 18 days and ST50 of 7.7 days). However, mortality levels were low (21.7% for soybean fat pellets) or very low (1-5% for palm stearin pellets) in choice experiments carried out at 25 °C when fungus-impregnated pellets were applied before or after exposure of pseudostem residues to insects, respectively. The potential of this delivery system to manage C. sordidus populations and other insect pests (including those with cryptic habits) is discussed. © 2014 The Netherlands Entomological Society.

Banana Xanthomonas wilt (XW), caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm), results in up to 100% yield loss. The efficiency of XW infection through the corm, pseudostem inoculation at bunch harvest, leaf, female and male bud bracts was evaluated in banana plants. The male and female bud bract inoculations caused the highest incidence (81% and 93%) compared with 0-44% for harvest and corm inoculations. Naturally mediated insect transmission in Pisang Awak resulted in up to 99% disease incidence. Floral inoculations and natural insect-mediated infections only resulted in floral symptoms. Symptom development in insect-transmitted infections simulated artificial male bud inoculations, confirming the male bud bract wounds as the main entry points for insect vector-mediated infections, thus reaffirming the importance of continuous and timely debudding to limit insect spread. Leaf and harvest inoculations resulted only in leaf symptoms, while corm inoculations resulted in late floral symptoms. Floral inoculations were the main mode of infection. Single leaf inoculations resulted in 30% plant mortality despite 100% incidence, with 70% of plants recovering and bearing visibly healthy bunches and suckers. Thus, detection of a diseased plant in a mat shouldnt warrant the destruction of the whole mat. A significant difference in Xcm cfu g-1 was observed between symptomatic and symptomless leaves, suggesting that practices that keep the bacterial load below the disease-causing threshold could benefit the plant. This could explain the observed success of XW control through removal of single diseased stems in farms. © 2014 The Canadian Phytopathological Society.

Bacterial diseases of bananas and enset have not received, until recently, an equal amount of attention compared to other major threats to banana production such as the fungal diseases black leaf streak (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense). However, bacteria cause significant impacts on bananas globally and management practices are not always well known or adopted by farmers. Bacterial diseases in bananas and enset can be divided into three groups: (1) Ralstoniaassociated diseases (Moko/Bugtok disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and banana blood disease caused by R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis); (2) Xanthomonas wilt of banana and enset, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum and (3) Erwinia-associated diseases (bacterial head rot or tip-over disease Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi), bacterial rhizome and pseudostem wet rot (Dickeya paradisiaca formerly E. chrysanthemi pv. paradisiaca). Other bacterial diseases of less widespread importance include: bacterial wilt of abaca, Javanese vascular wilt and bacterial fingertip rot (probably caused by Ralstonia spp., unconfirmed). This review describes global distribution, symptoms, pathogenic diversity, epidemiology and the state of the art for sustainable disease management of the major bacterial wilts currently affecting banana and enset. © 2017 Blomme, Dita, Jacobsen, Pérez Vicente, Molina, Ocimati, Poussier and Prior.

The recent surge in demand for exotic ornamental crops such as orchids has led to a rise in international production, and a sharp increase in the number of plant and plant products moving between countries. Along with the plants, diseases are also being transported and introduced into new areas. Fusarium is one of the major diseases causing pathogens infecting orchids that is spreading through international trade. Studies have identified several species of Fusarium associated with orchids, some are pathogenic and cause symptoms such as leaf and flower spots, leaf or sheath blights, pseudostem or root rots, and wilts. Infection and damage caused by Fusarium reduces the quality of plants and flowers, and can cause severe economic losses. This review documents the current status of the Fusarium-orchid interaction, and illustrates challenges and future perspectives based on the available literature. This review is the first of Fusarium and orchid interactions, and integrates diverse results that both furthers the understanding and knowledge of this disease complex, and will enable the development of effective disease management practices. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

Laboratory bioassays were conducted using an electroantennogram (EAG) and Y-tube olfactometer to study the electrophysiological and olfactory responses of banana pseudostem weevil (BSW), Odoiporus longicollis to its aggregation pheromone, 2-methyl-4- heptanol (2M4H) and host plant extract (HPE). The aggregation pheromone and HPE from highly susceptible cultivar Nendran were tested individually and in combination to ascertain the synergistic effect of HPE on 2M4H to the BSW. The peripheral response of antennae to the 2M4H + HPE combination elicited significantly strong amplitude of 4.089 ± 0.043 mV in males in comparison to females over the aggregation pheromone and HPE individually. Dose-dependent responses indicated difference between sexes and concentrations. Behavioural assay using Y-tube demonstrated that both sexes responded to host volatiles, and that males were more sensitive than females. Similarly, both the sexes responded most strongly (64.21% ± 3.91% of males and 55.47% ± 3.06% of females) to the odour sources comprising pheromone with host plant volatiles. Addition of HPE to 2M4H significantly increased EAG activity and also the attraction as indicated in the Y-tube behavioural bioassay; thus, the blend forms a good attractant. The present study provides information useful in developing pheromonebased lure in conjunction with HPE for monitoring and mass-trapping of O. longicollis. © 2019, Current Science.

Timing and distribution of attack on East African highland banana (Musa AAAEA) by the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was studied in a field trial at a farm 25 km NE of Kampala, Uganda. Weevils were released at three densities (5, 20 and 40 females per mat) in 324 m2 banana plots (cv Atwalira) that had been established 18 months earlier and maintained relatively free of weevils. Two weeks after release, entire mats were removed and examined for weevil eggs and first instar larvae. At a density of 20 weevils per mat, oviposition occurred on 25% of plants less than 6 six months old (suckers) with an average of three eggs (range 0-16) per infested plant. At the same time, 85% of flowered plants were attacked with mean oviposition of 15 eggs (range 0-41) per plant. An inverse relationship existed between weevil population density and eggs/female/plant. Five females per mat produced an average of 7.2 eggs per flowered plant, whereas 20 females produced 15 eggs per flowered plant and 40 females produced 12.5 eggs. This suggests the existence of density-dependent factors in weevil oviposition. Over 90% of the oviposition occurred in the base of the pseudostem, with the remaining eggs found in the corm and roots near the soil surface. However, in stands displaying high mat, (a condition in which part of the corm appears above the soil surface) more eggs were found on the corm than pseudostem.

The effects of host and non-host plant odours on the foraging responses of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), were investigated in the laboratory through arena and olfactometer bioassays. Contrary to previous reports that banana rhizome and pseudostem were the most attractive parts to the weevil, dead leaves were most preferred. Comparison of dead banana leaves with dead leaves of other plants showed that attractant odours were present in yam, cocoyam and dead grasses but absent in cocoa and soybean leaves. Complete leaf senescence while the leaf was attached to the mother plant proved necessary for the development of the dead-leaf-based odours but the involvement of microbial organisms could not be demonstrated. It is possible that dead-leaf-based attractants could be used in combination with microbials such as entomogenous fungi and nematodes in integrated management of C. sordidus.

The horizontal and vertical distribution of plant parasitic root nematodes on banana (Musa AAA cv. Valery) was determined in a sandy clay loam in Costa Rica. Root samples were taken from soil blocks at distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem, from 0 to 120 cm depth at intervals of 15 cm, and from plants of 120, 150, 180 or 210 cm high (non-flowering), plus a set from plants at flower stalk. The horizontal distance from the pseudostem affected the percentage of Radopholus similis, Pratylenchus spp., and total nematodes (R. similis + Helicotylenchus spp. + Meloidogyne spp. + Pratylenchus spp.). There was a significant effect of soil depth on the density of each genus. An interaction between soil depth and plant height and with horizontal distance was found for R. similis and total nematodes. For the three horizontal distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of each genus decreased with soil depth. Higher percentages of R. similis and total nematodes were found at 0 to 30 cm horizontal distance from the pseudostem than at greater distances in the upper 30 cm of the soil profile. Therefore, samples for monitoring nematode populations in bananas should be taken within a horizontal distance of 0 to 30 cm from the plant base and down to 30 cm deep from the soil surface. Additional studies are needed to relate the nematode population density at this sampling point to yield.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

Host location, acceptance and larval success were studied in a mixed cultivar trial consisting of three East African cooking bananas, two East African beer banana and Kayinja (an exotic cultivar used for beer making). Weevil damage to the endemic cultivars was 5 to 25 times higher than that of Kayinja. Capture of weevils in pseudostem traps at the base of banana mats was highest for Kayinja, while egg density on Kayinja was similar to that of four endemic cultivars. Therefore, host location and acceptance do not appear to be factors in host plant resistance. In contrast, larval survivorship indices were 10 to 23 times higher in endemic cultivars than in Kayinja suggesting that larval success may be an important factor in resistance to banana weevils. Timing of attack was similar among cultivars. Oviposition occurred throughout the banana cycle with egg density increasing with plant age. These data provide a possible explanation of differences in weevil attack found among banana cultivars in Uganda.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

Controlled studies to determine the efficacy of pseudostem trapping in reducing adult populations of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), were conducted under farmer conditions in Ntungamo district, Uganda. Twenty-seven farms were stratified on the basis of C. sordidus population density (estimated by mark and recapture methods) and divided among three treatments: (i) researcher-managed trapping (one trap per mat per month): (ii) farmer-managed trapping (trap intensity at discretion of farmer); and (iii) controls (no trapping). Intensive trapping (managed by researchers) resulted in significantly lower C. sordidus damage after one year. Over the same period, C. sordidus numbers declined by 61% on farms where trapping was managed by researchers, 53% where farmers managed trapping and 38% on farms without trapping; however, results varied greatly among farms and, overall, there was no significant effect of trapping on C. sordidus numbers. Moreover, there was only a weak relationship between the number of C. sordidus removed and the change in population density. Trapping success appeared to be affected by management levels and immigration from neighbouring farms. Although farmers were convinced that trapping was beneficial, adoption has been low due to resource requirements.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) survives as an endophyte in a wide range of plants, offering substantial protection against tunneling insect pests. Although current research indicates that the fungus can live as an endophyte in tissue-cultured banana plants, there is no information on the efficacy of endophytic B. bassiana against the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Our study aimed at determining the effects of endophytic B. bassiana on oviposition rate and populations of the banana weevil, and their plant damage. Screenhouse studies were undertaken in which 8-week-old B. bassiana-inoculated tissue-cultured banana plants [cultivar Kibuzi, Musa spec. (Musaceae), genome group AAA-EA] were infested with female banana weevils. Five days after plant infestation with the banana weevil, there was no effect of B. bassiana on oviposition rate and egg hatchability. However, after 15 weeks, the presence of B. bassiana as an endophyte in banana tissues greatly reduced banana weevil populations and their damage to plants. Between 53.4 and 57.7% of the banana weevil adults died because of B. bassiana infection, resulting in a reduction of plant damage by 29.1-62.7% depending on plant part. Beauveria bassiana was re-isolated from different plant parts, but to a greater extent from the roots and rhizomes than from pseudostem bases. Artificial inoculation of B. bassiana in banana plants caused no negative impact on banana growth. Our study demonstrated for the first time that endophytic B. bassiana reduced populations of C. sordidus and the plant damage they cause, and can thus be an alternative method for effective delivery of this fungus to banana plants for the management of C. sordidus.

The banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus, is the most important insect pest of banana and plantain in the world. Cultural control methods were investigated over 2 years in southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Harvesting at ground level and dissection of remnants (treatment 1), and covering the base of the mat (entire plant consisting of several meristems) with soil and moving debris to the inter-row (treatment 2), were compared to a positive control that involved treatment of plants with a registered pesticide (treatment 3), and a negative control that involved harvesting at 150 cm from the collar with no soil or sanitation amendments (treatment 4). Yield, weevil damage and pseudostem girth of plants were measured from August to November annually, while adult beetle densities were assessed over 4 weeks in October/November and April. Nematode samples were taken and analysed in October/November every year. Damage parameters included the coefficient of infestation, the percentage coefficient of infestation (PCI) at two intervals, the summed PCI value, the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder and cortex, and the mean cross-sectional damage percentage. A randomized block design with three replicates was used in the trial. The parameters were similar before the onset of the trial. Fruit yield and plant girth, corrected by nematode densities, were not significantly different in any treatment, nor were the nematodes controlled. Soil cover and recession of remnants was the only effective treatment, significantly reducing the CI, but not the adult density or the other damage parameters. Soil cover showed promise as a cultural control method because it only needs to be applied seasonally and reduced the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder, the damage parameter most closely related to yield, by 14%.

The banana weevil (BRW), Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is the most devastating pest of banana in most production areas, which limits production and productivity of bananas throughout the world. Numerous chemical insecticides are available commercially to manage this pest. However, it was more expensive and undesirable for the management of this pest. In this study, the effect of commercially available neem-based botanical insecticide neem gold on BRW was studied under laboratory condition. The weevils were separately maintained up to 96 hours on neem gold treated banana rhizomes. The total and differential haemocytes count; total body protein and fat body protein profile were performed using SDS-PAGE. 33.33% of C. sordidus were settled on neem-gold and significantly (P<0.05) caused minimum mortality (6.7%) whereas 66.6% weevils preferred the untreated pseudostem. However, treatment reduced both total haemocyte count (40%) and various haemocytes level. The total body protein and fat body protein analysis shows that 4 KDa to 163 KDa molecular weight and 144 to 7 KDa molecular weight polypeptides respectively are present. Consumption of neem gold impregnated banana pseudostem reduced the total body protein polypeptide to 8 KDa whereas the fat body polypeptide increased from 161 to 8 KDa. These results suggested that neem gold could be used as insecticide against C. sordidus. (c) JBiopest.

Cost implications and lack of knowledge for ideal pest control practices are among the major factors limiting banana and plantain (Musa spp.) production in Nigeria. A trial was designed to control banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus), a major insect pest, and termites (Microtermes spp.), an occasional pest, by low-cost methods. The main plot treatments included the cultivars TMPX 5295 and TMPX 7152-2 (AAA genotypes) and 'Agbagba' and 'Red Ogoni' (AAB genotypes). Treatment combinations of mulching with neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves, application of poultry manure, and minimal application of insecticide (chlorpyrifos) constituted the subplot. The split-plot trial was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Numbers of weevils and termites were monitored in 2004 and 2005. Significantly lower weevil numbers were observed in plots treated with insecticide or neem mulch (with or without manure) compared with the untreated control (with or without manure). Weevil and termite numbers observed in insecticide treated plots were not significantly lower than those in the neem mulched plots during the plant or first ratoon crops. Significantly higher weevil larvae numbers were observed in the control plants (2.2 plant-1) compared with those that received insecticide or neem mulch applications (maximum 0.4 plant-1). In the first ratoon crop, significantly lower numbers of adult weevils and larvae were observed in cultivars with an AAA genotype than in the Red Ogoni cultivar. Cultivar had no significant effect on termite infestations. The interaction of treatments and cultivars significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced weevil number in the crop but did not reduce termite numbers. Significantly higher mean total fruit yields (minimum 15 t ha-1) were obtained from the insecticide and neem treated plants compared with the control (maximum 11 t ha-1) at the end of the first ratoon crop. The treatments showed prospect in the control of banana weevils.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. (c) 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

1 The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major pest in banana (Musa spp.) growing areas. The weevil is known to be relatively sedentary and closely associated with its host plant but little is known about the species' ability to migrate between banana fields and in nonhost habitats. 2 Mark-recapture experiments were conducted to assess the weevils' migration potential, possible differences between the sexes, and the relative attractiveness of pseudostem and pheromone baits. 3 One thousand two hundred marked weevils were released in the nonhost habitat at five distances (5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 m) from fresh pseudostem, and from pitfall traps baited with 45 mg of sordidin. 4 Two hundred males and 200 females were marked and released at five distances (5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 m) from the pheromone traps. 5 Distance and distance/bait interactions had a significant effect on recaptured weevils (binary logistic regression). The two baits were almost equally attractive to weevils in the range 0-10 m, whereas the pheromone was more attractive in the range 10-100 m. 6 Distance, bait and distance/bait interactions had a significant effect on the time elapsed from release to recapture (regression with life data) but the pattern observed was not consistent. 7 There was no significant difference between males and females with respect to distance or time elapsed from release to recapture. 8 The results obtained in the present study show that the migration potential of the banana weevil is greater than previously reported. This should be taken into account when new banana fields are established with clean planting material. Published 2011. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

Nutrient composition, secondary plant substances and other host quality characteristics govern resistance and influence herbivore feeding. The current study was carried out to compare aspects of feeding behaviour and food utilization of banana weevil (Germar) (Coleptera: Curculionidae) larvae feeding on banana cultivars with different levels of resistance. In the first study, penetration times of larvae into tissue of seven banana cultivars (two susceptible, three intermediate and four resistant) were compared. Day-old larvae were placed on corm or pseudostem tissue of these cultivars and time taken to penetrate the tissue was recorded. Larvae generally took longer to tunnel into resistant cultivars, although Yangambi Km5 (resistant) did not fit this pattern. In the second set of studies, food consumption and growth of larvae were compared on cultivars: (i) Kisubi (resistant) vs. Atwalira (susceptible); and (ii) Mbwazirume (intermediate) vs. Kayinja (resistant). Day-old larvae were offered weighed pieces of corm that were changed every 4-7days. At each corm change, weights of the larvae, corms and frass were measured. Changes in corm and larval weight were calculated to determine larval growth and amount of tissue consumed. Larvae feeding on resistant cultivars had lower consumption and growth rates and longer developmental duration. It was concluded that low food consumption rates contribute to delayed development of larvae feeding on resistant cultivars. Differences between resistant and susceptible cultivars in food utilization may be of limited consequence for the cultivars tested. This is one step in identifying the factors influencing weevil development rates in cultivars of different resistance levels. If these factors are identified, they can be targeted in breeding for resistance. (c) 2010 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.

Context: Banana is one of the most important fruits crops among the different fruit crops in the agricultural and its intensively cultivated in all over the parts of Bangladesh especially in northern part. Many species of plant parasitic nematodes are association with banana root systems and are mainly responsible for controlling the banana productions to greater extend. Objective: Keeping in view of the disturbing nature of the nematode pest, the present study was undertaken to examine the biodiversity of plant parasitic nematodes associated with banana intensively grown in northern districts of Bangladesh. Materials and Methods: The collection of nematodes was conducted in the banana growing areas of Bogra, Natore, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Gaibandha districts. In each area, banana fields of different commercial cultivars were chosen for collection of soil and root samples. From each field 10 plants were selected randomly for sample collection. Each subsample consisted about 1 kg of soil and 20 g of fleshy roots taken from a single mat from a depth of 10-30 cm and from three equidistant points (40-50 cm) around the pseudostem Nematodes were extracted from soil by Cobb's sieving technique and from root by Mechanical maceration technique, and processed by Seinhorst's slow dehydration method. Fixing was done in boiling lactophenol cotton blue and finally by formalin glycerin solution. Dehydrated nematodes were kept in glycerol-ethanol solution and mounted permanently on glass slides. Identification was done up to species following the keys. Results: Among the plant parasitic nematodes ten species belonging to nine genera, six families of a single order, viz. Helicotylenchus dihystera, Rotylenchulus reniformis, Meloidogyne incognita, Hoplolaimus galeatus, Tylenchorhynchus mashhoodi, Tylenchorhynchus annulatus, Criconemoides sp., Hemicriconemoides cocophillus, Cephalenchus emarginatus and Aphelenchus avenae were encountered. Among the non-parasitic nematodes 15 genera belonging to seven families and three orders viz. Acrobeles, Acrobeloides, Aporcelaimus, Aporcelaimium, Aporcelaimellus, Cephalobus, Dorylaimus, Dorylaimoides, Discolaimus, Discolaimium, Discolaimoides, Indodorylaimus, Mylonchulus, Iotonchus, and Rhabditis were found to be associated with soils in banana field. It was found that species H. galeatus, C. emarginatus and M. incognita were present in all the surveyed areas. Four species of parasitic nematodes viz. C. emarginatus, H. cocophillus, Criconemoides sp. and A. avenae and 5 genera of non parasitic nematodes viz., Aporcelaimium, Aporcelaimellus, Discolaimium, Discolaimoides and Indodorylaimus are reported for the first time in Bangladesh. Conclusion: Present investigation have clearly indicated that the association of plant parasitic nematodes especially the most an important nematodes species like Hoplolaimus galeatus, Cephalenchus emarginatus and Meloidogyne incognita would cause severe economic yield loss to banana plantation in the study area.

The pseudostem weevil (Odoiporus longicollis) is one of the most dangerous pests in banana crop. On farm and laboratory experiments were carried out at the Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Pechiparai, Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu, India during the period 2010-2011 to assess the bio-efficacy of Beauveria bassiana, Azadirachtin 10000 ppm and monocrotophos (spray and injection) insecticide against pseudostem weevil, Odoiporus longicollis Oliver (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in Red banana. Injection of monocrotophos @ 4ml/plant registered the highest per cent reduction (76.07%) followed by the injection of Azadirachtin 2ml/plant (70.0%), application of B. bassiana @ 25g on the pseudostem trap (56.75%) and monocrotophos spray (38.39%). However, application of monocrotophos (4ml/plant) and Azadirachtin (2ml/plant) by stem injection proved to be more effective than by spraying of monocrotophos. Stem injection of monocrotophos, Azadirachtin and the application of B. bassiana recorded the highest per cent mortality of 96.15, 84.74 and 75.36%, respectively, after 96 hrs of application. All the treatments were found to increase the fruit yield with better cost benefit ratio. (c) JBiopest.

The present study was conducted in two successive seasons (2009/2010 and 2010/2011) on the first and second ratoons of Williams banana plants cultivated in loamy clay soil under flood irrigation at a private orchard located at Tanta, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt. Four planting densities (ranged from 933 to 1400 plants feddan-1) were examined to study their effect on vegetative growth, flowering, yield and fruit quality of Williams banana. Banana plants grown at close spacing had taller pseudostem than plants grown under wide spacing. The highest yield per feddan was obtained from plants spaced at 3x2 in with two plants per hole, followed by those at 3x1 in, with one plant per hole since it was 34.07 and 30.33 tons in the first ratoon and 34.80 and 31.50 in the second ratoon for both planting distances, respectively. Earliest bunch shooting and minimum days for harvesting were recorded with planting distance 3x4 in with three plants per hole and bunch emerged earlier (12-13 days) than bunches produced from plants spaced at 3x1 in with one plants per hole in both first and second ratoons, respectively. Heaviest bunches were harvested from plants at 3x4 in spacing with three plants per hole. Increasing yield per feddan by this planting distance could be attributed mainly to the increasing number of plants in the area unit. The highest finger weight, length, Total Soluble Solids (TSS%) and total sugars% were produced from plant spaced at 3x4 in with three plants per hole. (c) 2012 Academic Journals Inc.

The aim of this study was to assess the transmission of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana among adults of banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) in the field. C. sordidus healthy adults were marked and released on the basis of banana plants. Two days later insects marked and inoculated with the entomopathogenic fungus were released in the same area. Pseudostem traps were placed at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days for recover of released insects and to evaluate the mortality. It was observed that 3.7% of the non inoculated insects died due to pathogen infection caracterizing B. bassiana transmission between inoculated and healthy insects due to an increase in natural pre-existing prevalescence that was 0.3% of infected insects.

Banana xanthomonas wilt (XW) caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm) attacks all banana cultivars. Xcm in inflorescence-infected Pisang Awak plants with wilting male bud bracts is restricted to the upper parts of the true stem; therefore, cutting these plants at the pseudostem base has been recommended to prevent further Xcm spread. In order to fine-tune existing control strategies, this study examined the movement of Xcm into plants and mats, in relation to disease incubation period. Mature Pisang Awak and East African highland (AAA-EA) plants were inoculated with Xcm through abscission wounds of female bracts, male bud bracts, male flowers, a combination of male bud bracts and flowers, and by cutting male buds with a contaminated machete. Thirty plants per genotype and treatment were monitored for 24 months for disease symptoms. An additional 68 AAA-EA and 33 Pisang Awak plants were sampled weekly to assess the rate of Xcm spread within the plants. All floral entry points resulted in disease, with the highest incidence in combined male bract and male flower abscission wound inoculations. The study confirmed the systemicity of Xcm, with the pathogen able to live within the mat for long periods (5-16 months) without causing disease. Reliance on disease symptom expression to manage XW is therefore not sufficient. The long incubation period in lateral shoots may explain the current resurgence of the disease in locations where the disease was thought to have been successfully eradicated.

The objective of this study was to select strains of Beauveria bassiana for controlling Cosmopolites sordidus (Germ.) in plantain farms (cv. Terra) of the "Reconcavo" and southern regions in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The virulence of 32 B. bassiana isolates against C. sordidus was determined under laboratory conditions. Three isolates (CNPMF 407, CNPMF 218, and CNPMF 416) were selected for evaluation under field conditions in plantations located in the counties of Mutuipe and Wenceslau Guimaraes. Population of C. sordidus was estimated every 15 days by using pseudostem traps. The efficiency of the three strains of B. bassiana was compared to chemical control (carbofuran, 4g/trap) and absence of control. Carbofuran caused around 90% of adult mortality after 12 months, with a reduction in the population of C. sordidus since the first evaluation. A low number of trapped insects was observed in the fungus-treated plots, suggesting the efficiency of the isolates in controlling the C. sordidus population. The strain CNPMF 218 was the most efficient in controlling C. sordidus adults in both locations, causing around 20% mortality, leading to 40% population size reduction after 12 months.

Small-scale banana producers in Tanzania are facing constraints caused by the destructive activities of the banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus Germar). Many currently used methods of addressing the problem are ineffective or too expensive for local farmers to implement. Materials and methods. A combination of two integrated pest management (IPM) tools (regular trapping in combination with field sanitation) was tested at two farmer-managed sites (Bujela and Kyimo) and one researcher-managed site (SUA-Morogoro). Treated areas were surrounded by untreated control areas where no trapping and limited sanitation was done. Changes in population densities were estimated by the mark-recapture procedure and the Lincoln index. Results and discussion. After eight months, weevil populations in the cleaned and trapped areas had been reduced by 33% (Bujela), 33% (Kyimo) and 74% (SUA). The change in population sizes in the control areas differed greatly, possibly due to discrepancies in field management between farmers' and researchers' practice. Trap types, areas and sites affected the number of weevils captured. Disc-on-stump (DOS) traps captured more weevils than corm disc (CD) and pseudostem (PS) traps. Weevils responded more strongly to traps in the clean area at SUA compared with the other two sites, probably because the more rigid sanitation practices at SUA meant that volatiles from the traps were less likely to be masked by volatiles from surrounding residues. Conclusion. Regular trapping with field sanitation can greatly reduce populations of banana weevils, but strict adherence to method execution is required in order to gain favourable results.

An attract-and-kill approach based on pellets from soybean or palm stearin fats blended with the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. sensu lato and the aggregation pheromone sordidin (Cosmolure(r)) was tested against the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The viability of B. bassiana conidia, blended with hydrogenated oil and exposed for up to 150 min to heating at 50 degC, was not affected and the aggregation pheromone did not undergo any decomposition. Conidial viability in pellets decreased by 50% after an average of 15.1 and 9.1 days at 25 and 40 degC, respectively, when packaged in polypropylene bags. Active packaging (hermetic bag + O2/moisture-absorbing sachet) increased the shelf lives almost 10 and 6 times at 25 and 40 degC, respectively. In olfactometer bioassays, fat pellets amended with pheromone (sordidin, 1% wt/vol) were highly attractive to C. sordidus adults for up to 15 days, after which the pheromone release rate had decreased by about 90% and pellets were no longer attractive. Pellets with pheromone and conidia were as attractive to C. sordidus as banana rhizomes, and considerably more attractive than pieces of pseudostem. In no-choice experiments conducted in boxes, survival of insects exposed to fungus-impregnated pellets was affected by fat type (soybean fat vs. palm stearin) and bioassay temperature (25 vs. 30 degC), with results favoring soybean fat pellets at the higher temperature (96.9% of mortality after 18 days and ST50 of 7.7 days). However, mortality levels were low (21.7% for soybean fat pellets) or very low (1-5% for palm stearin pellets) in choice experiments carried out at 25 degC when fungus-impregnated pellets were applied before or after exposure of pseudostem residues to insects, respectively. The potential of this delivery system to manage C. sordidus populations and other insect pests (including those with cryptic habits) is discussed. (c) 2014 The Netherlands Entomological Society.

Banana Xanthomonas wilt (XW), caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm), results in up to 100% yield loss. The efficiency of XW infection through the corm, pseudostem inoculation at bunch harvest, leaf, female and male bud bracts was evaluated in banana plants. The male and female bud bract inoculations caused the highest incidence (81% and 93%) compared with 0-44% for harvest and corm inoculations. Naturally mediated insect transmission in Pisang Awak resulted in up to 99% disease incidence. Floral inoculations and natural insect-mediated infections only resulted in floral symptoms. Symptom development in insect-transmitted infections simulated artificial male bud inoculations, confirming the male bud bract wounds as the main entry points for insect vector-mediated infections, thus reaffirming the importance of continuous and timely debudding to limit insect spread. Leaf and harvest inoculations resulted only in leaf symptoms, while corm inoculations resulted in late floral symptoms. Floral inoculations were the main mode of infection. Single leaf inoculations resulted in 30% plant mortality despite 100% incidence, with 70% of plants recovering and bearing visibly healthy bunches and suckers. Thus, detection of a diseased plant in a mat shouldnt warrant the destruction of the whole mat. A significant difference in Xcm cfu g-1 was observed between symptomatic and symptomless leaves, suggesting that practices that keep the bacterial load below the disease-causing threshold could benefit the plant. This could explain the observed success of XW control through removal of single diseased stems in farms. (c) 2014 The Canadian Phytopathological Society.

Bacterial diseases of bananas and enset have not received, until recently, an equal amount of attention compared to other major threats to banana production such as the fungal diseases black leaf streak (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense). However, bacteria cause significant impacts on bananas globally and management practices are not always well known or adopted by farmers. Bacterial diseases in bananas and enset can be divided into three groups: (1) Ralstoniaassociated diseases (Moko/Bugtok disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and banana blood disease caused by R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis); (2) Xanthomonas wilt of banana and enset, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum and (3) Erwinia-associated diseases (bacterial head rot or tip-over disease Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi), bacterial rhizome and pseudostem wet rot (Dickeya paradisiaca formerly E. chrysanthemi pv. paradisiaca). Other bacterial diseases of less widespread importance include: bacterial wilt of abaca, Javanese vascular wilt and bacterial fingertip rot (probably caused by Ralstonia spp., unconfirmed). This review describes global distribution, symptoms, pathogenic diversity, epidemiology and the state of the art for sustainable disease management of the major bacterial wilts currently affecting banana and enset.

The recent surge in demand for exotic ornamental crops such as orchids has led to a rise in international production, and a sharp increase in the number of plant and plant products moving between countries. Along with the plants, diseases are also being transported and introduced into new areas. Fusarium is one of the major diseases causing pathogens infecting orchids that is spreading through international trade. Studies have identified several species of Fusarium associated with orchids, some are pathogenic and cause symptoms such as leaf and flower spots, leaf or sheath blights, pseudostem or root rots, and wilts. Infection and damage caused by Fusarium reduces the quality of plants and flowers, and can cause severe economic losses. This review documents the current status of the Fusarium-orchid interaction, and illustrates challenges and future perspectives based on the available literature. This review is the first of Fusarium and orchid interactions, and integrates diverse results that both furthers the understanding and knowledge of this disease complex, and will enable the development of effective disease management practices.

Laboratory bioassays were conducted using an electroantennogram (EAG) and Y-tube olfactometer to study the electrophysiological and olfactory responses of banana pseudostem weevil (BSW), Odoiporus longicollis to its aggregation pheromone, 2-methyl-4- heptanol (2M4H) and host plant extract (HPE). The aggregation pheromone and HPE from highly susceptible cultivar Nendran were tested individually and in combination to ascertain the synergistic effect of HPE on 2M4H to the BSW. The peripheral response of antennae to the 2M4H + HPE combination elicited significantly strong amplitude of 4.089 +- 0.043 mV in males in comparison to females over the aggregation pheromone and HPE individually. Dose-dependent responses indicated difference between sexes and concentrations. Behavioural assay using Y-tube demonstrated that both sexes responded to host volatiles, and that males were more sensitive than females. Similarly, both the sexes responded most strongly (64.21% +- 3.91% of males and 55.47% +- 3.06% of females) to the odour sources comprising pheromone with host plant volatiles. Addition of HPE to 2M4H significantly increased EAG activity and also the attraction as indicated in the Y-tube behavioural bioassay; thus, the blend forms a good attractant. The present study provides information useful in developing pheromonebased lure in conjunction with HPE for monitoring and mass-trapping of O. longicollis. (c) 2019, Current Science.

Timing and distribution of attack on East African highland banana (Musa AAAEA) by the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was studied in a field trial at a farm 25 km NE of Kampala, Uganda. Weevils were released at three densities (5, 20 and 40 females per mat) in 324 m2 banana plots (cv Atwalira) that had been established 18 months earlier and maintained relatively free of weevils. Two weeks after release, entire mats were removed and examined for weevil eggs and first instar larvae. At a density of 20 weevils per mat, oviposition occurred on 25% of plants less than 6 six months old (suckers) with an average of three eggs (range 0-16) per infested plant. At the same time, 85% of flowered plants were attacked with mean oviposition of 15 eggs (range 0-41) per plant. An inverse relationship existed between weevil population density and eggs/female/plant. Five females per mat produced an average of 7.2 eggs per flowered plant, whereas 20 females produced 15 eggs per flowered plant and 40 females produced 12.5 eggs. This suggests the existence of density-dependent factors in weevil oviposition. Over 90% of the oviposition occurred in the base of the pseudostem, with the remaining eggs found in the corm and roots near the soil surface. However, in stands displaying high mat, (a condition in which part of the corm appears above the soil surface) more eggs were found on the corm than pseudostem.

The effects of host and non-host plant odours on the foraging responses of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), were investigated in the laboratory through arena and olfactometer bioassays. Contrary to previous reports that banana rhizome and pseudostem were the most attractive parts to the weevil, dead leaves were most preferred. Comparison of dead banana leaves with dead leaves of other plants showed that attractant odours were present in yam, cocoyam and dead grasses but absent in cocoa and soybean leaves. Complete leaf senescence while the leaf was attached to the mother plant proved necessary for the development of the dead-leaf-based odours but the involvement of microbial organisms could not be demonstrated. It is possible that dead-leaf-based attractants could be used in combination with microbials such as entomogenous fungi and nematodes in integrated management of C. sordidus.

The horizontal and vertical distribution of plant parasitic root nematodes on banana (Musa AAA cv. Valery) was determined in a sandy clay loam in Costa Rica. Root samples were taken from soil blocks at distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem, from 0 to 120 cm depth at intervals of 15 cm, and from plants of 120, 150, 180 or 210 cm high (non-flowering), plus a set from plants at flower stalk. The horizontal distance from the pseudostem affected the percentage of Radopholus similis, Pratylenchus spp., and total nematodes (R. similis + Helicotylenchus spp. + Meloidogyne spp. + Pratylenchus spp.). There was a significant effect of soil depth on the density of each genus. An interaction between soil depth and plant height and with horizontal distance was found for R. similis and total nematodes. For the three horizontal distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of each genus decreased with soil depth. Higher percentages of R. similis and total nematodes were found at 0 to 30 cm horizontal distance from the pseudostem than at greater distances in the upper 30 cm of the soil profile. Therefore, samples for monitoring nematode populations in bananas should be taken within a horizontal distance of 0 to 30 cm from the plant base and down to 30 cm deep from the soil surface. Additional studies are needed to relate the nematode population density at this sampling point to yield.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

Host location, acceptance and larval success were studied in a mixed cultivar trial consisting of three East African cooking bananas, two East African beer banana and Kayinja (an exotic cultivar used for beer making). Weevil damage to the endemic cultivars was 5 to 25 times higher than that of Kayinja. Capture of weevils in pseudostem traps at the base of banana mats was highest for Kayinja, while egg density on Kayinja was similar to that of four endemic cultivars. Therefore, host location and acceptance do not appear to be factors in host plant resistance. In contrast, larval survivorship indices were 10 to 23 times higher in endemic cultivars than in Kayinja suggesting that larval success may be an important factor in resistance to banana weevils. Timing of attack was similar among cultivars. Oviposition occurred throughout the banana cycle with egg density increasing with plant age. These data provide a possible explanation of differences in weevil attack found among banana cultivars in Uganda.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

Controlled studies to determine the efficacy of pseudostem trapping in reducing adult populations of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), were conducted under farmer conditions in Ntungamo district, Uganda. Twenty-seven farms were stratified on the basis of C. sordidus population density (estimated by mark and recapture methods) and divided among three treatments: (i) researcher-managed trapping (one trap per mat per month): (ii) farmer-managed trapping (trap intensity at discretion of farmer); and (iii) controls (no trapping). Intensive trapping (managed by researchers) resulted in significantly lower C. sordidus damage after one year. Over the same period, C. sordidus numbers declined by 61% on farms where trapping was managed by researchers, 53% where farmers managed trapping and 38% on farms without trapping; however, results varied greatly among farms and, overall, there was no significant effect of trapping on C. sordidus numbers. Moreover, there was only a weak relationship between the number of C. sordidus removed and the change in population density. Trapping success appeared to be affected by management levels and immigration from neighbouring farms. Although farmers were convinced that trapping was beneficial, adoption has been low due to resource requirements.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) survives as an endophyte in a wide range of plants, offering substantial protection against tunneling insect pests. Although current research indicates that the fungus can live as an endophyte in tissue-cultured banana plants, there is no information on the efficacy of endophytic B. bassiana against the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Our study aimed at determining the effects of endophytic B. bassiana on oviposition rate and populations of the banana weevil, and their plant damage. Screenhouse studies were undertaken in which 8-week-old B. bassiana-inoculated tissue-cultured banana plants [cultivar Kibuzi, Musa spec. (Musaceae), genome group AAA-EA] were infested with female banana weevils. Five days after plant infestation with the banana weevil, there was no effect of B. bassiana on oviposition rate and egg hatchability. However, after 15 weeks, the presence of B. bassiana as an endophyte in banana tissues greatly reduced banana weevil populations and their damage to plants. Between 53.4 and 57.7% of the banana weevil adults died because of B. bassiana infection, resulting in a reduction of plant damage by 29.1-62.7% depending on plant part. Beauveria bassiana was re-isolated from different plant parts, but to a greater extent from the roots and rhizomes than from pseudostem bases. Artificial inoculation of B. bassiana in banana plants caused no negative impact on banana growth. Our study demonstrated for the first time that endophytic B. bassiana reduced populations of C. sordidus and the plant damage they cause, and can thus be an alternative method for effective delivery of this fungus to banana plants for the management of C. sordidus.

The banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus, is the most important insect pest of banana and plantain in the world. Cultural control methods were investigated over 2 years in southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Harvesting at ground level and dissection of remnants (treatment 1), and covering the base of the mat (entire plant consisting of several meristems) with soil and moving debris to the inter-row (treatment 2), were compared to a positive control that involved treatment of plants with a registered pesticide (treatment 3), and a negative control that involved harvesting at 150 cm from the collar with no soil or sanitation amendments (treatment 4). Yield, weevil damage and pseudostem girth of plants were measured from August to November annually, while adult beetle densities were assessed over 4 weeks in October/November and April. Nematode samples were taken and analysed in October/November every year. Damage parameters included the coefficient of infestation, the percentage coefficient of infestation (PCI) at two intervals, the summed PCI value, the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder and cortex, and the mean cross-sectional damage percentage. A randomized block design with three replicates was used in the trial. The parameters were similar before the onset of the trial. Fruit yield and plant girth, corrected by nematode densities, were not significantly different in any treatment, nor were the nematodes controlled. Soil cover and recession of remnants was the only effective treatment, significantly reducing the CI, but not the adult density or the other damage parameters. Soil cover showed promise as a cultural control method because it only needs to be applied seasonally and reduced the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder, the damage parameter most closely related to yield, by 14%.

The banana weevil (BRW), Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is the most devastating pest of banana in most production areas, which limits production and productivity of bananas throughout the world. Numerous chemical insecticides are available commercially to manage this pest. However, it was more expensive and undesirable for the management of this pest. In this study, the effect of commercially available neem-based botanical insecticide neem gold on BRW was studied under laboratory condition. The weevils were separately maintained up to 96 hours on neem gold treated banana rhizomes. The total and differential haemocytes count; total body protein and fat body protein profile were performed using SDS-PAGE. 33.33% of C. sordidus were settled on neem-gold and significantly (P<0.05) caused minimum mortality (6.7%) whereas 66.6% weevils preferred the untreated pseudostem. However, treatment reduced both total haemocyte count (40%) and various haemocytes level. The total body protein and fat body protein analysis shows that 4 KDa to 163 KDa molecular weight and 144 to 7 KDa molecular weight polypeptides respectively are present. Consumption of neem gold impregnated banana pseudostem reduced the total body protein polypeptide to 8 KDa whereas the fat body polypeptide increased from 161 to 8 KDa. These results suggested that neem gold could be used as insecticide against C. sordidus. (c) JBiopest.

Cost implications and lack of knowledge for ideal pest control practices are among the major factors limiting banana and plantain (Musa spp.) production in Nigeria. A trial was designed to control banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus), a major insect pest, and termites (Microtermes spp.), an occasional pest, by low-cost methods. The main plot treatments included the cultivars TMPX 5295 and TMPX 7152-2 (AAA genotypes) and 'Agbagba' and 'Red Ogoni' (AAB genotypes). Treatment combinations of mulching with neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves, application of poultry manure, and minimal application of insecticide (chlorpyrifos) constituted the subplot. The split-plot trial was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Numbers of weevils and termites were monitored in 2004 and 2005. Significantly lower weevil numbers were observed in plots treated with insecticide or neem mulch (with or without manure) compared with the untreated control (with or without manure). Weevil and termite numbers observed in insecticide treated plots were not significantly lower than those in the neem mulched plots during the plant or first ratoon crops. Significantly higher weevil larvae numbers were observed in the control plants (2.2 plant-1) compared with those that received insecticide or neem mulch applications (maximum 0.4 plant-1). In the first ratoon crop, significantly lower numbers of adult weevils and larvae were observed in cultivars with an AAA genotype than in the Red Ogoni cultivar. Cultivar had no significant effect on termite infestations. The interaction of treatments and cultivars significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced weevil number in the crop but did not reduce termite numbers. Significantly higher mean total fruit yields (minimum 15 t ha-1) were obtained from the insecticide and neem treated plants compared with the control (maximum 11 t ha-1) at the end of the first ratoon crop. The treatments showed prospect in the control of banana weevils.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. (c) 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

1 The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major pest in banana (Musa spp.) growing areas. The weevil is known to be relatively sedentary and closely associated with its host plant but little is known about the species' ability to migrate between banana fields and in nonhost habitats. 2 Mark-recapture experiments were conducted to assess the weevils' migration potential, possible differences between the sexes, and the relative attractiveness of pseudostem and pheromone baits. 3 One thousand two hundred marked weevils were released in the nonhost habitat at five distances (5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 m) from fresh pseudostem, and from pitfall traps baited with 45 mg of sordidin. 4 Two hundred males and 200 females were marked and released at five distances (5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 m) from the pheromone traps. 5 Distance and distance/bait interactions had a significant effect on recaptured weevils (binary logistic regression). The two baits were almost equally attractive to weevils in the range 0-10 m, whereas the pheromone was more attractive in the range 10-100 m. 6 Distance, bait and distance/bait interactions had a significant effect on the time elapsed from release to recapture (regression with life data) but the pattern observed was not consistent. 7 There was no significant difference between males and females with respect to distance or time elapsed from release to recapture. 8 The results obtained in the present study show that the migration potential of the banana weevil is greater than previously reported. This should be taken into account when new banana fields are established with clean planting material. Published 2011. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

Nutrient composition, secondary plant substances and other host quality characteristics govern resistance and influence herbivore feeding. The current study was carried out to compare aspects of feeding behaviour and food utilization of banana weevil (Germar) (Coleptera: Curculionidae) larvae feeding on banana cultivars with different levels of resistance. In the first study, penetration times of larvae into tissue of seven banana cultivars (two susceptible, three intermediate and four resistant) were compared. Day-old larvae were placed on corm or pseudostem tissue of these cultivars and time taken to penetrate the tissue was recorded. Larvae generally took longer to tunnel into resistant cultivars, although Yangambi Km5 (resistant) did not fit this pattern. In the second set of studies, food consumption and growth of larvae were compared on cultivars: (i) Kisubi (resistant) vs. Atwalira (susceptible); and (ii) Mbwazirume (intermediate) vs. Kayinja (resistant). Day-old larvae were offered weighed pieces of corm that were changed every 4-7days. At each corm change, weights of the larvae, corms and frass were measured. Changes in corm and larval weight were calculated to determine larval growth and amount of tissue consumed. Larvae feeding on resistant cultivars had lower consumption and growth rates and longer developmental duration. It was concluded that low food consumption rates contribute to delayed development of larvae feeding on resistant cultivars. Differences between resistant and susceptible cultivars in food utilization may be of limited consequence for the cultivars tested. This is one step in identifying the factors influencing weevil development rates in cultivars of different resistance levels. If these factors are identified, they can be targeted in breeding for resistance. (c) 2010 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.

Context: Banana is one of the most important fruits crops among the different fruit crops in the agricultural and its intensively cultivated in all over the parts of Bangladesh especially in northern part. Many species of plant parasitic nematodes are association with banana root systems and are mainly responsible for controlling the banana productions to greater extend. Objective: Keeping in view of the disturbing nature of the nematode pest, the present study was undertaken to examine the biodiversity of plant parasitic nematodes associated with banana intensively grown in northern districts of Bangladesh. Materials and Methods: The collection of nematodes was conducted in the banana growing areas of Bogra, Natore, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Gaibandha districts. In each area, banana fields of different commercial cultivars were chosen for collection of soil and root samples. From each field 10 plants were selected randomly for sample collection. Each subsample consisted about 1 kg of soil and 20 g of fleshy roots taken from a single mat from a depth of 10-30 cm and from three equidistant points (40-50 cm) around the pseudostem Nematodes were extracted from soil by Cobb's sieving technique and from root by Mechanical maceration technique, and processed by Seinhorst's slow dehydration method. Fixing was done in boiling lactophenol cotton blue and finally by formalin glycerin solution. Dehydrated nematodes were kept in glycerol-ethanol solution and mounted permanently on glass slides. Identification was done up to species following the keys. Results: Among the plant parasitic nematodes ten species belonging to nine genera, six families of a single order, viz. Helicotylenchus dihystera, Rotylenchulus reniformis, Meloidogyne incognita, Hoplolaimus galeatus, Tylenchorhynchus mashhoodi, Tylenchorhynchus annulatus, Criconemoides sp., Hemicriconemoides cocophillus, Cephalenchus emarginatus and Aphelenchus avenae were encountered. Among the non-parasitic nematodes 15 genera belonging to seven families and three orders viz. Acrobeles, Acrobeloides, Aporcelaimus, Aporcelaimium, Aporcelaimellus, Cephalobus, Dorylaimus, Dorylaimoides, Discolaimus, Discolaimium, Discolaimoides, Indodorylaimus, Mylonchulus, Iotonchus, and Rhabditis were found to be associated with soils in banana field. It was found that species H. galeatus, C. emarginatus and M. incognita were present in all the surveyed areas. Four species of parasitic nematodes viz. C. emarginatus, H. cocophillus, Criconemoides sp. and A. avenae and 5 genera of non parasitic nematodes viz., Aporcelaimium, Aporcelaimellus, Discolaimium, Discolaimoides and Indodorylaimus are reported for the first time in Bangladesh. Conclusion: Present investigation have clearly indicated that the association of plant parasitic nematodes especially the most an important nematodes species like Hoplolaimus galeatus, Cephalenchus emarginatus and Meloidogyne incognita would cause severe economic yield loss to banana plantation in the study area.

The pseudostem weevil (Odoiporus longicollis) is one of the most dangerous pests in banana crop. On farm and laboratory experiments were carried out at the Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Pechiparai, Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu, India during the period 2010-2011 to assess the bio-efficacy of Beauveria bassiana, Azadirachtin 10000 ppm and monocrotophos (spray and injection) insecticide against pseudostem weevil, Odoiporus longicollis Oliver (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in Red banana. Injection of monocrotophos @ 4ml/plant registered the highest per cent reduction (76.07%) followed by the injection of Azadirachtin 2ml/plant (70.0%), application of B. bassiana @ 25g on the pseudostem trap (56.75%) and monocrotophos spray (38.39%). However, application of monocrotophos (4ml/plant) and Azadirachtin (2ml/plant) by stem injection proved to be more effective than by spraying of monocrotophos. Stem injection of monocrotophos, Azadirachtin and the application of B. bassiana recorded the highest per cent mortality of 96.15, 84.74 and 75.36%, respectively, after 96 hrs of application. All the treatments were found to increase the fruit yield with better cost benefit ratio. (c) JBiopest.

The present study was conducted in two successive seasons (2009/2010 and 2010/2011) on the first and second ratoons of Williams banana plants cultivated in loamy clay soil under flood irrigation at a private orchard located at Tanta, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt. Four planting densities (ranged from 933 to 1400 plants feddan-1) were examined to study their effect on vegetative growth, flowering, yield and fruit quality of Williams banana. Banana plants grown at close spacing had taller pseudostem than plants grown under wide spacing. The highest yield per feddan was obtained from plants spaced at 3x2 in with two plants per hole, followed by those at 3x1 in, with one plant per hole since it was 34.07 and 30.33 tons in the first ratoon and 34.80 and 31.50 in the second ratoon for both planting distances, respectively. Earliest bunch shooting and minimum days for harvesting were recorded with planting distance 3x4 in with three plants per hole and bunch emerged earlier (12-13 days) than bunches produced from plants spaced at 3x1 in with one plants per hole in both first and second ratoons, respectively. Heaviest bunches were harvested from plants at 3x4 in spacing with three plants per hole. Increasing yield per feddan by this planting distance could be attributed mainly to the increasing number of plants in the area unit. The highest finger weight, length, Total Soluble Solids (TSS%) and total sugars% were produced from plant spaced at 3x4 in with three plants per hole. (c) 2012 Academic Journals Inc.

The aim of this study was to assess the transmission of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana among adults of banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) in the field. C. sordidus healthy adults were marked and released on the basis of banana plants. Two days later insects marked and inoculated with the entomopathogenic fungus were released in the same area. Pseudostem traps were placed at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days for recover of released insects and to evaluate the mortality. It was observed that 3.7% of the non inoculated insects died due to pathogen infection caracterizing B. bassiana transmission between inoculated and healthy insects due to an increase in natural pre-existing prevalescence that was 0.3% of infected insects.

Banana xanthomonas wilt (XW) caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm) attacks all banana cultivars. Xcm in inflorescence-infected Pisang Awak plants with wilting male bud bracts is restricted to the upper parts of the true stem; therefore, cutting these plants at the pseudostem base has been recommended to prevent further Xcm spread. In order to fine-tune existing control strategies, this study examined the movement of Xcm into plants and mats, in relation to disease incubation period. Mature Pisang Awak and East African highland (AAA-EA) plants were inoculated with Xcm through abscission wounds of female bracts, male bud bracts, male flowers, a combination of male bud bracts and flowers, and by cutting male buds with a contaminated machete. Thirty plants per genotype and treatment were monitored for 24 months for disease symptoms. An additional 68 AAA-EA and 33 Pisang Awak plants were sampled weekly to assess the rate of Xcm spread within the plants. All floral entry points resulted in disease, with the highest incidence in combined male bract and male flower abscission wound inoculations. The study confirmed the systemicity of Xcm, with the pathogen able to live within the mat for long periods (5-16 months) without causing disease. Reliance on disease symptom expression to manage XW is therefore not sufficient. The long incubation period in lateral shoots may explain the current resurgence of the disease in locations where the disease was thought to have been successfully eradicated.

The objective of this study was to select strains of Beauveria bassiana for controlling Cosmopolites sordidus (Germ.) in plantain farms (cv. Terra) of the "Reconcavo" and southern regions in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The virulence of 32 B. bassiana isolates against C. sordidus was determined under laboratory conditions. Three isolates (CNPMF 407, CNPMF 218, and CNPMF 416) were selected for evaluation under field conditions in plantations located in the counties of Mutuipe and Wenceslau Guimaraes. Population of C. sordidus was estimated every 15 days by using pseudostem traps. The efficiency of the three strains of B. bassiana was compared to chemical control (carbofuran, 4g/trap) and absence of control. Carbofuran caused around 90% of adult mortality after 12 months, with a reduction in the population of C. sordidus since the first evaluation. A low number of trapped insects was observed in the fungus-treated plots, suggesting the efficiency of the isolates in controlling the C. sordidus population. The strain CNPMF 218 was the most efficient in controlling C. sordidus adults in both locations, causing around 20% mortality, leading to 40% population size reduction after 12 months.

Small-scale banana producers in Tanzania are facing constraints caused by the destructive activities of the banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus Germar). Many currently used methods of addressing the problem are ineffective or too expensive for local farmers to implement. Materials and methods. A combination of two integrated pest management (IPM) tools (regular trapping in combination with field sanitation) was tested at two farmer-managed sites (Bujela and Kyimo) and one researcher-managed site (SUA-Morogoro). Treated areas were surrounded by untreated control areas where no trapping and limited sanitation was done. Changes in population densities were estimated by the mark-recapture procedure and the Lincoln index. Results and discussion. After eight months, weevil populations in the cleaned and trapped areas had been reduced by 33% (Bujela), 33% (Kyimo) and 74% (SUA). The change in population sizes in the control areas differed greatly, possibly due to discrepancies in field management between farmers' and researchers' practice. Trap types, areas and sites affected the number of weevils captured. Disc-on-stump (DOS) traps captured more weevils than corm disc (CD) and pseudostem (PS) traps. Weevils responded more strongly to traps in the clean area at SUA compared with the other two sites, probably because the more rigid sanitation practices at SUA meant that volatiles from the traps were less likely to be masked by volatiles from surrounding residues. Conclusion. Regular trapping with field sanitation can greatly reduce populations of banana weevils, but strict adherence to method execution is required in order to gain favourable results.

An attract-and-kill approach based on pellets from soybean or palm stearin fats blended with the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. sensu lato and the aggregation pheromone sordidin (Cosmolure(r)) was tested against the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The viability of B. bassiana conidia, blended with hydrogenated oil and exposed for up to 150 min to heating at 50 degC, was not affected and the aggregation pheromone did not undergo any decomposition. Conidial viability in pellets decreased by 50% after an average of 15.1 and 9.1 days at 25 and 40 degC, respectively, when packaged in polypropylene bags. Active packaging (hermetic bag + O2/moisture-absorbing sachet) increased the shelf lives almost 10 and 6 times at 25 and 40 degC, respectively. In olfactometer bioassays, fat pellets amended with pheromone (sordidin, 1% wt/vol) were highly attractive to C. sordidus adults for up to 15 days, after which the pheromone release rate had decreased by about 90% and pellets were no longer attractive. Pellets with pheromone and conidia were as attractive to C. sordidus as banana rhizomes, and considerably more attractive than pieces of pseudostem. In no-choice experiments conducted in boxes, survival of insects exposed to fungus-impregnated pellets was affected by fat type (soybean fat vs. palm stearin) and bioassay temperature (25 vs. 30 degC), with results favoring soybean fat pellets at the higher temperature (96.9% of mortality after 18 days and ST50 of 7.7 days). However, mortality levels were low (21.7% for soybean fat pellets) or very low (1-5% for palm stearin pellets) in choice experiments carried out at 25 degC when fungus-impregnated pellets were applied before or after exposure of pseudostem residues to insects, respectively. The potential of this delivery system to manage C. sordidus populations and other insect pests (including those with cryptic habits) is discussed. (c) 2014 The Netherlands Entomological Society.

Banana Xanthomonas wilt (XW), caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm), results in up to 100% yield loss. The efficiency of XW infection through the corm, pseudostem inoculation at bunch harvest, leaf, female and male bud bracts was evaluated in banana plants. The male and female bud bract inoculations caused the highest incidence (81% and 93%) compared with 0-44% for harvest and corm inoculations. Naturally mediated insect transmission in Pisang Awak resulted in up to 99% disease incidence. Floral inoculations and natural insect-mediated infections only resulted in floral symptoms. Symptom development in insect-transmitted infections simulated artificial male bud inoculations, confirming the male bud bract wounds as the main entry points for insect vector-mediated infections, thus reaffirming the importance of continuous and timely debudding to limit insect spread. Leaf and harvest inoculations resulted only in leaf symptoms, while corm inoculations resulted in late floral symptoms. Floral inoculations were the main mode of infection. Single leaf inoculations resulted in 30% plant mortality despite 100% incidence, with 70% of plants recovering and bearing visibly healthy bunches and suckers. Thus, detection of a diseased plant in a mat shouldnt warrant the destruction of the whole mat. A significant difference in Xcm cfu g-1 was observed between symptomatic and symptomless leaves, suggesting that practices that keep the bacterial load below the disease-causing threshold could benefit the plant. This could explain the observed success of XW control through removal of single diseased stems in farms. (c) 2014 The Canadian Phytopathological Society.

Bacterial diseases of bananas and enset have not received, until recently, an equal amount of attention compared to other major threats to banana production such as the fungal diseases black leaf streak (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense). However, bacteria cause significant impacts on bananas globally and management practices are not always well known or adopted by farmers. Bacterial diseases in bananas and enset can be divided into three groups: (1) Ralstoniaassociated diseases (Moko/Bugtok disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and banana blood disease caused by R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis); (2) Xanthomonas wilt of banana and enset, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum and (3) Erwinia-associated diseases (bacterial head rot or tip-over disease Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi), bacterial rhizome and pseudostem wet rot (Dickeya paradisiaca formerly E. chrysanthemi pv. paradisiaca). Other bacterial diseases of less widespread importance include: bacterial wilt of abaca, Javanese vascular wilt and bacterial fingertip rot (probably caused by Ralstonia spp., unconfirmed). This review describes global distribution, symptoms, pathogenic diversity, epidemiology and the state of the art for sustainable disease management of the major bacterial wilts currently affecting banana and enset.

The recent surge in demand for exotic ornamental crops such as orchids has led to a rise in international production, and a sharp increase in the number of plant and plant products moving between countries. Along with the plants, diseases are also being transported and introduced into new areas. Fusarium is one of the major diseases causing pathogens infecting orchids that is spreading through international trade. Studies have identified several species of Fusarium associated with orchids, some are pathogenic and cause symptoms such as leaf and flower spots, leaf or sheath blights, pseudostem or root rots, and wilts. Infection and damage caused by Fusarium reduces the quality of plants and flowers, and can cause severe economic losses. This review documents the current status of the Fusarium-orchid interaction, and illustrates challenges and future perspectives based on the available literature. This review is the first of Fusarium and orchid interactions, and integrates diverse results that both furthers the understanding and knowledge of this disease complex, and will enable the development of effective disease management practices.

Laboratory bioassays were conducted using an electroantennogram (EAG) and Y-tube olfactometer to study the electrophysiological and olfactory responses of banana pseudostem weevil (BSW), Odoiporus longicollis to its aggregation pheromone, 2-methyl-4- heptanol (2M4H) and host plant extract (HPE). The aggregation pheromone and HPE from highly susceptible cultivar Nendran were tested individually and in combination to ascertain the synergistic effect of HPE on 2M4H to the BSW. The peripheral response of antennae to the 2M4H + HPE combination elicited significantly strong amplitude of 4.089 +- 0.043 mV in males in comparison to females over the aggregation pheromone and HPE individually. Dose-dependent responses indicated difference between sexes and concentrations. Behavioural assay using Y-tube demonstrated that both sexes responded to host volatiles, and that males were more sensitive than females. Similarly, both the sexes responded most strongly (64.21% +- 3.91% of males and 55.47% +- 3.06% of females) to the odour sources comprising pheromone with host plant volatiles. Addition of HPE to 2M4H significantly increased EAG activity and also the attraction as indicated in the Y-tube behavioural bioassay; thus, the blend forms a good attractant. The present study provides information useful in developing pheromonebased lure in conjunction with HPE for monitoring and mass-trapping of O. longicollis. (c) 2019, Current Science.
