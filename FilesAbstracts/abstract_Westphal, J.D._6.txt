Boards of directors have been the subject of extensive conceptualization and empirical research. We review literature addressing boards of directors from the perspective of the control, service, and resource dependence roles that directors are hypothesized to fulfill, with particular focus on that research reported after the Zahra and Pearce (1989) compendium. We also discuss a number of methodological and conceptual elements which complicate the aggregation of research in this area of inquiry. (c) 1996 JAI Press Inc.

We investigate the role that a voluntary corporate restructuring can play in the design of efficient internal corporate control mechanisms. To this end, we examine the post-restructuring internal control practices in 78 voluntary corporate spin-offs that were completed between 1972 and 1987. We find that the selection of the new CEOs, the design of their compensation contracts, and the staffing of the boards of directors and their compensation committees in the spun-off firms can be seen as ex ante efficient. These governance and control practices, however, are not strongly related to the observed positive market reactions to the spin-off announcements. The results indicate that equity reorganizations facilitate the implementation of efficient internal governance and control practices, but that other factors must influence the share price reactions to the announcement of such voluntary corporate restructurings.

Incentive or performance contingent compensation plans are rapidly becoming the norm in corporate America, as boards of directors attempt to make executives more accountable to shareholders. However, incentive plans also expose executives to risk, and may also impart a short-term bias on their decision-making processes. This article suggests that the tension between the pressures for accountability and long-term decision making can be managed by aligning firm strategy with an incentive plan that is based on an appropriate performance criteria.

This paper examines CEO compensation, with an emphasis on the power of CEOs to influence their own compensation by managing the compensation process. It analyzes the CEO's power over the board of directors and the political tactics used by the CEO to manage the board and its compensation decisions. An empirical examination of CEO compensation in 203 large American manufacturing firms in 1985 illustrates the effect of CEO power on compensation and the flexibility available to the CEO in establishing the legitimacy of compensation. The implications of this perspective for management control of corporations and for CEO compensation research are considered. (c) 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Although a host of theory-driven rationales suggest a relationship between board of directors size and firm performance, the literature provides no consensus about the direction of that relationship. A meta-analysis of 131 samples (N = 20,620) provided systematic evidence of nonzero, positive, true population estimates of board size-performance relationships.

In this demonstration article, the authors explain procedures for combining the richness of detail that is characteristic of qualitative data collection with the hypothesis testing advantage of statistical inference techniques. Qualitative data came from a 5-year participant observation study of a corporate board of directors. Quantification of the participant observer's qualitative field notes was achieved by using content analysis to code directors ' verbal behaviors. Based on counts of directors'verbal behaviors, the authors tested illustrative hypotheses concerning group process within the board. Univariate (Cox-Stuart's test of trend), bivariate (Kendall's nonparametric correlation), and multivariate (log Poisson regression with post hoc contrasts) analyses were conducted. The study's use of qualitative and quantitative information promoted both "discovery" (i.e., theory development) and "justification" (i.e., theory evaluation) and facilitated a "discovery-justification-discovery cycle" that was particularly useful for understanding group processes with the corporate board.

This paper examines the impact of the entry and exit of board of directors on the share price of United Kingdom listed firms. Unlike previous studies in the area, this study distinguishes between the different type of board changes. The results of the study suggest that changes in the composition of management boards affect shareholders wealth. Small but significant positive abnormal returns are experienced on the day of the announcement. The results also indicate that the informational effects of new appointments are perceived differently by the market from resignations from the management board.

The coefficient of variation (V) is a statistical measure commonly used for comparing diversity in work groups. It has been employed by organizational researchers to index the relative internal variability of top-management teams, task groups, boards of directors, departments, and other social aggregates on numerous dimensions. Commenting on its widespread application, this article reviews cautions and pitfalls associated with its use for this purpose. Research implications associated with using V are also discussed.

Using both agency and institutional theories, we examined factors associated with the board's adoption of a formal process for evaluating the performance of the corporation's chief executive officer (CEO). Our sample was drawn from the hospital industry. Results show that an independent board chairperson, the level of market competition and the degree of managed care penetration were significant predictors of whether or not the board had adopted a formal CEO evaluation process. These findings imply that initiatives to improve governance effectiveness based on agency theory should take into account the institutional environment of corporate boards.

Utilizing Rest's moral development and Victor and Cullen's ethical climate surveys, we examine differences in moral reasoning and ethical climate between board members in the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors. Six for-profit corporations and seven not-for-profit corporations, all with base operations in a major midwestern state, participated in the study. We find that profit and not-for-profit boards may not differ in moral reasoning, but do exhibit different types of ethical climates. We also find that for-profit board members may utilize higher stages of reasoning a greater percentage of the time than not-for-profit directors. In contrast, the ethical climates of the two types of organizations are significantly different. For-profit companies had climates higher in egoism than did not-for-profit companies. In addition, not-for-profit firms reflected higher benevolence factors than for-profit firms. Not-for-profit organizations also had somewhat higher, but not significantly different, mean scores on the principle factor compared to the for-profit organizations.

Because shark repellents decrease the vulnerability of firms (and their incumbent managers) to the market for corporate control, the decision to adopt these devices represents an excellent test of agency theory. In this empirical study, we examined the relationships between the adoption of shark repellents and several mechanisms that, according to agency theory, should align the interests of corporate board members and shareholders and/or make directors more effective monitors of management behaviour. Of the variables included, only board stock ownership (especially by employee directors) was linked to a reduced propensity to adopt shark repellents in the predicted manner. Two variables not immediately associated with agency theory - the proportion of inside directors appointed by the incumbent chief executive officer (CEO) and a lower ratio of CEO compensation to the compensation of other top executives - were linked to higher rates of shark repellent adoption. Given that agency theory explains relatively little of the variance in shark repellent adoption, we advocate serious consideration of other theoretical formulations for corporate governance, including two approaches -stewardship theory and agent morality - that take the moral ('other regarding') obligations of directors seriously.

This article studies which of the directors of the largest corporations in Israel were invited to sit on additional boards of directors between the years 1974 and 1988. The article compares organizational affiliations, and the human and social capital of directors who accumulate directorships with those who do not. The study uses logistic regression to discern which variables increase the likelihood of being invited on to an additional board. The findings strongly support the hypothesis that it is a combination of the structure of the national economy and human and social capital of the directors which determines who will join additional boards.

This paper analyses and describes the possible role and responsibility of workers (via their representatives) in the process of strategic decision-making at corporate level, especially in the Netherlands where the Works Council (Ondernemingsraad) has achieved a certain degree of maturity in the last decade. It is a reaction to the lack of attention to workers' participation in the actual debate on Corporate Governance. From our point of view workers also have to be seen as equal 'stakeholders' and partners in decision-making. In several Dutch companies forms of partnership in corporate governance are starting to develop. But also in other countries (like Germany) and at European level Works Councils are starting to discuss strategic topics with the Board of Directors. After describing the position and role of the most important boards and stakeholders at corporate level (the Board of Directors, the Supervisory Board, the shareholders, the trade unions and the works councils), the paper presents a stakeholder model in which also the workers participate and exercise influence on strategic decision-making. Finally it gives practical suggestions for the improvement of the position of workers' participation in corporate governance. These suggestions and recommandations are mainly based on experiences in Dutch companies.

This study investigates the influence of growth potential on corporate governance mechanisms. Results suggest that firms with high growth potential make greater use of managerial equity ownership and long term incentives and have higher proportions of insiders on their boards of directors. The findings are congruent with the argument that firms with high growth potential make use of more flexible, future-oriented mechanisms of corporate governance.

Prior research has investigated determinants of CEO compensation. However, that research has been primarily limited to large firms. This study investigates the impact of CEO influence over the board of directors on CEO pay for both large and small firms. Additionally, other determinants of CEO pay for both large and small firms are examined. Results suggest that CEO influence over the board significantly affects CEO pay for large firms. However, we do not find the same evidence for small firms. Firm size is the primary factor of CEO pay for small firms. Evidence in this study suggests that CEO pay of large firms is mostly a function of CEO influence over the board, firm size, and firm performance. (c) MCB UP Limited 2000.

Managing the succession process by the hiring and firing of key executives is one of the important functions of a board of directors. In this research we study successions of fund managers in the closed-end mutual fund industry. The agency issues inherent in closed-end mutual funds makes them a unique laboratory for such a study. Our results suggest that while the overall abnormal returns of these manager changes are statistically insignificant, that the returns are more positive for funds with large expense ratios and for funds trading at a discount. We also find the abnormal returns are negatively related to the percentage of inside director stock ownership. Corporate bond funds and international equity funds react more negatively to these announcements than other types of funds. The abnormal returns do not appear to be related to board composition, but board composition does vary across fund type, and may therefore indirectly influence the results.

While boards of directors are usually recognized as having the potential to affect strategic change in organizations, there is considerable debate as to whether such potential is typically realized. We seek to reconcile the debate on whether boards are typically passive vs. active players in the strategy realm by developing a model that specifies when boards are likely to influence organizational strategy and whether such an influence is likely to impel vs. impede change. Specifically, we develop arguments as to when certain demographic and processual features of boards imply a greater inclination for strategic change, when these features imply a greater preference for the status quo, and how differences in such inclinations will influence strategic change. We then also propose that a board's inclination for strategic change interacts with a board's power to affect change, generating a multiplicative effect on strategic change. These ideas are tested using survey and archival data from a national sample of over 3000 hospitals. The supportive findings suggest that strategic change is significantly affected by board demography and board processes, and that these governance effects manifest themselves most strongly in situations where boards are more powerful. We discuss these findings in terms of their relevance for theories of demography, agency, and power. Copyrighi (c) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The corporatization reform in Chinese SOEs has been largely influenced by the Anglo-American corporate governance model, but at issues is whether or not this model suits China's current institutional and cultural contexts. Agency theory and stewardship theory are two corporate governance theories that provide conflicting assumptions about human behavior and different prescriptions about governance mechanisms. In this study we drew upon both theories and developed competing hypotheses about the relationships between board composition, leadership structure, and organizational performance in Chinese shareholding companies. We gave special attention to China's unique institutional context and its influence on board attributes. The hypotheses were tested with a sample of Chinese listed companies. Overall, the stewardship hypotheses received stronger empirical support. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

While many aspects of stock and option based compensation for corporate officers remain controversial, we suggest that the growing trend for similar practices in favor of boards of directors will prove to be even more contentious. High-ranking corporate managers do not set their own salaries nor authorize their own stock options. By contrast, boards of directors do, in fact, set their own compensation packages. Other potential conflicts of interest include setting option performance targets, stock buybacks, stock option resets and reloads, consolidations (mergers and acquisitions), and service on multiple boards. As trust is the most valuable commodity in a capitalist society, we suggest that these potential conflicts of interest and related outcomes may ultimately serve to erode any anticipated benefits of director stock compensation.

Research on inter-organisational networks reflects their acknowledged and growing importance. Strategy research, however, is only beginning to investigate the nature of networks and how network participation can affect organisational performance. Networks embody a relational viewof the organisation and their study draws attention to the mechanisms by which relationships are secured and managed. Board of directors interlocks are a principal traditional indicator of network ties, yet little has been written on the role of interlocks in different types of networks and their potential effects on performance.We develop a typology of inter-organisational networks based on the key dimensions of organisational interdependence and network durability; a 'micro-typology' of embedded networks in East Asia based on formalisation of ties and networking scope; suggest that key aspects of directors' roles differ based on the type of network in which they are engaged; and develop specific propositions for further investigation.

Accounting, auditing, and tax professionals constantly evaluate the integrity, competence, and financial performance of clients as factors in practice that influence both client acceptance decisions and the manner in which professional services are rendered. Yet, from an accounting perspective, previous research investigating the corporate board of directors as a governance mechanism has focused only on the representational role of board members. Moreover, many of these studies resulted in conflicting findings according to these attributes. Other disciplines address the particular influence of the board with respect to overall corporate performance, but arrive at little agreement on either the effect of or the most critical of board attributes. This literature review synthesizes the existing research to provide a framework in which to evaluate the effect of the board of directors in accounting settings and, in particular, when conducting future research that employs elements of corporate governance as dependent or independent variables in accounting studies.

In this article we investigated the degree to which nonprofit organizations have developed succession plans and to what degree there is room at the top for insiders to succeed incumbents. Twelve nonprofit community-based organizations (CBOs) within a major urban center in the northeastern portion of the USA served as our sample. CEOs responded to a questionnaire and were interviewed to collect personal and organizational data. Findings included that most of the organizations did not have succession plans; boards of directors, not incumbent CEOs, appointed successors, except in the case of founders; and despite the fact that insiders are provided with leadership training, they are often not promoted to the position of CEO. Implication for leadership and organization development and recommendations for future research are made. (c) 2001, MCB UP Limited

Examining the relationship between governance and corporate innovation strategies, we found, in opposition to the assumption that owners have a unified voice, differences among governance constituencies' preferences for corporate innovation strategies. The managers of public pension funds preferred internal innovation, but professional investment funds' managers preferred acquiring external innovation. The profiles of boards of directors also shaped these innovation strategies. Inside directors with equity emphasized internal innovation, and outside directors with equity emphasized external innovation. The two types of fund manager equally preferred boards composed of outsider representatives with equity. However, pension fund managers preferred inside directors with equity more strongly than did professional investment fund owners.

This article examines the compensation of top managers of nonprofits in the United States using panel data from tax returns of the organizations from 1992 to 1996. Studying managers in nonprofits is particularly interesting given the difficulty in measuring performance. The article examines many areas commonly studied in the executive pay (within for-profit firms) literature. It explores pay differences between for-profit and nonprofit firms, pay variability within and across nonprofit industries, managerial pay and performance (including organization size and fund raising) in nonprofits, the effect of government grants on managerial pay, and the relationship between boards of directors and managerial pay in nonprofits.

Although scholars have studied outside executive succession for decades, there is still no clear definition of the term "outsider". We focus on a new dimension of outsiderness, the industrial background of executives hired from outside the firm into a CEO position. This paper examines the antecedents of boards' decisions on the industry origin of outside successors as well as the short-term stock market response. We find that firms with more independent boards and with blockholders owning large amounts of stock are more likely to hire industry unrelated successors. However, the board's decision does not strictly follow the rhetoric of stockholder's interests. The stock market reacts more positively to outside CEO succession announcements when the CEO comes from an industry related firm. These findings support our theoretical arguments that the boards of directors may use a logic or rule of appropriateness in deciding the industrial origin of outside successors.

One of the primary responsibilities of a board of directors is to assess management practices and to make sure that the organization is being run in a fashion that is consistent with the interests of shareholders. This responsibility becomes especially important when the firm is performing suboptimally. The current paper integrates corporate governance theory with attribution theory to examine the processes by which board members attribute poor firm performance to either external or internal causes. A framework is presented that suggests that inside directors and outside directors differ significantly in the constraints they face and in the ultimate attributions they make. Facing primarily social constraints, such as loyalty to the CEO and fear of retaliation, inside directors are more likely to consistently attribute poor performance to industry or environmental factors, as opposed to top management. Facing primarily cognitive constraints, outside directors will use specific informational cues to attribute poor performance either to industry/environmental factors or to top management. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided. (c) 2002, MCB UP Limited

In many respects, Australian boards more closely approach normative "best practice" guidelines for corporate governance than boards in other Western countries. Do Australian firms then demonstrate a board demographic-organisational performance link that has not been found in other economies? We examine the relationships between board demographics and corporate performance in 348 of Australia's largest publicly listed companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. We find that, after controlling for firm size, board size is positively correlated with firm value. We also find a positive relationship between the proportion of inside directors and the market-based measure of firm performance. We discuss the implications of these findings and compare our findings to prevailing research in the US and the UK.

White-collar crime can cost a company from 1 percent to 6 percent of annual sales, yet little is known about the organizational conditions that can reduce this cost. Previous governance research has examined the link between block holders, boards of directors, or CEO compensation and fraud. In this study, these traditional measures of governance are found to have little impact. Instead, operational governance, including clarity of policies and procedures, formal cross-company communication, and performance-based pay for the board and for more employees, significantly reduces the likelihood of a crime commission.

Hostile takeover attempts oftentimes signal that a target firm has an over-diversified and ineffective corporate strategy. What does this signal mean when takeover attempts fail? Drawing from agency theory, we argue that target firms managed by independent directory boards are likely to ignore the takeover attempt and not refocus their firms' strategy. Conversely, target firms managed by nonindependent boards are more likely to view the failed takeover attempt as a 'wake-up call' and will refocus their firms' strategy so as to preserve the firm's survival. These arguments are tested using a sample of 76 firms that were targets of failed hostile takeover attempts. Logistic regression analyses confirm the predictions. This study suggests that in the aftermath of a failed takeover attempt board of director characteristics can help predict changes in corporate strategies.

Board configuration is discussed in the context of the perceived needs of the board as a strategic resource of the organization. This is highlighted in the context of the differing governance, performance and social requirements of organizations pertaining to private sector, state and local government ownership structures. Examined is the view that in bringing particular perspectives resulting from their professional, ethnic or gender backgrounds, directors contribute to board effectiveness. This notion is evaluated in terms of directors' coping devices and their perceptions of their ability to be heard on the board. Initiatives that boards may use to ensure the success of such appointments are highlighted. Consideration is also given to enhancing the dynamics of established but dysfunctional appointments. In concluding, the paper develops criteria for success in making board appointments where the prospective appointee is a minority in terms of professional discipline or other forms of diversity.

This paper examines two recent trends relative to boards of directors' compensation, and their potential incompatibility. There has been some progress in increasing board diversity, specifically the inclusion of women and minorities on boards. The increasing trend requiring directors to hold/purchase equity as a requirement of board membership may seriously compromise further improvements in diversifying boards. Also, an increasing number of companies compensate directors partially or fully in stock grants and options. These compensation policies may be exclusionary, especially for women and minorities, impacting the quality of boardroom discussions and decisions. This study systematically examines whether corporations requiring director equity are exclusionary toward women and minority directors. Contrary to being exclusionary, companies with director stock requirements and annual stock awards have greater representation by women and minorities on their board. Moreover, larger companies are both more likely to have such policies and have higher proportions of women and minorities on the board.

Most of studies on corporate governance are based on the Anglo-Saxon view. However in France the majority of the top managers graduate from Ena and Polytechnic. Belonging to one or the other of these two clans, with the underlying link to the civil service, can have serious repercussions on the system of corporate governance. The clan tries to increase their power in the firms. In order to do this, it needs to control firms' leaders, but also the board of directors. The control of the board allows the system to master all shareholders' objections. It is also a means to widen its influence. This study proposes an analysis of the links between the characteristics of leaders and boards as well as the consequences of this control of the clan on the performance of the firm.

This article examines the mechanisms underlying the worldwide diffusion of organizational practices. We suggest that the two main theoretical explanations in the diffusion literature, efficiency and legitimation, can be complementary. More specifically, we argue that endogenous forces seek to enhance the efficiency of existing systems, while exogenous forces seek to increase legitimation. To assess our argument, we explore the worldwide diffusion of codes of good governance. These codes are a set of 'best practice' recommendations regarding the behavior and structure of a firm's board of directors issued to compensate for deficiencies in a country's corporate governance system regarding the protection of shareholders' rights. We have collected data on codes of good governance for 49 countries. We operationalize efficiency needs in terms of the characteristics of shareholder protection, and legitimation pressures in terms of government liberalization, economic openness, and presence of foreign institutional investors. Our analysis supports the argument that both efficiency needs and legitimation pressures lead to code adoption. In addition, our empirical results show that countries with legal systems with strong shareholder protection rights tend to be more prone to develop codes, possibly for efficiency reasons. This article contributes to organization theory by illustrating that the diffusion of codes fosters both cross-national corporate governance convergence as well as some degree of country hybridization, particularly depending on the type of code issuer.

This study combines elements of the upper echelons and agency perspectives to resolve some of the ambiguity surrounding how corporate elites affect corporate strategy. We propose and test the notion that while differences in individual characteristics of corporate elites may imply different preferences for particular corporate strategies such as diversification and acquisitions, these basic preferences, when situated in different agency contexts (e.g., CEO, outsider director, non-CEO top management team member), generate very different strategic outcomes. Our detailed empirical findings, based on extensive longitudinal governance and corporate strategy data from large U.S. corporations, also highlight the pitfalls of using aggregate units of analysis (e.g., board of directors or top management team) when studying the influence of corporate elites on corporate strategy.

The role of the board of directors in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. However, research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies: the lack of an overarching theoretical perspective, reliance on proxies for the strategy role rather than a direct measure of it and the lack of quantitative data linking this role to firm financial performance. We propose a new theoretical perspective to explain the board's role in strategy, integrating organisational control and agency theories. We categorise a board's approach to strategy according to two constructs: strategic control and financial control. The extent to which either construct is favoured depends on contextual factors such as board power, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry.

Pressure on boards to improve corporate performance and management oversight has led to a series of inquiries and reports advocating governance reform. These reports largely reflect an agency perspective of governance and seek to ensure greater board independence from and control of management. While board independence is important to good governance, we contend that frameworks, models and advice centred on one element of governance ignore the complexity of how boards work. We develop a holistic board framework based upon the concept of board intellectual capital to address this concern. Our framework proposes a series of inputs (e.g. company history, company constitution, legal environment) that lead to a particular mix of board intellectual capital. We contend that the balance of the different elements of board intellectual capital will lead to a series of board behaviours. Further, the board needs to mobilise its intellectual capital to carry out a series of roles. The exact nature of these roles will depend on the company's requirements. Thus, the governance outputs of organisational performance, board effectiveness and director effectiveness will depend on the match between the board's intellectual capital and the roles required of it. We conclude by demonstrating the benefits of this framework as a diagnostic tool. We outline how boards wishing to improve their governance systems can diagnose common governance problems by evaluating their own board's capabilities in relation to the different components of the framework.

To date, corporate governance research agendas have tended to concentrate on one particular role that a board performs. For instance, agency theory concentrates on the monitoring role, resource dependence theory concentrates on the board providing access to resources and stewardship theory concentrates on the board's advice-giving or strategic role. While these approaches provide practitioners with useful guidelines regarding issues such as board independence, we contend that practitioners need to take care not to act on the recommendations from a single theory in isolation from the others. To address this concern, we provide a model of board effectiveness that uses the construct of board intellectual capital to integrate the predominant theories of corporate governance and illustrate how the board can drive corporate performance. We further contend that boards that wish to improve their performance need to review their intellectual capital. We conclude by linking the model to a practitioner-focused framework that identifies four key areas on which a board must concentrate to develop its intellectual capital.

This paper advances the resource dependence and social networks literature by investigating a board's structural social capital created as a consequence of interlocking directorates. Using approaches and measures developed by social network analysis we compare the interpersonal directorship networks of the top 250 companies in the United States and Australia. We find that the smaller, sparser Australian network is only marginally less compact and connected than the larger US network at the firm level of analysis. However, at the director level of analysis the US network is much larger and more connected than its Australian counterpart. As a result, we argue that scholars studying the resource dependence role of boards should consider using measures of interpersonal links as well as traditional measures of inter-firm links. Understanding how boards impact on corporate performance is a question central to the corporate governance research agenda. Agency theory, for example, argues that the key way a board adds value is by ensuring the interests of the managers of the firm are aligned with the interests of the owners (Eisenhardt 1989; Jensen & Meckling 1976). A quite distinct area of inquiry, however, relates to the role that the board plays in providing access to important resources such as customers (Pennings 1980), capital (Mizruchi & Stearns 1988), the business elite (Uscem 1984) and power in general (Pfeffer & Salancik 1978). We aim to broaden understanding of the resource dependence theory of corporate governance by examining the links provided to a board by interlocking directorships. We commence by reviewing existing research on the resource dependence role of the board before outlining how the emerging construct of social capital can be adapted and applied to investigate this role. In particular, we highlight how it is the personal director network that is critical to the development of social capital rather than the corporate network (i.e. network of corporations). While this study is primarily exploratory and descriptive, we contribute to the literature by employing a new methodology to measure the 'opportunity network' that interlocking directorates provide a board within a national corporate governance system (Adams 2002a; 2002b; 2002c). We show how the formal models, procedures and techniques developed in social network analysis can be applied to individual-level networks among directors. We stress that we are not considering the formation of social capital at the individual level; rather we are examining the systemic connections of individual directors in order to illustrate the opportunity network available to a board within the national corporate governance system. A comparison of the Australian and US systems highlights the divergence in network attributes between corporate networks and the networks of interlocking directors. We conclude with implications and areas for further research.

Greater use of qualitative research methods - including observing boards in real time and interviewing directors - needs to occur to advance the field. Quantitative researchers are, it would seem, measuring variables in respect of "structural independence," rather than board and individual director effectiveness, per se. Once "board effectiveness" and "director effectiveness" variables are able to be measured, together with their interaction, a greater likelihood of distilling a more definitive relationship between corporate governance and corporate financial performance may occur.

This study extends earlier research suggesting that board network ties may reflect the strategic and/or political concerns of top managers by considering how the managerial objectives that drive the formation and maintenance of board interlock ties may be subject to social influence. The particular form of social influence examined in this study derives from the social network research process itself. Specifically, we draw from research on social information processing and the framing of information to suggest how the administration of social network surveys can influence managers' perceptions about their relationship to directors and the potential benefits to be derived from director network ties, thus affecting their subsequent selection of board members in ways that change the firm's board interlock ties.We also consider how this social influence effect may diffuse beyond the actual survey respondents to create a more pervasive influence on the actions of managers at other firms in the board interlock network. We test our theoretical argument with an original quasiexperiment in which CEOs are randomly assigned to different versions of a survey questionnaire that have the potential to prime different schemata about the possible benefits to be derived from board network ties. Beyond addressing the potential for social influence in the formation and maintenance of board network ties, our study also addresses the potential for unintended reactive measurement effects in social network research, wherein network surveys influence the very ties that they are designed to measure.

This research examines one explanation for why replacing the chief executive officer does not seem to improve firm performance despite its positive effect on financial markets: some new chief executive officers (CEOs) are able to negotiate favorable agency contracts, and therefore protect their positions, at the expense of performance that would benefit shareholders. In a longitudinal study of 150 publicly-traded firms in the United States, we found that the governance systems that align the CEO's and owners' interests, the mechanisms by which compliance with the agency contract is monitored, and the firm's strategies and performance differed as a function of ownership concentration. In firms with dispersed ownership, new CEOs initiated changes favorable to them in the composition of the board of directors and in the level of and risk associated with their compensation. We also explore reasons for the differing patterns of institutionalized power resulting from the agency contract.

This paper examines board effectiveness through an examination of the work and relationships of non-executive directors. It is based on 40 in-depth interviews with company directors, commissioned for the Higgs Review. The paper observes that research on corporate governance lacks understanding of the behavioural processes and effects of boards of directors. Whilst board structure, composition and independence condition board effectiveness it is the actual conduct of the non-executive vis-a-vis the executive that determines board effectiveness. Data about behaviour and relationships on boards suggest that traditional theoretical divisions between agency and stewardship theory, and control versus collaboration models of the board do not adequately reflect the lived experience of non-executive directors and other directors on the board. Developing accountability as a central concept in the explanation of how boards operate effectively enables the paper to both challenge the dominant grip of agency theory on governance research and support the search for theoretical pluralism and greater understanding of board processes and dynamics. Practically, the work suggests that corporate governance reform will be undermined by prescription that supports distant perceptions of board effectiveness but not the actual effectiveness of boards.

We test the effects of stakeholder management on CEOs' salaries, bonuses, stock options, and total compensation. We also examine the extent to which the interaction of stakeholder management and financial performance determines compensation. Using a longitudinal database of 406 Fortune 1000 firms, our results suggest that stakeholder management is relevant to boards of directors when setting CEO compensation. Specifically, we found a significant, negative main effect of stakeholder management on CEO salaries. Further, we found that stakeholder management typically reduces the rewards CEOs may get for increasing levels of financial performance. In tandem, these results indicate that CEOs may jeopardize their personal wealth by pursuing stakeholder-related initiatives. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Macro- and microorganizational perspectives on strategy processes are typically treated as distinct lines of inquiry. This paper proposes an attention-based theory (March & Olsen, 1976; Ocasio, 1997) of strategy formulation processes to bridge both perspectives. In particular, it links evolutionary perspectives on strategy (Burgelman, 1991, 2002) and strategic choice (Child, 1972) perspectives on organizational and strategic decision making (Bower, 1970; Carter, 1971; Cyert & March, 1963; Frederickson, 1986). Our treatment of the strategy process extends theory by viewing strategy processes as assemblages of tightly and loosely coupled networks of operational and governance channels (Allison & Zelikow, 1999; Ocasio, 1997), strategy formulation as a fluid and distributed process, and environmental, organizational level and individual level forces as consequential. Like Lovas and Ghoshal (2000), we view strategy formulation as a process of guided evolution. Unlike Lovas and Ghoshal who view strategic intent as the objective function that guides evolution, we view strategy formulation processes as more fragmented and contested, with multiple foci of attention, rather than an explicit objective function, and both top-down and bottoms-up processes capable of generating changes in the strategic direction of the firm. Top-down perspectives on strategy formulation from Andrews (1971), Prahalad and Bettis (1986), Hamel and Prahalad (1989), and Lovas and Ghoshal (2000) focus on how strategy formulation is guided by policies and plans, dominant logic, or strategic intent of the top management of the firm. While attention is not an explicit focus of any of these perspectives, each can be interpreted as showing how the top management of the firm shapes the organization's agenda and focus, identifying issues and goals that guide organizational attention. In their retrospective account on dominant logics, Bettis and Prahalad (1995) make the connection with attention more explicit, positing that dominant logics provide a perceptual filter that channels managerial attention and choice-making behavior. In this paper, we will make the connection between organizational attention and the managed evolution of strategy more explicit. But rather than positing an exclusive role for top management in shaping organizational attention, we argue that attention is guided by distributed processes and the channels of decision making through which information flows and by which people engage in dialog. It is through these channels that the organizational managers communicate and make critical and discrete decisions that involve organizational resources. Channels allow actors to conjecture the future state of the environment, guide operations, establish rewards, and utilize feedback on key initiatives given a particular set of organizational and individual capabilities and priorities. Given the significance of these mechanisms, it is appropriate that the processes and their conduits become central to our investigation. It is, therefore, the form and characteristics of the firm's operational and governance channels - the vehicles for corporate decision-making processes - that are our focus. We propose that strategy formulation emerges from the pattern of organizational attention embedded in the interacting network of concrete operational and governance channels at both the corporate and business unit level. These operational and governance channels include formal decision-making channels, such as board of directors meetings, board committee meetings, Executive Committee meetings, operating committee meetings, capital and operating budgeting requests, financial performance reviews, strategic planning reviews, and employee evaluations. They also include ad-hoc channels for mergers and acquisitions, changes in organizational structure, joint venture activity, and informal interactions, not a regular part of formal processes. The objective of this paper is to explain the dynamics of corporate strategy formulation through the lens of an attention-based view and through a focus on channels. The paper explains how the firm's two types of channels - operational and governance channels - and its economic and social structures regulate the attention of its decision makers and thus impact the micro processes of strategy formulation. It further links decision making in channels to the macro processes of strategy evolution. We posit that strategy formulation is ultimately about the selective retention of strategic initiatives made in corporate decision-making channels in which actors are embedded, and that through this network, retained initiatives become enduring activities of the firm and strategy finds practical expression. We extend existing theory by exploring how decision-making channels may be tightly or loosely coupled from each other and how that results in an overall pattern of corporate strategy.

Recent corporate scandals have focused the attention of a broad set of constituencies on reforming corporate governance. Boards of directors play a leading role in corporate governance and any significant reforms must encompass their role. To date, most reform proposals have targeted the legal, rather than the ethical obligations of directors. Legal reforms without proper attention to ethical obligations will likely prove ineffectual. The ethical role of directors is critical. Directors have overall responsibility for the ethics and compliance programs of the corporation. The tone at the top that they set by example and action is central to the overall ethical environment of their firms. This role is reinforced by their legal responsibilities to provide oversight of the financial performance of the firm. Underlying this analysis is the critical assumption that ethical behavior, especially on the part of corporate leaders, leads to the best long-term interests of the corporation. We describe key components of a framework for a code of ethics for corporate boards and individual directors. The proposed code framework is based on six universal core ethical values: (1) honesty; (2) integrity; (3) loyalty; (4) responsibility; (5) fairness; and (6) citizenship. The paper concludes by suggesting critical issues that need to be dealt with in firm-based codes of ethics for directors. (c) Springer 2005.

A post-Enron consensus on corporate governance has emerged among investor groups, government regulators, and the private exchanges. The corporate board should function principally as a shareholder oversight body. To ensure independence from management, the board should have a substantial majority of independent, outside directors, who neither have business relationships with the firm nor social relationships with management. These reforms may decrease the probability for director complicity in managerial malfeasance. However, research has not demonstrated a relationship between board independence and firm performance. Corporate governance looks quite different when the firm is considered as a cooperative team to produce new wealth. From this "production" perspective, corporate governance recommendations differ substantially from recent reforms. Rather than have directors solely represent shareholder interests, boards should represent those stakeholders that add value, assume unique risk, and possess strategic information. Rather than restrict insiders to one or two, boards should include a group of employees (managers and workers,) who bring the firm's know-how to the table. The team production model for corporate governance has far-reaching implications. The recommendations derived from our model suggest that the latest reform proposals offered by the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission create a board of directors that does not adequately consider the firm's new wealth-producing capabilities. This, we argue, accounts for the missing positive link between board independence and firm performance. (c) Academy of Management Executive.

Good governance for SMEs is critical for economic development and growth in both developed and developing economies. In this paper we focus on boards and governance in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) by investigating the role and contribution of "outside" directors in this setting. By contrasting board role theories against different types of SMEs, firms are expected to recruit "outside" board members for various reasons. Illustrated by 52 empirical studies of "outside" directors in SMEs we show how agency theory, resource based view of the firm, and resource dependence theory can be applied to understand the multiple roles that "outside" directors can play in family firms, venture capital-backed firms and other SMEs. The illustration shows that the concept "outside" director is not the same in different theories and in different empirical settings. Based on this finding, we argue for the need to have a conscious and balanced use of theories for understanding the role and contribution of "outside" directors in SMEs.

Agency, strategic choice, and cognitive perspectives are used to examine the conditions under which chief executive officers (CEOs) of small private corporations involve the board of directors in strategic decisions. Logistic regression results (2,382 respondents to a cross-industry mail survey) indicate that board strategic participation is not the dominant practice in these firms but that boards are more likely to participate in strategic decisions when the firm is larger, the board has a critical mass of outside directors, the strategic issue under consideration involves an organizational transition or potential downturn, or CEO power (ownership) is low.

This study examines the impact that the publication of ratings of boards of directors by the business press has on stockholder wealth. We report findings from an event study of price reactions to the publication of Business Week's 7996 and 1997 ratings of boards of directors of U.S. corporations. As hypothesized, favorable ratings resulted in significant positive abnormal returns after controlling for market effects and confounding events, with only novel information explaining statistical variance. Contrary to expectations, unfavorable ratings also resulted in positive abnormal returns. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The Canadian Securities Administrators' National Policy 58-201 Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Policy"),1 released 15 April 2005, on which the author provided detailed advice, reads that: "[t]he board should develop clear position descriptions for the chair and the chair of each board committee" (section 3.5); the board should engage in an explicit two-step "competencies and skills" recruitment of individual directors (sections 3.12 and 3.14);2 and individual directors should be regularly assessed and that these assessments should consider "the applicable position description(s), as well as the competencies and skills each individual director is expected to bring to the board" (section 3.18). The Canadian Securities Administrators, subject to receiving the required approvals, intend for the Policy to come into force in Canadian jurisdictions on 30 June 2005. This article canvasses some of the aspects in assessing board leadership. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Crises in corporate accountability have prompted calls for boards of directors to monitor (i.e., oversee) top management teams (TMTs) more closely and become more involved in strategic decision making. Research on board processes has focused largely on the benefits of these board behaviors, with little attention paid to possible negative consequences. This study addresses that gap by examining the impact of board monitoring and involvement on affective conflict within the top management team. We find that board montoring and involvement interact with TMT power such that more powerful teams suffer less affective conflict when the board monitors their activities, but greater affective conflict when the board becomes involved in the firm's strategic decision-making process.

This study, based on a comparison of the Combined Code Guidelines for non-executive directors between listed and unlisted boards, suggests that on unlisted boards non-executive directors have a greater degree of involvement in strategic development, financial monitoring, shareholder communication and overall board contribution than on listed boards, but a lesser degree of involvement in the monitoring of management, the setting of executive remuneration, the appointment and removal of executives, and succession planning. The importance of risk analysis and induction is considered high across both sectors, although board development and independence is considered less important on unlisted boards.

Embedded within firms are unique stores of intangible human assets that likely influence the way firms compete. We argue that the human and social capital of a firm, particularly at the upper echelon and board of director (BOD) levels, contribute to the firm's awareness of the competitive environment and its motivation and ability to undertake numerous, complex, and forceful competitive actions. We also suggest that the firm's executive compensation systems moderate the effects of these intangible human assets on firm competitive behavior. By examining how human capital, intra-firm social capital, and executive compensation influence firm competitive behavior, we advance a strategic HRM perspective of firm competitive behavior and outline several implications for future research.

Purpose - The emergence of the information and communications technology (ICT) sector in Ireland over the course of the past decade has paralleled a period of exceptional national economic growth. This has raised questions regarding wealth distribution, power and governance. This paper seeks to identify some of the characteristics of the governance culture in this sector in Ireland. It deals specifically with issues such as board composition, non-executive directors and the perceived role and usefulness of accounting information in the decision-making process. Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaire feedback from chief financial officers (CFOs), focusing specifically on the board of directors of indigenous, private firms. Findings - The research indicates that firms operating in this sector adopt structures and cultures similar to those in more traditional sectors. However, there is evidence that Irish ICT firms have responded positively to calls for the roles and responsibilities of non-executive directors to be recognised and accommodated. It also confirms the continuing centrality of accounting information to the decision-making process. Originality/value - The research represents an initial survey of firms operating in this sector. As such it is concerned with identifying overall patterns and contours. It is unusual in seeking feedback from CFOs and, as such, offers some unique insights. The findings will be of interest to those operating in the ICT sector and those seeking to identify the governance features that characterise this emerging and dynamic area.

Among the many roles boards of directors perform, the monitoring role of the board has received the most attention recently, resulting in higher demands on boards and directors to be vigilant monitors. By presenting a framework to tailor the monitoring role of the board to the specific situation and needs of the company, this paper tries to overcome the negative effects of an excessive focus on control. In so far as boards are, to a certain extent, free to define their own delegation policy, this framework highlights two essential decisions of the board, namely the decision which responsibilities and authorities are delegated to management and the decision whether to delegate them to a single-headed or joint management. Some preliminary empirical findings supporting the central argument are presented, together with some suggestions for further research. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Cannella and Holcomb ((this volume). In: F. Dansereau & F. J. Yammarino (Eds), Research in multi-level issues (Vol. 4). Oxford, UK: Elsevier Science) are unconvinced that top management teams (TMTs) are the appropriate level of analysis for upper echelons research and are, accordingly, unenthusiastic about the promise of multi-level analysis for research of this type. We agree and discuss (1) the fragility of agency theory as it pertains to TMT research, (2) various issues pertaining to TMT turnover (or lack thereof), (3) paradoxes in practice and theory regarding TMT homogeneity/heterogeneity, (4) the absence of boards of directors in the upper echelons perspective, and (5) the implications of these issues on the theory/conceptualization of TMTs and of the research dedicated to them. We question whether the variables, as currently configured, relied on in this literature are sufficiently developed to adequately test an upper echelons perspective, or to sensibly warrant a multi-level analytical approach.

Existing research on the effects of boards of directors on firm performance has failed to produce consistent empirical results. In the research presented, I argue that this may be due to the fact that such research has largely ignored the interactions that take place on a board and that serve as an enabling mechanism for the board to be able to contribute to firm performance. I introduce the concept of 'board capability', which allows scholars to consider a board's composition, structure and interactions simultaneously. Also, the results of two empirical studies of boards in adolescent companies are presented. Taken together, these studies support the theoretical argument for the importance of board interactions and shed light on the performance effects of boards in adolescent companies.

The extant literature on CEO succession has paid significant attention to the organizational outcomes of CEO successions such as strategic change and firm performance. Few studies, however, have explicitly examined the personal outcomes of the newly selected CEOs. In this study, we examined how successions contexts may influence the likelihood that a new CEO is dismissed within three years after succession, namely, "new CEO dismissal." Based upon agency theory and human capital theory, we argue that new CEO dismissal may represent a correction to an inappropriate CEO selection and accordingly, succession contexts that tend to lead to an inappropriate CEO selection will increase the likelihood of new CEO dismissal. With a sample of 204 CEO successions in the time period of 1993-1998, we find that the origin of the new CEO and the characteristics of the board of directors at the succession time have significant impact on the likelihood of new CEO dismissal.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Purpose - The objective of this article is to examine and conceptualise gender-related boardroom dynamics that affect how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Design/methodology/approach - Stories were collected from eight women directors about their experiences from more than 100 corporate boards. Narrative methods were used in the data analysis. Findings - Women as well as men need to understand the power game inside and outside the boardroom. Their contribution depends on the ability and willingness to make alliances with the most influential actors, to spend time on preparations, being present on the most important decision-making arenas, and to take leadership roles. Practical implications - The study has implications for theory as well as practice. Process-oriented theories should be included in studies of boards and governance, and the study showed that boardroom dynamics are not neutral to gender. Concepts and relationships are suggested that should be included in further theory development. The study has also given several practical examples and suggestions on how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Originality/value - The study has value for developing the role of women directors. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Boards of directors have a number of roles. The board's monitoring function has been the subject of much work. Less examined is the role that the board has in setting company strategy. This paper uses agency and network perspectives in developing and testing the relationship between board characteristics and involvement in strategic decision making. Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the level of board involvement in strategic decision making is related to a number of governance variables. We demonstrate that involvement is generally lower where boards are highly interlocked. We also show that certain types of board interlocks - namely horizontal (same industry) and those involving direct links with the banking sector - are particularly associated with this negative effect. There is weaker evidence that board strategic involvement is lower where the roles of company chief executive and chair are combined. We find no evidence that factors such as board size, or the percentage of outside directors per se are related to board involvement in strategic decision making. In doing so, this paper adds to the growing literature synthesizing the structural features and processes of boards. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006.

Research on organization-environment relations has focused primarily on formal linkages between organizations such as board interlock ties as a strategy for managing resource dependence. This study examines whether top corporate executives may maintain more informal ties to executives of other firms in order to manage uncertainty arising from resource dependence. Our point of departure is prior research on boards of directors that has examined whether so-called 'broken board ties' (i.e., ties that are disrupted due to executive turnover) tend to be reconstituted, and whether resource dependence explains the likelihood of reconstitution. These studies have generally provided little evidence that corporate board ties are used to manage resource dependence. We draw from theory and research on social embeddedness and friendship to suggest that, as a strategy for managing dependence, the maintenance of friendship ties between top executives provides benefits that are comparable to the supposed benefits of board cooptation, while imposing fewer constraints on the organization. Our theory leads to the contention that, despite limited prior evidence that resource dependence determines the formation of formal board ties, corporate leaders may nevertheless reconstitute informal (i.e., friendship) ties to leaders of other firms that have the power to constrain their firms ' access to needed resources when those ties have been disrupted (e.g., due to turnover of the CEO's friend). We test our hypotheses with a unique dataset that includes survey data from U.S. corporate leaders collected at two points in time, thus permitting an assessment of whether top executives reconstitute broken social ties to leaders of other firms, and whether various sources of resource dependence predict the likelihood of reconstitution. We discuss implications for strategic perspectives on inter-organizational relations and the sociological literature on embeddedness. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The board of directors is regarded as one of the most imperative governance mechanisms in small and medium-sized family firms. Empirical studies examining both the roles these boards fulfil in a family business context, as well as evaluating the CEO's perceived importance of these roles, are scarce. Founded by a range of conceptual and multi-theoretical board role definitions, this paper contributes to the literature by empirically determining board roles. Furthermore, the importance of these board roles and differences between the board's performance and perceived importance are assessed. The results show it is indispensable to differentiate between two aggregated roles that boards in small and medium-sized family firms perform: control and service. The control role is predominantly based on agency theory, whereas the service role includes multiple theoretical perspectives. The CEOs of the family firms perceive the service role of the board as most important. However, in order to direct succession and to compensate for the owner/manager's altruistic behaviour, the board's control role should not be neglected. The acknowledgement of these two aggregated board roles and their importance may enhance future research on board roles within specific contexts. (c) 2006 Blaekwell Publishing Ltd.

Subsequent to a host of corporate corruption scandals, boards of directors are facing amplified pressure from investors, creditors and shareholders in a bid to ensure effective corporate governance of their investments. In previous research and public debate, the effectiveness of corporate governance structures has come under close scrutiny. However, boards' effectiveness in fulfilling their strategic role by guiding strategy execution mostly has been left unaddressed. Due to the high degree of secrecy and sensitivity of strategy issues, boards' effectiveness in guiding strategy execution is much more difficult to assess externally compared to structural governance issues. Against the backdrop of these difficulties and based upon insights from strategy process research, we suggest taking "strategy consistency" between a firm's resource allocation and its announced strategy as a proxy for boards' effectiveness in guiding strategy execution. In doing so, the paper contributes to extant research by going beyond structural governance issues and paying direct attention to strategic governance issues. Specifically, the paper develops a new approach and set of standard measures to assess boards' effectiveness in strategy execution. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this research paper is to explore the proposition that diversifying the board in terms of gender, ethnicity or skill base may require consideration of the specific strategic environment of the organisation. The proposition arises from the question as to whether or not greater diversity in board configuration is desirable in certain circumstances and considers the group dynamics, skill mix and capabilities that are required by boards under different conditions of change and strategic complexity. Design/methodology/ approach - The study examines the financial performance of New Zealand publicly listed companies over a five-year period and focuses on changes in board composition, strategic activity and implications for corporate performance. Findings - The study finds limited support for the idea that board configuration, strategic context and corporate decision quality may be linked. Originality/value - This paper will be of particular value to those involved in the appointment of directors within the private and public sectors. In particular, it focuses discussion on the strategic environment faced by the organisation and the relevance of a range of potential selection criteria when appointing new directors. It is also of interest to researchers evaluating the value of social capital and gender equity in contemporary organisations as, based on empirical reseach, it challenges conventional thinking. By implication, the paper also questions whether or not boards are actually able to influence key outcomes in the manner expected by legislators. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

How many directorships are too many? Globally, normative advice emphasises the importance of limiting the number of directorships any individual should hold due to the workloads they entail. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this view. Rather, there is a strong tradition of supporting multiple directorships as a mechanism for the firm to co-opt external resources. To explore the issue of director workloads and multiple directorships, we first consider the issues related to multiple directorships and outline the conclusions of extant international and Australian studies into multiple directorships. We then detail our objectives in undertaking this research and our approach to data collection. Our findings indicate that the incidence of multiple directorships in Australian listed companies is low. We also find that many of the apparent examples of multiple directorships are due to related entities, which share common directors and, due to the nature of these entities, have much lower workload requirements. Further, there does not appear to be any relationship between holding multiple directorships and firm financial performance. Finally, we discuss the implications for boards and those interested in governance, particularly the need to ensure governance recommendations and guidelines reflect empirical findings. We offer one solution to address the concerns of boards, investors, other stakeholders and the community regarding multiple directorships: board and individual director evaluations.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which firm's performance, the structure of the board of directors and ownership determine directors' remuneration in Malaysia among distressed firms. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses publicly available data from a sample of 86 distressed firms and matched 86 non-distressed firms for 2001 financial year. Findings - The findings for the full sample show that directors' remuneration is not associated with firm's profitability, as measured by ROA. A negative and significant association is observed between directors' remuneration and lagged ROA. With regard to corporate governance, board independence and the extent of non-executive directors' interests are found to have negative influence on directors' remuneration. In addition, findings also reveal directors' remuneration is positively associated with firm's growth and size. In sub-sample analyses, a strong negative relation is observed between ROA and directors' remuneration for healthy sub-sample. Research limitations/implications - Future research on this area could examine period after the adoption of the Malaysian Code by the Bursa Malaysia in 2001. Further, interviews with directors and managers about the need to link remuneration and performance could be carried out. Practical implications - There is a need for companies to link remuneration with performance, which this paper found to be lacking in practice. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is its examination of directors' remuneration among distressed firms. Findings of this paper would be useful to both regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - To examine an under-researched area, namely the dynamics of chairman-CEO interrelationship and its effect on the enterprise. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative methodology has been adopted through in-depth interviews with chairmen, CEOs and non-executive directors on the nature of chairman-CEO interactions and their effects. Findings - Four critical themes form the basis of this paper, chairman's role and contribution, nature of chairman-CEO relationship, impact of the chairman-CEO relationship on board effectiveness and the attributes of an effective chairman. Practical implications - Enhances understanding of the determining influence of the chairman-CEO dyad on board and organisational performance and also on the influence of formative context on this dyadic interaction. Originality/value - One of the few studies that has explored through in-depth interviews the chairman-CEO relationship. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates the effects of investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board of directors on their judgments. I hypothesize that investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board will be negatively related to their judgments of investment risk and positively related to the amount they are willing to invest. I also hypothesize that the association between effectiveness of the board and investment judgments will be moderated by investor type such that professional investors will be less conservative than non-professional investors. Forty non-professional investors and 33 professional investors participated in the experiment. Generally, the results of the study are consistent with the hypothesized effects. The results suggest that even in the context of sound financial performance, investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board are a key determinant of their investment judgments. This association is moderated by investor type and suggests professional investors are less conservative than non-professional investors. Such evidence is consistent with agency theory, "use of the house money" hypothesis and recent anecdotal scandals involving professional investors. Overall, the results provide evidence that investors are more confident in firms with effective corporate boards and support regulatory reforms strengthening corporate boards. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Based on Brickley's (2003) call for research on the CEO/turnover relation, we examine determinants of CEO age at succession. Utilizing the similarity-attraction paradigm, we propose that board members will select new CEOs that are similar to their own age. We find a strong positive relation between successor CEO age and average board member age. Thus, the similarity-attraction paradigm seems to play a role in board of director selection of CEO successors. However, we also propose that poor prior performance may mitigate similarity-attraction. Our results are also consistent with this hypothesis because we find no relation between successor CEO and board age following poor prior performance. Finally, the hiring of an age-similar CEO does not reduce the companies' subsequent financial performance and may even have a slightly positive impact on it. (c) Springer 2006.

Purpose - This paper seeks to provide a comprehensive review of the literature on the governance of international joint ventures (IJVs). Design/methodology/approach - Through focusing on IJV boards and top teams, examination of the current debate regarding IJV directors' contribution to board performance and effectiveness is undertaken and, in so doing, directions for future research are identified. Findings - The literature review reveals that little consideration has been given by researchers to the work of the IJV board and the role and contribution of IJV board directors to board effectiveness. Further, it is concluded that current understanding of IJV board functioning and the ways in which directors of IJV boards contribute to board effectiveness remains incomplete. Originality/value - Apart from highlighting the need for further study into the role and contribution of IJV board directors to board effectiveness, the paper suggests ways in which IJV director contribution and performance could be explored further, and offers current practical implications.

This study examines the association between the gender and ethnic composition of boards of directors and firm performance in a transitional nation. In contrast to prior research that largely focuses on firm performance within a financial context, this study concentrates on intellectual capital performance. Using data collected from 84 South African, empirical results indicate a positive association between the percentage of female and non-white directors on the board and a firm's intellectual capital performance. Additional analysis shows the designation of female directors as an insider has a negative effect of intellectual capital performance. Designation of female and non-white directors as outsiders, meanwhile, has a positive influence on a firm's intellectual capital performance. Finally, there was no association between the percentage of non-white inside directors on the board and intellectual capital performance.

Despite a large body of research in the management, accounting, economics, and finance literatures, the relationship between board composition and firm performance is still controversial and ripe for debate (for a recent study, see Boone et al., 2004). Utilizing the theoretical approach of Zahra and Pearce (1989) that identifies the three key roles of the board as oversight, strategy, and service, we examine the effects of having board interlocks between an industrial firm and of financial services firm, and firm characteristics. Using publicly available data on all listed Italian firms for the year 2001, we find that for industrial firms, there is a positive relationship between the number of board interlocks with a bank and current year return on assets, however, the opposite is true for financial services firms. Finally, we find no relationship between interlocking directorates with banks and firm capital structure.

Women are increasing in number among corporations' boards of directors, yet their representation is far from uniform across firms. In this study, we adopted a resource dependence theory lens to identify organizational predictors of women on boards. We tested our hypotheses using panel data from the 1,000 U.S. firms that were largest in terms of sales between 1990 and 2003. We found that organizational size, industry type, firm diversification strategy, and network effects (linkages to other boards with women directors) significantly impact the likelihood of female representation on boards of directors.

We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper investigates how governance mechanisms affect the ability of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to introduce strategic change. Previous research typically assumes that governance mechanisms operate independently of each other. Building on agency theory and insights from the literature on small firm governance, we hypothesize that governance variables related to ownership, the board of directors and the top management team all affect strategic change and that it is important to examine the interaction effects of these governance mechanisms. Using a longitudinal sample of over 800 SMEs, our general logic and hypotheses are supported by the analyses. We find that closely held firms exhibit less strategic change than do SMEs relying on more widespread ownership structures. However, to some extent, closely held firms can overcome these weaknesses and achieve strategic change by utilizing outside directors on the board and/or extending the size of the top management teams. Implications for theory and management practice in SMEs are discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This study examines the presence and roles of female directors of U.S. Fortune 500 firms, focusing on committee assignments and director background. Prior work from almost two decades ago concludes that there is a systematic bias against females in assignment to top board committees. Examining a recent data set with a logistic regression model that controls for director and firm characteristics, director resource-dependence roles and interaction between director gender and director characteristics, we find that female directors are less likely than male directors to sit on executive committees and more likely than male directors to sit on public affairs committees. There is little if any evidence of systematic gender bias in director assignment to other board committees. We find some evidence that boards evaluate resource dependence differently for women than men. (c) Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

Prior studies of the relationship between the composition of boards of directors and firm performance offer equivocal results. Drawing on agency and power circulation theories, we attempt to reduce this equivocality by asserting that CEO power moderates the relationship. Specifically, an outside director dominated board is needed to check a powerful CEO, but monitoring by other executives provides sufficient constraints on CEOs with low power. We used event study methodology to test the effects of the interaction between board composition and CEO power on stock market reaction to 73 unexpected CEO deaths. We found support for our theorizing among two of three sources of CEO power. Thus, although regulatory trends increasingly support outside director dominated boards, our findings indicate that this may not always benefit shareholders and that CEO power should be considered when constructing boards.

In this paper we analyse boards of directors as workgroups, i.e. groups of people that perform one or more tasks within an organisational context. Building on previous studies, we developed a model that relates group's social-psychological processes to three different board tasks: service, monitoring and networking. We tested our model through a survey on 301 large manufacturing firms in Italy. Our findings support the idea that (a) process variables and, to a limited extent, demographic variables significantly influence board task performance; (b) board processes have a different impact on each specific board task; (c) board task performance varies depending upon firm and industry characteristics.

This article explores how the boards of small firms actually undertake to perform strategic tasks. Board strategic involvement has seldom been investigated in the context of small firms. We seek to make a contribution by investigating antecedents of board strategic involvement. The antecedents are "board working style" and "board quality attributes", which go beyond the board composition features of board size, CEO duality, the ratio of non-executive to executive directors and ownership. Hypotheses were tested on a sample of 497 Norwegian firms (from 5 to 30 employees). Our results show that board working style and board quality attributes rather than board composition features enhance board strategic involvement. Moreover, board quality attributes outperform board working style in fostering board strategic involvement. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This paper examines the relationship between firm complexity and board of director composition. Utilising the board typology of Baysinger and Zardkoohi (1986), we classify board members either as insiders, business experts, support specialists, or community influentials, and examine board composition in relation to firm internal and external complexity. Internal complexity refers to the sophistication of internal work processes (proxied by firm R&D expenditures, and the amount of invested capital), while external complexity relates to the external competitive structure (proxied by the number of business and geographic segments, and industrial leadership). Utilising a random sample of 150 firms drawn from six industries over the 2003-2005 time period, and after classifying 4,408 directors to one of our board categories, multivariate results confirm conjectures that complexity is related to the specific capabilities that each board member brings to the firm. We find that externally complex firms substitute community influentials for insiders. Additionally, internally complex firms have lower levels of community influentials, which are substituted by insiders and support specialists. This study adds to a small but growing literature that examines the economic determinants of board structure (Boone et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2005; Gillan et al., 2003; Linck et al., 2005), by providing a unique lens in examining board characteristics that goes beyond the traditional insider/independent classification.

To understand the evolving perspectives and behaviour of directors and institutional investors, field research was conducted in 2004-2005 by way of a survey with corporate directors in four countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States; n = 658) and institutional investors in Canada (n = 34). Reported changes in directors' views and practices are substantial and consistent across countries, the defining characteristic of which is a fundamental shift in the positioning of the board toward becoming a strategic partner to management. The role of institutional investors also shifted in ways that are complementary to this new role of directors (e.g., toward increased monitoring). While most research has focused on agency concepts of the board as monitors of management, our research suggests that the board is evolving towards a more collaborative role with management, consistent with stewardship theory. Our findings also suggest that directors are seeking a balance between collaboration and their role as monitors of management, rejecting the notion of the board as primarily a monitoring body. An evolutionary model is offered to explain these changes and implications are discussed. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In this article we examine what affects the board of directors' involvement in the advice to management, with emphasis on the influence of crises on the board advisory tasks performance. Based on a survey of 881 small Norwegian firms, we analyse responses from CEOs in order to determine whether and to what extent the board is actively involved in the governance process during crises through providing advice. The study has two major contributions to board research in general and research of into small firms in particular. The first is the go beyond the "usual suspects" of board size, CEO duality, and board independence when looking for determinants of board involvement in advice. The second contribution is a clearer understanding of board involvement during crises. Our results show that board member diversity becomes particularly important during crises, since this provides the CEO and firm access to a more diverse pool of competences and experiences. We also find that crises moderate the effects of incentive on the board's involvement in advice. This evidence sheds new light on the determinants of directors' involvement in board tasks, suggesting that directors' incentive to perform certain board tasks vary according to the contingent situation the firm is experiencing.

Decisions by boards of directors can have a critical impact on the success or failure of a firm. These decisions range from the hiring and firing of a CEO to market entry and exit to the way in which a firm reports accounting profits and losses. In seeking to understand boards of directors more fully, we have come to think that we need a more complete picture of intraboard relationships among directors, including but not limited to relationships with the CEO, because these relationships affect critical decisions for the firm. The authors propose that the study of boards of directors could benefit by using a conceptual lens that scholars have yet to apply to this setting-that of the board as a social network unto itself.

This study examines participation of African-Americans on the boards and board committees of the US Fortune 500. Prior work suggests the use of committee assignment to discern active versus figurehead involvement on boards. We use a logistic regression model that controls for director traits, firm characteristics and director resource-dependence roles to compare the odds that a black director will be assigned to key committees to those for a white director. We find that black directors are more (less) likely than whites to sit on audit and public affairs (executive) committees. Black female directors are more likely than both white females and black males to serve on finance committees. Thus there is some evidence that race plays a role in determining assignment to corporate board committees. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Moves by regulators to drive governance reform have cascaded across the globe. The U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the U.K. Combined Code are leading examples. The article discusses how boards can contribute to strategic conversations and share responsibilities for strategic management with the CEO and top teams. We discuss how tools like balanced scorecards can align the focus of directors towards future opportunities and risks. It is suggested that boards adopt a strategic scorecard as implemented by CIMA1Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.1 to engage in strategy. This holistic framework provides a common language and structure for top-level decision-making and leads to enhanced performance for stakeholders. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although the Combined Code (Financial Reporting Council, 2003, 2006) clearly identifies the roles and responsibilities of PLC board members, current academic literature offers little guidance to FTSE 250 boards - many of whom are managing different Issues compared with their FTSE 100 counterparts including high corporate growth, existing founder and/or family board members, and/or newly formed boards - on ways In which they can improve the quality of decision-making, increase individual board contribution, and enhance overall board performance and effectiveness. This paper attempts to outline the key issues faced by board members, particularly non-executive directors, serving on FTSE 250 company boards with regard to three distinct roles-strategy, succession planning and risk management - and examines the relevant influences on board members derived from corporate lifecycle, board structure, existing process and board culture which affect board performance and standards of corporate governance. Its conclusions draw on the author's previous research on non-executive contribution (Long, 2004) and her recent experience of reviewing performance and effectiveness of FTSE 100 and 250 boards of directors through Boardroom Review.

Reports citing excessive CEO compensation continue to make the news with evidence of peer relationships between the CEO and the compensation committee often the center of debate. The compensation committee of the board of directors determines CEO pay and is often comprises CEOs from other companies as well as non-CEOs such as academic, exgovernment, and professional individuals. This study examines the influence of the psychological factor of social comparison over accounting performance measures in a compensation experiment with 176 subjects. The results of this study are consistent with social comparison theory in that CEO director-subjects award greater pay and shield the compensation of the CEO when firm accounting performance is below average. Additionally, we find shielding is mitigated when subjects are informed that the decision of the amount of compensation awarded will be revealed to the public. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This article contributes to the literature on board effectiveness by being perhaps the first to systematically examine how the nature of outside directors' prior experience, and resulting expertise, will influence the performance of a focal firm's strategic initiatives. Our theoretical model is grounded in the psychological literature on expertise and its role in group decision making effectiveness. We focus on outside director expertise in acquisition decision making, and its implications for the performance of the acquisitions of a focal firm. Our conceptual framework indicates that directors will develop expertise in making particular kinds of acquisition decisions (e.g., related or unrelated acquisitions or acquisitions in specific industries or product markets) through their past experiences at other firms with decisions about those specific types of acquisitions, and we predict that this experience and expertise will have positive effects on the performance of a focal firm's acquisitions. We extend our theoretical model to consider the conditions under which relevant director experience will prove most beneficial. Our model predicts that outside director acquisition expertise will deliver the greatest benefits when the focal firm's board is independent from management. We find empirical support for all of our hypotheses. In considering how and when director experience and resulting expertise may influence the performance of corporate acquisitions, our theory and results help to highlight a potential second main focus for research on the long-standing question of what factors render boards of directors effective.

Scholars and practitioners are interested in board effectiveness, yet we know relatively little about directors' engagement in the boardroom. We integrate identity theory and social identity theory research with literature on board monitoring and resource provision to model how directors' multiple identities affect their behavior. We propose that directors' strength of identification with multiple identities affects the extent to which they engage in monitoring and resource provision. We discuss implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

This study makes a contribution to the growing literature on the board's resource provision role by examining a specific type of resource provision (i.e., industry experience supplementing) and demonstrating the criticality of the liabilities of newness to this particular role. In this study, we find that among younger entrepreneurial firms, a dearth of top management industry experience is offset by the presence of outside directors with significant managerial industry experience, providing evidence of experience supplementing by outside directors. Our study highlights that the notion of experience supplementing at the upper echelons prevails in young firms as they try to alleviate the burdens of the liability of newness. Experience supplementing underscores board-management collaboration during early years of firm development. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

By examining the level of ownership concentration across firms, we determine how principal-principal conflict, defined as the incongruence of ownership goals among shareholder groups in a corporation, impacts agency costs of Chinese boards of directors. Based on data from Chinese companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges during 1999-2003, we found that ownership concentration had a U-shaped relationship with board compensation, board size and the presence of independent directors. These results provide corroborating evidence that principal-principal conflict can lead to high agency costs. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Using a sample of 714 private family influenced businesses in Germany, we investigate the relationship of goal alignment between owners and managers and the existence of a board of directors. Agency theory and stewardship theory serve as theoretical bases for our study. We find that firms with relatively high levels of goal alignment are less likely to have a board of directors. Our results provide support for the substitution hypothesis of formal by social control mechanisms. Furthermore, the findings show that firms without a board and with relatively low levels of goal alignment have less family members in the top management team. This circumstance might in turn be a trigger for owners to install a board. (c) 2008 International Council for Small Business.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: How and to what extent does national culture influence the composition and leadership structure of the boards of directors of multinational firms? Research Findings/Insights: Societal norms about corporate structure are treated as components of national culture. Hofstede's measures of national culture were shown to predict the board composition and leadership structure of firms based in that culture. The hypotheses were tested with data on 399 multinational manufacturing firms based in 15 industrial countries. The results suggest that national culture can have strong effects on corporate governance and should be considered in any transnational study. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The predictive accuracy of the culture variables provides strong support for the argument that norms embedded in a society's culture affect organizational structure, at least at the board level. The results of the study contribute to our understanding of institutional theory in explaining observed variations in corporate board composition and leadership structure across countries. By linking board composition to the cultural environment, institutional theory provides an explicit framework for analyzing variations in board structure across national boundaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: When considering board composition and leadership structure, it is important to consider national culture norms. The findings of the study also have important implications for multinational firms setting up boards for their subsidiaries in different countries. (c) 2008 The Authors.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the current debate regarding the role of a board director. Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive review of the corporate governance (CG) literature is undertaken, with a particular focus on director contribution to board effectiveness. Findings - The literature review revealed a number of issues in the CG literature that highlight the need to clarify board director role and pay closer attention to the processes needed for directors to perform their role effectively. These issues have broadly been classified into: conceptual issues regarding board effectiveness and director contribution; a methodological issue of level of analysis (board as a group and a director as individual); failure of much of the literature to account for the external context in which the board directors operate; and prescriptive nature of the literature. Originality/value - Issues pertinent to the CG literature identified in this paper hold theoretical and practical implications.

Corporate governance regulations across the globe increasingly push for a model in which top management is supervised by an independent, vigilant and skilled board of directors. Academic research, however, produces ambiguous results as to the direct effects of such board characteristics on firm performance. We therefore analyze the relationships between board attributes, board working processes and board role performance through intermediate relationships. Several hypotheses are derived and tested by analyzing data obtained from a survey at the board level in The Netherlands. Our results partly confirm the relevance of the model of board processes related to board role performance, as suggested by [Forbes, D.P., and Milliken, F.J. (1999) Cognition and corporate governance: Understanding boards of directors as strategic decision-making groups. Academy of Management Review, 24, 489-505]. Particularly, this study exemplifies the relevance of different board processes for explaining board role performance. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is considered by many to have made the most sweeping changes affecting corporate governance since the Securities and Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. About 4 years after its passing, however, many governance experts question whether the time and expense of compliance engender any real reforms. This article examines whether corporations have restructured their boards in response to the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley and finds evidence that companies are implementing changes that should strengthen the monitoring ability of their boards.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

The separation of ownership from control in modern corporations has led to some interesting questions and much debate among researchers and practicing managers (Baysinger and Hoskisson, 1990; Berle and Means, 1932; Johnson, Daily, and Ellstrand, 1996; Zahra and Pearce, 1989). Individual shareholders, unless they are also managers or hold a large block of stock, have very little influence on the company. Managers, as agents for the shareholders, make most important decisions with regard to corporate operations. Stewardship theory suggests that managers should be given maximum liberty to make decisions so that they are not encumbered by rules and influences that can jeopardize optimal performance (Davis, Schoorman, and Donaldson, 1997) However, many researchers and practitioners wonder whether managers can be relied upon to sacrifice their own self-interests and behave in a manner that is in the best interests of the shareholders.

In this paper I first review the basic tenets of agency theory and theory of managerial capitalism as well as some of the major research in these areas then suggest for areas for future research that go beyond the extant empirical work. First, I suggest that it would be useful to reconsider the basic nature of the agency relationship, taking into account that while equity holders can be considered the principal, the board of directors may be more realistically in need of agent-like controls. Second, the complementary or supplementary nature of the monitoring/incentive alignment relationship has been shown theoretically but the empirical evidence is equivocal and needs future investigation. Third, there has been very limited research on the construct validity of archival measures of the sort used in agency theory. This requires the use of methodologies outside those of the more conventional type used in agency theory (i.e., from economics and finance). Finally, agency theory development would profit greatly by more extensive use of research methods such as laboratory studies and survey methodology and the integration of concepts such as personality and control processes.

This paper considers industry-specific contingencies that may account for some of the inter-firm heterogeneity in the deployment of specific corporate governance mechanisms in IPO firms. We examine how differences in demand, competitive, and technological uncertainty in the industry influence the levels of IPO firm monitoring by board outsiders and institutional investors. We test our theory using a sample of U.S. firms that completed an IPO in 24 manufacturing industries. The results indicate that industry uncertainty is, indeed, significantly related to the use of corporate governance mechanisms. In particular, the empirical results indicate that industry effects on IPO firm board monitoring and institutional investor ownership are the strongest and most consistent for demand uncertainty and competitive uncertainty.

Purpose - The purpose of this research is to explore the potential role and the measurement of the effectiveness of boards of directors in strategy formulation and implementation - two aspects that have so far been left largely unaddressed by corporate governance research and practice. Design/methodology/ approach - Based on insights from strategy process literature, the paper suggests that, by ensuring consistency between resource allocation processes and the firm's intended strategy, boards could fulfil a meaningful role in strategy implementation. The proposed outside-in analysis of resource allocation decisions is illustrated by a single case study of a major Swiss pharmaceutical company. Findings - The proposed approach enables corporate governance scholars to look at how boards fulfil their role in strategy implementation from a perspective similar to that of financial analysts. It might thus be suited to complement existing methods in empirical corporate governance research. Practical implications - The presented outside-in analysis of resource allocation decisions helps board members to prevent role conflicts with executive management. In addition, boards may benefit from an analysis of implementation consistency, because it enables them to detect weak early warning signals of strategic divergence that require early intervention. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the discussion of alternative methods for exploring strategy issues in corporate governance research. The suggested approach outlines a potential new vantage point to investigate board involvement in strategy implementation in the event that action research is not feasible. The tentative findings from the case study put forward a set of indicators for measuring the effectiveness of boards in guiding strategy implementation. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

There is an absence of research about what information boards of directors have access to and how they use that information. The purpose of this paper is to explore and theorize about the content and use of information to boards of directors. The paper introduces and elaborates on the concept of 'board accounts', which is defined as the information supplied to boards of directors by top-management. The paper locates the board accounts in the Swedish institutional setting and demonstrates how the concept can be operationalized in an empirical setting. On the basis of a unique material of archived board records in a Swedish company, the paper explores the board accounts over a period of 10 years (1989-1998). It is found that while use of the board accounts in the case study company changes considerably over time, the content of the board accounts remains largely unchanged. This raises questions about where and when directors receive information, the reliability of the information in the board accounts, and recent attempts to integrate corporate governance and management accounting (CIMA, Performance reporting to boards: a guide to good practice, 2003; CIMA strategic scorecard: boards engaging in strategy, 2005; Seal, Management Accounting Research 17(4):389-408, 2006). Finally, the paper discusses the merits of historical archive-based approaches in this field and possibilities for future research. (c) 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

We also investigated the moderating influence of the board of directors in terms of its service role as stewards of the enterprise.

Research about boards and governance has been characterized by the dominance of few concepts and a limited number of methods. This article introduces methods and concepts that help us explore board processes. Six illustrative studies of board processes are presented, including the use of 'one of the lads' - methods, 'flies on the wall' - methods, interpretation of 'board life stories' of women directors, reconstructive case studies and the use of questionnaire surveys directed to multiple respondents in each case. The article shows directions for how to open the 'black box' of board processes.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: Prior research on corporate elites has focused on how interlocking directorships serve to create inter-organizational linkages and on what happens when board members lose their seats and those linkages are broken. Rather than focusing on the ties in corporate networks, here we focus on the nodes of these networks, the individual members of boards of directors. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the conditions under which a director will be able to retain his/her board seat even after he or she loses the executive position that provided initial entry onto the board. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The case of outside directors who have lost their executive positions in their home organizations provides an excellent opportunity to examine two competing theoretical perspectives: the inter-corporate and intra-class perspectives on corporate elites. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002), directorships are demanding an increasing amount of directors' time and directors without full-time executive positions elsewhere can actually devote more energy to board activities. An unintended consequence of this legislation is a potential decrease in the number of directors who hold several board seats simultaneously. This may reduce the efficiency of information flow across organizations and slow the diffusion of innovation. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The empirical support for agency theory explanations for the great variance in CEO pay has been equivocal. Drawing from the performance appraisal literature, we hypothesize that boards of directors incorporate human judgment into the evaluation and reward of CEO performance in order to balance managerial risk with agency costs. We test Baysinger and Hoskisson's (1990) proposition that insider-dominated corporate boards rely on subjective performance evaluation to reward the CEO, and we argue that R&D intensity influences this relationship. Using a sample of Fortune firms, findings support our contention that human judgment is important in evaluating and rewarding CEO performance. (c) 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

The 'value creating board' surveys have been conducted in several European countries, and initiatives have also been under taken to conduct similar studies on other continents. The objectives of this article are to present methodological issues in relation to survey research about boards of directors and to document some of the methodological reflections from the 'value creating board' surveys. Some studies using 'value creating board' survey data are also presented. A main concern in survey research about boards of directors is the common method bias. Questionnaire surveys are the common method in the 'value creating board' surveys, but the development of the instrument and the interpretation of the findings are based on results and experiences from board research using other methods. Furthermore, another methodological strength of the surveys is that they have been conducted in different countries, with different samples, at different points of time, with various respondents and by different researchers. The various studies are not only individual articles, but also pieces in a big puzzle. Details about samples and responses in the Norwegian 'value creating board' surveys are presented here as an input to this discussion. The article thus serves as a point of reference for contributions drawing from these and similar surveys. Ten studies are presented to illustrate the concepts, methods, samples and contribution from the 'value creating board' surveys.

In this study, we examine firm and board characteristics that predict whether a new CEO will come from the firm's current management, from the board of directors, or from outside the firm. This study is the first to recognize the potential for outside board members to compete for the CEO position. Though classified as firm outsiders, outside directors have many of the advantages of insider candidates for CEO: firm-specific knowledge and familiarity with the board of directors. This form of succession is likely to be valuable in high-technology industries, as competition is faster paced and information asymmetry is greater than in lower technology industries. In this study, we focus on a single high-tech industry (semiconductors) in the period between 1993 and 2000. We find that the presence of an heir-apparent increases the likelihood of insider succession while outsider board members' availability increases the likelihood that an outside director will become the new CEO. We also find that firms with high levels of R&D spending and rapid sales growth favor insiders as new CEOs. We discuss the implications of these findings for the CEO's relationship with the board.

There has been concern expressed in the financial press and focus established in the accounting literature over rising levels of executive compensation. Individuals on the compensation committee, a sub-committee of the board of directors, collectively determine executive compensation and are responsible for maintaining the pay-for-performance standard, a concept that warrants further attention. This study examines the process of exaggeration of a group decision over individual beliefs and the impact of leadership upon a committee's outcome when making compensation awards. In an experiment with 98 subjects role-playing as compensation committee members, results show that in a committee of individuals where a coterie and a majority belief is present, group polarization occurs and the compensation results are exaggerated as compared to individual beliefs. The findings also suggest, though, that the appointment of a leader as chair of the committee, either in the majority or minority view, has a moderating effect on the group outcome. These results highlight and add to the literature the potential for agency costs in the group decision process that may be found in the executive compensation-setting environment.

A prerequisite for building a field of research is to accumulate knowledge. I will here present some of the building blocks that are important for understanding behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Theoretical perspectives, a stream of research and some seminal articles are presented. When put together and not only presented as fragmented pieces, they constitute a framework that introduces a new field of research about behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Five articles in particular are mentioned as seminal building blocks in this framework.

In this article, we present an overview of empirical research on boards and governance in leading U.S. and international academic journals in general management. Samples, methods, theories, and main concepts are presented and compared. The contributions are positioned with respect to contingency perspectives, behavioral perspectives, and evolutionary perspectives. Through an analysis of 127 empirical articles, we find that most studies on boards and governance have been influenced by a research tradition that treats the board of directors as an isolated 'black box.' Only few studies explore boards in context or explore behavioral perspectives of boards. Almost no studies include evolutionary perspectives. Based on our analysis, we explore alternative research streams and outline various directions for future research.

The ways in which boards of directors can create value for SMEs has received a considerable amount of attention in the governance literature. Inconclusive results from input-output studies have asked for another approach, focusing on the influence of contingencies, board processes and actual board task performance. In this article, we examine the effect of the board's actual task performance on the value that boards create in Dutch SMEs. Because of the two-tier governance system, we distinguish between the value creation of the supervisory board and the executive board. A factor analysis on a wide range of board tasks results in six distinguishable sets of board tasks: 1) operational control, 2) behavioural control, 3) output control, 4) strategy, 5) advice and counsel, and 6) networking. Results show that - from a CEO's perspective - the supervisory boards mainly create value through their performance on the advice and counsel tasks. Executive boards are found to create value through their performance on the advice, counsel and strategy tasks.

This paper examines board responsibilities and accountability by management and Board of Directors in relation to the National Australia Bank's (NABs) performance. The NAB, an international financial service provider within the top thirty most profitable banks in the world, is compared with the Australian major banks. The evidence suggests that NABs poor performance was consistent with a lack of accountability, poor corporate governance and board dysfunction associated with fraudulent currency trading and the subsequent AUD360 million foreign currency losses. The NAB's performance is investigated by utilising accounting-based measures of profitability and cost efficiency as proxies for performance. Following the foreign currency trading losses in 2004 the NAB under-performed the other major Australian banks in terms of profits, cost to income ratio and growth in assets. In terms of profitability and cost efficiency NAB had the lowest ROE and ROA with a 19.7% fall in net profit and the highest cost to income ratio of 57.4% of any of the five largest banks. This case study provides an Australian example of poor corporate governance and suggests that financial institutions and regulators can learn from the NAB's experience. Failure to have top-down accountability can have significant impact on over-all performance, profitability and reputation. In particular, it suggests that management and Boards need to review their risk management procedures and regulators need to be more pro-active in their prudential oversight of financial institutions.

In focus of this paper are selected characteristics of enterprise boards and their influences on performance in companies located in Gnosjo, one of Sweden's best known industrial districts. The aim and contribution of this paper are to propose and test a model that reflects how the relationship between board characteristics, administration and company age can have an effect on company performance. Our results show that number of commitments among board members as well as company age are significant for company performance measured with sales and sales per employee. The support of the model proposed is strong and we believe the results have practical as well as theoretical implications. (c) Ossi Pesamaa, Johan Klaesson, Antti Haahti, 2008.

This paper provides some strong support for existing literature in an under-researched context (the emerging economies of the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe). We develop and apply a model linking Board formation and environmental uncertainty, finding some partial support for our anticipated relationships in the area of Board establishment and perceived financial sector uncertainly, although no support for our anticipated relationship between governmental sector uncertainty and Board formation. research is supportive of the broad assertion that strategy in emerging economies is different and a 'one size fits all' (generally American) approach to the questions we ask regarding strategy in emerging regions will rarely provide accurate insights for management academics and practitioners with an interest in understanding and improving management decisions in the context of emerging economies.

This study analyses the influence of various characteristics of the Board of Directors on the control and risk of the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). It also examines the effect on these variables of some of the CEO personal characteristics and of various contingencies of the firm. The results reveal that control of the CEO compensation is determined fundamentally by the CEO participation in the capital of the firm, while the level of risk of the CEO compensation package is higher when the firm is diversified and implements a proactive competitive strategy.

The study sought to explore the role that director behavioral-type might play in leading to board effectiveness. The study involved direct observation of twenty-one boards of directors or committee meetings, together with interviews of 194 respondents. The study suggests that board process may be an equal if not more important factor than board structure in determining board effectiveness. The study's data suggests that board processes, in turn, may be influenced by the behavioral-types of individual board members. Based on the three dimensions of dissent/consensus; individual/collective; and persuasiveness/non-persuasiveness, five director behavioral types leading to a functional board emerged from the study including: (i) change agents; (ii) consensus-builders; (iii) counsellors; (iv) challengers; and (v) conductors. Five director behavioral types leading to a dysfunctional board also emerged including: (vi) controllers; (vii) conformists; (viii) cheerleaders; (ix) critics; and (x) caretakers. The study concludes with its limitations.

Thirty years have passed since Pfeffer and Salancik's seminal work on resource dependence theory (RDT). During this time RDT has been applied broadly across the research domain to explain how organizations reduce environmental interdependence and uncertainty. In this review, the authors assess the conceptual development, empirical research, and application of RDT. They structure their review around the five options that Pfeffer and Salancik propose firms can enact to minimize environmental dependences: (a) mergers/vertical integration, (b) joint ventures and other interorganizational relationships, (c) boards of directors, (d) political action, and (e) executive succession.The authors summarize past work, synthesize contemporary thought, and propose future research directions.

This book integrates and assesses the vast and rapidly growing literature on strategic leadership, which is the study of top executives and their effects on organizations. The basic premise is that, in order to understand why organizations do the things they do, or perform the way they do, we need to comprehend deeply the people at the top-their experiences, abilities, values, social connections, aspirations, and other human features. The actions-or inactions-of a relatively small number of key people at the apex of an organization can dramatically affect organizational outcomes. The scope of strategic leadership includes individual executives, especially chief executive officers (CEOs), groups of executives (top management teams, or TMTs), and governing bodies (particularly boards of directors). Accordingly, the book addresses an array of topics regarding CEOs (e.g., values, personality, motives, demography, succession, and compensation); TMTs (including composition, processes, and dynamics); and boards of directors (why boards look and behave the way they do, and the consequences of board profiles and behaviors). The book synthesizes what is known about strategic leadership and indicates new research directions. (c) 2009 by Oxford University Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

In this article, the authors develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of outside directors' human and social capital on firm growth. They posit that outside directors' board memberships and managerial experiences have additive and interactive effects. Using a longitudinal sample of high technology firms, they test their theory and find that outside directors' membership on multiple boards, industry-specific managerial experience, and firm-specific founding experience have strong additive effects on firm growth. They also find negative interaction effects, indicating the costs of acquiring and combining certain types of outside director human and social capital within the board.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: Over the last four decades, research on the relationship between boards of directors and strategy has proliferated. Yet to date there is little theoretical and empirical agreement regarding the question of how boards of directors contribute to strategy. This review assesses the extant literature by highlighting emerging trends and identifying several avenues for future research. Research Findings/Results: Using a content-analysis of 150 articles published in 23 management journals up to 2007, we describe and analyze how research on boards of directors and strategy has evolved over time. We illustrate how topics, theories, settings, and sources of data interact and influence insights about board-strategy relationships during three specific periods. Theoretical Implications: Our study illustrates that research on boards of directors and strategy evolved from normative and structural approaches to behavioral and cognitive approaches. Our results encourage future studies to examine the impact of institutional and context-specific factors on the (expected) contribution of boards to strategy, and to apply alternative methods to fully capture the impact of board processes and dynamics on strategy making. Practical Implications: The increasing interest in boards of directors' contribution to strategy echoes a movement towards more strategic involvement of boards of directors. However, best governance practices and the emphasis on board independence and control may hinder the board contribution to the strategic decision making. Our study invites investors and policy-makers to consider the requirements for an effective strategic task when they nominate board members and develop new regulations.

ABSTRACT Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: A coherent alternative to an economic approach of corporate governance is missing. In this paper we take steps towards developing a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance. Research Findings/Results: Building upon concepts such as political bargaining, routinization of decision making, satisficing, and problemistic search, a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will focus more on (1) interactions and processes inside and outside the boardroom; (2) the fact that decision making is made by coalitions of actors and objectives are results of political bargaining; and (3) the notion that not only conflicting, but also cooperating, interests are parts of the boards' decision making and control over firm resources. Theoretical Implications: The consequences are a new research agenda for boards and corporate governance. The agenda will focus on actual instead of stylized descriptions of board behavior. In a behavioral perspective the emphasis on problems of coordination, exploration, and knowledge creation may dominate over problems of conflict of interest, exploitation, and the distribution of value. A future research agenda based on a behavioral framework calls for novel and adventurous research designs. Practical Implications: A behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will be closer to actual board behavior than the traditional economic approach and research about boards and corporate governance may thus become more actionable for practitioners.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

We present results from a study about women and employee-elected board members, and fill some of the gaps in the literature about their contribution to board effectiveness. The empirical data are from a unique data set of Norwegian firms. Board effectiveness is evaluated in relation to board control tasks, including board corporate social responsibility (CSR) involvement. We found that the contributions of women and employee- elected board members varied depending on the board tasks studied. In the article we also explored the effects of the esteem of the women and employee-elected board members, and we used creative discussions in the boardroom as a mediating variable. Previous board research, including research about women and employeeelected directors, questions if the board members contribute to board effectiveness. The main message from this study is that it may be more important to ask how, rather than if, women and employee-elected board members contribute, and we need to open the black box of actual board behavior to explore how they may contribute.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: This paper extends the theory of bundles of corporate governance mechanisms to address agency issues within the Anglo-Saxon system of corporate governance. The focus of our study is to detail the role of firm performance as a key determinant of how the governance mechanisms of monitoring and incentive alignment serve as complements or substitutes in addressing agency issues. Previous research has looked at these mechanisms in isolation from each other, with limited regard for the contingencies of firm performance and external monitoring. We propose that it is best to look at these mechanisms as a bundle of mechanisms to protect shareholder interests, and that firm performance is a key determinant of the composition of this bundle. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce firm performance as a critical contingency that heightens shareholders' concerns over governance issues as they seek to retain control over adverse selection and moral hazard problems. We propose that when firms are performing poorly, outside monitoring by institutional investors can complement internal monitoring by boards of directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We examine governance bundles under both agency and stewardship theoretical lenses to tie together previous empirical research and advance theory. In specifying the role of firm performance in determining the mix of mechanisms within the governance bundle, we reconcile prior disparate findings as to whether or not these governance mechanisms act in a complementary or substitutable fashion. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The conceptualization of these governance mechanisms has practitioner merit in analyzing the challenges that board members face managing agency conflicts through the mix of governance mechanisms, given different levels of firm performance. Our research also shows that, under conditions of poor performance, shareholders can provide effective external monitoring that can improve the overall governance effectiveness of the firm.

This study contributes to the debate on the benefits and costs of multiple directorships by investigating the impact of multiple directorships on board meeting attendance. Individuals with multiple board seats (or "busy" directors) exhibit a higher tendency to be absent from board meetings. The results are robust even after controlling for firm-specific characteristics, board of directors structure and endogeneity. Furthermore, our results do not support the hypothesis that directors with higher ownership stakes are more motivated to attend board meetings. Monetary inducements such as board meeting fees and annual director retainers do not appear to enhance attendance. Finally, the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) appears to have a material impact on board attendance. (c) 2008 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

It is often assumed that directors with human capital such as prior management experience or independence from the company are the most influential board members. By contrast, in a survey of all the board members in 14 companies we found that ties to others in a network of strong ties among those who meet outside of board meetings were more important predictors of social influence than human capital or ties across boards. These ties within the board represent the social capital of members in the form of prior relationships with other directors, ties to others on the board, and membership in cliques within the board's network of ties. These results support a social capital perspective on influence that emphasizes relationships with others on the board as important factors in the social dynamics of board decision-making.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between board diversity, as represented by the percentage of female, minority or female and minority directors on the boards of directors, and firm financial performance, and to explore the potential determinants of board diversity, using data from the Australian corporate sector. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the top 500 Australian companies as the initial data-set. Firm performance measures include return on assets, return on equity and shareholder return. Several control variables are introduced in the regression analysis. Findings - The results indicate that gender and racial diversity do not have significant influence on performance. It is reported that larger firms tend to have relatively more female members, and smaller firms or firms with larger boards may have more minority directors. Research limitations/implications - The findings should not be extrapolated to all firms as the sample is restricted to listed companies. To examine the complete impact of board diversity future research could consider non-financial performance indicators. Practical implications - The analysis shows that greater diversity does not lead to poor performance, which suggests that gender and racial diversity could be achieved without a negative effect on shareholder wealth. Originality/value - In addition to giving improved evidence on the effect of gender diversity on performance, the paper may be the first study which ascertains whether there is a "business case" for greater minority participation in boardrooms in the Australian context.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the association between the composition of the board of directors and corporate diversification, to explore the role of the board in corporate strategic choice. Research Findings/Results: Based on a sample of 101 Australian publicly listed firms in 2005, this study finds that there is no link between corporate decisions on product and/or geographic diversification and two aspects of board composition - board independence and institutional representation. However, there is a positive link between total diversification and a third aspect of board composition - the proportion of directors who have ties to boards of corporations in other industries. Theoretical Implications: The results provide support for the managerial hegemony and the resource dependency theories. Corporate strategic decisions regarding diversification are more likely to be made by management than boards of directors, and to be encouraged by interlocking directors with extra-industry ties. Practical Implications: Contrary to the requirement or recommendation in many jurisdictions that boards be more independent, these results indicate that shareholders' interests, represented by lower levels of diversification, are not promoted under such circumstances. Interlocking directors appear to effectively link the corporation to the external business environment and to encourage diversification. Existing recommendations and regulations to align management with shareholders' interests through independent boards should be revised. Board composition should also consider directors' knowledge, relevant expertise, availability, and length of tenure. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study analyses the form of the board-TMT interaction and the firm's level of strategic change. Relatedly, we explore the premise that there needs to be a good fit between the board of directors and the top management team to effectively bring about strategic change. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a sample of 119 firms in the period 1993-2000, we found that when a synergy exists between the board and the TMT, there will be a greater inclination for strategic change. The results indicate that a board's inclination to contribute to strategic change increases as the board size increases. Equally, it is possible to accept that the relationship between board tenure and their inclination towards strategic change is not linear. Finally, the simultaneous analysis of board composition and the ratio of directors on the TMT, demonstrates that the interaction of both variables has effects on the firm's strategic change. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support in favor of an active role of the board shaping the firm's strategic decisions. We have developed and tested a set of arguments regarding with the role of the board on the firm's change in strategy. We have investigated as well, the leveraging effect of one of the variables that define the composition of the management team on the relationship board-change in strategy. Practitioner/Policy Implications: In order to create an effective board, a broader governance structure must be examined with a detailed study of aspects of the composition of the board and the TMT (previous research has only considered characteristics linked to the CEO). The dynamics of the relationships between both governance mechanisms are essential and leverage the board capability. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study investigates how the implementation of special attributes of CEO compensation contracts is determined by both the acquisition and the acquirer features for a set of M&A deals undertaken by Canadian acquiring firms. Our findings reveal that when agency problems are higher, manifested by larger control premiums and poor firm performance, boards of directors tend to implement stronger mechanisms of incentive alignment around M&A transactions. Relying on multiple interdisciplinary logics that are activated to explain directors' ability to effectively perform their monitoring function, we show that boards are reactive rather than proactive in dealing with agency problems. Data are further interpreted in light of the unique aspects of the Canadian institutional context. Based on asymmetric risk properties of two different groups of executive compensation modes examined in this study, testing the substitution effects between alternative governance mechanisms is proposed as an interesting avenue for future research.

We propose a research agenda that can assist in developing a dynamic and comprehensive theory of boards of directors. It is based upon the concept of temporality, with time being organised around the life-cycle metaphor, and integrates research on agency theory, decision-making theory and resource dependence theory. We identify three key roles of boards of directors: 1) Monitoring and controlling top management 2) Involvement in strategic decision-making; and 3) Providing access to resources and networks. Our analysis suggests that boards perform all three roles, but that these roles change over time. We propose clear researchable questions for each stage of the organisational life cycle as well as the transition between the stages.

Debates about the ethics of executive compensation are dominated by familiar themes. Many writers consider whether the amount of pay CEOs receive is too large-relative to firm performance, foreign CEO pay, or employee pay. Many others consider whether the process by which CEOs are paid is compromised by weak or self-serving boards of directors. This paper examines the issue from a new perspective. I focus on the duties executives themselves have with respect to their own compensation. I argue that CEOs' fiduciary duties place a moral limit on how much compensation they can accept, and hence seek in negotiation, from their firms. Accepting excessive compensation leaves the beneficiaries of their duties (e.g., shareholders) worse off, and thus is inconsistent with observing those duties. (c) 2009 Business Ethics Quarterly.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between board composition and firm performance variance in the context of recent corporate governance reforms, based on the agency and organisational literatures. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses 384 of the top 500 Australian companies as its dataset. Board composition measures include the percentages of affiliated, executive and independent members on the board. Firm risk is represented by the standard deviation of shareholder return. Several control variables are introduced in the regression analysis. Findings - The results show a negative impact of executive directors on subsequent risk. Affiliated and independent directors, however, have no significant effect on the level of performance variance. Blockholders give a positive influence on firm risk. Moreover, companies with poor dividend payout or low managerial shareholdings tend to be riskier. Research limitations/implications - This paper does not examine the actual risk preference of individual directors, which could involve an attitudinal survey of board members. Future research may also examine the specific attributes towards risk for each type of affiliated directors. Practical implications - The findings cast doubts on the hope that promoting board independence would reduce agency conflicts relating to managerial risk aversion, and support the proposition that, although firms may comply with the demands for more independent directors, they could employ a number of tactics to neutralize the power of outsiders. Originality/value - The empirical work surrounding this topic has been scant. This study may present the first Australian empirical evidence on the relationship between board composition and firm performance variance. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether anti-director laws and legal director liability rules affect the diligence of directors in setting the compensation of CEOs. The study uses a world-wide data set covering 27 countries for the period 1995 to 2005. Research Findings/Results: Controlling for a number of legal and economic determinants, we find that independent of managerial risk-aversion, CEO pay is always less generous under stricter anti-director rules and a stronger rule of law. Director liability rules are associated with more generous pay schemes. The results persist once we control for the presence of institutional investors and cross-listing in the US. Theoretical Implications: Our results suggest that there exists an agency conflict between shareholders and outside directors reflected in the degree to which directors act diligently when negotiating the pay contract with the CEO. However, this conflict may be alleviated by specific legal rules making boards more accountable to shareholders. Private measures of shareholder protection do not seem entirely capable of substituting for legal institutions. Practical Implications: Reducing managerial agency cost is commonly viewed as a desirable policy goal. We advocate the view that specific legal institutions that strengthen procedural rights of shareholders' voting on directors and the overall quality of the legal system help to achieve this goal. Director liability rules, however, appear to be ineffective for this purpose. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - This paper aims to review how corporate governance is institutionalised in Nigeria and examine the relationship between board size, CEOs' duality, board composition and the board's involvement in strategy. Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire was sent by post to the chairmen of 138 publicly quoted companies in Nigeria in November 2004. Findings - Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the Nigerian public companies have embraced some principles of the Code of Best Practices for Public Companies. There is a high level of board involvement in strategy decision-making process, but no correlation was found between board involvement and a number of governance variables (board size, board independence and CEO duality). Research limitations/implications - The sample of 39 responding companies is small although it represents a 28 per cent of response rate and is representative of the Nigerian stock market. However, we are unable to look at other factors such as industry sectors and we cannot generalise our findings regarding corporate governance practices in Nigeria. Practical implications - The investment climate in Nigeria can become more reassuring than in the past although there is room for further improvements as the effectiveness of the corporate government practices is still in doubt. Originality/value - This paper adds to the scanty literature available on corporate governance practices in developing, countries. Findings extend our understanding about the strategic functions of the board in Nigeria, which is Africa's most populous nation, and the world's sixth larger producer of oil.

The division between ownership and management and the existence of minority shareholders have led to the need for control systems which allow for the convergence of shareholders and managers' objectives. The disclosure of information for shareholders and corporate governance stand out among these control systems. This work analyses the nature of this relationship for non-financial Spanish quoted corporations. Unlike the current efforts devoted to improving both systems, our findings reveal a substitutive relationship, by showing the disclosure of less information in those companies whose Boards of Directors are more effective.

This research study focuses on the problems involved in nominating board members based solely on rules and regulations, which neglect the affective dynamics of board behaviour and board process. For example, choosing board candidates who are independent (not part of a company's management), a rule imposed by the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) guidelines, may ensure that an organisation remains listed on this lucrative exchange. However, it does not ensure that the candidates have the necessary knowledge or are well versed in the company's business activities to effectively serve on a particular board. Having independent board members does not ensure that they ask tough questions of themselves or of management or that they have an extensive network from which to draw for advice on strategic issues. These are equally important areas of board governance that cannot be ignored when choosing candidates for the board, and these questions should not be suppressed in favour of concentrating solely on formal concerns such as independence. Information about board characteristics can provide management theorists with a broader range of informal variables that can contribute to the decision-making process. Board characteristics assist the board in operating as a team, improving the efficiency of the board. Selecting board members with the most suitable and effective characteristics for a particular board ensures that directors are spending their limited time on the company's most important challenges. This research was carried out in several stages in order to gather both qualitative and quantitative data. In this research there was a significant relationship for values and decision-making and no relationship for TSXFormal and decision-making, which is consistent with the literature, suggesting there must be a change in executives values to ensure changes in behaviour. A corporate governance model was developed. This model helps in ensuring that boards populated with board members who have knowledge and values (skills matrices) are more aware of the detrimental effect that groupthink can have on the decision-making process. Several executives mentioned the ability of board members to apply due diligence to strategic decision-making. This means that directors apply their experience and expertise to better understand issues and bring these to bear upon the decision-making process. Additionally, knowledge, values and groupthink (skill matrices) may be used both when nominating new board members and as an annual evaluative tool. Businesses are continually diversifying and board members need to continuously embellish their skill set and knowledge in order to adapt. However, the finding and the development of this corporate governance model are significant as they mark the start of how board characteristics can be operationalised. What is needed is more balanced research that looks at both the formal and the informal system. In doing so, more articulate measures of board decision-making process will evolve. The business environment is ever changing and dynamic; research in these areas will convey the interrelationship between the formal and informal system. Nevertheless, this research is unique as it has investigated the formal and informal system using both primary qualitative and quantitative data analysis and therefore provides much needed information about the characteristics requisite for nominating board members.

An effective system of corporate governance has both internal and external aspects that have to be sufficiently responsive if governance is to succeed. In this book, Ahmed Naciri examines these two core aspects or the latest buzzword in business and management theory. Internal aspects include ownership structure, the board of directors and committees, internal control, risk management, transparency and financial reporting. External aspects can either be market-oriented, or can take the form of credit ranking, and/or social requirements. Due to the original orientation of the Sarbanes/Oxley Law, concentrating solely on financial disclosure and given its decisive and tremendous influence on all other similar corporate governance legislations all over the world, most writings on corporate governance have dealt with solely internal corporate governance mechanisms. This book aim is to fill up the gap by using a systemic approach and giving a global picture of the corporate governance theoretical foundations, mainly by putting the emphasis on its double dimension: internal and external.

We manifested the triple principal-agent relationships among minority shareholders, majority shareholders and the board of directors, and conceptualized the expropriation as rents demanded by majority shareholders to compensate their agency function in a theoretical framework of internal and external corporate-control mechanisms for firms with concentrated ownership structure. By using related party transactions as a direct measure for expropriation, and the data of related party transactions between 2002 and 2006 on China's stock market, we corroborated the negative value effect of expropriation, and found that the controlling capability of controlling shareholders, ownership balancing, identity of controlling shareholders, stock incentives for the board/executives, and the proportion of tradable shares are significantly associated with expropriation. Our work on expropriation would provide insight to understand the relationship between corporate governance and firm value, and lay a basis for future theory building on corporate governance.

This article focuses on the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and the innovation policies in the Tunisian context from a cognitive perspective of corporate governance. The method used in this study is based on the regression analysis. We directly regress the board of directors' characteristics with the firm level of innovation. Our model includes some control variables such as the firm's size, the firm's sector of activity and even whether firm is listed or not. We empirically demonstrate that only the inside directors and the duality of the CEO are positively and significantly associated with the firm's level of innovation. Moreover, the empirical results show that the big size of the board has a negative impact on the development of innovative firms. In the same way, we demonstrate that the compensation system which is based on long-term objectives has no influence on the determination of the innovation policies in Tunisian firms.

122 initial public offerings (IPOs) occurring on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from January 1996 until September 2006 have been examined to assess the impact of institutional isomorphism on the selection of directors for boards facing the transition to listed companies. A high level of union representation as well as the restructuring of boards prior to an IPO and in anticipation of legal changes gives strong support for the influence of coercive isomorphism on IPO firms. Companies within industry sectors make similar choices with regard to their directors, their choices being dissimilar from their associates in other industry groupings. This supports the concepts underlying mimetic isomorphism. Finally normative isomorphism is largely supported by the reliance of corporations on a closed group of directors with similar educational backgrounds. All in all, societal and regulatory pressures, as modelled under institutional theory, are influencing the processes of corporate governance during an IPO.

Based on the results of a survey of 161 Canadian companies, this study focuses on board characteristics and their relationship to two essential board roles: strategy involvement and management monitoring. To examine these issues, a typology highlighting four possible board types is presented based on the level of independence and expertise of boards (authoritative, executive, institutional and convenient). The study demonstrates that board characteristics do have a significant impact on board roles. This study's findings are consistent with basic agency arguments regarding the importance of creating independent boards. However, it highlights the importance of board expertise as an essential criterion for board performance. Copyright (c) 2009, Inderscience Publishers.

This paper is a survey of the literature on boards of directors, with an emphasis on research done subsequent to the Benjamin E. Hermalin and Michael S. Weisbach (2003) survey. The two questions most asked about boards are what determines their makeup and what determines their actions? These questions are fundamentally intertwined, which complicates the study of boards because makeup and actions are jointly endogenous. A focus of this survey is how the literature, theoretical as well as empirical, deals-or on occasions fails to deal-with this complication. We suggest that many studies of boards can best be interpreted as joint statements about both the director-selection process and the effect of board composition on board actions and firm performance.

This article explores how the diversity of board resources and the number of women on boards affect firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR) ratings, and how, in turn, CSR influences corporate reputation. In addition, this article examines whether CSR ratings mediate the relationships among board resource diversity, gender composition, and corporate reputation. The OLS regression results using lagged data for independent and control variables were statistically significant for the gender composition hypotheses, but not for the resource diversity-based hypotheses. CSR ratings had a positive impact on reputation and mediated the relationship between the number of women on the board and corporate reputation. (c) 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The increased attention to women on corporate boards presents new challenges to governance research. In this paper we go beyond demography and open the " black box" of board behavior by drawing upon theories of gender differences and group effectiveness. Research Findings/Insights: A unique survey of 201 Norwegian firms is used. The findings suggest that the ratio of women directors is positively associated with board strategic control. In addition, we find that the positive effects of women directors on board effectiveness are mediated through increased board development activities and through decreased level of conflict. However, our results show no evidence for a positive association between women directors and open debate. Nonetheless, open debate enhances board's strategic and operational control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Recognizing the limitations of traditional governance theories to explain the role and contributions of women on corporate boards, this paper draws upon group effectiveness and gender differences theories to shed some light on whether and how women make a difference to board effectiveness in strategic and operational control. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Women's ability to make a contribution to the board may be attributable to their different leadership styles. The presence of women on corporate boards seems to increase board effectiveness through reducing the level of conflict and ensuring high quality of board development activities.

We develop the construct of board capital, composed of the breadth and depth of directors' human and social capital, and explore how board capital affects strategic change. Building upon resource dependence theory, we submit that board capital breadth leads to more strategic change, while board capital depth leads to less. We also recognize CEO power as a moderator of these relationships. Our hypotheses are tested using a random sample of firms on the S&P 500. We find support for the effect of board capital on strategic change, and partial support for the moderating effect of CEO power. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors' attention to monitoring represents an understudied topic in corporate governance. By analyzing hundreds of board meeting transcripts, we find that board members do not maintain constant levels of attention toward monitoring, but instead selectively allocate attention to their monitoring function. Drawing from the attention-based view, prospect theory, and the literature on power, we find that deviation from prior performance and CEO duality affect this allocation. Specifically, while negative deviation from prior performance increases boards' attention to monitoring, positive deviation from prior performance reduces it. The presence of duality also reduces the boards' allocation of attention to monitoring. Additional analysis demonstrates that the effects of duality are realized in part by the CEO-chair's control of the meeting's agenda and location. Finally, the results show that duality and deviation from prior performance interactively affect boards' attention to monitoring. In total, we find that board members do not consistently monitor management in order to protect shareholder value, a proposition often assumed within governance research; rather, our results demonstrate that board members' monitoring behaviors are contextually dependent. The contextual dependency of board attention to monitoring suggests that additional efforts may be needed to ensure the protection of shareholders' interests.

Using upper echelons theory and the concept of "faultlines," we argue that heterogeneity on a board of directors influences discussion of entrepreneurial issues in board meetings. We also propose that meeting context can influence such discussions. Results suggest that tenure variance, firm/industry background heterogeneity, and the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds are positively associated with a board's discussion of entrepreneurial issues. Weak faultlines increase and strong faultlines decrease such discussion. Meeting informality moderates these relationships: functional background heterogeneity decreases discussion of entrepreneurial issues, but the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds and strong faultlines increase it.

Our study investigates an unexplored succession process-interim CEO successions. We define an interim CEO succession as a case where the title of chief executive officer is vacated by the incumbent and the board of directors has not announced a permanent successor, but instead designates a particular individual as 'interim CEO,' or 'acting CEO,' or 'CEO until a permanent successor is named.' Theory predicts that interim CEO successions will lead to the type of disruption that can harm firm performance, even after a permanent successor is appointed. Our data show that interim CEO succession processes are widely employed by publicly-traded U.S. firms, and that they are associated with lower performance during the period in which the interim serves. However, whether the interim CEO also simultaneously serves as chairman moderates the impact of this type of succession on firm performance, as well as on long-term firm survival.

This study contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating how greater board of director control of management at a given firm can have unanticipated adverse effects on the leadership of-other-companies. We specifically show that greater board control reduces affected CEOs' willingness to provide various forms of strategic help (e.g., advice on strategic issues) to other CEOs, making it more difficult for other-company CEOs to access assistance on strategic matters that would otherwise enhance their firms' performance. Our theory and results indicate that these effects are mediated by CEOs' reduced social identification with the "corporate elite." (c) Academy of Management Journal.

An in-depth analysis of 11 cases is used to provide insight into the neglected area of the dynamics of boards in academic spin-offs. Drawing on stage-based, resource dependence, and social network theories, we explore board formation and changes in board composition occurring in Norwegian and US spin-offs. We find that these theories are important complements to earlier research on boards in technology-based new ventures. The process of board formation is mainly driven by social networks of the founders. Although we find differences in the initial board compositions in Norwegian and US spin-offs, there is convergence over time in subsequent board changes, which are mainly driven by the social networks of the board chair. Additions of key board members are associated with the progress of a spin-off developing from one stage to another. Several avenues for future research and implications are discussed.

Few aspects of corporate board diversity have generated the focused attention that the participation, position, and promise of women's service on the board has generated, especially in recent years. Of particular note is the extent to which women serve on large firm boards of directors (e.g., Fortune 500 firms). Increases in levels of participation have been described as glacial. While critics decry the level of participation of women on large-scale corporate boards, careful scrutiny suggests substantial progress. Concurrent with steady increases in the overall participation of women on corporate boards are increases in their presence on key board committees. Importantly, women's leadership of key board committees and their service as lead directors has improved in parallel with increases in their board memberships. These increases are particularly noteworthy in the post Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) period. Such trends suggest the continued progress of women in assuming prominent positions in the corporate governance landscape, and provide evidence that the increasingly challenging environment in the post-SOX era has not attenuated the gains noted in the pre-SOX period.

We highlight how directors and senior managers perceive the roles of a board to involve overseeing risk and compliance, strategy, governance, developing the CEO and senior management and managing stakeholders. We find that managers and directors perceive board effectiveness as linked to different combinations of these roles and that there appear to be differences in perceptions between different types of firms. We conclude that clarity around the board's role set is critical to furthering the corporate governance research agenda, and that the relationship between board roles and perceived board effectiveness differs between managers and directors.

Corporate governance and finance are dynamic academic fields that offer myriad opportunities for business ethics analysis. Within the corporate governance triad in recent years, shareholders have increased their power over boards of directors and executives through both regulation and movements to change corporate by-laws. The impact of board characteristics on firm performance has proven elusive, leading to questions concerning board processes and individual director beliefs and behaviors. At the same time, CEOs have lost considerable power, leaving many struggling to regain their control and maintain their compensation levels, while others adopt a stewardship approach to their posts. In the field of finance, the recent financial debacle has led to a reexamination of financial regulation and of the fundamental nature and purpose of the industry. All of these issues provide business ethicists fodder for investigation and analysis. (c)2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: Do the presence and independence of nominating committees within boards of directors affect the extent of rewards and sanctions provided by the labor market to directors with a reputation for being active in monitoring management? Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a director's reputation for being active in increasing control over management, the larger the number of his or her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that excludes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors. In contrast, we found that a director's reputation of being active in increasing control over management does not impact the number of his or her subsequent appointments (1) to boards without a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that includes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by executive directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director's appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of directors with reputations for being active in exercising control over managers. On the other hand, nonexistence of nominating committees or presence of weak nominating committees under the influence of the CEO decouple directors' reputations for being active in controlling management from the likelihood of obtaining new appointments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in increasing the efficiency of the labor market for directors. More specifically, it highlights the conditions under which directors with a reputation of being active in increasing control over management are likely to be rewarded by the labor market for directors. These conditions include (1) the creation of a nominating committee; (2) exclusion of the CEO from this committee; and (3) domination of this committee by outside directors.

Literature on acquisition places more concern on the consequence of an acquisition event and pays less attention to what factors influence the motive for initiating the acquisition strategy of a firm. Through the lenses of organizational learning and corporate governance theories, the study examine whether the prior acquisition experience and board characteristics affect firms' acquisition behavior. Hypotheses are tested on a sample of 92 acquisition events of Taiwanese electronics firms during the period from 1997 to 2007 by employing the survival function model. Empirical results indicate that business acquisition experience positively influence the inclination of the acquirer adopting a subsequent acquisition, while board characteristics do not relate to the likelihood of the acquirer making a subsequent acquisition. These findings provide theoretical and managerial implications for organizational learning and corporate governance theories in general and acquisition management in particular.

This study examines the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) pay fairness and future stakeholder management (SM) as well as the effect of the board of directors on this relationship. The results show that CEO pay fairness has an effect on future SM such that when underpaid, CEOs decrease SM and when overpaid, CEOs increase SM. Additionally, the relationship between CEO pay fairness and SM becomes stronger as the ratio of inside directors on the board increases, which suggests that as both management control increases and board diversity decreases, the CEO's control over SM increases. Implications for SM and CEO pay are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The board of directors is an important entity in a company, creating a link between shareholders and managers and therefore playing an important role in the governance of a firm. This study focuses on board structure and the extent of the corporate governance statement disclosure. This study found that the size of the corporate board does have some influence on the extent of the corporate governance statement disclosure. It is quite surprising to find that the rest of the variables involving the board structure do not have any association with the extent of corporate governance statement.

The study of the effectiveness of boards of directors is a tremendously interesting area of investigation, heightened by the many financial scandals of the recent past. Research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies like the inconsistency of many of the results achieved (Daily, Dalton and Cannella, 2003; Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand and Johnson, 1998; Johnson et al., 1996). It emphasises the need to go further with this research subject. Within this framework, our paper examines board effectiveness through board members' level of knowledge and experience and board structure. We understand that both dimensions: board composition and structure are not enough to board effectiveness but determine the potential to get a strategic capability. Our results show how board size, length of tenure of directors and board members' experience in senior management positions, have effects on firm financial performance.

This article presents both theoretical and empirical support for a movement from a traditional governance research paradigm towards a more holistic research approach. This includes taking into account behavioural, contingency and evolutionary theories, in an effort to better understand governance processes and effective board behaviour. Specifically, the authors highlight the importance of three groups of relationships (board dynamics, board-management relationships and board-stakeholder relationships) as contributing to good governance practice. Whilst historically researchers have largely ignored the behavioural aspects of corporate governance, the authors have made an attempt to open the 'black box' of governance processes and practices, and illustrate with examples from three New Zealand companies how the development of these relationships are important for effective board functioning.

We test whether Thai listed firms with higher levels of good governance policy adoption are less likely to violate listing rules and laws designed to protect shareholders. Our results suggest that firms on average implement, substantively as opposed to symbolically, recommended governance policies, as violations occur less frequently among firms with higher governance policy adoption scores. However, we also find evidence of symbolic governance among a small group of 'talk-only' firms that issue statements about governance while lagging in the adoption of policies related to shareholder rights and the board of directors.

Purpose - This paper aims to develop a model to assess the effectiveness and compliance of bank boards, taking into account their unique characteristics, financial industry standards and regulations. Design/methodology/approach - The literature on the roles and effectiveness of boards and directors in the financial industry is reviewed. Findings - The main finding in the literature suggests that evaluating the effectiveness of a board must include characteristics of the entire board as well as individual contributions of directors. Practical implications - Banking boards, more than in the past, must proactively evaluate their effectiveness and compliance with existing rules. Originality/value - The paper proposes a model for assessing the effectiveness and compliance of boards and directors of banking organizations, considering their characteristics, financial industry standards and regulations.

This study explores the influence Boards of Directors' demographic characteristics on the process of making strategic decisions. Empirical testing is based on a sample of 105 Greek companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. The results suggest that educational level affect both the financial reporting and the hierarchical decentralisation in the strategic decision-making process. Also, functional background of executives was found to be related with financial reporting. However, the educational specialty did not appear to have any significant influence on the strategic decision-making process. In light of these findings, implications for practitioners are made and avenues for future research are suggested.

Decades of research on corporate boards of directors resulting in diverse and often inconsistent findings have not dampened scholarly interest in the topic. Instead, researchers are attempting to more effectively model the board-firm relationship. One such modeling approach considers the power of the board in relation to top management. Drawing on upper echelons thinking (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) and the concept of managerial power (Finkelstein, 1992), this conceptual study develops the notion of board power in relation to CEO duality. Based on a framework composed of structural, ownership, expertise, and prestige power of the board, the study develops several propositions predicting the impact of board characteristics on a key aspect of managerial power - the appointment of the CEO to the position of board chair. This work contributes to scholarly understanding of the role of agency theory in explaining corporate governance phenomena by extending upper echelons thinking to the study of boards.

In the theoretical framework of corporate governance, this article studies the efficiency of the control exerted by the ownership structure and the board of directors on managers for the purpose of privileging investment in R&D. This efficiency is sensitive to national systems of governance. Tests realized on a sample of 531 U.S., Japanese and French firms with the canonical method corroborate the existence of positive relationships between concentration of ownership, the internal administrator dominance and the non-dual structure on the one hand, and the investment in R&D, on the other.

Using a large sample of European listed Companies and their Directors our study supports the hypothesis that European corporate governance do not yet converging towards a common model. Our results put in evidence in fact the existence of three dominant corporate governance profiles in European listed companies, different each others. The determinants of these profiles depend on the typical governance system adopted by the same companies and on country's culture and history; as a consequence, each of them has a own attitude of the board, in terms of structure, organization and skill mix characteristics. Finally we suggest some important implications on European governance practices.

The significance of boards of directors is often considered minor in unlisted companies due to the low degree of agency problems. Research on the topic has also been limited due to data access issues. However, networks are essential to the success of internationalizing new ventures and interlocked boards of directors have the potential to act as important information and resource conduits. To improve understanding on these dynamics, we performed an exploratory cluster analysis on board interlocks of Finnish software companies using board data we obtained from the Finnish Trade Registry and a custom survey. Our results indicate that companies that have international revenue are often interlocked with each other. In addition, companies without international revenue plan to internationalize if they have an interlock to a company that has international revenue. Our results are mirrored against management theory and future research is outlined. (c) 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The paper has two primary aims. First, to develop an appropriate network analysis to investigate whether any individual directors comprising the social network of New Zealand company directors is sufficiently connected so as to be in a position to exercise any form of cohesion, control or exertion of power. Second whether any directors could be identified as being in a position of power to take advantage of the network? This paper uses social network analysis to map and measure the structural features and patterns of relationships of the directors of companies listed on the New Zealand stock exchange and alternative exchange. The social network analysis was performed using the social network software Pajek(tm). The techniques used in the study reveal that the vertices (directors) in the network are moderately connected. The findings suggest that there is a small group of directors who are in a position to exercise cohesion, control and power over the network.

This paper examines the relationship between board of director independence and restructuring. Although poor performance driven by inadequate governance is a widely investigated antecedent of portfolio restructuring, it is also widely contested since governance structures of restructuring firms are automatically labeled as weak. Research has not proven that governance is weak in the pre-restructuring period, yet this philosophy has become institutionalized. This paper incorporates institutional arguments by suggesting that firms will adjust governance structures to reflect socially valid indicators of governance - greater board independence. Results revealed that firms do modify board independence in the post-restructuring period.

While a great deal of research has focused on the factors driving adoption of codes of best practice in corporate governance, only recently has the influence of the news media been considered. Corporate governance literature has largely converged upon internal monitoring and shareholder activist strategies as methods of shareholder protection following the decline of the market for corporate control. Commentators and activists alike have generally neglected the opportunity for an independent party, which watches over the management of companies, to guard shareholders' interests. Ireland is just one country where the value of media coverage of corporate governance violations to: (i) shareholders, (ii) policymakers and (iii) company directors has not been assessed. This paper investigates the reaction of these groups to newspaper coverage of corporate governance violations so as to determine the influence of the newspaper media on the corporate governance practices of public limited companies (plcs) listed on the Irish Stock Exchange. Using newspaper articles, media activity was analysed and measured in 15 instances of corporate governance violations and the relationships between this activity and the actions and behaviours of investors, policymakers and company directors as indicated by stock market data8, government reports9 and newspaper articles respectively were examined. Evidence from this study suggests that the Irish newspaper media influences (i) the boards of directors of Irish listed plcs, in that subsequent newspaper articles report reformatory measures taken by the boards in the vast majority of companies in the sample; (ii) the government authorities who are responsible for the legislative and regulatory infrastructure in which they operate, with statistical evidence of increases in government attention to corporate governance issues following increased newspaper coverage of theses issues and (iii) the investing decisions of investors in Irish listed plcs, with statistical verification of a relationship between movements in share price and volumes of newspaper articles relating to corporate governance violations by listed companies.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the educational qualifications and experience of executive and non-executive members of directorial boards in Australia. Inspired by Galbraith's (1967) analysis of the 'technostructure', we examine the educational qualifications of managerial (executive) directors and non-executive directors to assess the extent of divergences in the relevance (to the company's operations) of executives' and non-executives' educational qualifications. In addition, we measure the 'relatedness' of executives' and non-executives' educational qualifications to determine the extent to which the set of educational qualifications of executive directors diverges from that of non-executive directors. We find significant differences in the relevance of the educational qualifications possessed by executives and non-executives. We also find very low relatedness between the two sets of educational qualifications. The advantages of board diversity on the one hand and the disadvantages that may attend potentially sub-optimal technical information flow on the other are discussed.

This study contributes to the work on board composition and firm corporate social responsibility by extending it to the environmental domain. It evaluates the relationship between boards of directors' composition and environmental corporate social responsibility (ECSR) by integrating literatures on board composition, firm corporate social responsibility, and individual differences in attitudes toward and information about environmental issues. Using disclosed company data and the natural environment ratings data from Kinder Lydenberg Domini (KLD) Inc. for 78 Fortune 1000 companies, the study finds that a higher proportion of outside board directors is associated with more favorable ECSR and higher KLD strengths scores. Firms with boards composed of three or more female directors received higher KLD strengths scores. And, boards whose directors average closer to 56 years in age and those with a higher proportion of Western European directors are more likely to implement environmental governance structures or processes. Our results also reinforce growing concerns around unidimensional KLD measures. (c) 2011 SAGE Publications.

This study investigates the relationship between strong firm environmental performance and board characteristics that capture boards' monitoring and resource provision abilities during an era when the natural environment and the related strategic opportunities have increased in importance. The authors relate the proxy for strong environmental performance to board characteristics that represent boards' monitoring role (i.e., independence, CEO-chair duality, concentration of directors appointed after the CEO, and director shareholding) and resource provision role (i.e., board size, directors on multiple boards, CEOs of other firms on the board, lawyers on the board, and director tenure). The authors provide evidence consistent with both theories of board roles. Specifically, consistent with their agency theory-driven predictions, the authors find evidence of higher environmental performance in firms with higher board independence and lower concentration of directors appointed after the CEO on the board of directors. Consistent with resource dependence theory, they show that environmental performance is higher in firms that have larger boards, larger representation of active CEOs on the board, and more legal experts on the board. Their findings are generally robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. These findings have implications for managers, firms, shareholders, and regulators who act on behalf of shareholders, if they are interested in influencing environmental performance.

This study sought to investigate if there is a link between women on boards of directors and corporate sustainability. Using a sample of publicly listed firms from Australia, the results suggest some level of support that a link does exist. Boards that have a strong complement of gender diversity are expected to offer more effective monitoring of agents, as well as offer more stringent enforcement of ethical conduct, thereby minimizing affects of subversion of shareholder funds that can be detrimental to their returns. Accordingly, findings confirm a positive link between women on boards and economic growth. Because of their relational abilities, women on boards are more likely able to engage with multiple stakeholders and respond to their needs, resulting in an avenue for demonstrating social responsiveness, which is confirmed by the results. However, due to their backgrounds and work experiences, sex-based biases and stereotyping might exist in boardrooms with men directors discounting input from women directors on issues relating to environmental quality. The results of this study find that women directors are not significantly associated with environmental quality. Discussion is given to these findings along with paths for future research.

This paper offers a review of the theoretical and empirical literature addressing boards of directors within the unique organizational setting of family businesses. By reviewing and structuring past research, this paper aims to improve the understanding of how family involvement in firms affects the roles and behaviours of boards. The review of the literature is structured according to the family business board's two primary tasks as an internal administrative body, namely the exercise of control and the provision of advice. For both board tasks, theoretical perspectives and the match between theory and empirical findings will be discussed. The review concludes by offering an integrative discussion of the relevant theories and by highlighting the need for multi-theoretic, process and contextualized approaches in future research on boards of directors in family businesses.

This study extends work on independent directors to examine the influence of their human capital and social capital on investor reactions to the board's CEO selection decision. We predict that human capital, as represented by the board's CEO experience and industry experience, and social capital, as represented by directors' co-working experience on the board and external directorship ties to other corporate boards, will influence the stock market reactions to new CEO appointments. In a sample of 208 new CEO appointment events in U.S. manufacturing firms between 1999 and 2003, we found that the stock market reacted favorably to the appointments made by boards with higher levels of human and social capital. We also found that the effect of internal social capital was stronger when the new CEO was an insider rather than an outsider. The implications of the results for director selection and CEO succession are discussed. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Manuscript Tytpe: Empirical Research Question/Issues: The resource-based view of the firm may provide the theoretical explanation as to how boards can be a source of firm competitive advantage. Directors' experience, knowledge, expertise are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable resources that make up the board potential. These resources must be integrated with other firm resources in strategic processes through dynamics of relations. Research Findings/Insights: Given the preliminary nature of this work, the empirical section is an exclusive analysis of the board's potential. Our specific aim is to establish whether resources that directors bring to board are sources of board competence and ability with consequences for international strategic decisions. To do this, we use a sample of 562 board members of 45 listed Spanish companies. Our results show that average board tenure is negatively related to the firm's degree of international diversification. Directors with long tenures may operate from the basis of routines that are built up over time and their knowledge of the firm could eventually become a less valuable resource. The empirical findings also indicate that the directors' managerial experience within the specific industry to which the firm belongs and a high level of academic achievement affects the firm's degree of international diversification. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The contribution of this article is three-fold. First, it emphasizes the role of directors in board effectiveness, investigating why and how relevant elements of directors' human capital can enhance board ability to perform their roles making up the board potential. Secondly, it refines and extends the concept of "board capability" as an adequate configuration of potential and relationship dynamics that allow boards to undertake their task competently over time. Third, this article stresses the active participation of a board in firm internationalization. Practitioner/Policy Implications: One of the important practical implications of these results refers to the selection of board members. In order to increase board effectiveness, in the context of firm internationalization, the selection process must be guided by the search of intangibles, inimitable and unique resources, that the board can capitalize on in order to differentiate its potential over competitors.

We examine whether corporate governance matters more for firms facing financial distress. We theorize that financial crisis changes the relative costs and benefits of governance mechanisms and that more independent and smaller boards become more valuable in distressed firms. We further hypothesize that CEO power becomes increasingly beneficial as concentrated power allows the firm to respond more rapidly to the crisis. Event-history analysis of the failure of publicly traded Internet firms over the period 2000-2002 confirms our hypotheses. Our results suggest that the association between governance and survival depends on firm and environmental context and that one-size-fits-all prescriptions for governance mechanisms are therefore likely to be ineffective.

We develop and test a novel theory about strategic noise with regard to CEO appointments. Strategic noise is an anticipatory and preemptive form of impression management. At the time it announces a new CEO, a board of directors seeks to manage stakeholder impressions by simultaneously releasing confounding information about other significant events. Several CEO and firm characteristics affect the likelihood that this will happen. Strategic noise is most likely when long-term CEOs have a wide pay gap between other top managers at high stock price performance firms, and when a new CEO does not have previous CEO experience or comes from a less well-regarded firm. Results showing that CEO succession announcements are noisier than they would be by chance have some interesting implications for impression management theory, traditional event study methodology, and managerial and public policy. Interviews with public firm directors on CEO succession provide additional validity for the strategic noise construct and help us to articulate key elements of the theory.

Scholars and practitioners have recently devoted considerable attention to boards of directors, but far more research is needed. We still know little about how boards actually work and how their behavior may be improved to contribute to value creation. During more than two decades agency theory has been the dominant theory in studies about boards of directors. When relaxing some of the assumptions in agency theory several new pathways for new research arise. To present new perspectives on board research we follow in this essay some of the pathways arising from relaxing agency theory assumptions about complete contracts. Alternative theoretical approaches, research questions and methods are suggested. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Interactions between CEOs and their boards of directors are a prominent focus of management and strategy research. Despite the extensive literature on CEO-board relations, to date there has been limited integration of theoretical perspectives and measurement schemes. Through an extensive analysis of published studies, we hope to facilitate future research on CEO-board relations. We begin with a comparison of key theoretical approaches. Next, we conduct a content analysis of 51 empirical articles. We find that prior studies have an unbalanced focus regarding both topics and theoretical perspectives, and that there is limited consistency in the choice of measures. Based on this review, we lay out a number of promising directions for future research. We also find that, while there has been progress in international research on CEO-board relations, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the generalizability of governance theories across different geographic settings.

Each year shareholders, via exercise of their proxy votes, have the opportunity to voice their support or displeasure with firms and director nominees. Examining over 2,000 Fortune 500 director nominees, we explore those indicators available to shareholders at the time of directors' (re)election to provide insight into shareholder discontent with director monitoring. By studying actual voting behaviors, we provide new perspective to understanding director elections as a governance process. Employing a multilevel approach, we find support for agency-theoretic relationships between several firm and director characteristics and shareholder opposition to directors seeking (re)election to the board. At the firm level, we find that CEO compensation level and board size are positively related to the withholding of shareholder votes in director elections, a behavior indicative of shareholder discontent. Complementing these findings, at the director level, we find that affiliated director status, tenure, and number of outside directorships are positively related, and director block ownership is negatively related to shareholder discontent with director monitoring.

This study examines the influence of Mexico's efforts to improve corporate governance on firm performance and transparency. We utilize compliance data from the Code of 'Best' Corporate Practices, disclosed annually by public firms in Mexico, as a measure of corporate governance strength. We document a significant increase in compliance over 2000-2004 indicating Mexican companies view non-compliance as costly. However, we find no association between the governance index and firm performance, nor is there a relation with transparency. Instead, we find firms with greater compliance resort to the more costly mechanism of making dividend payments (higher propensity to pay and greater yield) to reduce agency conflicts. We conclude these associations are the direct result of the institutional features of the Mexican business environment, which is characterized by concentrated ownership of insiders, interlocked boards of directors, a lack of insider trading enforcement, and generally poor protection of minority investors. Our results show that monitoring mechanisms alone are not enough to fundamentally change economic behavior. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The origins of the global financial crisis have been attributed to the combination of a housing price bubble and innovative financial instruments, as well as the lack of restraint by corporate executives and boards to engage in excessive risk-taking. The rise in subprime lending between 1997 and 2005 played a crucial role in inflating the housing price bubble. We take a unique dataset of US financial institutions heavily engaged in subprime lending and ask the following research question: Did board configuration play a role in determining whether a financial institution specialized in subprime lending? Research Findings/Insights: We use a matched-pair sample of firms in the financial industry from 1997-2005 with half of the sample specializing in subprime lending and conduct panel data logistic regression analysis. We find that the board configurations of those financial institutions that engaged in subprime lending were significantly different from those that did not. Specifically, subprime lenders had boards that were busier, had less tenure, and were less diverse with respect to gender. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study uses the group decision making perspective in the context of subprime lending to examine board of director configuration and its influence on decision making processes around the issue of risky subprime lending. Findings show that how boards were configured did influence the decision to specialize in subprime lending. We find robust support for predictions based on the group decision making perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The deterioration of mortgage lending requirements that gave rise to the defaults of so many subprime loans, in retrospect, appears to be something that should have been entirely preventable. By demonstrating that subprime specialists had significant differences in board configuration that impacted group decision making, this study offers guidance to policymakers considering additional regulation and for corporate officers examining corporate governance issues.

This study explores the competing influences of different types of board interlocks on diffusion of a strategic initiative among a population of firms. We examine a broad social network of interlocking directors in U.S. firms over a period of 17 years and consider the likelihood that these firms will adopt a strategy of expansion into China. Results show that ties to adopters that unsuccessfully implement this strategy have a nearly equal and opposing effect on the likelihood of adoption as do ties to those that successfully implement the strategy. Ties to those that do not implement the strategy also have a suppressive effect on the likelihood of adoption. Furthermore, we examine a firm's position in the core-periphery structure of the interlocking directorate, finding that ties to adopters closer to the network core positively affect the likelihood of adoption. We discuss the implications of our study for social network analysis, governance, and internationalization research. (c) 2011 INFORMS.

Manuscript Type: Perspective Research Question/Issue: What were the reasons for poor risk management on the board level before and during the financial crisis? Were there systemic information processing problems that an alternative board design could alleviate? Research Findings/Insights: Using an information processing perspective, we identify two reasons for boards failing to manage risk well during the financial crisis: (1) board members did not have access to relevant information on the risks management incurred because they had no control over information supply; and (2) board members were unable to process the available risk-related information, and lacked incentives or power to influence managerial decision making. Based on insights from cybernetics and decision making theory, we suggest increasing board level information processing and decision making capabilities by including multiple boards for different stakeholders to create a division of power and labor. We label this alternative structure network governance and posit that it allows superior risk management. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The paper illustrates that the unitary board structure's systemic shortcomings increase the likelihood of poor risk management at the board level. The solutions proposed are an important theoretical advancement of the discussion on ongoing board failure in increasingly complex business environments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper is one of few providing actual recommendations based on a systemic insight. Enlightened shareholders and/or managers could introduce network governance by amending corporate constitutions. Regulators should require firms considered too big to fail to adopt network governance or pay the cost for regulators establishing a risk-monitoring unit in each firm.

Prior research shows that firms benefit from the social capital of their boards of directors but has not explored the antecedents of new director social capital. We argue that firms can attract directors with social capital by offering more compensation. We also argue that more complex firms (firms with a greater scale and scope of operations) are more attractive to such directors because of the greater experience and exposure that such directorships provide. Similarly, we argue that firms with high-status directors on their current boards will be more attractive to directors with social capital. We analyse the social capital of new outside directors added to boards of semiconductor firms between 1993 and 2007. Surprisingly, we find no support for the hypothesis that higher compensation is associated with adding directors with high status or board ties. However, firm complexity is associated with the ability to add new directors who have social capital, and the status of current board members is associated with the ability to add new directors who also have high status.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of prior firm performance on board composition and governance structure. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 90 companies listed on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations were used for this study. Hypotheses were tested using both general linear regression and logit regression analyses. Findings: The results showed that prior negative change in firm performance was significantly related to a decrease in the overall number of directors and a decrease in the number of outside directors. Research limitations/implications: The sample size used in this study was relatively small and the focus was on small to medium-sized firms, so the results found here may not apply to firms larger than those used in our sample. Practical implications: Directors may want to consider the implications for governance practices found in this study, specifically, whether smaller boards with fewer outsiders are appropriate following periods of performance decline. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine the effects of trends in prior firm performance on board composition and chief executive officer duality.

Background: Despite pressures to change the role of hospital boards, hospitals have made few changes in board composition or director selection criteria. Hospital boards have often continued to operate in their traditional roles as either "monitors" or "advisors." More attention to the direct involvement of hospital boards in the strategic decision-making process of the organizations they serve, the timing and circumstances under which board involvement occurs, and the board composition that enhances their abilities to participate fully is needed. Purposes: We investigated the relationship between broader expertise among hospital board members, board involvement in the stages of strategic decision making, and the hospital's strategic focus. Methodology/Approach: We surveyed top management team members of 72 nonacademic hospitals to explore the participation of critical stakeholder groups such as the board of directors in the strategic decision-making process. We used hierarchical regression analysis to explore our hypotheses that there is a relationship between both the nature and involvement of the board and the hospital's strategic orientation. Findings: Hospitals with broader expertise on their boards reported an external focus. For some of their externally-oriented goals, hospitals also reported that their boards were involved earlier in the stages of decision making. Practice Implications: In light of the complex and dynamic environment of hospitals today, those charged with developing hospital boards should match the variety in the external issues that the hospital faces with more variety in board makeup. By developing a board with greater breadth of expertise, the hospital responds to its complex environment by absorbing that complexity, enabling a greater potential for sensemaking and learning. Rather than acting only as monitors and advisors, boards impact their hospitals' strategic focus through their participation in the strategic decision-making process.

Posited on the asymmetric features of equity ownership and stock option pay, this article examines the extent to which acquisition activities affect boards of directors' decisions to restructure the incentive design of executive compensation packages in the post-acquisition period.For a recent dataset of 148 deals between 1996 and 2009, the article finds that acquirers' overpayment for target firms and equity financing are likely to require scapegoating, particularly under conditions of intervening poor performance and stronger board vigilance, inducing directors to respond to CEOs' overly risky and suboptimal selection of acquisition terms by enlarging the proportion of equity ownership disincentives at the expense of stock option incentives in executive pay contracts.By linking the incidence of large acquisition deals to an altered agency problem, the article proposes an alternative way to gauge how corporate boards enact their monitoring responsibilities based on CEOs' recent past strategic choices.(c) The Author(s) 2011.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study examines the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries maintain active boards of directors. Active boards are in this study defined as boards that perform tasks beyond fulfilling local legal requirements. We focus on both monitoring and service roles. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a sample of 83 foreign subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is a world mandate subsidiary, which has worldwide responsibility for a product line and performs a broad scope of value-added activities. Moreover, a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is larger relative to the multinational enterprise (MNE), if it has a higher level of local responsiveness, and if its past performance is poorer. Additionally, the presence of an active board in a foreign subsidiary is related to other control mechanisms deployed in the subsidiary. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results highlight the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries are likely to maintain active boards. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that agency theory and resource dependence theory are relevant and complementary in the analysis of active boards in foreign subsidiaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that an active board may be a control mechanism to govern foreign subsidiaries and an instrument to deal with the external environment. Corporate governance regulators may consider developing governance recommendations that emphasize the importance of subsidiary boards in the oversight of foreign subsidiaries.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate an interesting yet mostly ignored distinction within external CEO successions: outside successors who have previous CEO experience and those who do not. It examines stock market reaction, compensation and firm performance prior and post-succession. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used an event study, "Patell Z-statistic" and "Rank Z-statistic" to test cumulative abnormal return before and after the successions. They also used probit and OLS regressions to examine firm performance and CEO compensation prior and post-succession. Findings - The authors find that the stock market reacts positively to the hiring of an outsider who is an exCEO. Compared with firms that hire non-exCEOs, firms that hire exCEOs had higher debt ratios and greater bankruptcy chances pre-succession, but post-succession, these firms still have worse financial performances. Non-exCEOs come from better performing firms than exCEOs. There is no consistently significant difference in compensation between an exCEO and a non-exCEO, though the compensation for both increases significantly from that of the predecessors and that of their previous positions. Research limitations/implications - Future research could focus on the cost-benefit tradeoff of hiring an exCEO. It would be interesting to examine the role of the board of directors in assessing this cost-benefit tradeoff and determining the optimal choice for the firm. An important aspect that has not been sufficiently examined in the literature is the CEO fit. Hiring an exCEO may not always be the right choice for the firm. Another area for future research could examine how the post-succession performance is affected by exCEO tenure in previous CEO position(s) and whether the exCEO worked in several industries or in the same industry. Practical implications - This paper also has implications for the board of directors. There seems to be a negative transfer of human capital when it comes to hiring exCEOs. The human capital theory suggests that job-specific experience positively relates to job performance. According to Hamori and Koyuncu, prior CEO experience may "lead to the formation of knowledge corridors and decision-making templates that make it difficult for individuals to take in inconsistent information or take actions that are different from past ones in a changed context. This, in turn, undermines performance". Boards of directors should put more effort into considering inside relay successions and should be cautious when hiring an outsider who has prior CEO experience. A best-of-both-worlds scenario may be for boards to hire exCEOs into top executive positions, such as COO and/or president, so as to give them a chance to be groomed for the top position and familiarize themselves with the firm while still benefiting from their prior CEO experience. Originality/value - There is very little research on the distinction between outside CEOs with previous CEO experience and those with no such experience. This paper tries to shed some light on this important issue in corporate governance in order to explain why boards of directors would hire an outsider with or without previous CEO experience.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the effect of CEO preference proxied by CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity on non-CEO executive turnover, and how such effect is moderated by CEO power-related variables (the CEO's founder status and CEO ownership) and firm performance in a sample of Chinese listed companies. Research Findings/Results: The results show that when CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity is inconsistent with social norms (e.g., the non-CEO executive is older and has longer team tenure than the CEO), the non-CEO executive is more likely to exit from the TMT. This association is strengthened by the CEO's founder status and low firm performance, whereas it is weakened by CEO ownership. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The theory of organizational politics proposes that competition among top managers plays an important role in the internal monitoring of firms. In contrast with most literature centering on the role of non-CEO executives in CEO turnover and succession, this study focuses on what kind of non-CEO executives CEOs are likely to dismiss and demonstrates how this process is influenced by CEO power and low firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Given a CEO's intention to dismiss a non-CEO executive when CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity is inconsistent with social norms, particularly when the CEO is powerful and firm performance is low, the board of directors should keep an eye on any conflict of interests or power struggle between the CEO and the non-CEO executive. The CEO should also be prudent in making executive turnover decisions, because the implications of dismissing such a non-CEO executive for reasons relating to firm performance are largely unknown.

In the wake of this decade's corporate scandals, crimes and excesses, improving the effectiveness of corporate governance in the United States has become a priority. An important influence on a board's effectiveness at monitoring is its members degree of independence from senior management. While the current definition of independence revolves around the absence of familial and economic connections between a firm and its directors, research suggests that this standard may be inadequate in ensuring independent oversight. Rather, diversity along racial, gender and other dimensions has been proposed as a potentially more effective standard for board independence. This is especially welcome news for women, who currently comprise 51 per cent of the US managerial workforce but only 14.8 per cent of the directors on boards of large, publicly traded US corporations. Some explain the current dearth of women board members by claiming that there are no qualified women available for board service and/or that women are not interested in board service. However, there is more anecdotal rather than empirical evidence on the issue. Surveying women at a women's leadership conference in Boston, this research investigates the extent to which women are currently involved in some type of board service and the extent to which women aspire to future board service. We find that women are currently more active in governance activities than prior research on corporate boards suggests and that they aspire to play a continued and expanded role in governance activities.

The concept of stakeholder engagement is gaining increasing attention in the mainstream media and may feature as part of a corporation's strategy for corporate social responsibility. Not only are boards considering how they might engage with key stakeholders, but stakeholders are also pursuing greater participation in the strategic decisions of companies in which they invest. While this is an emerging concept in companies governed by unitary boards, as in North America, the issue of stakeholder engagement in various forms is also entering debate in other countries around the world. In general, however, the idea of shareholder or stakeholder representation on the boards of most UK and Commonwealth companies is anathema. Forces now influencing the development of strategies for stakeholder engagement and the rise of active investors include changing corporate governance rules which give investors more power in the election of directors, the increasing role of pension plans and hedge fund investment groups which have produced investors who keep a close eye on company performance and value, and a sluggish or turbulent stock market as a result of the financial crisis initiated by the credit crunch in the sub-prime mortgage markets. In this paper the phenomenon of stakeholder representation is examined and results of a recent survey conducted among a large sample of New Zealand directors are presented. The findings suggest that these traditionally oriented boards are increasingly inwardly focused and are without an agenda for building and managing shareholder and stakeholder relations. Accordingly, such boards are unlikely to regard stakeholder engagement as a serious strategic issue and are thus also likely to miss significant opportunities in the changed business environment to benefit from stakeholder support.

Purpose: Amid ongoing criticism that corporate boards do not receive adequate information to help them fulfill their current and emerging roles, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the type of information directors receive. Specifically, to examine whether greater board independence and greater board expertise were associated with receiving more information, in five specific categories. Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses about the relationships between the composition of corporate boards and the various types of information they receive were tested by means of a survey of 161 Canadian companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Findings: The authors findings indicate a strong association between board expertise and each type of information received and suggest a weaker relationship between board independence and information received. Specifically, the results demonstrate that more independent boards do not receive larger amounts of information that is more forward-looking in nature. Research limitations/implications: These findings contribute to the literature on governance by providing relevant empirical evidence, based on primary data on board information issues. However, these results must be interpreted within the context of the use of various perceptual measures. Practical implications: Now that the composition of corporate boards has changed considerably, the findings of this study underline the need to re-examine the supporting information processes. Hence, this study should help provide guidance to organizations examining the content of their current information strategy. Originality/value: An important contribution of this study is its detailed characterization of the information provided to corporate boards, including financial and non-financial information and reflecting the five traditional stages of the strategic management process.

Stakeholder theorists distinguish between normative stakeholders, those who gain moral standing by making contributions to the firm, and derivative stakeholders, those who can constrain the corporate association even though they make no contribution. The board of directors has the legal authority to distinguish among these stakeholder groups and to distribute rights and obligations among these stakeholder groups. To be sure, this stakeholder formulation appropriately seizes on the firm's voluntary, associative character. Yet, the firm's constituents contribute assets and incur risks to participate in market, economic activities. And, as such, the firm's "stakeholders" must share an imperfect language to assist in making two key economic decisions: (1) who are the legitimate and who are the derivative stakeholders; and (2) who should sit on the board? Still, stakeholder theorists have good reason to be skeptical of neoclassical economics. Its assumptions that all act opportunistically and that all can calculate rationally and fully hardly correspond to studies on the managerial experience of corporate coordination. However, advances in behavioral law and economics now provide a cogent economic logic that readily fits into a stakeholder mode. In brief, we argue that (1) the firm's economic purpose designates legitimacy to core stakeholders, to those who add value, assume unique risk, and can incur harm; (2) the board serves as the principal who coordinates these core stakeholders to sustain competitive advantage and new wealth creation; and (3) state incorporation law, Delaware in particular, reinforces the board's function. These, in turn, supply selection criteria for board membership. We aim to synchronize concepts from behavioral law and economics with stakeholder theory. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Stemming from different theoretical perspectives the article examines the conflicts of interest arising among the actors (citizens, local governments, private shareholders, service providers) that at various levels are involved in local public utilities governance systems. The main results of a multiple case study analysis on 10 Italian listed local public utilities are summarized. Different and coexisting situations of conflicts of interest among multiple principals and agents are identified. In this context, governance mechanisms (e.g., the board of directors) have different roles and functions and may prevent and mitigate such conflicts. However, our findings suggest that the ownership structure influences board composition and functioning and that higher numbers of independent directors do not necessarily mean "actual" board independence. The article contributes to the debate on conflicts of interest and governance mechanisms in local public utilities. (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Boards of directors are a vital part of corporate governance systems. In the on-going discussion about the development of national corporate governance systems, however, little interest has been given to the issue of how and why board behavior changes over time. In this article, we use an institutional approach and study the development of board behavior in Sweden between 1994 and 2004 and if it is affected by board composition and board network characteristics. In order to do so, we introduce the constructs of board activities, i. e. what the boards do, and board involvement, i.e. when in the decision process they get involved. Findings show that range of board activities and board involvement have increased drastically during this period, which indicates a change in the logic of appropriateness of Swedish board behavior. There are robust indications that new types of actors affect activities and involvement positively, as do board interlocks, whereas network centrality affects activities and involvement negatively.

This research focuses on the board role evolution analysis which took place simultaneously with the development of different corporate governance theories and perspectives. The purpose of this paper is to provide understanding of key factors that make a board effective in the performance of its role. We argue that analysis of board role performance should incorporate both structural and process variables. This paper's contribution is the development of an integrative model that aims to establish the relationship between the board structure and processes on the one hand, and board role performance on the other.

The theoretical framework for a comprehensive trust model is presented using McAllister's affect- and cognitive-based trust model and Siegrist, Earle, and Gutscher's trust-confidence-cooperation model as the foundation. The enhanced model includes cognitive and affective domains of personality, culture, motivation, reliability, competence, and intuition (as a latent variable) to measure perception of trust between two individuals. The model applies the intercognition of self-leadership for improving trust and building effective relationships within boards of directors. Furthermore, the authors consider the multiplicity of board of director roles and how such complexity affects formation and maintenance of optimal trust. (c) Baker College 2011.

This research examines how the board of directors affects the relationship between Research and Development (R&D) investment and firm performance. The study, conducted on a sample of French companies listed on Euronext Paris, shows that the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance is significantly positive. However, this relationship varies significantly with the characteristics of the board of directors. Specifically, the results show that board independence, chief executive officer and chairman duality and the number of board meetings have a positive effect on the R&D investment-firm performance relationship, whereas board size affects this relationship negatively.

This work aims to contribute to the field of research on Agency Theory, based on an approach that is different from the previous literature. It focuses on analysis of characteristics of the structure of the Board of Directors as mechanisms for control over the level of remuneration awarded to executive personnel, both in the context of "concentrated" as well as "dispersed" share ownership, with the aim of determining whether or not the postulates of this theory are applicable to both. To achieve this objective, the study is based on a sample of 80 traded Spanish companies for the period 2004-2007, to which crosscutting and panel data models are applied. The results obtained show that the characteristics that define the structure of the Board of Directors constitute efficient mechanisms for supervision and control of compensation received by Top Management, although its influence in this regard is conditioned by the concentration of ownership.

The role of boards in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. Over the last four decades, research on the relationship between boards of directors and strategy has proliferated. Ye t to date there is little theoretical and empirical study regarding the question of how board information affects the boards of directors' strategic involvement. Using a survey data from 104 responses of chairpersons collected in the year of 2010 in China, we examine how board information affects boards' behaviors of strategic involvement. Our study shows that quality of information, information diversity, frequency of board interaction, and proactive seeking information positively influence boards' strategy monitoring and advisory. These findings provide empirical support for agency theory and resource dependence theory on boards. (c) 2011 IEEE.

This study examines the relationship between board structure and board process on capital structure decisions of Malaysian public listed companies. The study combines a survey approach and secondary data from the year 2007 to 2009. Based on a sample of 175 companies, the findings reveal that directors' risk appetite is positively correlated to company leverage while directors' tenure has negative relationship with leverage. With regards to board process, four variables are identified to be negatively correlated to capital structure which is boards' risk oversight, performance of independent directors, CEO's performance evaluation and accessibility of information.

In an environment with poor quality of Corporate Governance Mechanisms, the quality of directors' attributes might exert an important role to improve firm's value and performance. I developed an index to explore the quality of Board of Directors based on Brazilian and international corporate governance codes to measure directors qualitative attributes. The sample consist in 24 Brazilian firms that traded at NYSE in the period over 1999-2006. The results show us that board of directors with high types of attributes can improve value measured individually and by the quality index. The main results indicate that firm value improved with high types of professionals, accountants seated in boards, directors with high level of education and that participated in executive training.

The literature on the relationships between board attributes and corporate performance is mixed, and one important reason is that the intermediate variable, i.e., board behaviors are ignored. With the data coming from listed company of China, the paper empirically researches the relationship between the characteristics and monitoring function of board. Using Principal Component Analysis, we get 6 variables reflecting the characteristics of board and 4 variables for the monitoring function. The study shows that the share held ratio of board's members has a negative impact on the directing function of board significantly, but the gender ratio and the average age of board members has a positive impact on the position function of board significantly. This may be valuable to regulate the behavior of board. (c) 2011 IEEE.

Through the lens of agency theory, the paper examines the conflicts of interest arising among the actors (citizens, Local governments, private shareholders, service providers, etc.) that, at various levels, are involved in local public utilities governance systems. The main results of a multiple case study analysis on ten Italian listed local public utilities are summarized by identifying different and co-existing situations of conflict of interest among multiple principals and agents. Although governance mechanisms (e.g., the board of directors) have different roles and functions and may prevent and mitigate such conflicts, our findings pointed out that various problematic issues exist. First, the effects of the ownership structure on board composition and functioning needs to be further explored. Second, higher numbers of independent directors do not mean actual board independence. Third, service charters as tools for promoting transparency, accountability and public participation are not well implemented yet. The chapter contributes to the debate on local public utilities governance suggesting possible agency theory developments by focusing on different forms of citizens' participation (e.g., co-production).

In Spanish listed firms, taking into account the predominant modes of ownership structure, which are characterized by a high concentration of shares in the hands of a few shareholders who are strongly represented on the board of directors, it might suppose that there are strong stimulus for a close top managers' supervision and a straight interest alignment. However, the empirical evidence indicates the opposite, and this paradox needs to be explained within the theoretical framework of institutional theory. The high concentration of ownership and the high level of cross-holdings generate conflicting interests by those who have multiple roles as directors and top managers, suggesting that board's supervisory effectiveness may be compromised by social pressures in search of legitimacy. These features of Spanish firms are undermining governance mechanisms, and may explain the high pay levels, the low variable packages and, in general, the lack of connection between top managers' compensation and firm performance in comparison with those in other countries of Continental Europe.

Corporate governance scholars are increasingly interested in firms' social and environmental performance. Empirical research in this area, however, has moved forward in an uncoordinated fashion, producing fragmented and contradictory results. Our paper seeks to address this situation by adopting a fact-based research approach that comprehensively explores the link between corporate governance and environmental performance. Specifically, we aim to understand how the relationships between and among the firms' owners, managers, and boards of directors influence environmental performance. We are particularly interested in understanding the interactions among these three key sets of actors. In the end, we offer some observations about governance practices and discuss the implications for theory. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Prior research on CEO succession has omitted consideration of a critical institutional reality: some exiting CEOs do not fully depart the scene but instead remain as board chairs. We posit that predecessor retention restricts a successor's discretion, thus dampening his or her ability to make strategic changes or deliver performance that deviates from pre-succession levels. In short, a predecessor's continuing presence suppresses a new CEO's influence. Based on analysis of 181 successions in high technology firms, and with extensive controls (for circumstances associated with succession, the firm's need and capacity for change, and for endogeneity), we find substantial support for our hypotheses. In supplementary analyses, we find that retention has a more pronounced effect in preventing a new CEO from making big performance gains than in preventing big drops. (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We build on a stakeholder-agency theoretical perspective to explore the impact of particular corporate governance mechanisms on firm environmental performance. Our empirical evidence shows that several important corporate governance mechanisms such as the board of directors, managerial incentives, the market for corporate control, and the legal and regulatory system determine firms' environmental performance levels. These results suggest that these different governance mechanisms resolve, to some extent, the existing divergence of interests between stakeholders and managers with respect to environmental activities.

Director selection is a critical board process and outcome that influences the board and its overall performance. Because of this influence, research from a variety of different disciplinary areas examines the antecedents and outcomes of director selection. The authors offer a synthesis of this literature from these different disciplines. The authors first delineate the process that drives the selection of an individual to a board. They then review and categorize the director selection literature into two distinct perspectives-a rational economic perspective focused on the organization-level benefits driving the selection decision and a socialized perspective emphasizing the social processes that influence the director selection process. Finally, from their review, the authors suggest promising areas of future research regarding director selection. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of corporate board characteristics on the financial performance of Nigerian quoted firms. Board characteristics studied comprise board size, board skill, board nationality, board gender, board ethnicity and CEO duality. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed the random-effects and fixed-effects generalised least squares (GLS) regression to test the six hypotheses formulated for the study, while controlling for firm size and firm age. Findings: Using panel data from 122 quoted firms in Nigeria between 1991 and 2008, it was found that board size, CEO duality and gender diversity were negatively linked with firm performance, whereas board nationality, board ethnicity and the number of board members with a PhD qualification were found to impact positively on firm performance. The result of the robustness test using the same board characteristics for 160 small firms showed that board duality was positively linked to firm performance, while a PhD qualification was negatively linked to firm performance. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of the board-performance link by examining both the traditional variables such as board size, CEO duality and other organisational attributes such as ethnic diversity, foreign nationality and competence variables represented by women and PhD holders, respectively. The results provide an insight for practitioners and policy makers on the importance of relying on institutional specifics in the prescription of corporate governance codes. Originality/value: The study adds value to the global corporate governance discourse in two ways: first, the use of Nigeria, which is claimed to have one of the weakest business cultures in the world, and secondly, using a good number of proxies that are country-specific for corporate boards.

Using a sample of 4,278 listed UK firms, we construct a social network of directorship-interlocks that comprises 31,495 directors. We use social capital theory and techniques developed in social network analysis to measure a director's connectedness and investigate whether this connectedness is associated with their compensation level and their firms overall performance. We find connectedness is positively associated with compensation and with the firm's future performance. The results do not support the view that executive and outside directors use their connections to extract economic rents. Rather the company compensates these individuals for the resources these better connections provide to the firm. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The prevalence of ownership concentration in Asian firms presents a challenge to the influential agency theory-based understanding of the role of corporate boards. In this paper we develop and test hypotheses about board attributes and firm performance that reflect Asian institutional conditions. We present the first meta-analysis of the relationship between board attributes and performance of Asian firms using a varied set of meta-analytical techniques on a database of 86 studies covering nine Asian countries. First, we find that board structure and composition preferences are influenced by the identity of the concentrated owner. Second, consistent with US data, we find very limited evidence of a direct relationship between board attributes and firm financial performance in the Asian context. Third, we find that the relationship between board structure and composition and firm performance is mediated by the revealed strategic preferences of Asian firms specifically by the level of R&D investment.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: To what extent can group faultlines and their potential value-destroying effects be detected on corporate boards? Task-related attributes of the type of directorship, education, board tenure, and financial background of board members are considered as directors' characteristics that give rise to the faultline phenomenon. The impact of task-related faultlines on firm performance as well as the moderating effects of busy boards, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) tenure, executive directors' (EDs) compensation structure, and the average non-executive directors' (NEDs) involvement in board committees are examined. Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel of FTSE 350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find a strong negative effect of task-related faultlines on firm performance. Further exploration of the moderating effects demonstrates that the condition of a busy board and CEO tenure exacerbate the negative effects of faultlines. At the same time, the executive pay contingency is found to have a remedying effect on boardroom cohesiveness, whereas the involvement of NEDs in board committee work is not likely to make the adverse effects of board faultlines less pronounced. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the arguments of social identity theory, this study shows that task-related faultlines on corporate boards have strong negative value-creating implications. The positive moderating impact of the executive compensation structure renders support to agency theory predictions about executive incentive alignment. This work also underlines the usefulness of the concept of faultlines in the corporate governance literature, because unitary boards, where NEDs and EDs share board responsibility, exhibit pre-existing factions, similar to top management teams of family-controlled firms and teams managing international joint-ventures. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This research points to the importance of a careful selection process of directors by nomination committees. It also underlines the role for active leadership on boards, who should be aware of available strategies to ameliorate the negative consequences of board schisms, such as accentuating superordinate board identity and/ or informal meetings.

Corporate governance research indicates that corporate boards of directors may be overly beholden to management, which can be detrimental to firm value creation. Drawing upon agency theory and the governance law literature, we examine the effects of a new SEC rule designed to lessen managerial power by increasing large, long-term shareholders' influence in the director nomination process. We predict and find support for a positive overall market reaction to the rule's announcement as well as a greater reaction for firms with characteristics that suggest compromised board independence or greater CEO control. Moreover, we examine the implications of greater shareholder voice for another key stakeholder group, firm bondholders, and find evidence that it is also value increasing. We conclude by discussing important implications for theory and practice. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Directors may play their most important role during organizational crisis; however, extant research suggests that they are often more willing to exit than remain on the board of a firm facing a crisis. We develop theory regarding directors' voluntary exit by integrating insights from identity theories with the organizational crises literature. Specifically, we model how directors' individual, relational, and collective identities work sometimes in concert and other times in opposition to each other to influence directors' voluntary decisions to remain on or exit from a board facing an organizational crisis.

This study examines the impact of corporate boards on firm performance during the current financial crisis. Using buy-and-hold abnormal returns over the crisis to measure firm performance, we find that board independence, as traditionally defined, does not significantly affect firm performance. However, when we redefine independent directors as outside directors who are less connected with current CEOs, a measure we call strong independence, there is a positive and significant relationship between this measure and firm performance. Second, outside financial experts are important for firm performance. We find that the positive impact of outside financial experts on firm performance is more significant than that of strong independence. Overall, our results suggest that firm performance during a crisis is a function of firm-level differences in corporate boards. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The global financial crisis in 2008 has generated increasing recognition of the importance of board diversity reflected amidst the capabilities and skills of directors on a board. As the primary institutional mechanism designed to strengthen the director selection process, nomination committees (NCs) occupy centre stage of this discussion. However, there is a dearth of studies which focus either specifically on NCs or on diversity as a board composition outcome. In this study, we examine the research question of the likely antecedents in terms of NC characteristics of two board composition outcomes, i.e., diversity as variety in terms of gender and nationality, and diversity as separation in terms of a board demographic faultline. Research Findings/Insights: For a panel of FTSE350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find that the increasing presence on the NC of females or non-British nationals is likely to have a positive impact on the level of board gender and nationality diversity, respectively. In addition, we report that the presence of the chief executive officer (CEO) on the NC is found to interact with the NC independence, as a result of which a board demographic faultline is likely to emerge. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We bring together three concepts from social psychology research to create the theoretical basis for our study of the influence of NCs on board diversity: these are similarity-attraction, homosocial reproduction, and social identity. The strong empirical findings suggest that these socio-psychological dimensions are applicable to the operations of NCs, which has implications for the outcomes of the director nomination and selection process, and consequently also for board composition. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research indicates that NC characteristics are significant antecedents of board diversity, hence composition of the NC is an important step and pre-requisite for assembling a diverse board. For example, appointing females and/or non-nationals to the NC increases the likelihood of greater representation of females and/or non-nationals on the entire board. At the same time, our evidence suggests that the presence of the CEO amidst the majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) on the NC is detrimental for board cohesiveness.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether director interlocks enable or inhibit a firm's adoption of a proactive environmental strategy. Specifically, using resource dependence theory, we argue that director interlocks with suppliers are linked to varying likelihoods that a firm adopts a proactive environmental strategy, depending on the relation between the provided resources and the environmental approach. Research Findings/Insight: Based on a sample of US electric firms, our results show that director interlocks with firms providing knowledge-intensive business services are positively linked to the adoption of proactive environmental strategies. However, director interlocks with firms providing financial resources and fossil fuel are negatively related to the adoption of these strategies for our sample. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Board linkages may enable and inhibit proactive environmental strategies. We contribute to resource dependence theory by offering empirical evidence that the reduction of uncertainty about critical resources by director interlocks may either make business change easier or constrict a firm's autonomy, making change more difficult. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The influence of interlocking directors varies depending on the type of resources that director interlocks transfer to their organizations. As a result, the selection of specific director interlocks can become very important to the strategic goals of the firm. Regulators should continue to pay attention to potential risks for other stakeholders from director interlocks. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper investigates gender differences on the corporate boards of Finnish listed companies. The personal characteristics, careers, and boardroom roles of female and male directors on boards were analyzed on the basis of empirical data collected by questionnaire. An analysis of the findings revealed only minor differences between the women and men in personal characteristics such as their marital status, number of children and education, or in their careers. However, female board members were on average younger than their male counterparts and considered themselves to be more protean, took more active roles on the board, and enjoyed power more than men did. They also felt a need for more women on the board. The goal of this study is to contribute to the existing research in two ways. Firstly, it provides empirical evidence on women's representation on boards from Finland, where women's and men's rights are regarded as more equal than in many other countries. Secondly, the study aims to increase our knowledge of gender differences, careers and roles of women in top positions in Finnish business. (c) 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This article examines the important role of social resources in enhancing the effectiveness of nonprofit boards of directors, paying particular attention to the positive implications of social capital. Using data collected from a survey of 234 organizations operating in the Canadian nonprofit sector, we model the relationship between a three-factor model of social capital and a multidimensional measure of governance effectiveness. Our results demonstrate the positive contribution that social capital makes to the capacity to govern effectively. Findings of our study support the need for renewed attention to social and relational considerations inside the boardroom. (c) Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This article brings together research on philanthropy, family business, and governance to examine patterns of giving by U.S. family versus nonfamily independent foundations. The authors use a sample comprising the 200 largest U.S. independent foundations in 2007 to show that family foundations are more focused in their grantmaking than nonfamily foundations. Board size moderates this relationship. They also offer a new typology of family foundations to show that the generation stage of the family and the foundation board's composition are associated with different levels of grantmaking diversity in family foundations but in dissimilar ways. Scholarly and practical implications are discussed. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Most organizations focus their attention on simply achieving gender diversity on their boards. This approach misses the point. A complex relationship exists between board gender diversity and good governance whereby such diversity can have a negative, positive, or neutral impact on organizational performance, indicating that organizations may only reap the benefits of gender-diverse boards under proper conditions. This article examines which conditions allow gender-diverse boards to flourish and which conditions lead to failure. Organizations usually increase female representation on boards of directors to achieve one of two goals: gender parity or improved governance. Each of these goals is influenced by different circumstances and thus must be approached in a unique manner. Three recommendations are offered herein for organizations trying to achieve each goal. Gender, ethnic, and cultural board diversity all share related justifications and challenges, so organizations that follow the recommendations in this article will be well positioned to benefit from all three sources of increased diversity on their boards of directors.

In order to compete, firms must constantly gather and assess information that will help them identify and evaluate emerging opportunities. Their social context is instrumental in determining what information they have to work with and how they might make sense of and act upon that information. Unfortunately, many firms allow themselves to become under-connected, which isolates them from new sources of information, or over-reliant on just a few connections, creating a bottleneck for the flow of information. Herein, we describe how these problems manifest themselves among the network of interlocked directors, which is created when directors of firms sit on multiple boards. This network is so vast and complex that fully understanding the position and structure of a given firm's board interlocks remains elusive. Toward solving this problem, we offer five keys to developing a board with effective interlocks, as well as three cautions regarding how board interlocks could potentially hurt firms.

Owner-managers of private family businesses are vulnerable to escalation of commitment, which can lead to costly failure. In an effort to help private family businesses reduce such costs and contribute to the resource dependence literature, we extend prior research on escalation of commitment (Staw, 1981). Specifically, we develop a model that examines how outside board members influence the antecedents, and moderate the processes, that lead to escalation of commitment. Our work encourages the use of outside board members, insofar as they are likely to help the owner-managers of private family businesses to avoid escalation of commitment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the effect of new governmental regulations on corporate Boards of Directors (BODs). We have reviewed the literature pertaining to agency theory and resource dependency theory, both of which have been assumed to explain the actions of BODs. We examine the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory regarding both the structure and actions of BODs in times of governmental regulatory change. We then describe four historical events in which radical changes were required by certain governmental regulations, and discuss responses by BODs to each event, and present a discussion of these responses and how they adhere to or stray from the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory. We conclude the paper with recommendations for the direction of further study.

The fields of leadership and corporate governance e have, in their own rights, become the domains of significant interest recently for academics and business practitioners alike. While they often focus on similar phenomena, they rarely interact or engage with each other. In this chapter we argue that there is much to be gained by integrating and cross-fertilizing research efforts within the corporate governance and leadership research fields. Their strengths and weaknesses mutually complement each other: leadership has been traditionally strong in highlighting significant interpersonal dynamic processes within organizations but has been biased by its attention to the middle and lower ranks of the organization. Corporate governance, on the other hand, has developed an upper echelons perspective but have been hamstrung by a preoccupation with formal, static and impersonal theoretical models. We therefore suggest that there is much to be gained by creating a theoretical rapprochement between the two fields which will have positive repercussions not only in terms of fresh empirical insights but also in terms of improving and energizing the everyday practice of corporate governance. By way of example, we highlight three important intersections at which governance and leadership processes can come together in any organization: team leadership on the board, the chair's leadership of the board and strategic leadership by the board. We conclude by raising a number of research questions that can be profitably researched by taking both a 'leadership in governance' and a 'governance in leadership' perspective.

Existing research on a board-of-director-sustainability performance relationship have largely examined inside directors, outside directors, and gender diversity-yet empirical results have yet to offer any definitive answers. I posit that this previous research lacks a thorough examination of the role of boards and the means and mechanisms by which they influence performance. Drawing on the board capital perspective and the role of boards, this paper develops a model that highlights the influence of board capital on the future sustainability performance of firms. The model takes into account specific types of human and social capital of outside directors which have previously been unexamined. Beyond the board capital perspective, an argument is put forth that values are largely neglected in the examination of boards of directors, but are necessary in the study of sustainability because of its normative implications. I therefore account for the value attunement concept as a moderating variable in the model The paper draws on corporate governance and business ethics' literature to generate propositions and offer original insight into the drivers of sustainability performance in organizations.

Over the last ten years, the corporate governance context in most Western countries has changed as a result of irregularities, increased regulation, heightened societal expectations and shareholder activism. This paper examines the impact of the changing context on the role of chairmen of supervisory boards in the Netherlands. Based on a combination of thirty semi-structured interviews with board members of leading Dutch corporations and secondary data on the position of supervisory board chairmen at the top-100 listed firms in the Netherlands, the study reveals that board chairmen have become increasingly involved in both their control and service roles. While the demographics (i. e., age, tenure, gender and nationality) of chairmen have hardly changed over the last decade, chairmen are spending considerably more time on boards and committees, have reduced the number of board interlocks and have become more active on the forefront of the corporate governance discussion. The paper highlights several implications for scholars and practitioners. (c) 2010 The Author(s).

This study researches the influences of CEO compensation on firm behavior to examine the interactive relationship between the behavioral momentum of innovation in R&D and CEO compensation. The models presented in this study are based on evolutionary, institutional, and agency theories to test hypotheses using data from 107 companies in the high-technology sectors in the United States. The results indicate that the pre-succession innovative behavior of these high-technology firms on R&D can positively affect these firms' post-succession innovative behavior towards R&D. That is, positive momentum in R&D innovation prevails in a firm across a change of the CEO. However, for the role of CEO compensation, short- and long-term compensation does not positively moderate this behavioral momentum in R&D. Hence, the moderating impact of short- and long-term CEO compensation to enhance the momentum of innovation in R&D can be romanticized. These findings provide boards of directors with evidence as to how a CEO succession matters to a firm's behavioral momentum in R&D, and whether CEO compensation can be strategized to change a firm's innovation and momentous behavior.

Purpose: There is no previous systematic and theoretical investigation of the interim CEO succession practice. This research attempts to fill the gap by studying this phenomenon and hence advance executive succession research/practice. Design/methodology/approach: Based on agency theory, the authors propose a model and several propositions to predict what determines the origin of interim CEOs, the length of the interim tenure, and the career prospects for the interim CEO after the interim tenure. Findings: Both firm performance and environmental uncertainty play an important role in the dynamic interim CEO succession process. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides the foundations for future empirical research on interim CEO succession. Practical implications: Board members at companies experiencing sudden CEO departures should choose a loyal non-aggressive veteran to be the interim CEO so as to minimize disruption and to smooth the transition. They should use caution when choosing an internal candidate because if such a candidate is not chosen to be the permanent CEO later, a talent may be lost. Originality/value: The research is the first to systematically examine the phenomenon of interim CEOs. The authors make a unique contribution to the literature on CEO succession.

Triggered by highly publicised corporate scandals, changing societal expectations and the collapse of financial markets, the roles of boards of directors have changed significantly in safeguarding the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders. Yet, relatively little is known about contemporary challenges non-executive directors face and whether their boards are well-equipped for their new tasks. Based on self-assessment reports by supervisory boards, a survey and interviews with supervisory board members, this paper investigates the challenges non-executive directors face in the Netherlands, particularly after a decade of corporate governance reform. Non-executive directors' inadequate role in scrutinising executive directors' performance, information asymmetries and dysfunctional working relationships between executive and non-executive directors are among the greatest challenges indicated by non-executive directors on Dutch supervisory boards. The paper discusses several implications for scholars and practitioners and provides a unique insight in boardroom dynamics. Copyright (c) 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study explored the role of strategic leadership in declining firms by empirically examining CEOs' founder status and extensiveness of external board of director appointments as predictors of the likelihood of successful turnaround. The authors used the resource dependence and board interlock literatures to develop their hypotheses. Their analysis of data collected from a matched pair of 82 turnaround and bankrupt U.S. firms indicate that the extensiveness of CEOs' external board appointments significantly increase the likelihood of turnaround. Contrary to the authors' prediction, there was no significant relationship between founder status and likelihood of turnaround. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Boards have become increasingly independent, to the point where some firms have removed all of the insiders except for the CEO. The authors call this phenomenon a "lone-insider board" and submit that it constitutes a fundamentally distinct governance arrangement worthy of inquiry. This paper describes institutional pressures that give rise to increasing reliance on loneinsider boards, and investigates likely outcomes. According to agency theory, the greater the proportion of independent directors, the more effective boards are in monitoring CEOs. The authors submit, however, that a lone-insider board creates a fundamental shift in board effectiveness due to a loss of mutual monitoring and an increase in information asymmetry. Mutual monitoring occurs when members of the top management team actively monitor the CEO. Information asymmetry refers to the disparity in knowledge between the CEO and the board of directors. The authors propose that reduced mutual monitoring causes increased information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and increases rather than decreases CEO power. The authors hope this article will stimulate fruitful inquiry in the area of lone-insider boards.

This study explains the inconsistent findings of previous research on board management by examining the direct and interaction effects of board independence and the top management team's external ties on firm performance. The results obtained using a multiyear sample of firms indicate that outsider-rich boards improved firm performance when they worked with top managers imported from outside the focal industry. On the other hand, a high proportion of outsiders on the board and top managers imported from the focal industry were not a desirable combination for firm performance. The findings imply that researchers and practitioners should pay more attention to identifying the conditions under which board competence aligns with top management. (c) eContent Management Pty Ltd.

Representation of women on boards is getting more and more attention these recent years (Hillman, Shropshire, & Cannella, 2007; Nielsen & Huse, 2010), all the more as recent influence by the legislator accelerates the pace of change. Indeed, in France, a new law adopted in January 2011 stated that the proportion of female directors should not be lower than 40% in all major companies. Most previous research focused on the impact of the presence of women in boards on performance, but there are few studies on female directors' networks. In order to help to better understand the ties at the origin of these networks, we study several characteristics and network ties of female directors of French companies belonging to the SBF 120 index and we compare them with male characteristics. We test the specificity of four types of board of directors' networks: attendance at the same elite educational institutions, use of business networks, civil servants' networks, and interlocking directorates.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

Social activists and government agencies seek greater diversity on corporate boards without any considerations of firm or governance characteristics. Using a comprehensive dataset on over 8000 firms from 1996 through 2005, we explore the potential determinants of socially homogeneous boards based on the advisory and monitoring needs of a firm. We find that director-homogeneity is associated with lower advertising intensity, lower R&D intensity but greater firm risk. Director-homogeneity is also positively associated with measures of CEO influence such as CEO ownership, CEO tenure, non-independence of nominating committee and director ownership. Overall, the empirical evidence implies that firms choose social diversity on the board of directors based on the economic needs and existing governance structures. (c) 2018, SAGE Publications Ltd.

This study investigates variables that influence director compensation of listed Taiwanese companies using the new disclosure rule for director compensation. We divided the compensation from its structure into three types: non-incentive compensation, incentive compensation, and total compensation. This study collected the research samples of companies listed in Taiwan Stock Exchange from 2005 until 2007. Using multiple regression analysis, we investigated the variables, which influenced the director compensation. Our results show that the amount of director compensation is influenced by the relative performance of the industry. These companies considered performance level of competitors or the whole industry. The monitoring effect of inside directors can reduce agency conflicts. The company will lower the levels of director compensation to avoid the inefficiency of its directors. It should also be noted that the outside monitoring effect and director compensation are complementary to each other in governing the company and the board of directors. If the active institutional investors of a company have a high percentage of ownership, the levels of director compensation would be relatively high. When the company has a high level of future growth, then the shareholders will encourage directors to monitor the company vigorously and contribute to future developments of the company by an increased director compensation.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the orientation of a firm's governance choices along a continuum of shareholder voice to managerial power and tests whether the governance orientation of a firm can survive regulation. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of 873 firms, a set of three index measures is constructed reflecting the orientation of a firm's governing rules, the orientation of the board of directors and the overall orientation of both types of governance structures. The resulting measures are compared pre- and post-SOX. Findings - While specific, individual governance components, such as independence, can be regulated, the overall orientation of a firm's governance mechanisms, as manifested by its aggregate choice of governance structures, appears to be constant overtime suggesting that it is difficult to regulate the governance orientation of a firm. Research limitations/implications - The findings may be limited due to sample bias. There is both survivor bias and listing bias in the sample. To be included in the sample, firms needed to be publicly listed from 1998 through 2006 and needed to be listed on a major S&P index for each of those years. Practical implications - The paper highlights ways in which companies circumvent the intention of regulations such as SOX. The paper therefore has implications for regulators and shareholders. Originality/value - While the index method has been used before it has not been used to compare the impact of regulation on governance orientation. That makes this paper of value to regulators when considering the cost and benefit of regulations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Our work provides an analysis of the interaction effects between internal governance mechanisms on the components of initial returns during the listing period. The application of multivariate regressions on a sample of 110 IPO French companies during 2005-2010, has allowed us to conclude that the different interactions between these mechanisms significantly influence the level of under / overpricing. Indeed, the positive relationship between internal governance mechanisms and overpricing reflects a substitutability relationship. In contrast, the complementarity effect comes from the negative relationship characterizing the combination of governance mechanisms and the underpricing. Thus, the interactions effects between institutional ownership, board structure and under / overpricing are not conforming to the existence of a complementarity or substitutability relationship between these variables given the absence of a significant combination between these variables.

This research deals with the review of researches on strategic decision making and the factors that has contributed to its growth and how it has affected the organisational performance. This study is focused on five major themes; decision making environment; comprehensiveness and speed/timing; Top Management Team (TMT), Chief Executive Officers (CEO's) and Board of Directors (BOD's); communication, information system and decentralised strategy and culture, hierarchical decentralisation and power distance, lateral communication and individualism, formahsation and uncertainty avoidance. It has been established that all these factors will lead to high organisational performance even in a turbulent business environment. The methodological approach of the reviewed researches is based on survey method with the use of questionnaire that makes the studies to be empirical in nature. (c) Medwell journals, 2012.

Board composition is a critical element in the ability of the board to impact firm outcomes. While much of this research has focused on size and independence, there is growing literature that investigates the composition of directors' demography, human capital, and social capital. The purpose of this article is to synthesize this diverse literature. The authors first review the literature on board demographics, human capital, and social capital composition research. In doing so, they highlight the theoretical and methodological approaches utilized. Finally, they suggest avenues for future research that can advance our understanding of the effects of board composition. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Firms with central boards of directors earn superior risk-adjusted stock returns. A long (short) position in the most (least) central firms earns average annual returns of 4.68%. Firms with central boards also experience higher future return-on-assets growth and more positive analyst forecast errors. Return prediction, return-on-assets growth, and analyst errors are concentrated among high growth opportunity firms or firms confronting adverse circumstances, consistent with boardroom connections mattering most for firms standing to benefit most from information and resources exchanged through boardroom networks. Overall, our results suggest that director networks provide economic benefits that are not immediately reflected in stock prices. (c) 2013.

In this article, we examine the factors determining the representation of women on boards of directors by considering three main questions. The first question deals with the relationship between characteristics of ownership and governance on one side, and female directorship on the other. The second major question concerns the demographic attributes of women directors, such as nationality, foreign experience, educational level, business expertise, and connections to external sources. The third important question refers to women in senior positions on French boards (e.g., as independent members or board subcommittee members) in relation to firm characteristics and women's demographic attributes. Our study focuses on French large- and mid-capitalized companies belonging to the SBF120 stock market index during a 5-year period running from 2000 to 2004. First, our results give evidence that the appointment of women directors is strongly related to family ownership and board or firm size. Second, the appointment of women directors is related to their professional services, valuable skills, and network links. Furthermore, we show that women face a double glass-ceiling problem, and note that French firms rely more on the demographic attributes of their women directors when they are appointed to senior board positions. Our study sheds light on issues concerning the law that comes into force in 2016, which imposes quotas of women members on boards of directors in French companies.

This study investigates the joint effect of corporate ownership and board of directors' diversity configurations on the success of strategic merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions. Board diversity is defined as the extent to which its demographic diversity as measured by the culture, nationality, gender and experience of its directors complements its statutory diversity. A theoretical framework linking ownership, board diversity and M&A strategic decision making is proposed and tested. Based on a sample of 289 M&A decisions undertaken by Canadian firms over the period 2000-2007, demographic diversity is found to have a clear and non-linear effect on M&A performance while statutory diversity is of limited influence. Ownership is found to influence the effect of diversity, making the relation finer and more precise. This has practical implications. First, statutory diversity is not sufficient for well-performing boards. Also, ownership is an important factor. The most advocated board diversity aimed at insuring the board's independence is not valid across all ownership configurations. From a public policy perspective, results provide support for the principles-based approach in governance. Governance regimes should encourage the search for a balance between board diversity and the need for cohesion that best serves the firm's purpose and obligations. (c) 2011 The Author(s).

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We explore how the combinations of firm-level corporate governance (CG) practices embedded in different national governance systems lead to high firm performance. Research Findings/Insights: Using fuzzy set/qualitative comparative analysis, we uncover a variety of findings. First, we show that within each of the stylized national CG models, there are multiple bundles of firm-level governance practices leading to high firm performance (i.e., equifinality). Second, we provide evidence of complementarity as well as functional equivalence between CG practices. Finally, we demonstrate that there can be heterogeneity ("differences in kind") in firm governance practices within each stylized model of CG. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We build on the configurational and complementarity-based approaches to make the following theoretical claims. First, governance practices within firm bundles do not always relate to each other in a monotonic and cumulative fashion as this entails higher costs and possibly over-governance. Second, practices in bundles do not need to be aligned toward the insider or the outsider model ("similar in kind"). We argue that non-aligned practices can also be complementary, creating hybrid governance forms. Third, we predict functional equivalence across bundles of CG practices which grants firms agency on which of the practices to implement in order to achieve high performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We contribute to comparative CG research by demonstrating that there are multiple governance paths leading to high firm performance, and that these practices do not always belong to the same national governance tradition. Therefore, our findings alert of the perils of "one size fits all" governance solutions when designing and implementing CG policies. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: The article is concerned with the prevalence, character, and development of qualitative research within the field of corporate governance. The paper provides an overview of published qualitative research in the field of corporate governance based on a structured literature search of papers published in scholarly peer-reviewed journals between 1986 and 2011. Research Findings/Insights: A fine-grained search based on key words resulted in a sample of 78 qualitative corporate governance studies. A review and content analysis of these studies show that qualitative studies in governance have grown in number since the 1990s, but remain a small fraction of the published work on corporate governance. Studies are mostly developed by UK and European scholars, published in European journals and tend to explore boards of directors more than other governance related actors and mechanisms. These studies utilize a range of disciplines, predominantly management, adopting a wide range of methods, the most prevalent being that of the interview, often in combination with other methods to get a better account of the empirical phenomenon. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The search reveals an eclectic range of theories, spanning several disciplines, which is serving to generate, elaborate, and refine theorizing about corporate governance and the associated meanings, mechanisms, processes and relationships. There is much scope and need for more qualitative studies of significant rigor and relevance which explore the array of interactions and processes involved in corporate governance, across different levels of analysis and contexts. Practitioner/Policy Implications: After over two decades of research and reform of corporate governance, problems of practice remain, and corporate governance prescription via codes and other forms of regulation is increasing in search of better governance. Qualitative research can assist policy-makers and practitioners to develop more efficient governance mechanisms, by shedding light on the efficacy of policy prescription. Qualitative research provides a basis for rethinking and challenging some of the dominant assumptions and meanings about how governance actors and institutions actually function.

This paper explores the phenomenon of positive organizational deviance from institutional norms by establishing practices that protect or enhance the natural environment. Seeking to explain why some organizations practice positive environmental deviance while others do not, we locate our inquiry on the board of directors-the organizational body that interprets external issues and guides organizational response. We find a strong correlation between positive deviance and the past environmental experience of board directors and the centrality of the organization within field-level networks. Organizations located on the periphery of the network or whose boards possess a high level of environmental experience are more likely to deviate in positive ways. Our conclusions contribute to multiple literatures in behavioral and environmental governance, the role of filtering and enaction in the process of institutional conformity and change, and the mechanisms behind proactive environmental protection strategies within business.

This study investigates how a fundamental group decision-making bias referred to as group polarization can influence boards' acquisition premium decisions. The theory suggests that when prior premium experience would lead directors on average to support a relatively high premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even higher after discussions; but when directors' prior premium experience would lead them on average to support a relatively low premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even lower after discussions. Results provided strong support for the theory. Moreover, group polarization was reduced by demographic homogeneity among directors and by minority expertise but increased by board influence. This study introduces a fundamental group decision-making bias into governance research and explains how group processes can influence network diffusions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

When academic researchers, business commentators, and boards of directors have debated the merits of hiring new CEOs from outside the firm, the implicit or explicit assumption typically made is that outsider CEOs will provide an advantage in achieving strategic change. In this study, we challenge this assumption by employing a duality perspective on stability/change, and we provide an original conceptual framework to posit that it is the presence of corporate stability (ordinary succession, a long-tenured predecessor CEO, and good firm performance) that allows outsider CEOs to generate a greater degree of post-succession strategic change. We use extensive longitudinal data from US airline and chemical industries between 1972 and 2010 to test our hypotheses, and we discuss how our supportive findings challenge long-standing assumptions regarding the outsider succession-strategic change relationship, and we advocate embracing the non-intiutive notion that stable (unstable) conditions can be enablers (barriers) of strategic change for outsider CEOs.

Research Question/Issue: This research examines the relationship between board processes and corporate financial risk. Using a unique questionnaire survey about board behavior, several measures related to board processes are developed and used to explain certain aspects of financial risk during the recent crisis. Research Findings/Insights: In a sample of 141 companies with complete data collected from company chairs on both board structure and process, board process is found to be an important determinant of financial risk during the crisis of 2008-2009. In particular, financial risk is lower where non-executive directors have high effort norms and where board decision processes are characterized by a degree of cognitive conflict. The impact of cognitive conflict is, however, found to be less pronounced in boards with high levels of cohesiveness. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The study provides theoretical and empirical advancement of the governance literature towards an understanding of group process-oriented views of boards' work and effectiveness. This study identifies the significance of board processes and their impact on financial risk supported by quantitative empirics. Findings of a strong relationship between board process and financial risk augment existing theories to suggest that the effects of boards work through group processes that bring executives and non-executives together in relations laced with control and collaboration. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulators, acting post the financial crisis have produced governance codes that emphasize risk management as a key responsibility of boards. The link between board process and financial risk established in this paper provides evidence for company chairs and other directors on the possibilities and potential effectiveness of boards in discharging this responsibility.

Board diversity is important especially in countries which practice a one-tier board system, such as Malaysia. Under the system, board appointments are usually controlled by the firm's substantial shareholders, and as a result, directors are chosen based on "the old-boy" network or "people like us", who are typically middle-aged males and from similar ethnicity which could lead to "group think". Board diversity ensures breadth and depth of the board's judgments. To this end, this study examines board diversity of the top 100 non-financial Malaysian firms, specifically directors' gender, ethnicity and age and their effects on firm performance. Data are collected from the 2007 annual reports of the sample firms. The evidence indicates the lack of diversity of the Malaysian boards of directors. Results from the multivariate analyses reveal that gender diversity is negatively associated with Tobin's q and ROA. Age diversity is found to be negatively related to ROA. Ethnic diversity, on the other hand, is found to be positively associated with ROA. Hence, findings on the effect of board diversity and firm performance are mixed. Nevertheless, this study offers insights to policy makers in enhancing corporate governance in Malaysia where diversity is one of the areas that could strengthen the effectiveness of the board.

Much of the scholarship on boards of directors has examined either the control (i.e., monitoring) role or the resource dependence role that boards fill. Relatively little has examined the service role, wherein directors provide advice and guidance to management. This study builds on recent work exploring director expertise by asking how operational expertise on boards impacts firm performance. We find that having external COO/presidents on a board of directors positively impacts firm performance when the firm's operational efficiency is declining, but negatively impacts performance when the firm's operational efficiency is improving. We also find that other types of external executives serving as directors exhibit the opposite relationship, suggesting that the value of director expertise is context-dependent. We discuss the implications of these findings for director selection. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A focus on preserving socioemotional wealth may influence entrepreneurial activities in family firms. In this paper, we identify the emotion of empathy in the family CEO as an antecedent of socioemotional wealth creation. We argue that the presence of one or more external directors can have a direct as well as moderating influence on the relationship between CEO's empathy and the salience of socioemotional wealth to the family CEO. Our empirical tests confirm these hypotheses. Several areas of future research are suggested to incorporate empathy and other emotions in family business studies.

A significant amount of research has examined firms' decisions to adopt poison pills; however, firms today are increasingly repealing or allowing poison pills to expire. Based on agency theory, the authors examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than substitutes. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: Given its position as a dominant logic in corporate governance, this paper evaluates the theoretical and practical implications of agency theory on good governance. Agency theory is presented as consisting of two layers, one resting on the assumption of oppositional shareholder-manager interests and the other resting on the assumption of supportive shareholder-society interests. Given the dominance of the simple economic depiction of agency theory, its first layer is heavily researched and supported, while the second layer is largely unsubstantiated and often exploited to obscure inefficiencies in the first layer. Research Findings/Insights: Agency theory is shown to fill a highly institutionalized position in governance, despite often violating the second layer's assumption of aligned shareholder-society interests. We assert that the relationship between societal benefits and value maximization must be reconceptualized from interdependent to correlated but independent. Otherwise, when the second layer of agency theory is undercut, shareholders can eschew their role as societal guardians to partner with managers and engage in mutual managerialism at the expense of society. We detail how inefficiencies in first layer mechanisms (market regulation, monitoring, and contracts) impact agency theory's second layer and present the new mechanisms of oversight boards and expanded founding firm documents to reintegrate a societal orientation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Aligned shareholder-society interests are shown to be frequently undermined, artificially substantiating the second layer assumption that societal betterment can be sufficiently promoted via financial rewards and sanctions. We discuss agency theory's underlying logic and present the possibility that a violated second layer can be exploited to obscure first layer inefficiencies. Ineffectiveness in the first layer's key mechanisms is shown to potentially undercut agency theory's promotion of good corporate governance on an organizational and societal level. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Oversight boards and expanded founding firm documents are presented to make agency theory's second layer explicit, ensuring the assumed supportive nature of the shareholder-society relationship is substantiated. Specifically, oversight boards formalize how members of boards of directors are vetted, oversee societal claims to ensure that appropriate ones are sufficiently presented and addressed, supervise reporting, and sanction firms who fail to enact these duties. Revised founding documents ensure that both economic and social goals are enshrined in the mission of incorporated firms. Together the two help establish the foundation of a measurable approach to socially responsible actions. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This study investigated how female directors of corporate boards of directors (BoD) experience boardroom dynamics. The study represents an initial research trend that moves from a unilateral focus on financial outcomes of female representation in BoDs toward stronger attention on the social dynamics in the boardroom. Drawing on social identity theory, the study proposed that female directors often constitute an out-group within the BoD, preventing them from experiencing positive board dynamics. More specifically, the study explored the extent to which female directors do experience less justice, lower cohesion, and higher levels of conflicts within the BoD than their male counterparts do. Moreover, we assumed that female directors with nontraditional educational backgrounds would be particularly likely to experience negative boardroom dynamics whereas female chairpersons of BoDs would perceive boardroom dynamics more positively than other female directors. The sample consisted of 491 directors from 149 BoDs. Our findings revealed that there were generally few differences in the way female and male directors experienced boardroom dynamics and female chairpersons of BoDs did not perceive the dynamics differently than other female directors. Female directors with nontraditional educational backgrounds perceived the boardroom dynamics somewhat more negatively than other female directors, but the differences were not statistically significant. The conclusions from this study are that there are reasons to believe that female directors are welcomed into boardrooms, not perceived as out-groups, and BoDs are able to benefit from the female directors' experience and skills.

This study draws from the corporate governance literature to investigate the implications of board involvement for international joint ventures (IJVs). We extend recent corporate governance research on the value of board involvement by investigating unique sources of complexity related to the nature of the IJV. We argue and find that board involvement can enhance the performance of IJVs, particularly for collaborations that are complex in nature due to their broad functional scope as well the level of market overlap between IJV parents. We complement recent research on joint venture control that has focused on the antecedents and types of control, as well as studies on formal (e.g. contractual safeguards and monitoring) and informal governance mechanisms (e.g. trust) by providing empirical evidence that IJV board involvement is valuable when directors undertake their control and coordination responsibilities. We advance corporate governance research by providing evidence that joint ventures possess several unique characteristics that shape the value of board involvement, thereby showing that applications of corporate governance theory to joint ventures are useful, but should be made with care.

We adopt a construct validity lens to provide a critical reexamination of established corporate governance research. In particular, we focus on the body of work relying on the theoretical bases of agency theory and involving boards of directors' independence, CEO duality, equity holdings, and their relationships to corporate financial performance. We offer a five-step protocol involving the following components: (1) establishing the base rate for the phenomenon in question, (2) evaluating the extent to which the dependent variables are germane, (3) evaluating the extent to which the independent variables are germane, (4) determining whether explanatory power is improved as a consequence of improved measurement, and (5) concluding whether previously established estimates should be revised. We implemented the proposed protocol and used alternative measures that reduce threats to construct validity. Results yielded substantially higher estimates of relationships in corporate governance research. Future research can adopt the proposed protocol to understand whether a similar improvement in explanatory power could be achieved in other research domains. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

The paper discusses the ownership and control structures of local public utilities by showing evidence from the Italian case. In this discussion, the focus is on three main aspects: the ownership structure, the board composition and independence, and citizens' involvement (service charters). The main results from this study reveal that there are controversial aspects, which need further investigation. The existence of a principal-principal conflict is clearly arising from an in-depth analysis of the ownership structures. In addition, the board of directors, because of the lack of actual independence, does not seem to be a useful arena to manage and solve these conflicts. Other governance mechanisms are thus needed, to increase accountability to citizens. Within this, service charters seem to be a useful tool to protect the "public interest". However, service charters content analysis suggests that further implementation actions are due. The paper contributes to the debate on conflicts of interests and governance mechanisms in local public utilities suggesting possible developments of agency theory and discussing implications for further research.

Since the beginnings of the global debate over corporate governance in the early 1990s, academics, practitioners and policymakers have focused on changing boards of directors to improve corporate governance. The financial crisis of 2007-09 arose despite two decades of codification of corporation governance, a process that continues in the light of concern about corporate performance and accountability: codes have not eliminated the problems they set out to address. Analysing the three main versions of the UK code of corporate governance, we see a shifting discourse of 'structures' in Cadbury to 'independence' under the reforms in 2003, and then in the 2010 iteration towards 'behaviour', as the code seeks to improve boards as mechanisms of corporate governance. The evolution in the language and recommendations of the code reveals growing understanding both of the practical challenge of board effectiveness and of the limitations to codification.

We propose that CEO compensation and tenure moderate the relationship between multinational corporations' (MNCs) R&D intensities and their percentages of equity ownership in international joint ventures (IJVs). Transaction cost economics (TCE) suggests a positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, but this relationship has not been confirmed consistently in prior research. We examine the moderating effects of CEO compensation and tenure on the relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, thereby bringing more nuanced explanations from agency theory and upper echelons theory into the discussion. Our proposed relationships were tested using a sample of 202 IJVs formed between U.S. MNCs and foreign partners in high-tech industries for the period 1993 to 2003. We found an overall positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and the percentage of equity ownership in IJVs. Moreover, CEO tenure and bonus compensation each weaken the positive R&D intensity-equity ownership relationship in our sample, while CEO stock options compensation amplifies it. These findings indicate that CEO compensation and tenure influence decision making about equity ownership in IJVs, suggesting that scholars and boards of directors should consider these CEO-related factors when evaluating strategic decisions regarding IJVs.

In this paper we develop and test a theoretical model that reduces relational risks to solve the puzzle of conflicting task requirements imposed on boards of directors in listed companies. Doing so unites two seemingly conflicting tasks-board control and service tasks-through examining relational risks between the board and the CEO. We also present two mechanisms that could reduce relational risks. One is board power over the CEO, and the other board trust in the CEO. Practitioners could apply these two mechanisms to achieve better performance of board control and service tasks simultaneously. We test hypotheses using 441 survey responses collected in 2005. The result shows a good fit between the model and survey data, indicating examining relational risks is a rewarding approach to understanding conflicting board task performance, and board control over the CEO and board trust in the CEO are two effective mechanisms to reduce relational risks.

This paper examines the impact of board governance mechanisms, namely board size, independence ratio, opacity of earnings disclosure, and ratio of genuinely independent nonexecutive directors to total board size on director remuneration, executive tenure and likelihood of individual executive salary disclosure in a unique and comprehensive sample of 69 North African IPO firms. I find evidence of the enhanced governance role of true independent nonexecutives in family as opposed to non-family firms in improving disclosure of individual salaries and moderating lengths of executive tenure. However while their role is only significant in the context of family firms the evidence suggests that their presence is associated with higher levels of remuneration. The evidence also ascribes a greater role for business angel as opposed to more formal private equity financing which is more applicable within the highly social networked economy of the Maghreb region.

Recent developments in corporate governance have put the board chair into the spotlight. The importance of positive leadership as a determinant for board effectiveness is well recognized. However, empirical research on board leadership is rather limited except for those studies that focus the attention on the benefits of combining or separating the roles of CEO and chair. This study addresses the critical issue of the pivotal role that a chairperson plays in transforming a board into an effective decision-making group. The article argues that a chairperson faces unique challenges as a leader. We then introduce the Decision-Making Grid as an analytical framework to get insights into the decision-making style of the chair. By means of a qualitative interview research technique, the study explores perspectives on board chair leadership for a sample of Belgian listed companies. The results point to three major issues. First, although the model of eye-to-eye decision making is considered to be the most effective one, board leadership is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in practice. Moreover, it appears to be related to the chair's personality and appeals to his personal competencies. Second, the study reveals that the chair needs to be a relational leader and that a clear delineation of his role is not an otiose luxury. Finally, the study calls for a more pluralistic theoretical lens, tapping insights from other research disciplines, to explain the nature and behaviour of board chairmanship. From our findings, we point out implications for practice. In particular, we plea for development opportunities, more attention for a well-defined selection process as well as for a periodical assessment of the board chair. (c) 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

This paper contrasts firm-level as opposed to state-level governance on directors self-rewarding behaviour in West Africa. Director self-reward or compensation is measured through fixed base salary as well as total remuneration which provides a conservative estimate of the full private benefits of control of directors. Using a unique hand-collected sample of 56 IPO firms from across West Africa from 2000 to 2012, I find that larger board sizes have less effective governance mechanisms while enhanced expropriation of private benefits of control is closely associated with lower government promotion of private sector policies, media and analyst freedom and corruption control.

Using a large sample analysis of Thai listed firms, we address an important question. Do board diversity and network add value to firms? This article extends the debate on the benefits and costs of board diversity and network and their effect on the broader picture of corporate governance. The sample period straddles 2001 to 2005, which allows us to examine board characteristics in response to the Asian financial crisis. We find that diversity in age and study majors are positively related to Tobin's Q ratio, while diversity in educational levels leads to lower firm value. Our results suggest that boards with diverse age groups and study areas might generate useful advice and complement each other; however, those with diverse educational levels might create costs due to possible conflicts and a lack of coordination and communication. In addition, the results show that alumni networks have a positive effect on Tobin's Q ratio. The findings further suggest that board networks could bring benefits to firms. An alumni network is significant to firms because it could help firms obtain external resources. It also provides significant findings for policy makers to design best practices of directors in emerging countries. (c) author(s) Creative Commons License CC-BY.

The purpose of this paper is to explore and verify roles of boards as bundle of tasks in the context of SMEs in a small country. This is a descriptive study based on the perceptions of CEOs. The objective was to find empirical evidence for what boards in small and medium sized companies perceive they do in terms of tasks and roles. A survey was sent out to 560 SMEs in Iceland and the response rate was 21%. Factor analysis shows that three different roles can be measured in SMEs: Monitoring role, Strategic role and Resource and Advice role. The results of this research show that boards in SMEs can and do have more than one role and are more active in strategy than often is assumed. (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study focuses on the impact of institutional quality on the amount of disclosure in IPO firms listing prospectuses using the six well established World Bank Governance indices, namely corruption control, government effectiveness in promotion of private sector development, political stability and absence from terrorism, regulatory quality, rule of law and lastly democratic voice and accountability. Using a unique hand-collected sample of 165 IPO firms from across Africa from 2000 to 2011 I find evidence that enhanced rule of law and regulatory quality impact on the amount of disclosure by firms, reflected in length of IPO listings prospectuses. In addition I find evidence that founder-led entrepreneurial firms are more likely to disclose more alongside firms in extractive and technology industries that rely on local stock exchanges as a source of external finance. In contrast IPO firms that have significant long term foreign partners or are subsidiaries of foreign Multinational Enterprises are likely to disclose less than other types of firm underscoring their apathy to domestic investors and relative lack of dependence on indigenous stock markets as a viable source of external finance.

This paper studies the differential impact on IPO firm listing prospectus length from increasing proportions of foreign directors from civil as opposed to common law societies and social elites. Using a unique hand-collected and comprehensive sample of 165 IPO firms from across 18 African countries the evidence suggests that increasing proportions of directors from civil code law countries is associated with shorter prospectuses while the opposite is true for their common law counterparts. Furthermore increasing proportions of directors drawn from elevated social positions in indigenous society is related to increasing prospectus length in North Africa while being insignificant in SSA.

This paper undertakes a unique study of the determinants of corporate governance in the West African developing region and their impact on director compensation. A new measure of director total remuneration is constructed providing a conservative estimate of expropriation of private benefits of control. Using a hand-collected sample of 51 West African IPO firms from 2000 to 2011 we find evidence that increased presence of true independent nonexecutives that are unconnected to CEO or dominant insider groups within firm and nominally independent board level committees are highly associated with expropriation inferring that firm's with directors engaging in this behaviour are more likely to adopt measures indicative of governance best practice.

The interlocking board directorships among corporations. as well as between corporations and social organizations, is important for defining the modern political economy. This article finds the networks of those interlocks for Koch Industries Inc. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation. Moreover, the article extends the networks to describe and analyze the accompanying political network of contributions to Nebraska political campaigns. For corporate and social networks, we utilize conventional theoretical structures to find the new database of those networks for Koch Industries and TD Ameritrade. The new theoretical structure and database concern the campaign contributions of the board of directors in the corporate and social networks, as we trace them to campaigns for federal offices. The new political campaign finance structure we uncover here includes thousands of interconnected campaign finance conduits, through which money flows to political campaigns.

In this study, we investigated the impact of academicians as board members on firm outcomes. Based on popular theories of corporate governance, we contend that firms with academicians as directors would have more vigilance on their boards, would perform better based on accounting measures, and would be perceived as more valuable based on a market measure. Using a matched-pair design, our results showed that firms with academician directors do not have more vigilance on their boards and do not differ based on their accounting performance. However, they are perceived to be more valuable, which signifies the possible positive impact of academicians on one of the organizational outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (c) The Authors 2013.

For organizations in high-technology industries, knowledge is a critical resource that can be accessed through inter-organizational networks. However, for industries characterized by a heterogeneous set of actors, little is known about how different networks within the industry interact. Therefore, our research question is: How similar are the strategic network and the innovation network in the biotechnology industry? To answer our research question, we study two networks of interest. First, the Board-of-Directors-network serves as a proxy for the strategic network that fosters knowledge transfer between organizations. Second, we analyze the innovation network by using the patent network that emerged from collaborative innovation activities. Subject of analysis is the Flanders biotechnology industry, which is characterized by strong performing research institutions, large firms and innovative SMEs. We use social network analysis methods to measure the similarity of both networks and to identify their key actors. We find that a connection between two organizations in the strategic network increases the probability of forming a new connection between the same organizations in the innovation network, or vice versa.

This study proposes a new determinant of executive pay dispersion by integrating two distinct mechanisms: inter-firm diffusion and intra-firm adaptation. Based on institutional theory (diffusion) and group development framework (adaptation), we assess the similarity between the pay dispersion change at executive compensation committee members' tied firm (i.e., where they serve as executives) and that at their focal firm (i.e., where they serve as board of directors). Using a panel sample of U.S. banks, we find the evidence of "diffusion" such that the change (either increase or decrease) of executive pay dispersion at their tied firms results in the change of pay dispersion at the focal firm in the following year. We also find the evidence of "adaptation" such that the extent to which pay dispersion practices are diffused across firms is contingent upon the length of shared tenure among committee members.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between board composition and financial vulnerability of non-profit organizations in Malaysia. Information on these variables is obtained from the content analysis of annual reports of 205 societies registered with Registrar of Societies in Malaysia for the financial period 2010. Results of this study revealed significant relationships between some board compositions and some measures of financial vulnerabilities. First, there is a significant positive relationship between board members with professional affiliations and solvency. Second, there is a negative relationship between board members with political connections and efficiency as well as solvency. These findings indicate that types of directors on the board are important as they bring specific critical resources to match the specific environmental needs facing the organizations. In addition, the findings also provide useful information that can facilitate screening, monitoring, and decision making processes for various stakeholders.

Corporate governance issues are especially important in transition economies, since these countries do not have the long-established financial institution infrastructure to deal with corporate governance issues. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was no need to discuss corporate governance issues because all enterprises were owned by the state and there were no shareholders. All that has changed since 1989. This paper discusses the view on corporate governance in some transition economies. Highly limited knowledge on executive pay in (post)transition economies creates demand for research in this filed; this paper explores executive compensation structure in Croatia. The research was conducted among Croatian public limited companies during December 2010 through February 2011 at a response rate of 18,44%. Paper also covers specificities of the development of the corporate governance structures and practices in the Republic of Macedonia.

Marta Cuadrado This study advances research on CEO succession and board monitoring of senior executives by examining how proprietary directors can affect the probability of CEO dismissal. Drawing on our newly developed database covering all CEO successions occurring in all Spanish listed firms during the period 2007-2010, we propose that proprietary directors may increase the board's monitoring efforts over the chief executive, forcing him to resign in situations of poor performance. Hypotheses are tested longitudinally, using CEO succession data taken from 111 publicly-traded firms in the Spanish mercado continuo' over a four-year period.

Increased business complexities coupled with enhanced global transformation have propelled corporations to behave as responsible citizens to drive the sustainability agenda. Many corporations incorporate their affirmative commitment to sustainable business practices into their corporate identities and give evidence for this in their sustainability reports. This paper examines the role of the board of directors in sustainability reporting quality (SRQ) in the Asia-Pacific region. Based on a cross-sectional study of 113 companies from 12 countries in the region, we find that the SRQ in the region leaves much room for improvement. However, we find that the institutionalization of the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in an organization provides a sound foundation for enhancing SRQ. We find that the value of CSR anchored in the vision and/ or mission statement and strategic alliances fostered with non-governmental organizations are positively associated with SRQ. This study contributes to strengthening the understanding, promoting discussion on the state of sustainability reporting in the Asia-Pacific context and laying a solid foundation for more aggressive efforts to enhance SRQ. The study identifies the significant drivers currently associated with SRQ. The weak role of the board of directors in upholding the sustainable development agenda through the reporting process is highlighted. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

CEO duality-the practice of a single individual serving as both CEO and board chair-has been the subject of academic interest for more than 20 years. In that time, boards' use of CEO duality has fluctuated and the scholarly conceptualizations of the phenomenon have become more complex. As such, the need to understand CEO duality has only increased with time. We review and integrate the disparate literature on this topic so that future attempts to study it will benefit from a more complete understanding of the knowledge already produced. We review the demonstrated antecedents and consequences of CEO duality, pointing out that while much work has been done in this area, much remains that we do not understand. Finally, we offer new theoretical, methodological, and contextual directions that researchers could explore to extend knowledge about CEO duality. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Diverse boards have been seen as providing impetus for initiating change. However, diversity may introduce conflict and impede decision making, which could hinder the ability of the firm to make strategic change, especially in times when firm performance is low. Integrating threat-rigidity theory and team diversity research, we examine how board gender diversity, firm performance, and the power of women directors interact to influence the amount of strategic change. Results support a three-way interaction, indicating that when the board is not experiencing a threat as a result of low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most positive. However, when the board is threatened by low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most negative. Results suggest that diversity is double-edged because it can propel or impede strategic change depending on firm performance and the power of women directors.

Research on human capital as a source of competitive advantage has focused largely on firm employees. In this article, we argue that outside directors' general human capital can also be a source of competitive advantage. Firm performance is likely to benefit from directors' human capital-that is, their prior experience and education-because such human capital is likely to make them more effective at monitoring management and providing advice. Drawing on insights from research on individuals' cognitive limitations, we further argue that the extent to which the firm is able to benefit from this human capital can be severely limited by the demands for information processing that directors face from their other board positions. Consequently, we find that the benefit of directors' human capital is contingent upon the information processing load placed upon them from their other board appointments. We find support for our hypotheses using data on over 5,700 directors from 650 firms sampled from the Fortune 1000. This study extends the nascent literature on board human capital by showing that in addition to specific expertise in relevant areas, directors' general human capital can also help firms create competitive advantage. The theory developed in this article also contributes to the literature on strategic human capital by incorporating the concept of information processing demands, suggesting that not only do such demands leave limited cognitive capacity for directors to focus on the focal firm but also that they can severely diminish the beneficial effects of directors' general human capital.

This article extends the literature on CEO succession and financial performance by addressing corporate owners' mixed motives and desires to protect their interest in being in business. We draw on a Socio-Emotional Wealth (SEW) perspective to investigate how the choice of one of three succession mechanisms - relay succession, 'horse races' among internal CEO candidates, and hiring from outside - may effectively balance trade-offs between corporate owners' non-financial SEW motives and the firm's financial performance. We find that implementing one of these succession mechanisms reduces the negative impact that typically characterizes CEO transitions in family firms. We also show that family presence on the board of directors offsets the benefits of having selected these balancing succession mechanisms, in either placing too much emphasis on SEW, or creating negative dynamics that make the chosen succession mechanisms less effective.

This paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by developing and testing theory regarding positive and negative synergies between the CEO's and the board's human and social capital. Using a sample of 360 biotechnology firms that went public between 1995 and 2010, we demonstrate that accumulated public company board experiences of the CEO and the board have positive synergistic effects on IPO performance whereas the current board appointments have negative effects. While scientific educational backgrounds have positive synergies, industry-specific experiences produce either positive or counterproductive effects depending on the age and profitability of the firm. Thus, our paper contributes to the corporate governance and human and social capital literatures by describing the costs and benefits of specific types and combinations of CEO and board capital.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

We propose a concept of structural equality as a compromise between competing policy preferences of equality and individual liberty to address a stunning property of the governance of corporations, namely, the paucity of female directors on corporate boards. An argument for imposing a quota for women directors on boards is the need to disrupt structural impediments to permit endogenous mechanisms to sustain female recruitment beyond a critical mass. Using estimates from the Norwegian experiment, we apply an agent-based model to American board data to show that modest numerical quotas generate well-connected networks of women directors who attain equality in their centrality and influence. The analysis demonstrates the utility of computational social science for identifying policies that generate alternative and possible worlds of greater structural equality.

This paper develops relational pluralism as a collective construct whose dimensions are heterogeneity, multiplexity, and asymmetry. Relational pluralism is instantiated in the board of directors, whose network of relationships influence a new venture's ability to establish external links beyond the networks of the founding team. We argue that relational pluralism speeds the establishment of a diverse alliance portfolio, which, in turn, speeds the attainment of major revenue milestones in a new firm. We examine these ideas in a population of de novo semiconductor firms and find that diverse alliance portfolios emerge faster when a board includes members with heterogeneous, multiplex relationships, as well as central network positions. However, the asymmetric influence of outside board members can have both positive and negative effects: the alliance formation process is aided by outsiders in central network positions, but impeded when central investors dominate the board. We discuss implications for our understanding of relational pluralism as a collective construct. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

The last two decades have witnessed substantial scholarly interest in corporate boards, yet little research has been devoted to boards of international joint ventures (IJVs). We combine the corporate governance and alliance governance literatures in order to study this important ex post governance mechanism for IJVs. We identify a fundamental tension inherent in IJVs, which arises from the unique features of this organizational form and influences the level of involvement by their boards. International joint ventures are hybrid organizational forms that can require administrative control to facilitate monitoring and coordinated adaptation in the presence of exchange hazards. At the same time, the fact that IJVs operate in different host countries can make it efficient to delegate authority to local management for certain collaborations. In investigating the determinants of IJV board involvement, we therefore examine characteristics of IJVs that reflect this underlying tension. We conclude that board involvement reflects efficiency considerations in individual ventures, and the administrative control provided by boards is an important dimension of IJV governance.

We examine the relationship between strategic change and CEO compensation by studying how a firm's refocusing program influences CEO compensation after completing the change. We contribute to the 'settling up' literature by arguing that strategic change is often uncertain for both the CEO and the board of directors responsible for executive compensation. As such the firm is likely to settle up with the CEO by paying for compensation risk and effort undertaken during refocusing after the extent and impact of strategic change are better known. We find that refocusing intensity is positively related to post-refocusing CEO total compensation, suggesting that 'settling up' through post hoc compensation is an important factor in strategic change. We also find that prior firm performance, governance structure and industry dynamism are important moderators of this relationship. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this paper, it is argued that boards internationalize by recruiting international directors in order to increase companies' performance. However, increasing nationality diversity on a board can be costly considering that it potentially creates cooperative problems on a board due to fault-lines and separation processes. As a result, boards will prefer international candidates who are more similar to themselves on a variety of 'distances'. Based on data collected regarding 5683 board members of 361 companies from 15 countries in 2005-2007, we discover that the greater the distance (cultural, institutional and geographical) between the candidates' and the companies' country-of-origin, the lower the fraction of board members of that nationality on boards. Subsequently, it is argued that historical ties between countries play a 'distance compressing' role and partially compensate for the effects of distance. A colonial tie between countries will make recruitment of these particular nationalities more likely than others. (c) 2013.

Boards of directors and corporate governance have gained much attention in recent years. Many reforms have been made, especially on board composition to ensure that boards of directors are effective, in order to improve corporate governance. The Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance codified the best practices of good governance and described optimal corporate governance structures. However, due to a different context for business practices and the nature of the business environment in emerging markets, we expect that the determinants of board structure will differ from those in developed markets. Our study investigates the determinants of board structure for Malaysian firms from 2000 to 2007. We also examine trends in corporate board structure and the level of compliance of boards of directors in Malaysia with the requirements of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance. Overall, we find that after an increase at the beginning of the study period, and then a decrease, board size remained globally stable over the period studied while board independence has shown an upward trend in recent years.Our results also suggest that board size and board independence are correlated with the operation level of the firms. Unlike most findings in the US market, we find no evidence that the measures under the monitoring hypothesis are related to board independence, which requires further investigation on the monitoring role played by Malaysian boards.

Our research aims at exploring individual's characteristics of women on Boards in the French context. In the first part of our paper, we discuss the different theoretical frameworks which supported the business case of gender diversity on Boards of Directors and expose our hypothesis regarding differences in women and men characteristics. The second part presents our methods, measurements and data. Then, we focus on our empirical study. Our sample consists of the French Index SBF 120 companies. We studied the profile of 1,250 directors collecting information from the firms' annual reports of year 2010, using various scales defined by previous research on that field in the Anglo-Saxon literature. Our findings confirm that integrating women on boards has an impact on the Human and Social Capital of Boards but not as much as might have been expected. It is worth noting that men and women board members seem to build their human and social capital through the same educational process in France. Nonetheless, our work shows significant differences between men and women regarding professional experience and board member status. (c) by author(s); CC-BY.

Chief information officers (CIOs) play increasingly strategic roles in firms in this competitive global economy, which is now largely powered by information technology (IT). However, research has shown a lack of board of directors' oversight on CIO- and IT-related issues. Drawing on agency, resource dependence, and alignment theories, we investigate the effect of board of directors' IT awareness on CIO compensation structure and firm performance. We conduct cross-sectional time series analyses of data collected from various sources. Our study underlines three important findings. First, we show that some commonly known executive compensation determinants, such as individual characteristics and governance structure, do not have significant effects on CIO compensation structure. Second, with regard to CIO compensation structure, firms respond to increasing information asymmetry differently according to the level of IT awareness of their boards. Finally, firms perform better when their boards have higher levels of IT awareness, and this positive effect of IT awareness is considerably larger in IT intensive industries. Overall, our study provides empirical support for the important role of boards' IT awareness in shaping CIO compensation and improving firm performance. Our results suggest that boards with functional area knowledge-or higher IT awareness in this case-can more effectively monitor and better incentivize executives, and consequently lead to better firm performance.

Purpose: This study seeks to explore how non-executive directors address governance problems on Dutch two-tier boards. Within this board model, challenges might be particularly difficult to address due to the formal separation of management boards' decision-management from supervisory boards' decision-control roles. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire among non-executive directors provide unique insights into three major challenges in the boardrooms of two-tier boards in The Netherlands. Findings: The study indicates that non-executive directors mainly experience challenges in three areas: the ability to ask management critical questions, information asymmetries between the management and supervisory boards and the management of the relationship between individual executive and non-executive directors. The qualitative in-depth analysis reveals the complexity of the contributing factors to problems in the boardroom and the range of process and social interventions non-executive directors use to address boardroom issues with management and the organization of the board. Practical implications: While policy makers have been largely occupied with the "right" board composition, the results highlight the importance of adequately addressing operational challenges in the boardroom. The results emphasize the importance of a better understanding of board processes and the need of non-executive directors to carefully manage relationships in and around the boardroom. Originality/value: Whereas most studies have focussed on regulatory initiatives to improve the functioning of boards (e.g. the independence of the board), this study explores how non-executive directors attempt to enhance the effectiveness of boards on which they serve.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines whether certain proxies for board incentives and board capital are linked with bankruptcy in unlisted firms. Research Findings/Insights: Based on data analyzed over a five-year period with a sample of 232 matched pairs of unlisted firms, results reveal that firms with boards led by an independent Board Chair (vs. CEO duality), and including longer-tenured directors, and directors with fewer additional directorships on average, are less likely to become bankrupt. Results of analyses of board size and board change support a "reputation" hypothesis, i.e. that directors begin to flee firms in a downward spiral prior to bankruptcy. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Results support an eclectic model of board incentives and board capital, which integrates elements of agency and resource dependence theories, and the group decision-making literature to explain governance antecedents of firms that went bankrupt. It builds on a model proposed by Hillman and Dalziel, while identifying important differences, including lack of support for predicted moderating effects between board incentives and board capital. Findings also support applicability of the threat-rigidity logic and reputation hypothesis in this context, and the importance of anchoring corporate governance research more precisely on prediction of certain levels of performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Findings support governance recommendations to separate Board Chair and CEO leadership and limit a director's number of outside directorships. Negative effects of director tenure on bankruptcy contradict the notion of "term limits," suggesting that benefits of firm-specific knowledge and experience may outweigh risks of entrenchment.

This study examines how chief executive officer (CEO) compensation decisions may be influenced by a major group decision-making tendency referred to as group polarization among outside directors. I start by explaining why outside directors on average tend to support relatively high (low) CEO compensation when they previously witnessed relatively high (low) CEO compensation across different boards. Group polarization theory then suggests that when outside directors on average tend to support relatively high (low) CEO compensation prior to board discussions, they will support even higher (lower) focal CEO compensation after the discussions. In addition, this study proposes three important moderators of the group polarization effect. Specifically, (1) demographic homogeneity among outside directors and (2) the similarity of the minority's prior decision context are proposed to weaken the group polarization effect, whereas (3) outside directors' power relative to inside directors is predicted to strengthen it. Longitudinal analyses (1995-2006) of Fortune 500 CEOs' compensation provide support for these theoretical predictions. This study contributes to corporate governance research on CEO compensation by advancing a novel group decision-making approach to examining this important decision. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

Developing and implementing a meaningful code of conduct by managers or consultants may require a change in orientation that modifies the way these precepts are determined. The position advocated herein is for a different approach to understanding and organizing the guiding parameters of the firm that requires individual reflection and empowerment of the entire organization to advance their shared values. The processes involved are discussed using four discrete stages that move from the personal to the work team and to the unit to the full company, followed by the board of directors' evaluation. The hoped-for end product is dynamic, employee-driven, codes of conduct that recognize the systemic and far-reaching impact of organizational activities across internal and external stakeholders. Operational details for and some issues associated with its implementation are also provided. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We examine the contingencies that sway independent noncore directors of S&P 500 firms to heed the norms of the corporate elite or the disciplining forces of the efficient directorial labor market in the context of executive entrenchment. We find support for the corporate elite perspective as the number of independent noncore directors is positively associated with an entrenchment index score. However, the positive association is moderated by contextual factors that influence whether these directors reflect the expectations of the corporate elite or the efficient directorial labor market. Specifically, this study shows that the association becomes more positive when these directors are highly embedded in the corporate elite network or have shorter board tenure but less positive when independent chief executive officer directors' equity ownership is high. We also found a crossover interaction effect where the association is negative (positive) when firm performance is low (high). These results shed light on an underexplored group of independent directors that play an increasing role in the effective governance of publicly listed firms. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

Journal names, author country affiliations, topics and focus levels, theories, empirical contexts, and methodologies are presented and analysed. We also assemble and analyse this data thematically in order to identify and frame developments and trends in researchers' ideas on board leadership. This analysis provides guidance for researchers by identifying different research streams on board leadership. The analysis may also serve as basis for theory development in board leadership research that can inform policymaking and best practice recommendations.

This study aims to examine the relationship between multiple directorships and the monitoring role of the board of directors in Malaysian listed companies (PLC). The monitoring role is proxied by the percentage of directors' attendance in board meetings, as attending meetings provides directors with resources about the management actions and assists directors to exercise their role effectively. The study uses a sample of 1023 directors from 134 companies on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia (Malaysian Bourse) in year 2008. The results of the study show that the incidence of multiple directorships is low. Independent directors are found to have more multiple directorships. Directors with multiple directorships are older directors, have less director ownerships and are on boards with a high fraction of independent directors. Based on the 75% cut-off for the percentage of meetings' attendance, the logistic regression suggests that no agency cost is associated with multiple directorships. However, the tendency to be absent from board meetings is associated with the high number of board meetings whilst the tendency to attend more board meetings is associated with the increase in age, tenure, and director ownership.

Research Question/Issue: When the stock options granted to CEOs go underwater, boards of directors tend to award additional stock options to their CEOs. Drawing on agency theory and attribution theory, this study explores social psychological mechanisms that explain why boards of directors increase new option grants to CEOs in response to underwater options. Research Findings/Insights: Using the compensation data of CEOs at 966 US firms, we found that contextual factors such as market conditions and industry performance affected boards of directors' decisions to grant new stock options. Consistent with our hypotheses, boards of directors granted a greater number of new options to CEOs in response to CEOs' underwater options during the recession period than the recovery period, and they granted fewer new options when the firm's industry performance was high rather than low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study incorporates attribution theory in understanding boards of directors' causal attribution of firm performance and its impact on executive compensation. It complements earlier studies on causal attribution by exploring the role of contextual factors. It also contributes to the research by examining the attribution process of boards of directors rather than that of top management, as well as the consequences of the causal attribution in terms of ex-post adjustment in executive option compensation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides up-to-date and improved evidence on boards' decision making about executive stock options. Practitioners and policy makers can benefit from the study's findings that board members rely on contextual information about the market and the competition when they make causal attribution of firm performance changes, which tends to affect their decisions about executive compensation.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to survey chairmens perceptions of female board representation in five Nordic countries, focussing on whether the chairmans perception of board work is related to gender diversity, and on differences between high- and low-risk firms. Design/methodology/approach The authors combine data from a questionnaire directed to the chairmen of the boards in Nordic listed companieswith data on firmcharacteristics and board composition. Findings The authors find that the chairmen (97.5 percent male) are significantly less satisfied with female board members as compared to male ones. The authors also find that firms with nomination committees have more gender diverse boards, as well as indications of a more positively perceived contribution of female representation in high-risk firms. Research limitations/implications The study is restricted to perceptions of chairmen for listed Nordic firms. The low response rate of 20.1 percent is a severe limitation. Practical implications The increasing practice of using nomination committees in the Nordic countries seems advantageous from gender balance perspective. Originality/value The authors contribute to the literature on gender diversity in boards by providing results from a board intern perspective. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend governance research in the small business context by examining the moderating influence of top executive involvement on the board of directors on market valuation. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a sample of initial public offering (IPO) high-tech firms engaged in late-stage funding, the study uses stepwise regression to test board involvement moderation effects. Findings: Primary market investors reward governance structures that limit founder power. Originality/value: The current study introduces the notion that optimal market valuation depends not only on whether a CEO-founder governs the firm, but also on level of involvement on the board of directors.

Drawing together literature on corporate governance, organizational behavior, and educational psychology, and using survey data from a sample of 300 Chinese company directors, this study examines the mediating role of director learning goal orientation in linking two widely-acknowledged director social identifications (identification with the organization and identification with executive-agents) and a key director task behavior, namely the monitoring of executive-agents. We also investigate the moderating role of director avoidance orientation in influencing this mediation since a predisposition to avoid loss of "face" is widely posited as having particular relevance in the Chinese context. Results show, first, that directors with stronger organizational identification monitor executive-agents more diligently than those with stronger executive-agent identification. Second, we find that while learning goal orientation mediates the positive effects of both organizational identification and executive-agent identification on monitoring, the mediated indirect effect of organizational identification on monitoring is stronger than the mediated indirect effect of executive-agent identification on monitoring. Third, results show that the indirect effects are stronger when director avoidance orientation is low. These findings underscore the importance of director social identification and learning goal orientation in inducing director monitoring in the Chinese context, as well as the worth of selecting directors who exhibit a low disposition to avoidance.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze if the composition and activity of the appointment and remuneration committee have a significant effect in the remunerations of the members of the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach - To achieve the paper's objective the authors proposed four hypotheses in order to analyze the repercussions of independent, institutional and executive directors in the Appointment and Retribution Committee (ARC) and its activity in the directors' remunerations. Findings - The results put into evidence that the composition (independent, institutional and executive members) of the ARC is not associated with the variation of the directors remuneration mean, while the activity of the ARC influences positively this remuneration mean, contrary to what was expected. Originality/value - The ARC in Spain is not effective in fixating the directors' remunerations. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The study examines if certain board of directors characteristics influence the CEO's Pay Slice (CPS), i.e. the CEO's share of the combined compensation received by the five top-paid executives of the firm. The results show that the CPS is positively affected by the percentage of independent directors and negatively linked to director stock ownership. We also examine if CPS increases company valuation by investors, as predicted by the tournament theory. Our results upheld this view, showing that there is a positive link between CPS and company market value as predicted by the tournament theory. Although the effect is significant at a threshold of 95%, CPS only explains a small percentage of the variance in company market value.

The aim of this paper is to shed light on the cognitive as well as the disciplinary role of one important governance mechanism that is the board of directors in a privatization context. Using a sample of privatized French companies, we examine the relationship between the size, component and structure of this mechanism to the performance and value creation on the post privatization period. Thus, the majority of our findings have support on the theory of cognitive governance, one aspect of governance that was ignored in previous research.

This study investigates the valuation effect of board characteristics in corporate Joint Venture (JV) investments. Despite the prevalence of a board's involvement in JV decisions in practice, extant literature is mute concerning how the board adds value to JV outcomes. Investigation into board contribution in JVs is insightful due to executives' self-serving behaviors that may underlie their JV pursuits and boards' resource provision that may mitigate critical JV challenges. The former (latter) sheds light on the board's monitoring (advisory) role in a firm's JV engagement. Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study investigates the value of representative board characteristics underscored by these two theoretical perspectives. Our results show that the two conventional board measures, board size and outside director ratio, do not have a significant explanatory power. In contrast, director experience associated with JV decisions and gained from within relevant industries are found to positively impact JV outcomes. Moreover, both board meeting frequency and director ownership have favorable moderating effects on the strength of the experience-value relationship. However, these two variables per se do not independently determine a JV's value. Our research results indicate the importance of taking an integrative view to the investigation of board effectiveness, a perspective which has long been neglected in board research. The findings of the present study contribute to the mixed findings of extant studies on board influence from an uninvestigated domain, JV. (c), 2014, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and strategic change of a firm in the Chinese context. In this study, strategic change is defined as strategic deviation relative to industry norms and strategic variation relative to historical experiences. The size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors are defined as the board characteristics. We then propose hypotheses on the effects of board characteristics on a firm's strategic change. This study takes strategic resource allocation profile as measure to calculate strategic deviation and strategic variation, and then empirically tests and verifies the hypotheses using data from Chinese publicly listed companies in the information technology industry from the year 2006 to 2010. We find that the size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors significantly affect both strategic deviation and strategic variation. Therefore, we conclude that board characteristic affects a firm's strategic change. The conclusion of the study indicates that moderate reductions in the size of the board, increasing the proportion of independent directors and separating the roles of chairman and chief executive officer can facilitate promoting the process of strategic change for a firm in a dynamic environment. Through this study we re-examine the role and significance of the board of directors in strategic decision-making for a firm, and provide useful suggestions on how to form a board that can meet the needs for strategic change for a firm in a dynamic business environment.

This article analyses how some internal factors inherent to family firms influence the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of small-and-medium (SME) family businesses, which are the most successful type of firms in maintaining jobs in a crisis like the present. In this sense, we predict that a family firm's image, its willingness to change, and the strategic involvement of its board of directors may positively influence its EO, which is one of the most used strategies among firms against crisis. We test these hypotheses by surveying the CEOs of 232 Spanish SMEs. The results of a structural equation model corroborate our hypotheses. (c) Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

We formulate theory on the effect of board of director gender diversity on the broad spectrum of securities fraud, and generate three key insights. First, based on ethicality, risk aversion, and diversity, we hypothesize that gender diversity on boards can operate as a significant moderator for the frequency of fraud. Second, we advance that the stock market response to fraud from a more gender-diverse board is significantly less pronounced. Third, we posit that women are more effective in male-dominated industries in reducing both the frequency and severity of fraud. Results of our novel empirical tests, based on data from a large sample of Chinese firms that committed securities fraud, are largely consistent with each of these hypotheses.

Ten countries have established quotas for female representation on publicly traded corporate and/or state-owned enterprise boards of directors, ranging from 33 to 50 %, with various sanctions. Fifteen other countries have introduced non-binding gender quotas in their corporate governance codes enforcing a "comply or explain" principle. Countless other countries' leaders and policy groups are in the process of debating, developing, and approving legislation around gender quotas in boards. Taken together, gender quota legislation significantly impacts the composition of boards of directors and thus the strategic direction of these publicly traded and state-owned enterprises. This article outlines an integrated model of three institutional factors that explain the establishment of board of directors gender quota legislation based on the premise that the country's institutional environment co-evolves with gender corporate policies. We argue that these three key institutional factors are female labor market and gendered welfare state provisions, left-leaning political government coalitions, and path-dependent policy initiatives for gender equality, both in the public realm as well as in the corporate domain. We discuss implications of our conceptual model and empirical findings for theory, practice, policy, and future research. These include the adoption and penalty design of board diversity practices into corporate practices, bottom-up approaches from firm to country-level gender board initiatives, hard versus soft regulation, the leading role of Norway and its isomorphic effects, the likelihood of engaging in decoupling, the role of business leaders, and the transnational and international reaction to board diversity initiatives.

Corporate governance (CG) research has largely focused on internal governance mechanisms (i.e. the board of directors, controlling owners, and managerial incentives). However, much of this work ignores the role that external CG practices play in preventing managers from engaging in activities detrimental to the welfare of shareholders, and the overall firm. In this essay, we first review and organize current research on external governance mechanisms and integrate this siloed body of work within the broader CG equation. We explicitly focus on six external governance mechanisms: the legal environment, the market for corporate control, external auditors, stakeholder activism, rating organizations, and the media. We discuss findings showing how external governance mechanisms act both as independent forces and in conjunction with internal CG mechanisms. We conclude the review by mapping an agenda for future research on CG that better integrates internal and external governance mechanisms. Our review suggests that studying different configurations of external and internal governance mechanisms will help us to better understand what factors and conditions lead to effective CG.

A growing body of work suggests that the presence of women and of independent directors on boards of directors is associated with higher corporate environmental performance. However, the mechanisms linking board composition to corporate environmental performance are not well understood. This study proposes and empirically tests the mediating role of sustainability-themed alliances in the relationship between board composition and corporate environmental performance. Using the population of public oil and gas firms in the United States as the sample, the study relies on renewable energy alliances to measure sustainability-themed alliances and longitudinally analyzes lagged data for independent and control variables. The study found that (1) the higher the representation of women on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances, and (2) the higher the representation of independent directors on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances. Such alliances, in turn, positively contribute to corporate environmental performance. This paper discusses the study's contributions to the board composition-social performance literature.

We distinguish between "family companies," involving multiple family members as owners and/or managers, and "lone-founder companies," involving only the founder and no other family members. We apply social identity theory and organizational identification to elucidate the differences between these two types of firms, and how their differing organizational identities reflect unique desires for control and influence. We then consider how these differences are reflected in a firm's board structure (i.e., directorship interlocks, director experiences, and director tenures). Specifically, we predict that family firms are more likely to interlock with other family firms, select directors with more experience in family firms, and keep directors on their boards longer. Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern. We also consider the consequences of family and lone-founder ownership and board structures on the investment behavior of three classes of institutional investors. We test our hypotheses with a sample of publicly traded corporations between 1991 and 2006, and report strong support for most of our predictions. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Organizational boards of directors are one of the most important subgroups within most modern organizations, performing critical advisory, monitoring and resource dependence roles. This paper investigates the crucial question of whether the stock market values ethnic and gender diversity within organizational boards. We find that board diversity is positively associated with market valuation. We distinctively demonstrate further that ethnic diversity is valued more highly by the stock market than gender diversity. By contrast, we do not find any evidence of a significant non-linear link between board diversity and market valuation. Our findings are robust across a number of econometric models that deal with different types of endogeneities and market valuation measures. Overall, our results are consistent with agency and resource dependence theoretical predictions. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

This paper highlights the importance of a firm's board with respect to sustainability issues by analysing the relationship between director interlocks, i.e. directors who simultaneously belong to the boards of directors of several companies, and a firm's environmental performance. The previous literature has focused on the influence of firm-level resources on corporate environmental performance. This study utilizes insights from a resource-based view and research on social capital to demonstrate that the environmental performance of a firm is also influenced by the difficult-to-imitate capabilities that are embedded in the network relationships of its directors. Our results support a contingency perspective of the social capital theory that finds that director interlocks are positively connected with the environmental performance of a firm in two specific situations: (1) when the firm is linked to a larger parent company and (2) in cases of low and high levels of interlock diversity.

Prior studies show that agency conflicts are important in explaining corporate financial policies and that the board of directors is central to corporate governance. In this study, we examine the role of this governing body in the accumulation of cash reserves. Using a sample of 597 French listed firms during 2001-2007, we find that firms with boards deemed to be effective in mitigating agency problems--that is, those appointing independent directors and splitting chief executive officer and chair positions--accumulate less cash reserves than those with less effective boards. Moreover, two-tier boards are more efficient in mitigating the agency costs of free cash flow, leading to less corporate cash hoarding. These findings support the idea that agency conflicts influence cash management policy and that effective boards of directors play an important disciplinary role in a concentrated ownership setting.

Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries--often labeled "lack of transparency"--between top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high.

Boards of directors are in a position to contribute vital knowledge resources to strategy-making. We propose that the relation between board functional background heterogeneity and exploration-focused versus exploitation-focused strategy is contingent on the extent to which the institutionally adopted board model enables or constrains inclusion of the board's knowledge resources in strategy-making. We empirically juxtapose the Anglo-Saxon ('one-tier') and Rhineland ('two-tier') board models in the U.K. and Germany, respectively, and find support for our assertion that the influence of board functional background heterogeneity on relative exploration orientation is more pronounced when the adopted board model accommodates inclusion of the board's knowledge resources into strategy-making. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2015 Strategic Management Society.

Research on corporate governance has attempted to investigate the added value of boards of directors through the lenses of both demographic and behavioral approaches. However, investigations into these two approaches, and the subsequent implications for firm performance, have thus far been mainly decoupled from one another. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to put both approaches to the test in the family business context. Using a sample of 567 Spanish family firms, we find that although both approaches can explain the performance of family firms, the behavioral approach explains a much higher proportion of the variation in the firm's performance. Furthermore, our findings support our hypotheses that the relationship between the proportion of outside directors and firm performance follows an inverted U-shape in private family firms, and that both business-oriented and family-oriented board role performance are positively related with firm performance.

Prior studies of IPO underpricing, mostly using agency theory and single-country samples, have generally fallen short. In this study, we employ the knowledge-based view (KBV) to explore underpricing across 17 countries. We find that agency indicators are insignificant predictors, board of director knowledge limits underpricing, and external knowledge both substitutes for and complements internal board knowledge. This third finding suggests that future KBV studies should consider how internal and external knowledge states interact with each other. Our study offers new insights into the antecedents of underpricing and extends our understanding of comparative governance and the KBV of the firm. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Employment discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals remains a persistent problem not addressed by federal and most state equal employment opportunity laws in the United States. Despite this lack of regulation, a growing number of organizations are voluntarily adding sexual orientation and gender identity to their nondiscrimination statements, providing domestic partner benefits, sponsoring affinity groups, and establishing other "LGBT-friendly" policies. This article incorporates institutional theory and organizational demography to explore the antecedents to these policies to understand why some organizations seek to be at the forefront of this trend while others do only the minimum to embrace this element of diversity. The analysis of a sample of Fortune 1000 firms reveals that state law dealing with gay rights in non-employment-related areas for the state where each company is headquartered, the number of women serving on each firm's board of directors, and whether other companies in the same industry have adopted progressive policies are all related to company policy toward its LGBT employees. Sexual orientation of employees by industry does not seem to influence company policy. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We study the relation between the chair of the board of directors and the CEO. We argue that substantial age dissimilarity between the two-giving rise to cognitive conflict-increases board monitoring and firm value for firms with greater monitoring needs. We find evidence for our hypothesis using data on German two-tier boards. German law mitigates endogeneity concerns as it prevents CEO duality and also restricts CEO power in other ways. Additional identification attempts include CEO-firm and chair-firm fixed effects, random effects, dynamic panel data estimations, and the use of the 2007 financial crisis as an exogenous shock to monitoring needs. We find that during the crisis, when fast decision making and managerial discretion were needed, the link between age dissimilarity and firm value changed. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss a research model that presents three metrics of corporate social performance (CSP): board interlocks, director's profile and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach - Based on social network theories, the authors argue the possible relationships between the three variables. The authors conduct the study on 255 directorships in the boards of 20 listed companies in France, which participate in Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 2010. Findings - The results show that director's background and nationality diversity in the board are the most relevant attributes to discerning firms with high CSR scores. However, the relationship between board interlocks and CSR is not consistent. Some explanations are reported and discussed. Research limitations/implications - The research contributes to recognize the most influential variables in board composition for firms with high CSR scores, although it is based on a conceptual development and an explorative analysis. It could constitute the basis for future research which integrates modeling and multivariate analysis. Practical implications - Diversity in the board could be an effective tool to guide management for more CSR decisions. Social implications - The paper highlights the importance of diversifying the recruitment base when integrating new board members. This implies opening board networks to new profiles, in order to better meet stakeholders' expectations regarding CSR. Originality/value - The paper contributes to board literature by highlighting the importance of combining individual attributes (director) with corporate ones (board of directors) to better assess the role of board of directors in the adoption of CSR' practices.

In this article, we develop theory regarding one set of mechanisms through which increases in the compensation of directors are transmitted throughout the director labor market. In a longitudinal study using director compensation data from 1996 to 2005, we test hypotheses about how directors' use of social comparison processes, and reciprocity between CEOs and the board, drive up the compensation level for boards of directors. Specifically, we argue and find that directors' home firms and interlocked boards serve as salient comparison groups for board members. (c) 2012, (c) The Author(s) 2012.

The attraction of blue-chip listings in emerging stock markets is a major policy initiative common across much of the developing world. In many cases however, local blue-chip firms are the result of foreign Multinational Enterprise (MNE) firms engaging with local indigenous partners to form an international joint venture (IJV). These are unique with bilateral governance structures underscoring co-ownership between partners of residual cash flows and assets of the IJV. Using a unique and comprehensive sample of 202 IPO firms from across the emerging African region evidence of both a pronounced internal as well as external role for IJV boards was found. Social and political legitimacy concerns dominate the external role of boards in particular. Increasing proportions of boards drawn from commercial and governmental social elites are associated with IJV IPO firms in high institutional quality while lower proportions of these elites are associated with civil code law jurisdictions rather than common law. Governmental elites are associated with country-level improvements in corruption control and political stability while commercial elites are only marginally associated with improvements in political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and democratic voice and accountability measures.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the importance of human capital and professional networks for women's and men's appointment to the boards of directors of public companies. The study provides an in-depth analysis of how human capital and professional networks contribute to women's as compared with men's odds of corporate board membership. Design/methodology/approach - The study analyzes the human capital and professional networks of 494 male and female corporate outside (non-executive) directors appointed between 2005 and 2010 to the boards of US public companies listed in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Human capital was measured as director age, education and professional experience (function and role). Professional network variables measured included composition of professional network, network centrality, constraint and cohesion. Findings - The study's findings reveal that the characteristics that impact the appointment of women as outside directors to public company boards differ from those of men. Relative to men, certain professions such as government relations and education improve the odds of appointment of women to corporate boards, while age lowers women's odds. The number of network ties and the degree of network cohesion were also significant in predicting the likelihood of female board appointment to public corporations relative to men's odds. The final model was able to predict female board membership correctly only in 28 per cent of the cases, while male board membership was predicted in 89 per cent of the cases, suggesting that factors other than human capital and professional networks (e.g. their gender) impact women's appointment to corporate boards. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively examine the professional network components of female and male directors along with their human capital in the analysis of their prospects for board appointment. The conceptualization of professional networks as well the depth of quantitative analysis of the network components of the study advance the extant literature on the composition of corporate boards.

This study brings together developments in corporate governance and organization studies to examine the work of the company secretary, a mandatory legal officer in UK listed corporations, typically positioned close to the board of directors, but hitherto largely ignored in governance and organizational research. Regulation continues to use distinctions between inside executive and outside independent non-executives on boards, opening up organizational space between what one director actually does vis-a-vis another. This study combines a socio-spatial perspective of organization with theories of board behaviour to identify the potential for company secretaries to engage in a vibrant role performance in and around the boardroom. Findings show the potential for company secretaries to act as boundary spanners, 'walking the lines and working the spaces' that connect executive and non-executive directors, so developing the governance space in ways that enable board effectiveness.

In recent years, shareholders, regulators, and academics have become increasingly interested in how multinational enterprises (MNEs) can ensure sound corporate governance throughout all entities within a firm. One important mechanism available to MNEs for improving their global governance is the subsidiary board of directors. However, to date scant academic research has focused on the roles of subsidiary boards and the factors that influence their involvement in different roles. Using survey data from a sample of MNE subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a subsidiary board performs four roles: control, strategy, coordination, and service. Further, a subsidiary board is more involved in control, strategy, and service roles if the subsidiary operates only in the local market, independently from the headquarters (the local implementer subsidiary). In particular, the board of the local implementer subsidiary is more involved in strategy and coordination roles when more directors are headquarters country nationals. Our findings collectively suggest that the subsidiary board facilitates a subsidiary's pursuit of its strategic objective and helps to manage the headquarters-subsidiary agency problem. Moreover, subsidiary directors' characteristics influence the subsidiary board's ability to perform its roles. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study explores the influence of board independence, board size, CEO duality, board diligence, board financial expertise and presence of audit committee as well as the type of sector on the timeliness of financial reports among selected Jordanian companies. The timeliness of the financial reports is measured by audit report lag (ARL) and management report lag (MRL). This study covers 112 firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange for the years 2011 and 2012. The results of the ARL model indicate that companies that have members of board who are independent from management take a significantly shorter time to prepare and issue their financial reports. The results indicate that companies with greater number of board of directors are related with a higher audit report lag. The results also show that companies that separated the CEO and chairman's roles are quicker in publishing financial reports than companies combining the roles of CEO and chairman. In addition, boards of directors with more meetings make the audit report lag shorter. The findings also support that argument that the existence of an audit committee could resolve the information asymmetry between management and external auditors that, in turn, would lead to reduced audit report lag and management report lag. However, the results of the MRL model show that management report lag is related positively to large board size and board diligence and negatively to the existence of audit committee. This study concludes that the good structures of corporate governance play a key role in improving the quality of timeliness of financial reports. (c) 2015 Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences.

This study examines how board ownership shapes board processes in family firms. The extant family firm research has extensively adopted an input-output approach to the study of boards, but results have been inconclusive, calling for further research on intervening processes. By examining board ownership, this study shows that board processes are shaped by the life cycles of family firms across generations, as reflected in ownership dispersion among family directors: Cognitive conflict is the highest and the use of knowledge and skills is the lowest when the levels of balance in a board's voting power are moderate, which occurs when the board mostly mirrors a sibling partnership. A discussion of this study's findings contributes to the literature on family firm boards, work groups, and corporate governance. (c) 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how an environmental threat (possible quotas for female supervisory directors) might change supervisory board gender composition in SBF120 French company boards between 2008 and 2010. Design/methodology/approach - From a census of supervisory board membership of SBF120 companies in France in January 2008 and December 2010, data were obtained to test hypotheses relating to changes in gender composition of boards and demographic differences between new and earlier director appointees. The authors drew on institutional theory to inform the discussion of this paper's findings. Findings - The authors reveal significant increases over 2008-2010 in SBF120 board female representation and significant cohort differences between recent and earlier appointees. Newer female appointees differed from male peers and from earlier appointed females and males, bringing youth and international experience. New females were more likely to gain CAC40 seats than their male peers. There was an increase in boards with multiple female directors. Research limitations/implications - Actual motivations for increase in female appointments are unknown, but institutional theory provides possible explanations, as suggestion of coercive forces loomed. Chairmen of larger firms may have made strategic choices to attract younger and English-speaking foreign women, before the rush. Limitations include the descriptive nature of the paper, but it sets a benchmark for later studies to monitor progress in depth. Practical implications - The talent pool for female directors has widened to include foreign English-speaking women, bringing a range of new insights and experience of international governance practice to traditional French boardrooms. However, this could be seen as further discriminatory practice that requires female appointees to bring more human and social capital than that required of their male peers. Originality/value - This is the first paper charting the changes in supervisory board composition during the three-year period of environmental unrest as quotas were proposed and legislated in France and comparing new and existing cohort French director demographics.

Purpose - Director selection is an important yet under-researched topic. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to extant literature by gaining a greater understanding into how and why new board members are recruited. Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory study uses in-depth interviews with Australian non-executive directors to identify what selection criteria are deemed most important when selecting new director candidates and how selection practices vary between organisations. Findings - The findings indicate that appointments to the board are based on two key attributes: first, the candidates' ability to contribute complementary skills and second, the candidates' ability to work well with the existing board. Despite commonality in these broad criteria, board selection approaches vary considerably between organisations. As a result, some boards do not adequately assess both criteria when appointing a new director hence increasing the chance of a mis-fit between the position and the appointed director. Research limitations/implications - The study highlights the importance of both individual technical capabilities and social compatibility in director selections. The authors introduce a new perspective through which future research may consider director selection: fit. Originality/value - The in-depth analysis of the director selection process highlights some less obvious and more nuanced issues surrounding directors' appointment to the board. Recurrent patterns indicate the need for both technical and social considerations. Hence the study is a first step in synthesising the current literature and illustrates the need for a multi-theoretical approach in future director selection research.

The CLO shapes and enforces corporate governance, but is faced with a dual-role paradox that requires her to act as both monitor of corporate governance and executive of the firm. We study the role of the CLO under environments that are most likely to impact governance and pressure the firm to either emphasize or marginalize the CLO's role as monitor or facilitator. Using the financial shock of a securities class action lawsuit on large corporations, we measure changes in CLO value through the metrics of total and relative compensation of the CLO and other C-suite members. After controlling for relevant variables such as growth and total assets, we find that when firms have more insiders on their board of directors, the CLO's compensation declines when the preceding year's Tobin's Q is high. CLO compensation increases under conditions of high opacity, but that compensation partially erodes in high Tobin's Q environments. We also find that a lawsuit increases CFO and CEO turnover but not the CLO's. Our results have implications for corporate governance, the dual and potentially conflicting role of CLO as gatekeeper and monitor, executive compensation, and agency costs. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We study how New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) firms adopted governance committees on their boards of directors. The drive to adopt started as a social movement but was facilitated greatly by the collapse of Enron Corporation and a subsequent mandate by the NYSE that all of its traded firms must have governance committees. Using institutional theory and a sample of NYSE firms, we develop and test hypotheses about the speed of governance committee adoption, the likelihood of committee adoption by the NYSE deadline, and the types of directors that were placed on the inaugural governance committee. Our study adds to theory about how organizations respond to external pressures when responding is contrary to the interests of executives. (c) 2013, (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between organizational characteristics and presence in a board-of-directors (BoD)-network, in the context of the biotechnology industry. Accessing and integrating external knowledge is key to an organization's success within innovative industries. This can occur through inter-organizational networks such as the BoD-network. Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply a network analysis method (Robins and Alexander, 2004) and a logistic regression to a proprietary database of Belgian biotechnology organizations. Findings - The authors conclude that some organizational characteristics influence the presence of a biotechnology organization in the regional BoD-network. Academic spin-offs, start-ups and small companies are more likely to be part of the regional biotechnology BoD-network. The authors also observe that organizations involved in innovative activities are prominently present in the BoD-network. Interestingly, key actors like universities or academic hospitals are less present in the network. Research limitations/implications - The authors show that studying full networks and heterogeneous groups of organization leads to a better understanding of the causal mechanisms and dynamics of inter-organizational networks. To better understand the network dynamics in a context as complex as the biotechnology industry, multiple networks need to be studied simultaneously. Practical implications - The findings in this study allow for the development of policies addressing knowledge transfer, diffusion of management and governance practices, and the initiation and management of collaborative projects through the BoD-network. The authors observe a self-reinforcing dependency between innovative activities and BoD-network membership. This implies that policies aimed at stimulating innovation should also aim at increasing the target organizations' presence in the BoD-network. Analyzing an organization's innovative activities and position in the BoD-network allows for identifying those organizations that contribute most to the region's knowledge transfer network and innovative capacity. Originality/value - The authors combine two different research streams and are the first to study the complete BoD-network of a biotechnology industry agglomeration.

In this article, we build on recent attempts to theorize about the evolution of boards of directors by juxtaposing firms' strategies to gain, maintain, and repair legitimacy onto their life cycle to examine how board characteristics change-both symbolically and substantively-to reflect their firm's evolving legitimating strategy. In doing so, we develop insights contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the evolving structure and composition of boards of directors. We suggest that boards fulfill an important role ingrained in the firm's legitimacy in addition to, and intertwined with, their substantive contribution to the firm's performance at each life cycle stage. We also address firms' real ability to effect change in their board as a function of the factors that pertain to each stage of life cycle. We conclude by expounding the implications of this novel framework for future research and managerial practice.

Board performance research conducted over the last 50 years has focused on individual directors' economically-motivated behaviors and outcomes, and has generated inconsistent and disappointing results. Most research does not consider the board as a team, despite recent calls for a focus on collective board processes and behaviors. A recent survey revealed that 90 per cent of directors rate their individual performance as very effective but only 30 per cent rate overall board performance at an equivalent level, exposing a gap that needs to be addressed. The discrepancy between individual and team performance effectiveness was the focus of this research, based on original data from 182 directors and their assessment of their board's dynamic, team task performance efficacy, team potency and the impact of their activities, as a board, on firm profitability. Our findings show that director experience, social network and cultural intelligence quotient, as well as their ability to achieve high levels of team interaction - thereby lowering information asymmetry - have a significant impact on corporate profitability. Our study demonstrates that the impact of board functioning as a team is an eight times greater predictor of corporate performance than individual director demographics. We found that this team dynamic as well as team potency has a positive impact on profitability, while the focus on compliance-oriented tasks has a significantly negative effect on profitability. The insights of this study should help boards and their advisors better focus their efforts to improve team dynamic, optimize board interactions and refocus their attention on value-creating activities. We also believe that improving board team dynamics will have an unintended consequence of bringing a level of individual and team satisfaction back to the boardroom.

Understanding the value the right chief executive officer selection and tenure choices can bring to an organisation is under researched in legal jurisdictions such as Australia where there is strong separation of the role of the chief executive officer and chairperson. The chief executive officer is the key organisation strategist and plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategy as well as keeping the board of directors informed of the work of the executive team. This paper reviews and synthesises the corporate governance literature to develop the argument that a chief executive officer's professional development background and work context will impact his or her ability to favourably influence organisation performance. A series of research propositions of interest to a range of stakeholders inside and outside the organisation are developed drawing on a number of corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory, stewardship theory). This conceptual paper develops a substantial future empirical research agenda. (c) 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

There is an increasing scholarly interest in how social enterprises manage their hybrid nature. As hybrid organizational forms, social enterprises combine mission-driven social goals and revenue generating activities in a variety of organizational constellations and in diverse institutional contexts. Acknowledging the potentially conflicting demands that institutional environments impose on social enterprises there is an increasing research interest in the existence and proliferation of these conflicting demands at the organizational level. Some researchers have pointed to the importance of particular management practices and governance characteristics - such as authority relations and internal representation - as mechanisms to deal with the conflicting demands at the organizational level. This paper adds to this stream of literature by taking into account the organizational level dynamics of internal representation and the proliferation of factional groups in the boards of directors of hybrid organizational forms and their impact on board performance, ultimately influencing the organizational performance.

Examining board of directors' decision making in case studies of CEOs and board members in four US companies, we found that an "inner board" of directors and CEOs linked by network ties outside of board meetings contained the most influential board members who also shared cognitions about problems. This informal network of ties was affected by the formal governance structure of the board. Strong ties in the informal network led to shared cognitions on the board, demonstrating a link between the formal and network positions of board members and their decision making.

Purpose-The purpose of this article is to examine if certain board characteristics have an impact on the total remuneration of top management and the ratio of stock-based remuneration to total top-management remuneration. Design/methodology/approach-The study draws on data from the largest public Canadian companies, the constituents of the TSX/60 index. The study controls for firm size and profitability. Findings-The authors concludes that total remuneration of top management is directly linked to board-member total remuneration and the board average number of director-tenure years. The study also shows that the ratio of stock-based to total top-management remuneration is positively affected by the percentage of independent directors, total remuneration of board directors, the ratio of stock-based remuneration of directors to their total remuneration and the average number of tenure years of the board of directors. Practical implications-If regulators are determined to curb the excesses in top-management remuneration by means of promoting boards with certain characteristics, they should implement measures facilitating the control of directors' remuneration and tenure, to discourage cronyistic behavior. Good corporate governance requires that the board act as a counterbalance to top management, ensuring that a substantial percentage of top-executive total compensation is variable, and not fixed. According to our findings, the boards that are the most likely to hold managerial avoidance of variable pay in check are those favoring director independence, variable director remuneration and longer director tenures. Social implications-The present article examines specifically the latter aspect, namely, the role of board characteristics (independence, size, compensation, board director ownership and tenure, etc.) in the determination of top-management compensation. This relationship is important because it allows us to further the analysis of corporate governance. If the above-mentioned traits of boards have a meaningful relationship with the compensation of the top management, one might conclude that certain practices in the composition of boards could influence good corporate governance practices. This is relevant for regulatory agencies, for investors and for corporations. Originality/value-The article adds to the extant literature in a number of ways. Firstly, it considers the role of the traits of the board in the determination of the compensation of the top-management teams, and not only of the chief executive officer, as is the focus of previous literature. Secondly, the article focuses on the power interplay between boards and managers, and, more particularly, on the ability of boards to be an effective mechanism of corporate governance. Finally, the article examines the potential impact of board traits in the determination of top-management compensation in the context of Canadian firms, a subject that has received less attention from academic research, which has mostly concentrated on analyzing the issue in the US context.

Using resource-based logic as well as stewardship and agency theories, we address a paradox when governing young firms-how to design governance structures to encourage top managers to generate rents while minimizing the threat of rent appropriation. Some corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) enhance empowerment and encourage managers to generate rents for the firm. But these CGMs may also allow managers to appropriate rents excessively. The solution appears to be combining CGMs that empower managers to generate rents with CGMs that either (a) motivate stewardship behavior or (b) reduce information asymmetry between management and other stakeholders. Our empirical analyses provide substantial support for our predictions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Taking the assumptions of the resource dependency theory as our starting point, the main objectiveof this investigation is to gain an understanding of how and in what way board members who serveon multiple boards (interlocks) can affect a firm's profitability, and whether it is useful to consider thederivation of these interlocks according to the type of board member (executive or non-executive) whopossesses them. Using dynamic panel data analysis (GMM) and a sample of 88 firms quoted on theSpanish Continuous Market for the period 2005-2008, our results confirm the existence of a curvilinear(inverted-U) relation between interlocks and firm performance. The results demonstrate that this relationis only significant if we include the total number of external ties rather than just the number of linksgenerated by non-executive directors. We can also confirm that the degree of familiarity and sharedknowledge between board members (measured by average board tenure) affects this relationship. (c) 2015 AEDEM.

PurposeFrom the resource-based view (RBV), the purpose of this paper is to argue that the board has the capability to participate in international strategic decisions and deal with the environmental complexities that internationalisation brings; and moreover, to achieve better performance than its competitors. Design/methodology/approachThis paper highlights the active participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010. FindingsThe results show that while the resources provided by the directors through their level of education and international experience, help them learn and process information, and they are a source of expertise representing "board potential";. A board that functions well through the directors' relationships allow the proper integration and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive advantages in an international context. Originality/valueFrom a RBV, this paper refines and extends the concept of "board capability"; as the combination of potential and internal relations that allow boards to undertake their roles competently over time. Additionally, the paper empirically examines the effect of board capability on firm internationalisation. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Biotech firms are faced with particularly complex decisions early in their development. Because of the specific nature of their products, their growth strategy rapidly entails the internationalisation of their activities, especially through alliances. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) wishing to develop and access complementary skills may use corporate boards and scientific advisory boards. The resource-based view provides a compelling rationale for efficiently using these external sources of knowledge in order to access the key resources SMEs need to improve their performance. This study investigates how corporate and scientific advisory boards are involved in the internationalisation of biotech firms through strategic alliances. Based on semi-structured interviews and secondary data from 22 biotechnology firms, we describe the characteristics of these external sources of strategic advice and explore their impact on the firms' internationalisation. A discussion of the results, along with their implications for future research and managerial practices are also presented. Copyright (c) 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Decades-long research on boards of directors based on the agency theoretic insider/outsider distinction (Fama & Jensen, 1983) has yielded limited results regarding the effectiveness of boards as monitors of senior management (Johnson, S., Schnatterly, & Hill, 2013) leading governance scholars to incorporate agency theory based distinctions with rich characterizations of the human capital of board composition. This study examines the human capital brought to the boards of directors by active CEOs.

Previous studies that have examined the impact of board diversity on firm financial performance have yielded conflicting results. One of the main challenges for studies looking at the impact of diverse directors stems from the fact that firm financial performance and board of director composition may be endogenously determined. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to the problem of endogeneity. By analyzing the reaction of the stock market when a diverse director's departure is announced, we can examine investors' perceptions of the importance of changes in board diversity. Our results show that investors value gender diversity among directors; however, we are unable to conclude that investors value ethnic diversity among directors.

This case study examines strategic management issues related to corporate governance and CEO-Chair duality, which have led to the use of power and family control of a very profitable and successful public holding company that dominated the insurance industry in Palestine for 20 years. It specifically describes the incidents that made Hayat Insurance Company (HIC) vulnerable and unable to choose the right strategies to cope with external threats, such as the rising competition and the developing regulations during the 1990s. With government interventions, the situation deteriorated, and HIC was dissolved. The selected solution, to liquidate HIC by selling its license to another insurance company, was thought to be for the best interest of the various stakeholder groups. The case is based on interviews with major stakeholders including insurance experts, shareholders, board of directors, former employees and managers, and government officials in various departments.

The strategic role of the board of directors can be a competitive advantage for family firms. In fact, in medium-sized family firms the more the board is involved in the firm strategy, the better performance it gets. However, this relationship is mediated by some variables that may enhance or inhibit this effect. In this chapter, the impact of the entrepreneurial orientation variable is analysed as a mediator between the strategic involvement of the board of directors (SIBD) and performance. We test these hypotheses by surveying the CEOs of 230 Spanish medium-sized family businesses. The results obtained through the Partial Least Square (PLS) technique show that the entrepreneurial orientation of the family firm has a positive effect on the relationship between SIBD and performance.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to better understand dependency issues between the CEO and the board as well as the between the board and CEO through Emerson's power dependency framework. Design/methodology/approach - A symbolic management approach is integrated with a board-CEO power dependency model to study the dependency issues. Findings - According to the symbolic management perspective, uncertainty increases the likelihood of symbolic actions. A high level of uncertainty in CEO dependency issues suggests a high likelihood that board power over the CEO is manifested on a symbolic level, whereas a low level of uncertainty in board dependency issues suggests otherwise for CEO power over the board. The core of board-dependency issues is information provision. Practical implications - A focus on improving board control over CEO performance, compensation and strategic proposals is likely to generate symbolic actions without an effective result. Originality/value - The paper advocates that an effective approach to enhance board power is through reducing board information dependency on the CEO. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Despite the growing interest in IJVs and their governance, systematic research is limited on the board of directors and their roles in international joint ventures in emerging markets. In this study, we draw from corporate governance research that suggests that the levels of control and collaboration by boards are influenced by organizational complexity. While joint ventures possess several similarities compared to unitary firms, they also have unique sources of complexity given the fact that two or more international partners collaborate within JVs under an incomplete contract. Based on a sample of 114 IJVs, we argue and show four separate conditions that influence the functions that boards undertake as well as how control and collaboration as two separate functions are interrelated. Our findings address calls for research to open the black box of what boards actually do as well as to bring corporate governance theory to new organizational forms such as joint ventures.

In this study, we investigate the impact women leaders have on the corporate environmental strategies of organizations. Using a dataset of all Fortune 500 CEOs and boards of directors for a ten-year period, we examine several aspects of gender in leadership on environmental strategy. Specifically, we test the impact of women CEOs, the proportion of women on the BOD, the number of interlinks women board members hold, and the interactive and cumulative effects of women CEOs and gender diverse boards. Findings suggest that firms characterized by gender diverse leadership teams are more effective than other firms at pursuing environmentally friendly strategies. This study contributes to research on corporate governance and environmental performance by showing how the gender composition of leaders affects corporate practice.

This paper demonstrates how meta-analysis can be combined with structural equation modeling (MASEM) to address new questions in strategic management research. We review this integration, describe its implementation, and compare findings from bivariate meta-analyses, a direct-effect structural equations model, and two mediating frameworks using data on the strategic leadership and performance relationship. Results drawn from 208 articles that collectively included data on 495,638 observations demonstrate the new insights available from MASEM while also suggesting a revision to conventional thinking on strategic leadership. Whereas some theories posit that boards of directors influence firm performance through monitoring and disciplining the top management team, MASEM provides more support for the view that boards mediate the top management teams' decisions. Implications for applying MASEM in strategic management are offered. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Resource dependence theorists argue that boards of directors with political capital can benefit focal firms by reducing uncertainty and providing preferential resources. Here, we develop theory regarding the downside of board political capital. The problem of principal-principal agency is evident in many parts of the world, and we argue that board political capital can further exacerbate it by enabling large blockholders to undertake more appropriation of firm wealth. Further, we explore how this enabling effect is moderated by ownership-, industry-, and environment-level contingencies. We find empirical support for our arguments using 32,174 directors in 1,046 Chinese listed firms over the period 2008-2011. Our study sheds light on new ways in which resource dependence and agency theories can be integrated to advance the extant research on board governance and corporate political strategy.

We ask whether and when shareholder-oriented foreign owners are likely to change corporate governance logics in a stakeholder-oriented setting by introducing shareholder-oriented governance practices. We focus on board monitoring and claim that because the bundle of practices used in a stakeholder context does not protect shareholder-oriented foreign owners' interests, they seek to introduce their own practices. Our results suggest that board monitoring is only activated when shareholder-oriented foreign ownership is high and that the influence of foreign ownership is especially strong in firms without large domestic owners, with high levels of risk and poor performance. Our findings uncover the possibility of the co-existence of different corporate governance logics within a given country, shaped by the nature and weight of foreign owners Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Excess CEO returns refer to CEO financial returns in excess of shareholder returns. How do boards rein in excess CEO returns? Introducing a social capital view of board monitoring, we suggest that boards face two competing normative pressures - corporate elite norms and monitoring norms. How boards conform to such normative pressures for controlling excess CEO returns is affected by their external and internal social capital. Further, we substantiate our arguments by showing that powerful CEOs and institutional investors may facilitate or constrain the normative pressures existing in the social network and alter the effects of board social capital on excess CEO returns. Data from a sample of U.S. corporations listed on the Standard and Poor's 1,500 index from 1999 to 2010 largely support our framework. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Reporting requirements, targets, and quotas have been implemented in several countries to increase female representation in leadership. In three studies, we analyze the effectiveness of these strategies from a goal-setting perspective. Study 1 evaluates the relationship between reporting requirements and female representation on boards of directors with data from Fortune 500 companies from 1996 to 2015. Study 2 analyzes the association of reporting requirements, targets, and quotas with the representation of women on boards of directors of public companies across 91 countries. Study 3 evaluates the impact of targets and quotas for women in parliaments across 190 nations. The board diversity reporting directive introduced in the US was followed by an acceleration in the increase of female representation on boards of directors of Fortune 500 companies. Higher goals for women on boards of directors were related to higher female representation. Similarly, higher gender goals and strong enforcement mechanisms in parliaments were related to higher female representation. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper explores the interaction between a prominent board of directors and the network of inter-firm relationships on new product development. Specifically, we posit a positive interaction effect between a prominent board and the inter-firmnetwork and structural holes positions on the number of newproducts developed by the firm. We test the theoretical framework on a sample of 1758 agreements among 1890 biopharmaceutical firms over the period 2006-2010.We find that by filtering, complementing and legitimizing information coming from the inter-firm network, a prominent interlocking directorate network can improve the inter-firm network's effects on new product development. We discuss important implications for how inter-personal networks (such as the board interlock directorate network) help to develop the effectiveness of inter-firm relationship networks in achieving new product development outcomes.

Agency theory-grounded research on boards of directors and firm legitimacy has historically viewed CEO power as de-legitimating, often taking this fact for granted in theorizing about external assessors' evaluations of a firm. With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be. Data from 151 U.S. semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms over a 10-year period generally support our predictions. (c) 2016 Academy of Management Journal.

How do a country's basic institutions enable or hinder women's rise to the boards of public companies? The study evaluates this question with reference to the five basic institutions that research suggests are common across all countries: family, education, economy, government, and religion. The study draws on a sample, which consists of 23 countries, and the study is framed in neo-institutional theory. In analyzing the role of these institutions, the article seeks to understand better the relationships between specific institutions and the share of board seats held by women. The results suggest that four of the five basic institutions are related to the share of board seats women hold. Family, education, economy, and government influence women's rise to the board; however, religion does not influence women's rise to the corporate board of directors.

Research summary: Many boards view their chairs as valuable resources. We predict that whether a board adopts such a view depends on the board chair's human and social capital. Data from S&P 500 firms suggest that while a board chair's human capital increases the probability that the board views him or her as a resource, social capital has no overall effect. In a post-hoc investigation, however, we find the board chair's independence to be an important boundary condition for the effect of social capital. With this exploratory research, we aim to spur research devoted specifically to board chairs. Such research will become increasingly important over time as firms continue to separate their CEO and board chair positions. Managerial summary: The purpose of this research was to determine the factors that lead a board of directors to view its chair as a valuable resource. We expected that board chairs with high human and social capital would be more likely to be viewed as a resource by their colleagues. Surprisingly, only human capital exhibited such an effect overall. Social capital increases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is independent, but actually decreases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is either the current or former CEO. These results suggest that boards generally value human capital in their chairs, but view social capital through a somewhat more complex lens. We explore the possible implications of these findings in the article. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Previous studies report inconsistent findings regarding how board monitoring influences firms' research and development (R&D) intensity. This study uses agency theory and resource dependence theory to argue that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between these two constructs. By using board capital theory, the present study also postulates that this curvilinear relationship varies depending on the firm- and industry-specific human capital of outside directors. 467 firm-year observations collected from a randomly selected sample of large public firms from high-tech industries between 2005 and 2010 largely provide empirical support for these arguments. The findings contribute to the corporate governance literature by refining the understanding of the costs and benefits associated with board monitoring. The curvilinear relationship reported herein may also help reconcile prior inconsistent findings. The results also contribute to board capital theory by emphasizing the role of outside directors' firm-specific human capital in the context of R&D investments. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: Board interlocks are a phenomenon of widespread prevalence and one of the most vibrant topics in corporate governance research. However, despite sustained academic interest in interlocks, there has not been a comprehensive review of the literature in nearly two decades. To address this need for an up-to-date review, this paper aims to conduct an assessment and integration of the empirical research on board interlocks. Design/methodology/approach: In reviewing the board interlocks literature, the "systematic review" approach, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, has been used. Using this method, 81 empirical papers that became the focus of this analysis have been identified. Findings: This review reveals that board interlocks research can be categorized based on the theoretical lens used, its focus on antecedents or outcomes of interlock activities and the perspective of the study (i.e. firm- or director-level). Moreover, a number of commonly examined themes have been identified. Several unexpected omissions in the literature have also been uncovered. For instance, it was found that scholars have neither examined the implications of engaging in interlocks in a global context nor have they explored the phenomenon of international interlocks (i.e. interlocks between firms located in different countries). Originality/value: In developing a deeper understanding of the board interlocks literature, this review identifies several topics and disciplines that, if pursued, could enrich the literature and open promising avenues for future research.

Chinese listed companies have a two-tier (dual) governance structure that comprises a supervisory board/committee (SB) and the board of directors (BoD). However, as there is no hierarchical relationship between them, the two boards are independent. This is different from the governance mechanism in Continental Europe in which the SB appoints the directors of the management board; in this sense, the Chinese two-tier governance structure is unique. We investigate the impact of governance characteristics and ownership structure on gender diversity of both the BoD and the SB for a sample of 892 Chinese Initial Public Offerings floated in both the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. We find that the average proportion of female directors and female SB members on the BoD and the SB are 10 and 22 %, respectively. Using both static and dynamic panel data methods, we find that there is no significant impact of board structure on gender diversity in China. However, we find a positive and significant relationship between SB size and gender diversity. We also find that the higher the state ownership, the lower the female representation on both boards. Finally, our findings show that there is a bi-directional relationship between financial performance and the proportion of female directors sitting on the BoD.

Research summary: We examine how board members' reactions following financial misconduct differ from those following other adverse organizational events, such as poor performance. We hypothesize that inside directors and directors appointed by the CEO may be particularly concerned about their reputation following deceptive financial practices. We demonstrate that directors more closely affiliated with the CEO are more likely to reduce their support for the CEO following financial misconduct, increasing the likelihood of CEO replacement. Enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act similarly alters governance dynamics by creating a greater expectation for sound corporate governance. We demonstrate our findings in U.S. public firms that restated their financial earnings during a 12-year period before and after the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley. Managerial summary: Given past concerns about lack of oversight by boards of directors leading to firm financial misconduct, we examine how the relationship between directors and CEOs may be altered in the face of such misconduct. We argue that directors most closely tied to the CEO (inside board members and board members appointed by the CEO), typically the most supportive of the CEO, may become most concerned about their own reputation following financial misconduct. We find that CEOs receive less support from these directors, a finding in contrast to past studies demonstrating that such board members tend to shield CEOs following poor performance. These findings are accentuated following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which places greater responsibility on the CEO for the accuracy of financial reports.

We advance the literature on the demographic factors that shape organizational outcomes by analyzing the impact of the gender composition of firm leadership on the likelihood that a firm will adopt lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)-friendly policies. Drawing on social role and token theory, we test the relative impact of CEO gender and the gender composition of the board of directors separately and together in order to identify the effects of gender diversity at the top of the organization. We rely on a unique data set that includes corporate policies (gender identity and sexual orientation non-discrimination policies, domestic-partner benefits, and overall corporate equality index scores) as well as the gender of the CEO and board of directors among Fortune 500 firms over a 10-year period. Our findings suggest that firms with gender-diverse boards are more likely than other firms to offer LGBT-friendly policies, whereas findings for firms with women CEOs offer mixed results.

This study examines how firms use benchmarking information about peers to determine the compensation that they offer to chief executive officers (CEOs). It jointly addresses two distinct perspectives: pay equity and managerial power. Pay inequity provides strong motivation for CEOs to restore equity, by promoting the logic of external fairness and urging boards of directors to implement peer benchmarking and adjust the focal CEO's compensation levels. Although pay inequity may motivate CEOs to restore equity, their reaction to inequity may be effective only when they have sufficient power over the board of directors to influence the pay-setting process. Results from a sample of 1,555 CEOs generally support predictions about the moderating effects of CEO power in the relationship between a focal CEO's pay and peer CEOs' pay. The compensation for underpaid CEOs with relatively greater power over the board is associated with their peers' compensation, suggesting that peer benchmarking is more aggressively used to adjust CEO compensation upward. For overpaid CEOs, the relationship between the focal CEO's pay and peer CEOs' pay is weaker when the CEOs have greater influence over the board, suggesting that such CEOs are able to avoid the use of benchmarking and downward adjustments of pay.

Research summary: We develop a theory to explain why new outside CEOs can better manage their relationship with the board if they previously served on boards that were more diverse than the focal board. We predict that a new outside CEO's prior experience with more diverse boards not only reduces the likelihood of post-succession CEO turnover and director turnover, but also improves firm performance. Results from an analysis of 188 outside CEOs in a sample of Fortune 500 companies provide support for our theory. This study contributes to upper echelon theory and research by identifying outside CEOs' prior experience with board diversity as an important aspect of their background that influences a range of major organizational outcomes, including CEO turnover, director turnover, and firm performance. Managerial summary: It is challenging to be a new CEO who comes from outside of the organization. Our study examines why some new outside CEOs fare better than others. We suggest that a positive relationship with the board of directors is a key factor in a new outside CEO's success. A new outside CEO can better manage the relationship with the board if he or she has prior experience working with other demographically diverse boards. In contrast, when the focal board is more diverse than the other boards on which the new CEO previously served, the new CEO tends to struggle in managing his or her relationship with the board, experiencing a higher likelihood of turnover and delivering worse financial performance.

Recent research on the actual behaviour of boards suggests that more attention should be given to group dynamics in boards of directors. Therefore, we investigate if faultlines are detrimental to the role performance of boards of directors in family firms. In contrast to previous studies that only focus on one attribute, we use a more encompassing measure of faultlines, which is based on three attributes simultaneously (family-membership, type of directorship, and gender). Furthermore, we investigate the moderating role of formal board evaluation. Findings suggest a negative relationship between faultlines and both board control and service role performance. Interestingly, our study indicates that in boards that use formal evaluations, the negative effect of faultlines on control role performance is reversed. We discuss implications for faultline theory and research on boards of directors. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Although corporate governance researchers have devoted considerable attention to the role of boards of directors in monitoring management and providing resources, less attention has been paid to whether and how they affect the strategic actions of firms in response to changing environments. Taking a process-based perspective, we examine how several prevalent board processes (i.e., board meetings, outside-board-meeting reviewws and information utilization) affect the involvement of boards in strategic decision-making and how such involvement shapes organizational performance. Moreover, we offer an initial attempt to compare the strategic role of boards in for-profit and non-profit organizations. An investigation of 217 for-profit and 156 non-profit organizations in Canada indicates that different processes lead boards to different levels of strategic involvement, and that such effects are contingent on the types of organizations concerned. Moreover, boards that are active in strategic decision-making enhance the performance of their organizations. Our findings have implications for board research and practice.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to define the contribution of intellectual capital (IC) of the board of directors (BDs) in generating IC of a company, to develop a definition of the IC of the BDs, as well as two of its major elements: human capital (knowledge, skills, and experience of board members, etc.), and social capital (relationships and networking opportunities of board members), and to clarify the relationship between these elements and financial performance indicators of companies based on a literature review on the topic. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review and analysis was applied as this study's research design. Findings: The authors suggest that IC is generated not only by company staff, but also by governing bodies, particularly the BDs, whose members are not always under contract with the company in the traditional sense. Members of the board use their knowledge, experience, and networking opportunities to build IC for effective monitoring, advising, and providing the company with resources. In this sense, the BDs serves as a source of IC for a company, being the main internal corporate governance mechanism that leads to value creation in a company, taking into consideration the interests of all stakeholders. Practical implications: The research indicates that the personal characteristics of board members may influence the performance of a company. Therefore, companies should be recommended to carefully select candidates for nomination to the board. Originality/value: This study contributes to further development of the concept of IC of the BDs by bringing together the theory in the field and the empirical results of studies on the various elements of board capital in a company's value creation.

New ventures often form a formal board of directors for the first time at the initial public offering (IPO). The tumult of external changes places a premium on rapid decision making within a resource-constrained venture. According to the social psychological theory, group consensus and decision alternatives serve as two key drivers for making rapid decisions. Therefore, based on signaling theory, the valuation from investors at the IPO depends on the observable signals that can imply the group consensus and decision alternatives in a board. We argue and test the hypothesis that, when group consensus and decision alternative signals are jointly considered, the relationship between the ratio of founders on the board and the IPO price premium will have an inversed U shape. In addition, we analyze how three contextual factors (original chief executive officer [CEO], founders' ownership, and venture capitalist [VC] on the board) can influence their signal consistency with founder directors on group consensus and decision alternatives, which ultimately changes the pattern of the inverted U shape. Based on a unique sample of 274 Chinese new venture IPOs over the period from 2004 to 2009, our results show that if the firm is managed by a nonoriginal CEO, the relationship between the founder-board ratio and the IPO price premium is an inverse U shape. Furthermore, if a VC sits on the board, the presence of founder directors has a linear positive effect on IPO premium; otherwise, the inverse U-shaped relationship still holds.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the influence of information and knowledge exchange and sharing between managers and non-executive directors is important in assessing the dynamic processes of accountability in boardrooms. By analysing information/knowledge at multiple levels, invoking the literature on implicit/tacit and explicit information/knowledge, the authors show that information asymmetry is a necessary condition for effective boards. The authors introduce a conceptual model of manager-non-executive director information asymmetry as an outcome of the interpretation of information/knowledge-sharing processes amongst board members. The model provides a more nuanced agenda of the management-board information asymmetry problem to enable a better understanding of the role of different types of information in practice. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation and the resultant conceptual model are based on the following elements: manager-non-executive director information/knowledge, management-board information/knowledge and board dynamics and reciprocal processes converting implicit/tacit into explicit information/knowledge. Findings - The paper provides new insights into the dynamics of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors (individual level)/between management and boards (group level). The authors characterise this as a two-way process, back-and-forth between managers/executive directors and non-executive directors. The importance of relative/experienced "ignorance" of non-executive directors is revealed, which the authors term the "information asymmetry paradox". Research limitations/implications - The authors set out key opportunities for developing a research agenda from the model based on prior research of knowledge conversion processes and how these may be applied in a boardroom setting. Practical implications - The model may assist directors in better understanding their roles and the division of labour between managers and non-executive directors from an information/knowledge perspective. Originality/value - The authors apply Ikujiro Nonaka's knowledge conversion framework to consider the transitioning from individual implicit personal to explicit shared information/knowledge, to understand the subtle processes at play in boardrooms influencing information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: How do conflicting institutional logics predict and explain the overstatement of corporate governance compliance in a developing country?. Research Findings/Insights: A unique opportunity to study overstatement of compliance is available through checklists published in annual reports by companies in Bangladesh. A data set contrasting with that available from checklists is collected by a confidential survey of company secretaries. Overstatement of compliance with the country's Corporate Governance Guideline issued in 2006 is measured by comparing the published compliance with that revealed by the survey. There is significant overstatement of compliance in annual reports, particularly with respect to the less directly observable provisions of the Guideline. The overstatement is positively associated with control by a sponsor family and is negatively associated with the presence of an institutional investor on the board of directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The logic associated with the regulative framework of an Anglo-American-based corporate governance model conflicts with the logic of a cultural-cognitive institutional framework in a developing country. The resulting contest of legitimacy motivates firms to overstate compliance with the Corporate Governance Guideline 2006 in annual reports. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study highlights the challenges of introducing an Anglo-American model of corporate governance in a developing country. National and international investors should seek to understand the reality of the corporate governance structure of firms in developing countries, rather than relying solely on compliance reported in annual reports. For researchers, there may be limitations in using the compliance reported in annual reports as a measure of corporate governance. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine in greater depth the concept of "board capital", which the authors consider to be a bundle of three types of capital, and believe to be a clear antecedent of the board's ability to perform its roles, which have positive consequences for the firm's performance. Design/methodology/approach: Through 83 firms listed on The Madrid Stock Exchange during the period 2005-2010, the authors test empirically the relationships between different dimensions of board capital and firm performance, and specially how internal social capital moderates the relationships between board human capital and external social capital with firm performance. Findings: The results show that certain characteristics of human capital (average board tenure) and external social capital (directors' interlocks) are positively related to the firm performance. The empirical findings also indicate that the internal social capital, measured by board density, is positively related to the firm performance and moderates these above relationships, increasing the potential of the resources contributed by the board members and influencing to a large extent on a firm's performance. Practical implications: The results of the investigation will help both executives and scholar in two ways. First, they will assist firms when they have to select board members, as they can now understand how the resources that board members bring with them can affect the firm performance. To be more effective, boards need to have members that have experience as firm's directors, external connections to other boards and many internal ties among them. Second, in this context, internal social capital is especially relevant, so the firms should look for possible ways of encouraging internal ties between directors. In this paper, the authors have opted for study the participation of directors in committees. Originality/value: The authors propose that these three types of capital (human, external and internal social capital) need to be synergistically combined to create a group of directors with access to a complete set of skills, knowledge and connections, but which can still work as a compact social group when making decisions.

This paper examines the firm-level antecedents of Six Sigma adoption in Korea. Our results indicate that firms with top executives and board members having work experience in the foreign country where the focal management practice originated and was popularized are more likely to adopt this practice. Furthermore, firms' exposure to foreign investors exerts a direct effect and also moderates the impact of foreign work experience on adoption. Prior work experience in the country of practice origin reduces the uncertainty inherent in cross-border adoption by providing executives and board members with greater insight into the presumed benefits of the focal practice.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether board-related characteristics matter for cost efficiency in banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of publicly traded US commercial banks and savings institutions to estimate a relationship between cost efficiency measured by stochastic frontier analysis and a set of board-related characteristics for the period 2007-2013. Findings: An inverted U-shape relation is found between board size and efficiency. Thus, there is a trade-off between costs and benefits of larger boards. Optimal board size is higher for banks with more complex operations. This study also observed an inverted U-shape relation between board independence and cost efficiency. The banks where the Chairman also executes the CEO responsibility show lower efficiency. However, a higher proportion of independent board members in banks with unitary leadership structure may mitigate the conflict of interest and lower efficiency stemming from CEO duality. Research limitations/implications: This study's evidence supports the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision emphasis on advising a board composition that provides for a sufficient degree of director independence. Practical Implications: The results are relevant for banks and their external and internal stakeholders. Banks may adjust their current board characteristics to increase the board effectiveness. Externally, potential investors can evaluate the quality of corporate governance of banks before making investment decisions. The empirical findings can also be useful for regulators imposing corporate governance codes in banking. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide empirical evidence on the impact of board characteristics on bank efficiency for a wide panel of US banks. Additionally, a comprehensive set of board-related variables is used. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study presents evidence of the influence of gender diversity on the pay system and the monitoring of executives in Spain. In this country/context, characterized by a few male dominant shareholders acting simultaneously as executives, there is an ongoing discussion regarding the enactment of laws to promote gender equality on the boards of directors of large listed companies. This paper presents several contributions. On the one hand, the scarce previous evidence on this topic is focused on US firms. On the other hand, this study includes the role of ownership structure as a factor that indirectly moderates the relationships between gender diversity on board and monitoring effectiveness in terms of executive directors' compensation. Furthermore, this paper makes an important effort to control endogeneity. The sample examined includes 120 companies listed on the Spanish stock market during the period 2004-2011. The results show a positive and highly significant effect of the presence of women independent directors on the proportion of variable pay in the compensation of executive directors. Our findings also point out the negative moderating effect of ownership concentration: the more concentrated is ownership in the hands of internal majority shareholder, the less is the link between board diversity and pay-for-performance systems.

In this study, we examine how board characteristics, such as the independent director ratio, board size, and the number of interlocks, influence the investment of slack resources into research and development (R&D) by a firm. Both the agency theory and resource dependence theory predict a positive influence of independent director ratio on the financial slack-R&D investment relationship. However in the case of board size and number of interlocks, resource dependence theory argues for a positive moderating effect, while agency theory predicts a negative effect. The hypotheses are tested on the seven-year panel data of 172 firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry, an emerging economy, high technology industry. We find broad support for the resource provisioning role of the board of directors, which is attributed to the emerging economy context of the Indian pharmaceutical industry, where firms face high levels of opportunity but lack resources to make use of them effectively.

This paper provides new evidence of innovation processes in family firms by investigating their attitude toward the protection of innovation outputs. More specifically, the main objective is to understand, through the SEW (Socioemotional Wealth) lens, whether innovative family firms tend to use patents as a tool for protecting intellectual property. Based on a sample of 229 Italian companies that make R&D investments, our analysis highlights that degree of alignment with the family business model is a significant predictor of a firm's attitude toward protecting innovation with patents, even though not all of the dimensions of a family business have the same effect. When disentangling the effect of three different indicators (i.e., family ownership, family governance and the presence of young successors), family involvement in the board of directors is a negative significant driver, the presence of young successors is a positive driver, and ownership has no effect.

Research summary: The formation of interorganizational ties is a consequential phenomenon examined in strategic management research. Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips (2004) is one of the first studies to comprehensively consider interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect both alliance and board interlock formation. They find that firm-specific uncertainty relates to broadening actions, whereas market-level uncertainty causes firms to reinforce current structures. Our replication considers whether these relationships operate similarly in a differing temporal context. Building from the framework of the original study, we suggest our findings offer intriguing new empirical evidence highlighting the importance of time as a boundary condition in understanding embedded firm actions. Managerial summary: The development of interorganizational relationships, such as alliances and ties between boards of directors, has an important impact on innovation, strategic actions, and firm performance. This study examines whether the dynamics of interorganizational relationship formation remain consistent over time. We replicate earlier work by Beckman and colleagues (2004), but with an expanded data set covering more than 20 years. Over this broader time horizon, we find a shift in behavior, with companies facing firm-specific uncertainty seeking to reinforce their current relationships and companies facing industry-wide uncertainty seeking to diversify their risk by expanding their network. Our results demonstrate the importance of replication studies in research and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding interorganizational relationships.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of cognitive diversity on strategic issue interpretation among the boards of directors making sense of sustainability management. The study also investigated the centrality of the corporate sustainability issues to identify common interpretative patterns in the shared cognitive maps among the companies. In addition, the aim was to advance quantitative methods for the analysis of decision-makers' cognition. Design/methodology/approach - The research was an exploratory study analyzing 43 individual cognitive maps collected through surveys from the boards of nine cleantech companies. For the elicitation of the cognitive maps, the study used the hybrid cognitive mapping technique. The diversity of the shared cognitive maps was analyzed using the distance ratio formula and the graph analysis method with eigenvector to measure the centrality of the strategic issue interpretation in the maps. Findings - This study provides evidence through the analysis of distance ratios on the existence of cognitive diversity among companies within the same industry. Surprisingly, despite the cognitive diversity, the study identified strong common patterns on strategic issue interpretations among the companies. In addition, the study shows that the sustainability management issues have gained minor attention from the boards of directors. Research limitations/implications - The initial industry sample provided relatively restricted perspectives on managerial cognition, and to confirm the findings regarding the effects of industry on the shared cognitive maps of top decision-makers, wider industry-level data are needed. Practical implications - This study provides an approach to facilitate the process of strategic decision-making for top decision-makers by identifying the shared beliefs of the selected strategic theme and to concentrate on the most central strategic issues in the company and industry. It reveals asymmetry between the significance of sustainability issues in an open agenda and the real position of sustainability concepts in the shared cognitive maps in the green industry. Also, the study advances cognitive mapping techniques for application in the board's decision-making. Originality/value - This paper contributes to brightening the black box of corporate governance by shedding light on the interaction of the concepts of corporate sustainability and other key strategic issues within the shared cognitive maps of the boards. It also provides new empirical knowledge on top decision-making processes and the effects of cognitive diversity on the strategic issue interpretations within the corporate boards of the green industry, and it further develops the methodology for the quantification of cognitive diversity and the content of cognitive maps.

The growing importance of board diversity among directors has been established as a result of global financial crisis in 2008. According to the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance 2012, nominating committee shall be responsible to select directors with diverse background that meet the needs of the company. This paper attempts to examine the impacts of having female directors in a nomination committee on gender diversity on board. For this purpose, 393 (50%) non-financial Malaysian listed companies were selected for the three year period of 2011 to 2013. Results indicated that having female directors in a nomination committee is significantly related to the level of gender diversity on board. The results also signify the importance to have female directors in nomination committee as it will influence gender diversity on board. (c) 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

The question of whether a "good" corporate board structure can optimize performance and minimize conflicts between managers and shareholders has been widely debated. Because mergers and acquisitions represent major managerial investment decisions that are subject to board scrutiny, the effectiveness of a board's structure is especially visible in the context of corporate acquisitions. With that in mind, in this paper, we examine the abundant literature in the fields of strategic management, economics, and finance in order to identify which board attributes contribute to the ability of corporate boards to create value through mergers and acquisitions. In particular, we discuss the impact of four board attributes: (1) board independence, (2) board size and director-specific attributes, (3) board ownership and compensation, (4) multiple directorships. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the impact of board attributes on shareholder wealth in mergers and acquisitions is specific to each firm. Therefore, board regulations that do not reflect a firm's specific needs may in fact hinder the creation of a board that is capable of responding effectively to the firm's unique needs and circumstances.

This paper examines the effects of board quality on the relationship between corporate bankruptcy and nomination committee effectiveness. We argue that the proportion of outside directors, a proxy of board quality, arguably captures the extent of board control and resources. Based on dataset from 1835 firm-year observations for 98 bankrupt and 269 non-bankrupt UK listed non-financial firms between 1994 and 2011 and using the agency and resource dependence theories, we predict and find that nomination committee effectiveness negatively affects corporate bankruptcy and that board quality mitigates the negative effects. The results lend support to the notion that firms benefit from board quality in terms of outside directors' ability to monitor CEO on behalf of shareholders and also provide advice, counsel and legitimacy to the firm. This study extends the present research on corporate bankruptcy by providing evidence on the impact of board quality and nomination committee effectiveness on UK corporate bankruptcy.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study whether and how owners' preferences for CEO characteristics changed due to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. The authors identify three fundamental success factors needed for companies to compete in the after-crisis environment, and the authors connect five CEO characteristics to such factors. Design/methodology/approach - The authors rely on a hand-collected database to build a panel data of European CEOs for the 2010-2012 period. Findings - The empirical results indicate that after 2009, CEOs of companies that were more severely hit by the crisis are significantly different compared to those of other companies. More specifically, they have a background in science or engineering; they have international experience; and they are remunerated to a higher extent through stock options. The results of this paper also indicate that only international experience had a positive and significant impact on financial performance. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the stream of literature on CEO characteristics and owners' identity, tackling the research theme from a dynamic rather than from a static perspective.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms of corporate governance in companies and to delineate their effect from the perspective of two variables: the financial performance of firms; and an examination of executive turnover. An analysis on theoretical grounds of these two variables is made with respect to non-financial companies specifically in the context of the country of Jordan. Also in the context of this study, a company represents a firm. A sample comprising 109 companies from the non-financial sector for the fiscal year 2011 was selected and analyzed. A cross sectional study tested all hypotheses of the study and used statistical software, SPSS 20, to analyze the data. The study has examined the structure of the board of directors and its effects on the financial performance (financial leverage) of the non-financial Jordanian companies. Evidence suggests that the corporate governance mechanisms such as increasing the board size has a positive effect on reducing the level of financial leverage, thus leading to enhanced levels of financial performance. On the other hand, board independence and the structure of non CEOduality have no effect on a company's financial performance. In addition, the findings revealed that executive turnover has been found to significantly moderate the relationship between some of the factors and that is the board size and financial leverage. Given the diversity of trends utilized to measure the financial performance of companies in the area of corporate governance and the associated performance relationship, empirical research has continued to undergo new financial performance indicators to prevent manipulation and to obtain a realistic picture of the financial performance of companies. Hence, this is the first study that internationally chooses financial leverage to represent the financial performance of companies in their relationship with corporate governance. Crucially, it is globally the first study to choose executive turnover as a moderating variable on such a relationship. Thus, choosing these two new variables uniquely contributes to the literature of both corporate governance and firm performance from the perspective of developed and developing countries. This is considered to extend and add new insights to prior research in this discipline. The study therefore provides empirical evidence to policy-makers, stakeholders, academia and other interested parties in the Middle East; specifically in Jordan.

Purpose - The chapter builds on the literature of Agency and Signalling Theories to analyse the corporate governance factors associated with the voluntary decision to prepare an Integrated Report according to the International Framework promoted by the IIRC. Methodology/approach - The chapter is based on the results of a probit regression run with regard to a sample of 35 companies that joined the Pilot Programme in 2011 and 137 similar companies that did not. Findings - The analysis of two samples of European companies reveals that adhesion to the IR Pilot Programme is positively related to the gender diversity and size of the board. Research limitations - Further research is required in order to study the differences between listed and non-listed companies in terms of variables affecting the adoption of the Framework and to increase the time range of our study. In addition, it would be interesting to include other variables capturing different aspects other than corporate governance, since the decision to join the Programme, as the results of our analysis have shown, may also be influenced by other factors, such as strategy decisions and communication policies. Originality/value - The chapter adds to the existing literature by showing the main governance characteristics that impact the decision to adhere to the IR Pilot Programme. It is also important to the existing literature regarding the role played by gender diversity in corporate governance mechanisms and CSR policies.

Initiation and support from boardrooms are factors that are important to a Taiwanese firm's ability to change its strategic orientation from manufacturing to branding. We examine whether board members' educational backgrounds contribute to firms' branding success. We find that firms are more likely to be successful in brand development when their board members have been educated at top-ranked universities, foreign universities, and top MBA programs. The results are more robust when branding is successful at a global rather than a domestic level. Our argument is further supported by the finding that the educational background of board members is more relevant for branding success in industries with more mature branding practices.

This study seeks to determine the impact of the implementation of good corporate governance practices on the family business Board of Directors, observing the impact on the family socioemotional wealth. Using four cases study from family businesses in Colombia-South America, the results show that the implementations of corporate governance practices in the Board of Directors have strong tendencies to preserve the family's socioemotional wealth. Furthermore, unity, honesty, transparency and amity are factors boosting both family and business success.

We examine the relationship between the board of directors and earnings persistence. We define the advisory role of board members as providing strategic counsel to top management. We argue that strategic counseling provided by the board helps create and sustain growth, which, in turn, translates into more persistent earnings. We find that for firms whose boards are dedicated to advising, earnings are more persistent and the association between earnings and future cash flows is higher, compared with firms whose boards are not focused on advising. We further find that advising by boards increases the persistence of both the cash flows component and the accruals component of current earnings. In additional analyses, we fail to find a consistently positive correlation between boards with intensive monitoring and more persistent earnings. Putting together, these results suggest that the relation between board structure and earnings persistence is more likely driven by the advisory role and less likely by the monitoring function of the board of directors.

Despite extensive research on the internationalization-performance relationship, our understanding of the role of board of directors in the internationalization of emerging-market firms remains relatively limited. In addition, research pertaining to the board's influence on firm performance has tended to focus more on board content than on its processes. In an attempt to address this research gap, we study the contingent role of the board's capabilities on the relationship between internationalization and performance, in emerging-market firms. We propose that board tenure will have a negative moderating effect, whereas board members' experience as CEO or general manager, industry-specific experience, international experience, and level of academic achievement will have positive moderating effects. We argue that, in the context of emerging market firms, board interactions are particularly important, and propose that moderate levels of board interaction will be most beneficial for the internationalizationperformance relationship.

Committees on a board of directors are now subject to recommendations by regulations in practically all jurisdictions. At the same time, scholarly work on the topic has escalated since the mid-1990s. In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

This study examines the degree to which senior executive members of a school's decision-making team (senior management team and board of directors) are aligned on fundamental principles of school strategy. Our study is based on a conceptual framework of strategic leadership as it applies in an Australian independent school context. We also examine the differences between the senior management team and board of directors based on top management team (TMT) tenure heterogeneity, and how these differences account for TMT associations with school strategy. Implications for research and practice complete the study. The terms top management team, senior management team, and senior leadership team are used interchangeably in this article.

The aim of this paper is to determine to what extent globalization pressures are changing interlocking directorate networks modeled on continental capitalism into Anglo-Saxon models. For this purpose we analyse the Spanish network of interlocks, comparing the present structure (2012) with that of 1993 and 2006. We show how, although Spanish corporative structure continues to display characteristics of the continental economies, some major banks are significantly reducing industrial activity. Nevertheless, the financial organizations continue to maintain a close relationship with sectors such as construction and services. The analysis of the network of directorates shows a retreat in activity of industrial banking in Spain. Two large Spanish financial institutions, BSCH and La Caixa, continue to undertake activities of industrial banking in 2006, but this activity is significantly reduced in 2012. According to the theories on the role of the interlocking directorates, the companies in these sectors assure their access to banking credit by incorporating advisors from financial organizations to their board of directors. We cannot conclude that the structure of the Spanish corporate network has become a new case of Anglo-Saxon structure, but we got indications that are becoming less hierarchic as banks seem to slowly abandon centrality positions. This is especially salient if we compare the networks of 2006 and 2012, which show a continuing decrease of the role of banks and insurance companies in the network.

The importance of the composition of the Board of Directors of an organization is an issue that has received special attention in recent years. Studies about the effect of the presence of independent managers, managers of different ethnic groups and different genders, seek to determine whether a diverse management will have different approaches and opinions that may enrich the process of decision making and improve the performance of the company. In the particular case of women participation, there are previous studies on this matter for developed economies. However, there are no studies about countries such as Peru, characterized by a dominance of male figures in the business world. The role that women have played during the past few years in the Peruvian business environment has gained special importance and serves as motivation for this study to determine if their presence on the Board has any effect on the performance of the company, especially on its financial dimension. Using a sample of 137 non-financial companies listed on the Lima Stock Exchange, the main results show that female participation in the Board does not significantly affect the financial performance of an organization.

The appointment of a new CEO is among the most pivotal and visible decisions made by the board of directors. Yet while much research explores how firm performance, governance structures, and types of succession affect the appointment decision, we have less understanding of the influence of contextual factors such as external constituents. This paper is the first to explore how one key constituent -investment analysts -may shape the appointment decision, specifically through serving as an information intermediary for the board. Because CEO succession creates uncertainty regarding the firm's future leadership and its strategic direction, I propose that investment analysts, as knowledgeable experts who provide research coverage on the firm, provide the board with information that is likely to influence their selection of a new CEO. In addition, I argue that because analysts are recognized as having expertise regarding the future performance of the firm, the board is likely to select a CEO in order to appease these critical stakeholders. Using panel data on S & P 500 companies for the 2000-2005 periods, I find evidence that analyst recommendations convey information about a firm's top management and the appropriateness of its strategy that is reflected in the appointment decision. Specifically, I find that more negative analyst ratings lead to a higher probability that the board will appoint an outsider CEO and also make the board more likely to appoint a high status CEO.

The previous literature suggests that firms may use the characteristics of the board members as a signal for building their own image. The objective of this paper is to analyze whether the number of appointments of directors influences corporate reputation. For that, we focus on a sample of US firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the period 2007-2010 and we examine a total of 30,813 directors. Our results indicate that there is a curvilinear relationship between the number of directorships of board members and corporate reputation. These findings shed some light on the value of boards of directors and also have implications for companies in the selection of board members. (c) 2016 Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

Following poorly performing acquisitions, the board of directors often redesigns the CEO's annual compensation package to include less risk-encouraging stock options and more risk-discouraging restricted stock. This study explores the emerging area of post-acquisition compensation management and proposes that CEOs can indirectly, but effectively, defend against compensation rebalancing. Specifically, we find that CEOs may counteract the effects of compensation rebalancing by delaying the exercise of existing stock option holdings. Fortunately, this insight also offers valuable implications including the ability of the board to limit the CEO's defense by adjusting stock option exercise windows.

The purpose of corporate governance mechanisms is to prevent opportunistic behaviour by managers, in order to align the interests of owners and managers. Following from this, our research topic is the analysis of ownership concentration as an internal mechanism to protect the interests of shareholders. In the study of the interdependence between ownership concentration and shareholder protection, particular importance needs to be given to the relationship between ownership structure, the role of the board, and strategic decision-making. Starting from this interdependence, our research aim is to examine the impact of ownership concentration on the protection of shareholders' interests and the board's responsibility for firm strategy. This paper presents the results of an empirical, pilot study in the Republic of Serbia. The research confirms the interdependence of corporate governance mechanisms and strategic decision-making. Our findings indicate that ownership concentration protects majority shareholder interests and leads to lower board responsibility for strategic decision-making.

Manuscript type: Empirical Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically determine whether the one-rule-fits-all approached adopted by the Nigerian Securities Exchange Commission in terms of the separation of board chairman form the CEO promotes firm performance irrespective of the firms' ownership structures, in Nigerian with strong dominance of family owned firms. Design/methodology/approach: The study is restricted to firms quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Pooled data for 18-years period 1994-2011 were collated from published annual reports and statement of accounts of 91 ownership dispersed firms and 72 ownership concentrated firms. Two equation system Ordinary Least Square multiple regressions were used to estimate the relationship between firm financial performance and CEO duality along ownership structures in Nigeria. Findings: The findings of the study showed that while board duality was negative in predicting the financial performance of ownership dispersed firms; same cannot be said of ownership concentrated firms (family owned firms) as duality was found to be positive in predicting financial performance. Research Limitations/Implications: Paucity of substantial local literature on institutional perspective of agency constitutes the major limitation of this study. Although, this study is meant to close this gap, the implication is that foreign theoretical and empirical literature standpoint constitutes the bulk of the review, which may not explain reasons for any identifiable local trends in Nigeria. Practical Implication: The study reveals the importance of taking into cognizance, institutional perspective of agency theory in solving the excess power assigned to the board of directors, especially for family owned firms, where the family members have strong incentive to monitor the managers. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the institutional perspective of agency theory from Nigerian institutional perspective. The study revealed the importance of accommodating individual country specificities in draft corporate governance laws. (c) 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

From the Agency Theory point of view, the role of the board of directors is critical for supervision as well as for the control performed over management, preventing opportunistic behavior by shareholders in general and particularly by controlling shareholders against minority shareholders. Some corporate scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Nortel Networks and AIG, among others) have led to a growing interest on the quality of corporate government because all of those failed firms showed failures in their corporate governance. The delimitation of board functions and the identification of new good practices that allow them to perform their role properly and efficiently is one of the main challenges for governments and regulators in order to ensure their control mechanism duties, whilst restoring the confidence of decision-makers (investors and creditors). In fact, scholarly literature on the subject has linked board performance to different issues (for instance: board structure, nomination practices, diversity, experience and training, internationalization, incentives, remuneration, or board committees). Below is a review of the principles, practices and proposals arisen at the international context to improve board of directors' practices. The purpose of this overview is to point out the main challenges for the future in this regard. (c) 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

Corporations are increasingly being pressured to manage their business risks including their social and environmental risks. The aim of this study is to examine the extent to which plantation companies in Malaysia address their social and environmental risks and the role of the board of directors in motivating the disclosure of risk management information. The agency theory was used to underpin arguments for the study. Content analyses of the annual and sustainability reports of forty (40) public-listed companies in the plantation industry for the year 2013 was undertaken to examine the quantity of risk management disclosure among these companies. The data for the multiple regressions was analyzed using the Structural Equation Modelling technique of Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS). The results of the study revealed that for social risks, Community Involvement issues were the most disclosed item while for environmental risks, the companies were concerned with Pollution Abatement/Environment awareness risk management issues. The findings from the study revealed that board professionalism was significant in inducing management to provide risk management information to stakeholders. However, board interlock and board size were not significant drivers motivating risk management disclosure. The findings from the study suggest that the professionalism of board members is critical to guide managements towards revealing risk management information. The findings from the study provide evidence that plantation companies in emerging economies such as Malaysia are becoming concerned about the social and environmental impacts of the palm oil plantation to the community and are taking steps to address these issues.

This paper examines the relationship between board structure and risk taking behavior of emerging market firms by looking at firms' growth strategies in foreign as well as domestic markets. More specifically, we study the individual and joint effects of board structure, network centrality through board interlocks and ownership structure on firm's growth strategies. With the help of longitudinal data on 2152 publicly listed Indian firms from 2002 to 2009, we find that boards that are structured keeping in view the resource dependence role are more helpful in pursuing growth strategies. We find that firms having more independent board members and CEO duality are more likely to pursue growth through new domestic ventures or new foreign investments. Moreover, firms that are more central in the network of other firms, based on director interlocks, are more likely to pursue growth in domestic as well as international markets. Further we find that board independence interacts with network centrality and family ownership in affecting a firm's growth strategies. (c) 2017

In the wake of the recent debt crisis in Europe, we investigate the influence of board diversity on financial fragility and performance of European banks. Corporate governance codes in Europe recommend unitary and dual-board systems; therefore, we believe that the influence of board diversity may vary across governance mechanisms and that no other studies have addressed these variations and their influence on financial fragility across European countries. The results show that a critical mass of female representation on both the supervisory board and the board of directors may reduce banks' vulnerability to financial crisis. However, interestingly, we find evidence that female directors on the management board are not risk averse. We argue that the degree of risk taking for female directors may vary based on their roles (non-executive or executive) and that female and male executive directors may have the same risk taking behaviour. Our empirical results provide guidelines to the regulators in Europe with respect to the recently approved proposal by the European Parliament on female representation. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Prior research on post-acquisition performance suggests positive, negative, or no wealth creation for the acquiring firms. Grounding our arguments on the extended resource-based view, the current article proposes that business group-affiliated firms leverage their affiliation advantages to attain superior long-term acquisition performance, relative to standalone firms, especially in emerging economies such as India. Additionally, we hypothesize that both within-group heterogeneity, manifested as prior group experience, group diversification, and intra-group variation in the form of horizontal ties through boards of directors, also affect the long-term post-acquisition performance of affiliated firms. The findings, obtained with a buy-and-hold abnormal returns method applied to a sample of 468 majority stake mergers and acquisitions, both domestic and cross-border, by Indian firms during 2005-2013, provide robust support for the theoretical arguments.

The concept of greed is one of the oldest social constructs; however, greed as a managerial attribute that affects firm outcomes has yet to attract scholarly attention in management. In this study, we examine the relationship of CEO greed to shareholder wealth. After anchoring greed to familiar constructs in organizational literature, we test our hypotheses on a sample of over 300 publicly traded firms from multiple industries. As predicted, greed has a negative relationship with shareholder return, but this relationship is moderated by the presence of a powerful, independent board, managerial discretion, and CEO tenure. The contributions of this study, which include refining our understanding of self-interest and opportunism, developing the greed construct, and illustrating its impact on shareholder wealth, are intended to open a new line of inquiry in the management literature.

Research summary: This study examines the relationship between an independent director's death and CEO acquisitiveness. Using a sample of large U.S. public firms, we find that CEOs who have experienced an independent director's death undertake fewer acquisitions in the post-director death period, in particular fewer large acquisitions. Our findings are consistent with the prediction of posttraumatic growth theory that mortality awareness can induce CEOs to reevaluate their life priorities and reduce the importance of extrinsic goals in their decision making. This study contributes to the strategic leadership literature by highlighting the influence of the death of CEOs' social peers on CEOs' strategic decisions. Managerial summary: Does the death of CEOs' social peers influence CEOs' strategic decisions? We find that CEOs who have experienced an independent director's death engage in fewer acquisitions in the post-director death period, in particular fewer large acquisitions. One likely explanation for our findings is that the death of an independent director may heighten CEOs' mortality awareness, lead the CEOs to pursue a quieter life, and weaken their propensities for undertaking decisions (i.e., acquisitions) that increase their compensation and social status.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board independence and gender diversity on the effectiveness of boards in monitoring CEO compensation in a continental European context, i.e. France. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to study the impact of board independence, gender diversity and their interaction, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors on the different components of CEO compensation (total, fixed and variable). Findings: The authors observe that both the proportions of independent directors and women sitting on the boards positively influence the various components of CEO compensation. However, the interaction of these factors, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors, is negatively associated with CEO compensation. These results suggest that independent women directors improve board effectiveness in monitoring CEO compensation, especially its fixed component. Originality/value: The results of this research help to elucidate the importance of women being appointed to boards as independent directors to properly monitor managerial pay. These results provide support to the approach of the French Cope-Zimmerman law of January 2011, which promotes female representation on boards as independent directors to enhance board decision-making. Thus, evidence presented and discussed in this paper should provide useful insights for academics, corporate managers and regulators. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research summary: Corporate scandals of the previous decade have heightened attention on board independence. Indeed, boards at many large firms are now so independent that the CEO is "home alone" as the lone inside member. We build upon "pro-insider" research within agency theory to explain how the growing trend toward lone-insider boards affects key outcomes and how external governance forces constrain their impact. We find evidence among S&P 1500 firms that having a lone-insider board is associated with (a) excess CEO pay and a larger CEO-top management team pay gap, (b) increased likelihood of financial misconduct, and (c) decreased firm performance, but that stock analysts and institutional investors reduce these negative effects. The findings raise important questions about the efficacy of leaving the CEO "home alone.". Managerial summary: Following concerns that insider-dominated boards failed to protect shareholders, there has been a push for greater board independence. This push has been so successful that the CEO is now the only insider on the boards of more than half of S&P 1500 firms. We examine whether lone-insider boards do in fact offer strong governance or whether they enable CEOs to benefit personally. We find that lone-insider boards pay CEOs excessively, pay CEOs a disproportionately large amount relative to other top managers, have more instances of financial misconduct, and have lower performance than boards with more than one insider. Thus, it appears that lone-insider boards do not function as intended and firms should reconsider whether the push towards lone-insider boards is actually in shareholders' best interests.

This paper studies how governance drives entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in small firms. We argue that founder status and ownership create powerful personal incentives for small firm CEOs to engage in behaviors that influence EO. Integrating stewardship theory and the principal-principal branch of agency theory, we test our hypotheses on a sample of 339 Swedish firms, and find that CEO founder status is significantly and positively associated with EO, while CEO stock ownership significantly but negatively predicts EO. We additionally test two boundary conditions that show that the founder-CEO's prior managerial experience in start-up firms positively moderates the founder-EO relationship, while contrary to expectations, CEO ownership diversification has no effect on the negative association between ownership and EO. Thus, our study adopts a corporate governance perspective to explain how variations in EO across small firms are driven by the goals and motivations of its leader. Our research also shows that in small, private firms the balance of power is tipped in favor of the CEO rather than the board of directors. Finally, we underline the importance of adopting alternative theoretical lens like stewardship and principal-principal agency, given that traditional principal-agent problems are largely mitigated in the small firm context.

We examine the relation between boards of directors' knowledge heterogeneity and organizational ambidexterity (OA) (i.e. simultaneous exploration and exploitation) in knowledge-intensive firms (KIFs). Although the literature on OA has started to emphasize its antecedents, the role of the board remains unaddressed. This is an important omission, as boards have become increasingly involved in strategy-making. In turn, studies on boards have looked at their influence on either exploration- or exploitation-type strategies. Yet, KIFs particularly need to balance both exploration and exploitation to renew their knowledge base. We draw on knowledge-based perspectives to disentangle the benefits and costs of board knowledge heterogeneity for driving OA in KIFs. Our empirical analysis based on a longitudinal panel of UK pharmaceutical firms provides support for our hypothesized U-shaped relation. Our findings suggest that the benefits of knowledge heterogeneity only outweigh the costs beyond a particular threshold. Overall, our theoretical approach and allied findings advance the literature by introducing boundary conditions to the resource provision role of boards in KIFs. We discuss contributions for organizational learning, strategic leadership, and human resource management. We conclude with implications for theory and practice, as well as key opportunities for future research. (c) 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

In this empirical study, we investigate the variation in firms' response to institutional pressure for gender-balanced boards, focusing specifically on the preservation of prevailing practices of director selection and its impact on the representation of women on the board of directors. Using 8 years of data from publicly listed Nordic corporations, we show societal pressure to be one of the determinants of female directorship. Moreover, in some corporations, the director selection process may work to maintain "a traditional type of board". In such boards, demographic diversity among male members appears to be associated with a lower share of female directors, although we cannot establish wether this reflects discrimination or a desire to maintain critical competencies. With this paper we add to the theoretical understanding of the factors underlying female board appointments by adopting an institutional theory lens to study female board representation. Viewing the demands for gender-balanced boards in terms of societal pressure for the de-institutionalization of the prevailing norms and practices, we highlight preferences for maintaining established practices as a potentially important barrier to institutional change. On these grounds, we conjecture on the relationship between the gender diversity of boards and other diversity dimensions. We suggest that a board room gender quota (if implemented) is supplemented by policies to ensure the transparency of board changes, in order to prevent the crowding out of other diversity dimensions.

Boards of directors represent a central factor for firm success by performing different tasks such as control, networking, or advice. Stemming from socioemotional wealth (SEW) literature, the aim of this article is to investigate the board tasks-financial performance relationship, showing their different contributions in family and non-family firms when firm survival is at stake. The main hypotheses are tested through moderated linear regression analyses. The findings suggest that while advisory tasks generally enhance financial performance in family firms, especially during turmoil, networking and control tasks have a detrimental effect when these firms suffer internal financial crises. Hence, we contribute to the SEW paradigm by underlining that family firms seem to accept performance hazards in order to protect family discretion and a positive public reputation even when they suffer severe hardship. In contrast, board advice supports utilizing family firms' unique social capital and significantly bolsters financial performance, without disturbing the family and its SEW preservation needs.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

Governance scholars debate the value of directors as an effective governance mechanism. We suggest that this value varies with director tenure. We study both how shareholder assessments of the value of individual directors vary with director tenure and whether director tenure actually makes a practical difference to governance effectiveness. Using data from abnormal stock price reactions to the sudden deaths of 274 outside directors, and integrating executive cognition and social capital perspectives applied to the dual roles of director monitoring and advising, our results confirm a curvilinear relationship between the assessed value of directors and tenure. We find that directors are more highly valued by investors over a tenure period between 7 and 18 years, moderated by director involvement on key committees. Further, in examining the S & P 1,500, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the percentage of outside directors in this prime tenure period strengthens the CEO pay-performance linkage by 2.5%, suggesting that directors in this tenure period are more effective in aligning CEO and shareholder interests. Our results demonstrate that individual director tenure makes a difference in governance effectiveness, and shareholders accurately assess this difference. Additionally, our findings provide important boundary conditions for when theories of executive cognition and social capital may be more/less applicable regarding director tenure. (c) 2017 INFORMS.

Taking a combination between agency theory and resource dependence theory, we point out that directors' capital may have an effect on R&D strategies. A sample of both high-tech and low-tech industries for the period 2007-2011 is used. The results indicate that, regardless of the type of industry and the specific expertise on R&D intensive companies, board members with multiple directorships influence R&D corporate strategies. The resources acquired by directors through their experience and connections positively influence R&D intensity, but only if directors can carry out their monitoring activity adequately. This evidence implies a step forward in the understanding of the role of board of directors in corporate strategy, thus having significant implications for academics, companies and regulators, which are both theoretical and practical.

Boards of directors must navigate between adopting standardized "best practices" for their CEOs' pay plans, on the one hand, and customizing their CEOs' pay to align their particular CEO's goals with those of shareholders, on the other. We build theory proposing that the incentive effects of different CEO compensation types vary consistently over CEO tenures and, therefore, that overstandardization of CEO pay plans actually can hurt shareholders. Our analysis of a sample of U.S. Standard & Poor's 500 firms from 1998 to 2005 shows declining benefits to shareholders from performance-based compensation (i.e., options and bonuses) as CEO tenure increases but an opposite effect for non-performance-based (i.e., salary) pay. These findings can be considered a preliminary warning that normative "best practices" should not become the exclusive approach to determining CEO pay packages; instead, boards should consider more holistic approaches that incorporate the fit between CEO characteristics and organizational goals.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between gender diversity in a firm's board of directors and financial performance of firms listed on Bursa Malaysia for the period between 2009 and 2013. Using unbalanced panel data analysis, we tested whether gender diversity in the boardroom may influence the firm's performance, as measured by Tobin's Q. We employed four different proxies for gender diversity (the dummy variable for women, the percentage of women on the board, the Blau index, and the Shannon index) to provide a more comprehensive measure of gender diversity. This study suggests that a higher degree of female representation on the board increases a firm's financial performance. Positive discrimination favouring female boardroom appointment is therefore likely to persist as a feature of the corporate governance landscape in Malaysia.

More and more boards are tapping interim CEOs to temporarily fill the corner office. Prior research indicates the negative performance implications of this decision; yet, little is known about the rationale behind this decision. Our aim is to fill this research gap. Drawing on agency and human capabilities frameworks, we examined the contextual elements that influence a board's decision to pursue temporary leadership. Within a sample of 375 successions occurring between 1998 and 2005, we found that boards of directors were more likely to select interim CEOs under certain succession conditions, namely, when the prior CEO was forced out and there was no heir apparent or when the prior CEO had served for a short tenure. Our results highlight the importance of context in succession selections and provide insights into why a board would pursue a decision with seemingly negative repercussions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

In this paper we address how director expertise impacts a director's social status and conformity within the board. Our results, derived from two unique multi-source datasets of peer ratings on director status and conformity of non-executive directors from Dutch organizations, indicate that industry-specific expertise and financial expertise differently impact directors' social status and influence within the board. We find that directors' individual performance orientation - the motivation to demonstrate expertise - acts as an important contingency for expertise to increase directors' status within the board. Additional analyses using archival data and interviews with non-executive directors substantiate our findings and provide additional insight into the dynamics operating within boards. This study extends existing research on boards of directors and provides unique micro-level insights into the boardroom dynamics that connect director expertise to director status and conformity within boards.

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

The board of directors is legally responsible for setting the strategic direction of the firm and for ensuring the firm's long-term performance in almost all governance environments. However, many boards delegate part or all of the task of creating and executing the firm's strategy to a group of full-time professional managers. This separation between ownership and control creates many challenges for the modern-day firm, and the board's role in the strategy formation process is arguably the seminal governance challenge confronting boards today. This study examines this seminal challenge by: (1) Introducing background information on this stream by defining key terms and discussing its importance to the wider corporate governance literature, describing three infamous case studies of firms based in the USA, Europe and Asia where the board was insufficiently involved, and noting situations where the board may become too involved; (2) Exploring previous reviews of this research stream on board strategic involvement, and discussing the evolution of this construct and related studies over time; (3) Analyzing previous research designs used in this research stream while identifying the frequency as well as costs and benefits associated with each; (4) Summarizing what we currently know about the multi-level antecedents of board involvement within single countries; (5) Specifying some of the national-level antecedents of board involvement identified in cross-national studies; (6) Identifying the subsequent multi-level effects of board involvement; and (7) Discussing the implications of this review and outlining future research directions.

The role of the nomination committee (NC) in the selection of members of various ethnic groups for board membership has increased significantly as a result of the global financial crisis of 2008. A company board that comprises directors who come from all the three major ethnic groups (Malay, Chinese and Indian Malaysians) increases the efficiency of the board in its monitoring and advising roles. According to the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG 2012), the NC shall be responsible for the appointment and recognition of candidates of diverse backgrounds into the board and committee. With that in mind, this paper examines the presence of Malay, Chinese and Indian directors in a nomination committee and its impact on the ethnic diversity of its board. This paper also examines the influence of the executive directors who are members in the nomination committee on the nomination process. For this purpose, 393 (50%) Malaysian listed companies were selected from the three year period of 2011 to 2013. Only non-financial companies were included because other companies such as finance have a different set of regulations in Malaysia. In this study, descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple regression were used for the purpose of revealing important significance of the variables used. In order to control possible endogeneity issues, the GMM estimator was also administered. The regression results of the ethnic diversity model are statistically significant, showing that, a higher proportion of Malay and Chinese directors in a nomination committee has negative relationships while a higher proportion of Indian directors in a nomination committee increases their representation on the board. However, the proportion of executive directors in the nomination committee was found to have a significant impact on the director nomination process of Malay, Chinese and Indian directors. In order to test the robustness of the model, several sets of measures were used. In conclusion, it is deduced that the results of this study support the social identity theory and power struggle, it shows the importance of diversity within the nominating committee of Malaysian companies. The result also reveals that unbiased and effective board mix enhances the strategic decision-making process of the board.

The language that signals conformity to a prevailing norm can contribute to the appearance of managerial competency and organizational legitimacy. We argue that top corporate managers' use of language that is congruent with a prevailing norm leads the boards of directors to evaluate the managers more favourably and to grant a higher level of compensation. We test this argument by analysing the letters to shareholders from 334 US firms and examine the CEOs' expression of the shareholder value principle, which is a prevailing model of corporate governance in the USA. We found that the use of shareholder-value language is significantly related to a higher level of CEO compensation and that the effect of shareholder-value language is greater when shareholder activism is stronger.

This study examines the impact of board characteristics on the amount of capital raised through an IPO for a sample of 220 Malaysian IPOs over the period of 2005-2015, applying both ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression (QR) techniques. The OLS results show that board with ethnic Malay directors has a significant and positive association with the amount of capital raised, while a weak significance is found for board size. However, the QR results reveal that other than board ethnicity, other board characteristics namely board size, board independence and CEO duality are significantly associated with the amount of capital raised. The additional results suggest that QR provides a more insightful and full picture into the association than does OLS. The overall empirical evidence lends support to the resource dependence role of the board of directors at the time of an IPO. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we introduce a justice perspective to examining the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards over the allocation of firm residuals that ultimately determines CEO compensation. Framing CEO pay as the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards focuses attention on the power of CEOs to increase their share of firm residuals in the form of increased compensation, and the diligence of boards of directors to constrain CEO opportunism. Framing this negotiation through a theory of justice offers an alternative perspective to the search for pay-performance sensitivity. We predict and find that as board diligence in controlling opportunism declines and CEO power increases, CEOs are increasingly able to capture a larger portion of firm residuals relative to shareholders. This finding supports critics who charge that CEO pay violates norms of distributive and procedural justice. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Purpose: Corporate accountability is a complex chain of reporting that reaches from external stakeholders into the organization's management structure. The transition from external to internal accountability mechanisms primarily occurs at the board of directors. Yet outside of incentive mechanisms, we know surprisingly little about how internal actors (management) are held to account by the representatives of external shareholders (the board). The purpose of this paper is to explore the process of accountability at this transition point by documenting the routines used by boards to hold the firm's management to account. In doing so, we develop the understanding of the important transition between internal and external firm accountability. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive, case-based approach identifies recurrent behaviour patterns in two matched boards over three video-taped meetings. Sequential analysis of coded group and individual behaviours provides insight into boards' accountability routines. Findings: The boards engaged in clear, recurrent accountability routines. Individuals on the boards play different roles in these routines depending on the issue before the board, allowing both directors and managers to hold each other to account. The outsiders (directors) both challenge and support the insiders (managers) during board discussions, switching their behaviours with different agenda items but maintaining a consistent group level of support and scepticism across the meeting. This allows for the simultaneous development of trust and verification at the group level, a necessary condition for effective accountability. Research limitations/implications: As board relationships and organisational context are highly variable, future research should concentrate on testing the generalizability of the results across different board and shareholder structures. Practical implications: The results call into question the current governance focus on the independence of the individual director, as the authors identify that all directors appear to act as agents at one time or another in a meeting. Accountability at the boardroom level requires an effective group process not usually addressed in governance recommendations or regulation. Originality/value: This study provides unique insights into board dynamics, documenting the accountability implications of group behaviours. By focussing on the group process, the authors highlight the potential mismatch of monotonic, individual-level approaches to governance and accountability prevalent in current agency approaches.

While the value of external audits was long considered to be minimal for private family firms, some exceptional studies indicate that external audits are demanded by these firms to reduce the agency conflicts between family and non-family members. Using a sample of Belgian private family firms, this study empirically shows that (high quality) auditors are also hired to mitigate agency conflicts among family members. Since these intrafamily agency conflicts are mainly based on emotions instead of economically rational behavior and are therefore difficult to grasp by compositional proxies, they are identified by the level of family cohesion. Moreover, this study shows that the monitoring effectiveness of the board of directors weakens the association between the level of intrafamily agency conflicts and audit (quality) demand, indicating that the audit demand effect of intrafamily agency conflicts decreases when family firms are able to reduce the related agency costs internally.

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the board composition on financial performance in the restaurant industry from a stewardship theory perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The composition of board was measured as the ratio of inside and outside directors. Firm performance was operationalized as return on assets (operational performance) and Tobin's q (market-based performance). Panel regression analysis tested the research hypotheses. Findings: Using data from 25 restaurant firms from 2007 to 2013, the study found an insignificant impact of board composition on operational performance. However, a higher proportion of inside board members increases market-based performance. A higher proportion of outside board members decreases market-based performance. Practical implications: Supporting the basic tenets of stewardship theory, restaurant companies may consider changing the current practice of having a super-majority of outside directors and increase the inside board members. Because inside board member have greater experience with the organization and the industry, they have a better understanding of the status quo and are better able to respond to opportunities and threats in the environment. Originality/value: Considering the scarcity of research on how the board composition affects firm performance in the hospitality context, the present study is a forerunner in its exploration of the impact of inside and outside directors on restaurant firms' performance.

Purpose: Presently, one of the major governance issues faced by management and shareholders of organizations is the gender composition of the boards of directors and audit committees. This study aims to examine the impact of gender diversity in audit committees on the accuracy of management earnings forecasts disclosure in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample comprises 190 Malaysian companies issuing IPOs that transformed into public companies during the period 2002-2012. Earnings forecasts accuracy (quality) is proxied by absolute forecast error and the study model is developed based on the frameworks of the signalling theory, the agency theory and the resource-dependence theory. Findings: The study proposes that female directors introduce a set of specific features in the boardroom that serve to improve investor protection and efficient monitoring of management. However, findings reveal an insignificantly positive relationship between gender diversity in audit committees and absolute forecast error, which shows that more female directors in audit committees could translate into more errors and less accuracy in earnings forecasts. Practical implications: Considering the recent regulatory developments that encourage the number of women on the board of directors, the findings obtained have significant implications for policymakers. The study findings can also be invaluable to investors, investment analysts, market players and researchers. Originality/value: The composition of the board of directors and audit committees in terms of gender plays a significant role in the promotion of effective corporate governance practices. This study is one of the pioneering studies that examines the advantages of gender diversity in the board of directors. It is also the first study to extend IPO literature by investigating the role of gender diversity in audit committees in the enhancement of accurate management earnings forecasts included in the IPO prospectuses.

Manuscript Type:: Review. Research Question/Issue:: Research on how boards govern individual top management team (TMT) members, i.e., senior executives aside from the CEO, is still scarce and fragmented. In this study, we review extant research on board monitoring of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) - an increasingly influential actor at the top of the firm - synthesize it, and propose an integrative future research agenda on board governing of the CFO. Research Findings/Insights:: Our review of the accounting, finance, and management literatures reveals that extant research emphasizes the board's need to monitor the CFO as a major strategic actor in the firm. However, studies have frequently focused on selective aspects of board monitoring activities, neglecting how central board attributes influence effective governance of the CFO. We therefore develop a comprehensive model of board monitoring and advising of the CFO that addresses the role of board attributes in governance activities. Theoretical/Academic Implications:: Our future research program on board governance of the CFO contributes to developing a better understanding of how board composition, structure, characteristics, and processes influence different board monitoring and advising activities. Practitioner/Policy Implications:: We offer a framework for boards of directors responsible for governing CFOs, highlighting the factors they have to take into consideration when selecting, dismissing, and compensating the CFO and when ratifying her decisions and rendering advice on her proposals. We also provide CFOs with insights into the factors that influence their dismissal, compensation, and collaboration with the board. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Leadership, governance and performance in family businesses are broadly studied, but results are contradictory. There is a need for deeper understanding of these relationships since emotional and behavioral aspects are complex in these types businesses. Questions on the how and the why of board functioning and ownership, and their influences on performance are scarce, given lack of data or a focus on quantitative data. To find a balance between qualitative and quantitative methods, we explore fuzzy sets logic as a methodology to expand knowledge in family businesses and present an application to build a representation of entrepreneurial performance results based on board of directors' composition and CEO's ownership, using case studies. Results indicate that the methodology offers alternative explanations to governance, leadership and performance dimensions in these businesses. Using fuzzy sets logic, we find that entrepreneurial performance is higher when outsiders' membership in boards of directors and CEO ownership are both high as well.

The purpose of this study is examine how agency theory and stewardship theory lead to different firm-level outcomes on an array of different outcomes. Based on these differences, we argue for the development of an agent-steward measurement scale, which will help researchers classify chief executive officers (CEOs) along an agent-steward continuum. This, in turn, will spur research to predict and test CEO behaviors and firm-level outcomes. Agency theory suggests CEOs take advantage of their powerful positions to maximize their personal economic utility, whereas stewardship theory suggests CEOs are motivated through intrinsic awards and will balance their interests with those of other stakeholders. We use these theories to examine possible differences in CEO behaviors. This is important because different CEO behaviors might lead to differing impacts on important firm-level outcomes. This paper reviews the relevant agency and stewardship literatures, then offers propositions regarding CEO behaviors from agent and steward perspectives.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an account of banking scandals in relation to corporate governance (CG) failures in an emerging economy, arguing that Anglo-American ideas of CG are misplaced in traditional settings. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders. Observations of annual general meetings (AGMs) and the personal working experience of one of the researchers, along with documentation, provided triangulating data on CG practices. Findings: The authors have found that both of the banks studied had adopted CG practices contrary to the expectations of the Sri Lankan CG codes. Key features of CG practices that emerged from their investigations of these two scandals are ineffectual central bank regulations, familial boards of directors, ceremonial board meetings, biased auditing practices and manipulative AGMs, relying on traditional structures of accountability centred around families, kin and social networks. Research limitations/implications: The authors argue, drawing on Weber (1958, 1961, 1968, 1978), that the traditionalist culture mediates the process of rationality in bank governance codes and regulatory frameworks Therefore, practices fall far short of expectations. Originality/value: The paper builds on the extended critique of shareholder-centric CG models and their transferability to alien contexts. It contributes to the CG studies calling for more appreciation of the need to move beyond the conventional view of CG problems as simply down to conflicts of interests. The authors complement and advance the decoupling debate in CG studies drawing on the Weberian notion of traditionalism. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the presence, expertise, independence, size and meetings of the audit committee (AC) have an effect on corporate insolvency. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 insolvent and 269 solvent UK-listed non-financial firms from 1994 to 2011. Findings: The authors find that corporate insolvency is negatively related to thenieetings and independence of the AC but not to AC's presence and size. The authors also observe that financial expertise on the AC is not related to corporate insolvency. These associations are robust to different specifications, while after controlling for board composition, board size, the number of board meetings, CEO duality, financial and firm characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The study's approach has two main limitations: neglect of small and medium private unquoted firms and more regulated corporate governance environment. Practical implications - The findings lend support to the continual use of the agency theory as an explanation in understanding the role of the analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of the AC in reducing the likelihood of insolvency. Social implications: The findings support continued efforts to strengthen boards' ACs in the wake of high profile insolvencies. The findings will assist regulators and firm management to design appropriate ACs (e.g. independence) and processes (e.g. number of meetings). Originality/value: The authors provide empirical evidence on the impact of the AC on firm insolvency in the UK context, an important but neglected area in research.

Manuscript Type: Article/Review. Research Question/Issue: This study presents the results of a longitudinal content analysis of governance articles published in both CGIR and other leading management outlets. Our aim with this review is to identify problematic areas, as well as opportunities to improve the methodological rigor of governance studies. Research Findings/Insights: We examine key design aspects of corporate governance articles. We identify and compare trends (1) over time and (2) across publishing outlets. Specifically examined are the geographic scope of samples, design characteristics (i.e., single- versus multi-year data, the use of archival, survey, experimental, and qualitative designs, data sources, and reliance on concurrent versus longitudinal data), survey response rates and the use of tests for non-response bias, the statistical analysis techniques used, reporting of results (number and proportion of hypotheses supported, non-significant, and counter-significant, use of statistical power analysis, reporting of descriptive statistics and correlations, use and significance of control variables, and endogeneity controls), and the sophistication of the models tests (i.e., mediation and moderation). Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the results of the review, recommendations for academic researchers are offered in the following areas: (1) designing theoretical tests which both incorporate and go beyond main effects; (2) evaluating a research design's analytical parameters on an a priori basis to maximize reliability, validity, and the potential for publication; (3) incorporating assessment of sensitivity and robustness checks into the analysis; and (4) comprehensive reporting of results including post hoc power analysis, complete and expanded correlation matrix(es), reporting and assessing counter-results, and avoiding HARKing.

This study investigates dividend initiation as the product of the imbalance of power between shareholders and management in U.S. firms from 2003 to 2012. We find that dividend initiation is associated with a stronger governance structure (strong shareholders' rights and board independence), in accordance with the outcome model. We do not identify a single motivation for dividend initiation. Dividend-initiating firms tend to rely on various forms of governance balanced by the interests and ownership of CEOs and directors. Firms with institutional owners are more likely to initiate dividends concurrent with the turnover of the CEO. Dual CEOs initiate dividends when they own more shares, and boards of directors initiate dividends with a higher personal ownership stake when shareholders' rights are weak. We also find that when initiation is due to stronger governance, it is significantly related to the firm's investment opportunities, while for weak governance firms, that relationship is not observed. We interpret this as evidence that, under weaker governance, the decision to initiate dividends is motivated by agency conflicts rather than investment or capital structure considerations. (c) 2017

This study examined the relationship between board effectiveness and innovation in service providing associations from the perspectives of agency, resource dependency, and resource-based theories. Results based on 349 respondent surveys showed that the the relationship between board effectiveness and innovation varied by the type of innovation (service, administrative, product, process, and capacity for innovation). Based on the results, practice implications are discussed, with a special focus on educating boards on the potential impact they might have on innovation through an effective performance of their tasks.

The participation of directors on more than one board is called "board interlocking". This phenomenon contributes to the spread of management and governance practices, through directors sharing their knowledge and experiences on other boards. Thus, directors could "carry" the earnings management practices present in one company into another in which they sit on the board. It is assumed that the greater directors' direct or indirect connections on boards, the greater the sharing of information, especially information that can be reflected in company earnings quality. In light of the above, the aim of this study is to verify the influence of board interlocking on earnings management in companies listed on the Sao Paulo Stock, Commodities, and Futures Exchange (BM&FBovespa). The study is characterized as descriptive, quantitative, and documentary, and uses a sample of companies listed on the BM&FBOVESPA between 2011 and 2013. For earnings management, the model from Kang and Sivaramakrishnan (1995) was used, while for interlocking, degree centrality measures were used for direct board member connections, and intermediation centrality for indirect connections. The results indicate that earnings management is influenced by the interlocking of board members. It is concluded that the greater the degree centrality, the greater positive earnings management is, and that variations in positive and negative accruals are influenced by board member intermediation. The results reinforce the idea that earnings management behavior can be transferred between companies by the directors that make up their boards.

The aim of the study is to examine the effect of diversity in the board of directors on the performance of the listed Italian financial institutions. The sample is a data set of 177 firm-year observations covering 2011 to 2014. The performance of the firm is measured by Tobin's Q while board diversity is analysed considering the percentage of female and foreign directors on the board (or their conjoint presence as a proxy of overall demographic diversity) and task-diversity is measured by board interlocking directorship and busy directors. Findings suggest that female directors have no effect on firm performance. Foreign directors and interlocking directorship have, instead, a positive statistically significant relationship with performance while we find a negative statistically significant relationship between busy directors and performance. When we consider the overall demographic diversity on the board we observe that it is positively and significantly related to the performance of the financial firm.

This study examines how behavioral processes among nominating committees, CEOs, and board chairs affect the comprehensiveness of non-executive director selection planning and evaluation. Building on a theory-building multiple-case study, our findings indicate that comprehensiveness is based on three key factors: (1) task-related mutual and collective interactions in nominating committees, (2) board chair leadership in structuring selection processes with high facilitation skills, and (3) the level and timing of information exchange between CEOs and board chairs. Furthermore, we highlight the interconnectedness and temporal embeddedness of these behavioral processes. Our study contributes to a more holistic understanding of non-executive director selections and provides new insights into the complex and interwoven social dynamics among nominating committees, CEOs, and board chairs.

While directors' task boundaries are usually ambiguous, some of their activities or behaviors clearly constitute their formal duties, whereas others are usually perceived as organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Applying identity theory, we present a theoretical model that demonstrates one of the key drivers for directors to engage in OCB with a focus on their role identity. We argue that an individual director's role identity is one of the key factors that motivate directors to engage in OCB. Furthermore, we propose that two board-level contingencies, board capital, and informal board hierarchy order, can moderate the effect of directors' role-identity salience on their OCB. That is, low levels of board capital and directors' higher positions in a board's informal hierarchy enhance directors' motivation to engage in OCB.

In this study, a cross-theoretical hybridization between diversity archetypes and the behavioural theory of corporate governance is proposed. Within an integrative theoretical framework, I discuss three variants of the board's social setting: diversity as variety; separation; and disparity. Their influence on the mechanisms of the socially-situated and socially-constituted agency, and in consequence the socially-constructed boardroom reality, is considered. The model stipulates what kind of impact individual agency perception, associated with each diversity archetype, can be expected to have on board task effectiveness (monitoring/control, resource-provision, and strategy-making/consulting). There are altogether six theoretical propositions made in this paper. The study represents an application of the behavioural theory of corporate governance in the theory-building paper. I utilise the notion of diversity and the theory of subgroups from existing group effectiveness literature. The proposed theoretical framework strongly benefits from recent taxonomically-systematizing efforts in the area of diversity research. The proposed model also allows for due consideration of behavioural patterns in the boardroom. This framework scores high on its generalisability to a wider population and realism of context, but low on its precision of measurement. A discussion of the model's limitations unfolds in the wider context of the challenges and paradoxes/conundrums with which the community of corporate governance scholars is invariably confronted. The model suffers from a limited translatability of findings into actionable managerial implications and recommendations of the regulator, as expressed in corporate governance codes.

Despite boards of directors' prominent involvement in strategic alliance (SA) decisions in practice and reports from news media, there is relatively little academic research exploring the board's value for a firm's technical SA investments involving a technical transfer or R&D, which are characterized by a high level of uncertainty, information asymmetry, and extreme complexity. Anchored in the resource dependence theory, this study aims to address this important issue by examining how board of directors contribute their human capital, in the form of relevant strategic experience, may mitigate the core challenges managers face when pursuing technical SAs and thereby influencing their outcomes. Our empirical results show that when outside directors hold more extensive alliance experience, they can better execute their consulting function and improve the firm's technical alliance performance. In addition, directors with experience specifically related to technical alliances also have a positive effect on performance. Last, we find that the impact of alliance experience on technical alliance performance is positively moderated by the size of directors' prior affiliated companies and their share ownership in the focal firm.

This study explores the structural relationship of director networks among boards of directors in publicly listed companies in Malaysia using social network analysis (SNA) techniques at both the director and company levels. This paper examines whether company corporate governance practices and institutional characteristics are associated with company network size and pattern. SNA performed using UCINET and NetDraw software shows that the directors and company in the networking are moderately connected. This suggests that there is a small group of directors or companies that are well-connected and well-positioned to exercise power, control, and influence over the network. This study also reveals the interconnectedness of board members and companies. The regression results also identify a group of the most well-connected and well-positioned directors and companies in Malaysia's corporate governance environment. The results suggest that board size, board meeting, and duality are the corporate governance practices, which most influence company network size and pattern. The presence of a Bumiputera or politically-connected director is an institutional characteristic, which especially determines the network of a company.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how information-processing mechanisms between nominating committees (NCs), incumbent executives, board chairs, and shareholders affect the comprehensiveness of executive succession processes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ an explanatory multiple-case study that comprises eight CEO and CFO succession cases in large German publicly traded firms. Findings: The findings reveal that comprehensiveness is determined by four key information-processing mechanisms: the effectiveness of NC's information sharing, absorbing disagreement, and integrating heterogeneous opinions; board chair leadership (i.e. an apprentice board leadership structure in association with the board chair's openness to ideas); the breadth and depth of information sharing between executives and NCs; and the extent and timing to which major shareholders influence succession processes. Research limitations/implications: The authors summarize the findings in a conceptual framework and develop a set of propositions to guide future research on the topic. Such studies may want to test the suggestions in a quantitative way, preferably in a multinational context. Originality/value: The authors' emerging conceptual framework contributes a set of information-processing variables by which NCs engage in comprehensive executive successions with incumbent executives, board chairs, and major shareholders and offers a multiechelon approach to study executive successions.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the impact that women who sit on boards of directors, as well as women that are part of an interlocking directorate, have on corporate performance. The investigation is placed within the literature on human capital theory and resource dependency as an argument for gender diversity and boards of directors. Design/methodology/approach: A director data set for over 32,000 firms based in the USA, composed of 6,218 women and 54,932 men, is utilized. From this, regression and network analysis were utilized. Findings: It is found that female directors' participation in interlocking directorates translates into greater corporate performance when compared to simply examining female representation on boards of directors. Additionally, women involved in interlocks translated into greater corporate performance when compared to men. These results support the resource dependency approach. Practical/implications: Results of this study suggest that when considering female directors, corporate performance is enhanced when female directors already sit on the boards of other firms. Originality/value: This study highlights external network connections to differentiate between human capital theory and resource dependency as an argument for gender diversity and boards of directors.

Purpose: This paper aims to show the importance of introducing an integration manager (i.e. an executive position used to channel the acquiring firm's course of action and strengthen the success of a post-acquisition integration process) within the acquiring firm's board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This is a theoretical paper that introduces the integration manager within the board of privately held firms going internationally via acquisitions and serving as an "out-insider" director able to balance the conflicting demands of the previously separated entities during their integration process. The authors present an explanatory case study that empirically contributes to the board of directors' design for internationalization. Findings: The authors posit that the integration manager serves as an "out-insider" director of the board for privately held firms, possessed by large-block shareholders, going internationally via acquisitions, providing the necessary expertise and knowledge of the target firm's products and industry. Originality/value: The provided study aims to show that international acquisitions, even though apparently less risky than greenfield investments, may require additional neutral information flow - both within the due-diligence process and the post-acquisition integration - that only outsiders possess. Such an outsider has been individuated in the integration manager whose crucial role focuses on smoothing the pre- and post-acquisition integration processes.

In this paper we develop a model for researching the influence that a board of directors can have on improving an organization's sustainability performance. Our model explores sources of cognitive flexibility of boards needed to recognize and respond to the need for improved sustainability performance. We first define concepts of sustainability, sustainability competence, and sustainability performance. We then analyze two forms of board capital (a board's human capital and its social capital) and three aspects of a board's information processing (its patterns of information search, discussion and debate, and information absorption) that we suggest affect a board's cognitive flexibility and thereby influence whether a board decides to adopt sustainability performance goals. Our model also suggests that an organization's strategic flexibility - as represented by its current endowments of resource flexibilities and coordination flexibilities - will moderate the relationship between a board's decision to adopt sustainability performance goals and an organization's subsequent achievement of those goals. We also suggest that our model is generally relevant to any research seeking to predict the influence of boards on strategic change in many forms, not just to research focused on sustainability issues.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between board dependence, antitakeover provisions and their influence on corporate entrepreneurship (CE). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses agency theory as a framework to expand on the board dependence-CE relationship by injecting the moderating role of antitakeover provisions to the model. Using data collected from 350 publicly traded firms, a panel regression analyses was conducted on both innovation and venturing components of CE. Findings: The findings of this study show a negative relationship between board dependence and CE. Further this study shows that such a negative relationship becomes weaker when higher levels of antitakeover provisions are injected into the model. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of large publicly traded firms within the information and manufacturing sectors, and so our findings may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other variables representing CE (e.g. new product introductions) may add to this line of research in the future. Practical implications: Understanding the role of board of directors within a firm may help foster CE throughout the organization. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by incorporating the influence of environmental factors (e.g. antitakeover provisions) and examining the relationship between corporate governance and CE using both measures of innovation and venturing.

Exploring director connectedness around S&P 500 Index revisions, this paper studies whether board connections contribute value to the firm. Even compared to firms of similar size, S&P 500 Index boards are more central in the network of directors. After inclusion to the Index, boards become more central in the director network, and newly added firms are more likely to get new directors from other S&P 500 Index boards. Those newly added firms with lower connectedness pre-inclusion accrue larger abnormal announcement returns stemming from the benefit of increasing director centrality after inclusion. In contrast, firms with more centralized boards suffer larger losses upon removal from the Index. Using the local supply of directors as an instrument, we demonstrate that well-connected directors as well as the percent of S&P 500 Index directors contribute to firm value. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The main aim of the present study is to determine the role of environmentally expert and experience leader on positive deviance behaviour in corporate environmental reporting practices. Based on the environmental reporting index develop based on the concept of positive environmental deviance, the study measured positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices of 209 Malaysian public listed companies based on 5 years panel data. It was found that environmental expert and experience board of directors have a positive significant relationship with positive deviance in environmental reporting practices. Nevertheless it have been found that there were no significant relationship between environmentally expert and experience CEO and its interaction effect with environmentally expert and experience board of directors on positive deviance behaviour in environmentally reporting practices. This study conceptualized positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices as the strategic behaviour of the corporations to improve the impact of environmental sustainability practices beyond the required regulations by disclosing set of information regarding to their proactive management practices and performance which: (1) exceed minimal norms; (2) deviate from others within the field; (3) go beyond what is required by regulation; and (4) associated broader scale changes.

Drawing on stewardship and resource dependence theories, we examine how the board of directors (BoD) influences the link between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and ambidextrous innovation in small and medium sized family firms (family SMEs). Our analysis of 230 Spanish family SMEs shows that family involvement in the BoD has a negative effect on their ability to turn EO into innovation. Moreover, we show that the BoD's strategic involvement in service and control tasks and the provision of knowledge and skills have positive effects, whereas the intensity of BoD activity has a surprisingly negative effect. These findings underscore that the effects of the BoD on the entrepreneurship-innovation link are more complex than previously thought, pointing to the important role of both BoD composition and BoD functioning for enabling innovation in family SMEs.

This study develops a combined agency-resource dependence perspective and applies it to the study of interlocking directorates. It suggests that interlocking directorates may exert either a positive or a negative effect on subsequent firm performance, depending on the firm's relative resources, power imbalance, ownership concentration, and CEO ownership. A test on a sample of 145 Italian companies provides support for hypothesized effects. This study suggests that integrating agency and resource dependence theories provides a higher-order explanation of firm performance and helps advance both agency and resource dependence theories.

Do women board directors change how companies do business? Firms face growing pressure to appoint more women to their boards of directors, yet little is known about the factors that enable female directors to impact their organizations. This study analyzes the representational thresholds that facilitate women's leadership in the area of corporate social responsibility. We test the predictions of token theory and critical mass theory to evaluate the ability of women to impact firm outcomes based on their numerical representation on the board of directors. Our analysis focuses on board composition and organizational outcomes in the Fortune 500 from 2001 to 2010. Our findings challenge the theoretical assumptions that solo and token women are unable to exert significant influence over their organizations, and underscore the importance of board diversity for today's firms.

This study examines the effects of board diversity on bank profitability and risk. Using a sample of 97 Chinese banks over a period from 2009 to 2013, we find that board age diversity is negatively associated with bank profitability. To further investigate why age-diverse boards influence bank performance, we decompose board age diversity into diversity of directors' personal values, utilizing the World Values Survey. Our findings suggest that the heterogeneity among directors' views on risk, prudence, and wealth is more likely to spark intragroup conflicts in the decision-making process. This prevents the board from functioning effectively and ultimately weakens bank profitability. Our results are robust with respect to alternative measures of diversity and bank performance.

Reflecting investor expectations, most prior corporate governance research attempt to find the effect duality Role of Chief Executive Officer, board structures and firm financial performance. Specifically, we refer to devote this paper on investigating the relationship between the Duality Role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the CEO tenure, board structures and gender diversity with tow measurement of performance in listed companies in CAC 40. We found evidence provide that board characteristics are positively correlated to the firm' performance. However, our results show a significant association between ROE, ROA and the board of directors' composition. We find significant negative association between financial information and equity-based management compensation. On the other hand, the presence of independent directors on the board seems to affect, positively, the level of financial performance CAC 40 firms. Likewise, the stewardship theory assumption, the CEO duality is very high and is significantly associated with a higher level of firm performance. Our results suggest a constant negative relation between firm performance and CEO's tenure. The results show that there is a significant relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance from our samples CAC 40 companies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study focuses on CEO hubris and its detrimental effect on corporate financial performance along with an examination of critical corporate governance contingencies (CEO power and board vigilance) that may moderate the negative effect. From 654 observations of 164 Korean firms over the years 2001-2008, we found that CEO power exacerbated the negative effect of CEO hubris on corporate financial performance, whereas board vigilance mitigated it. This study provides empirical evidence that entrenchment problems arising from CEO hubris would be exacerbated as CEOs become more powerful, but weakened as board of directors become more vigilant. Theoretical contributions and practical implications will be discussed. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Scholars have expressed concern that marketing's influence at the strategic levels of the firm is waning. Consistent with this view, only 2.6% of firms' board members have marketing experience. The authors suggest that this is shortsighted and that including more marketing-experienced board members (MEBMs) will increase firm growth by (1) helping firms prioritize growth as a strategic objective and (2) contributing their expertise to improve the effectiveness of revenue growth strategies. Drawing on the behavioral model of corporate governance, the authors develop a theoretical framework explicating the situational, dispositional, and structural influence moderators that alter the impact ofMEBMs on firm growth. Using 64,086 director biographies from S&P 1500 firms, the authors find thatMEBMs positively affect firm-level revenue growth and that this relationship is strengthened or weakened by important contingencies that occur in the firm. The findings suggest that the common practice of not including experienced marketers on boards of directors puts firms at a competitive disadvantage. (c) 2018 American Marketing Association.

Firms' boards of directors affect many strategic outcomes. Yet the impact of boards on new products, a key organizational adaptation mechanism, has been overlooked. Addressing this gap, the authors consider the effect of the firm's board interlock centrality, the extent to which board members are connected to boards of other firms, on its new product introductions. They propose that board interlock centrality provides firms access to market intelligence, creating opportunities to introduce incremental new products. Applying the motivation-opportunity-ability theory, the authors propose that two aspects of board leadership moderate this relationship: internal (vs. external) leadership and marketing leadership. They test the hypotheses using a panel of publicly listed U.S. consumer packaged goods firms, in which most new products are incremental innovations. As hypothesized, board interlock centrality increases new product introductions. This effect is stronger when firms have high internal leadership, internal marketing leadership, and a marketing CEO; it is weaker with high intra-industry external leadership. The findings highlight the unexpected role of board interlocks on innovation outcomes and advance the literature on marketing leadership, board interlocks, and social networks.

We examine how friendly boards affect firm innovation. Using CEO-director social connections as a measure of board friendliness, we find that firms with friendly boards create more patents and citations. The positive relation between friendly boards and innovation are more pronounced when firms' advisory needs are higher or when firms operate in innovative industries. Friendly boards are also associated with higher firm value, especially when firms have higher advisory needs or when innovation is an important source of firm value. Our results support the positive view on a friendly board perspective that directors serve as valuable advisors to CEOs. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Various regulatory governance initiatives have strived for board diversity, as diversity stimulates creativity, encourages discussion, and enlarges the board's knowledge base. However, increased diversity results in superior decision-making only when the board is free from conflicts and acts as a cohesive group. In this paper, we extend existing corporate governance research by introducing faultline theory to the board of directors (Lau and Murnighan 1998). The idea is to show how a board's diversity structure can give rise to the formation of subgroups along faultlines. The resulting subgroup formation may, in turn, reduce board effectiveness. Using a sample of U.S.- listed firms between 2008 and 2012, results suggest that boards with strong faultlines are associated with lower firm performance, lower CEO turnover-performance sensitivity, and higher abnormal CEO compensation. Understanding potential unintended consequences of board diversity could be of interest to regulators and companies that plan to appoint new directors to the board.

Drawing from corporate governance research and social identity theory, the authors argue that the relationship between outside directors' time in office and outside director task involvement is more complex than generally anticipated. By using a unique multisource data set composed of peer ratings provided by fellow outside directors rating a focal director's task involvement, this study analyzes director task involvement at the individual director level of analysis. The authors propose and empirically demonstrate that outside director tenure has an inverted U-shaped relationship with outside director task involvement that is moderated by a director's social identification with the organization. As such, the authors demonstrate that social identification with the organization provides a critical contingency for the curvilinear relationship between outside director tenure and outside director task involvement. Findings suggest that outside directors who socially identify with the organization are more likely to grow "stale in the saddle" at lower levels of tenure. These findings provide support for the merit of analyzing outside directors at the individual level of analysis and suggest that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be most appropriate in assessing the effects of tenure on outside director functioning.

Despite substantive organizational ramifications, surprisingly little theory explains executive succession planning processes. A firm's board of directors has the fiduciary responsibility to select CEOs, but, historically, boards have failed to exercise this authority. Increasing focus on corporate governance has prompted directors to become more engaged in organizational management, but boards face significant barriers to gathering and processing information. However, there is a dearth of research examining how boards overcome informational barriers to enhance decision-making effectiveness. Accordingly, the current study integrates procedural rationality in decision-making with research on boards as information-processing groups to explore how and why boards conduct succession planning processes. Procedural rationality results in formalized processes designed to collect essential information about CEO succession candidates; these processes, in turn, lead to a greater quantity and quality of CEO succession candidates. We also illustrate how CEOs can influence the effectiveness of board information gathering and processing. The tests of the theoretically generated hypotheses rely on in-depth qualitative interviews, coupled with unique survey and archival data from 355 firm-year observations of 218 large organizations, collected over three years.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze, in the Colombian developing context, the relationship between the presence of women in corporate positions and the financial performance of the company and to know if there are differences between family and non-family firms. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the contingency theory of leadership, which emphasizes that leader's personality and the situation in which that leader operates influences corporate decision-making, the authors use panel data models on a sample of 54 Colombian public businesses for the period 2008-2015 to test the proposed hypotheses on the relationship between women's presence in corporate governance positions and financial performance, as well as the difference between family and non-family firms. Findings: The results support that women's presence in corporate governance positions is positively associated with firm performance. More concretely, the authors find a relationship between women at the top corporate governance structure (as part of the board of directors, top management team and chief executive officer) and firm profitability. Results also indicate that family business, as a type of organization, (negatively) moderates the positive relationship between female participation in top executive positions (board and top executive team) and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: First, this study is limited to women in corporate positions in large companies listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange, and thus, generalizability for smaller entities may be limited. Second, data limitations do not allow us to investigate ways in which women's presence in corporate governance structures contributes to improve firm goals. Practical implications: The authors provide support to the hypothesis that positively relates women's presence in corporate governance positions and firm performance for the case of Colombia. This serves as a guidance to Colombian regulators, corporate decision-makers and policy-makers to promote the inclusion of women in top hierarchical structures through either mandatory laws or recommendation. Originality/value: Few studies have addressed the women's presence in corporate governance positions and contribution to firm performance in developing economies. This study contributes to better understand how women impact performance in contexts where women are underrepresented in corporate governance structure and where there are no laws that pressure firms to appoint women in corporate governance positions.

Research summary: We examine the consequences of the formalization of the board leadership structure at IPO for board-level turnover. We introduce the concept of director undervaluation. It indicates the degree to which a director's qualifications based on normatively accepted criteria for board leadership are not duly reflected in his/her appointments to the board chair and committee chair positions. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board ("board undervaluation"), the greater the turnover levels of undervalued directors. This effect is stronger when board interaction frequency is higher. We contribute to the behavioral perspective on corporate governance by introducing justice-based legitimacy as a key normative institution, and by providing a novel predictor of aggregate turnover of directors (as well as the firm's CEO). Managerial summary: Why do outside directors exit the board? We offer a novel answer to this question in the context of newly public firms. We suggest that when directors are passed over for the board chair and committee chair positions despite having higher qualifications than their peers, they have been "undervalued," and a negative board climate is likely to develop. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board, the higher the turnover levels of these undervalued directors. More frequent board meetings exacerbate these turnover levels. Further, these turnover effects are not restricted to undervalued directors--even the CEO is more likely to exit. This study demonstrates the critical importance of developing a legitimate and fair board leadership structure. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards operate notionally in a liminal, nonhierarchical space, neither inside the company nor outside, creating ambiguity between service and control functions and fostering tolerance of it. With repeated corporate governance crises, however, new prescriptions institutionalized in law, regulation, and codes of conduct have added significance to the control side, marked by monitoring and compliance tasks. Taking a cue from the strategy process and strategy-as-practice literature, this study revisits the work of directors on the service side: their engagement in strategizing. Formalization of board processes has led to greater structure and reduced the liminality of the board. Using interviews with 20 directors from a range of organization types, this study finds that directors experiment respond to increased institutionalization of board practice by seeking out new liminal spaces and informal practices, with implications for theory of boards, board activities, and public policy.

While academic researchers continue to debate the effect of board independence in increasing performance, its efficacy could also be reflected in whether firm performance is made more stable. Board governance activities are a constellation of actions aimed at managing agency costs and ensuring the viability of a company over time. The efficacy of such actions would, therefore, be reflected in a distal outcome, specifically, in lower firm performance variability. Boards that can control agency costs and limit both underinvestment and overinvestment would reduce a firm's deviation from its mean performance trajectory. Using a longitudinal sample of publicly traded companies in the United States, we find that board stability, board resource provision, and CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability. Board independence is not associated with performance variability. With increasing board independence, greater board stability and greater CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability, however, greater board resource provision is not associated with performance variability.

This study aims to explore whether the percentage of women on boards of directors and top and medium-level executive management positions in Jordanian banks had an effect on these banks' financial performance. To do so, the study employs a multiple regression model on data from Jordanian banks for the period from 2009 to 2016. The findings show that, contrary to the findings of many studies from developed countries, there is no statistically significant relation between the percentages of women on boards and top and medium-level executive managements of Jordanian banks and these banks' financial performance. However, due to the apparent advantages of the inclusion of women in such positions, as seen by the findings of many international studies, this study recommends that most Jordanian banks increase their currently small percentages of women on boards and top executive management positions in order to potentially achieve such advantages.

The study investigates demographic diversity, cognitive diversity and internal diversity within Islam among top-level management of firms and their impacts on the financial performance of Malaysian-listed companies. In addition, Muslim and non-Muslim women and Islamic religious diversity on corporate boards are investigated. Even though numerous organisations desire to be socially diverse, the significance of diversity for organisational performance remains uncertain. Are profitable companies inclined to improve board diversity or do other characteristics of the company contribute to firm performance? Does the participation of Muslim and non-Muslim women on corporate boards affect firm performance? Does internal diversity within Islam affect firm performance? Data from 330 Malaysian-listed companies in eleven full fledged sectors were used for the period from 2009 to 2013. This study employed econometrics methodology from panel data analysis to fill the research gap in the current management literature. This study used the interaction approach to examine empirically diverse corporate boards and their impacts on firm performance. This discussion included: (1) a combination of gender diversity and ethnic diversity and (2) a combination of gender diversity and foreign participation. The findings suggest that demographic, cognitive and internal diversity within Islam are significant predictors of a firm's financial performance. Ethnic women on boards have a significant and negative impact on firm performance. Hence, companies having high profits are more accountable for encouraging diversity among top-level management.

Two key groups central to improving firm performance are the top management team (TMT) and the board of directors. Executives undertake strategic actions, whereas board members fulfill their resource provision and monitoring roles. Drawing on tournament theory and equity theory, we propose that high pay dispersion among outside directors and the TMT is positively associated with strategic risk, whereas high (low) TMT pay dispersion and low (high) outside director pay dispersion are positively associated with firm performance. Our predictor is the unexplained component of horizontal pay dispersion, or the residual of pay dispersion resulting from regressing pay on observable firm, industry, period, and individual characteristics. Our results highlight the importance of unexplained pay dispersion for TMTs, but not for boards of directors, in improving firm performance. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Research Summary: Regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny question of whether to mandate a governance practice or allow for organic adoption. While mandates afford rapid diffusion, we theorize that they also result in ceremonial adoptions. Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment, we compare adoption outcomes for a governance practice--lead director adoption--that was mandated by the NYSE but not the NASDAQ. We find that NYSE firms are more likely than NASDAQ firms to have installed a lead director as a symbolic management tactic, so their lead directors are less effectual. We also find that transient institutional investors are deceived by this symbolic management, but dedicated institutional investors are not. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and analysts often desire to see companies introduce strict governance measures, such as proxy access and independent boards. Consequently, regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny issue of whether and when to mandate such practices for all companies. What they might not realize is that mandates may not work as well as they seem. Although more companies adopt reform under a mandate, they do so merely as a symbolic gesture. We look at one governance reform--appointing a lead director--finding that companies who introduce this reform as a result of a mandate appoint someone that is relatively toothless. We also find, though, that savvy investors are not actually fooled by this tactic and will trade out of firms that attempt such symbolic management. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

There is a significant debate on the real contribution of board diversity in corporate strategies. The objective of this study is to analyse the influence of board diversity on the disclosure process within a firm by focusing on risk reporting. The disclosure of this kind of information has become crucial in recent years in capital markets. Results show that gender and ethnic diversity in the boards positively influence the disclosure of information on risks. These findings contribute towards the debate about why diversity matters. Our study has important implications for the director-selection process since our results highlight the importance of considering the diverse background of board members. Regulators can also benefit from this evidence in order to issue recommendations and/or rules on the composition of boards of directors, as mechanisms to improve the disclosure practices of companies.

We propose and test a theory of board discretion in the context of the board's selection of a female CEO. We propose that boards also have discretion, an area that has typically focused exclusively on managers, and examine the conditions under which boards, facing high levels of uncertainty, have the latitude to make nontraditional choices, particularly when a negative equity market reaction to such a selection is likely. In the context of the nontraditional choice of a female CEO successor, we observe that the strong financial health of the firm and boardroom and situation-specific experience grant the board the discretion to select a female CEO. We test our model using all Standard & Poors (S&P) 1500 firms that experienced a CEO succession between 2000 and 2013. Implications for practice and research are discussed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

What role does the board of directors play in fostering organisational innovation? This study contributes to this conversation by exploring the relationship between board characteristics and business model innovation adoption. Drawing from resource dependence theory and using the smart home business model as our context, we examined the relationship among board size, CEO duality and proportion of outside directors on the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our analysis of 96 firms indicates that both board size and CEO duality significantly increase the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our findings highlight the important resource provision role boards play in promoting organisational innovation. (c) 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

In small and medium-sized organizations, boards of directors often spend most of their time providing advice to the management. As the content of advice provided has seldom been the focus of previous studies, we differentiate between functional and firm-specific advisory tasks. We examine antecedents of the two types to explain why this differentiation is important. Applying group effectiveness arguments, we study the effects board members' different knowledge bases and diversity have on the two advisory tasks, considering the mediating effects of board processes. Our results suggest that it is important to distinguish between different types of board members' knowledge and different board advisory tasks. Our findings have direct implications for research and practice. First, there is a need to go beyond the surface level understanding of what boards are doing. Second, our results emphasize the importance of organizational knowledge, and hence question the call for independent board members for advice provision. (c) 2017 European Academy of Management

Strategic decision-making processes influence firm-level outcomes. Using the theory of upper echelons, this study investigates how diversity in directors' skills, knowledge, and industry experience influence board decision-making processes that may impact overall strategic decision-making processes. Such diversity has been commonly accepted to be a 'double-edged sword'--enhancing comprehensiveness but hindering the speed of decision-making. On the contrary, we used an existing large survey database to show that directors' diverse educational background, functional background, and industry experience (job-related diversity) have a positive effect on comprehensiveness as well as the speed of board decision-making. In addition, our results indicate that board processes (directors' use of their knowledge and skills) play an important role by transmitting the positive effects of diversity. The study is in a tradition of exploring how boards may influence firms' strategic decision-making processes. Our findings provide additional arguments for adding job-related diversity to boards of directors. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the demographic diversity at top-level management and its impact on the performance of Malaysian-listed companies. In addition, Muslim diversity on corporate boards is examined. Design/methodology/approach: Although many organisations aspire to be socially diverse, diversity's consequences for organisational performance remain unclear. This study specifies the whole distinct mechanism and measures it independently, bridging as the demographic diversity among the board of directors (BODs) and bonding as the firm's financial performance. To maintain the homogeneity factor, the empirical analysis has been confined to 12 fully fledged sectors and 529 Malaysian listed firms out of 798 firms selected on the basis of judgmental sampling during the period of 2013. The paper applies the correlation matrix and linear regression model to justify this phenomenon. Findings: The empirical findings suggest that gender diversity (Muslim and Non-Muslim women) is positively significant with firm performance with regards to management, shareholders and market perspectives. It means that both Muslim and non-Muslim women are contributing to firm performance. Ethnic diversity (minority) and Muslim diversity (majority) have no impact on firm performance. On the other hand, interaction variables are positively significant with firm performance. It means that majority and minorities are essential for corporate boards to produce a greater performance. Research limitations/implications: Future research could include more variables such as director's age profile and foreign participation as well as other types of diversities, such as cognitive diversity and corporate diversity. In addition, another possible extension could be the investigation of diversity issues between small scale and large or high and low-profit firms. The findings provide insightful information to firms, as this study suggests that the diverse corporate boards can enhance firm performance. Originality/value: In recent years, diversity issues have been examined with regard to firm performance of the listed companies. Whilst extensive literature exists on diversity issues, this issue is still under debate and has had inconsistent results. The paper attempts to fill the gap in the existing literature, discuss the empirically diverse corporate boards with the interaction approach and impact on the firm performance.

Using data from China's listed privately owned enterprises (POEs) during the period from 2002 to 2014, we explore the effects of firm life cycle on board structure. We find that the board size of China's listed POEs declines over firm life cycle, and there is a trend of separation for board chair-CEO duality while board independence remains almost static. We further provide evidence that board size and independence are determined by the benefits of monitoring and advisory roles of the boards through all the stages of firms' life cycle with different drivers. The impact of CEO power on board chair-CEO duality is determined by the benefits and costs of separation of board chair, and CEOs are supported at all stages of firms' life cycle. This article sheds light on the dynamic board structure in an emerging economy where the external corporate governance is weaker than that of developed countries. Our findings suggest that the board structures of China's listed POEs are adjusted at various stages of firms' life cycle, and the adjustments are mostly based on the resources brought by the new board of directors.

The present research has been undertaken to study the role of ownership type and board mechanisms in moderating the executive pay-corporate performance linkage in the Indian context. A sample of 209 companies listed on the S&P BSE 500 Index has been studied over the period 2008-2009 to 2012-2013. Rigorous statistical analysis of the panel data highlights that some of the governance mechanisms are, in practice, instrumental in improving the relationship between pay and performance. Whereas efforts must, indeed, be channelled towards the better functioning of certain other internal control mechanisms. Specifically, of noteworthy consequence is the difference in the way the shareholders and the board of directors ameliorate the pay-performance relationship with respect to accounting vis-a-vis market-based corporate performance. Further, the weak monitoring role discharged by the institutional investors warrant immediate policy concern. The study brings forth important implications for practitioners and policy makers in designing corporate performance-based pay keeping in view the predominant influence exerted by the institutional environment of the emerging economy of India.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of corporate governance practices on firms' financial performance, as measured by comprehensive income (CI). Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 237 firms from the Standards & Poor (S&P) 500 index during the years 2004-2009, multivariate statistical analyses are conducted to confirm the authors' main hypothesis. Findings: The results indicate that having high levels of corporate governance culture has a positive impact on a measure of firms' financial performance, namely, CI. Furthermore, they indicate a positive correlation between a higher percentage of external directors and financial performance, and a negative relationship between number of board meetings and financial performance. Originality/value: The main contribution of this research is that good corporate governance strategies deliver superior financial performance for businesses in terms of CI. This serves as a method of value creation, which is the ultimate goal of a business. In addition to the use of CI as an indicator of financial performance, a unique measure of corporate governance level is tested. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Previous studies have been unable to establish a clear relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. We argue that this could be due to the failure of these studies to account for both the endogeneity problem and the possible nonlinearity of the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. We overcome these problems by studying the investor reaction at the announcement of a female director's departure. We find a negative market reaction only when this departure drops the gender diversity below a critical level of three women. In all other cases, a director's departure has no significant impact on shareholder wealth. This result is consistent with the assumption of value in diversity and critical mass theory.

Using a legitimacy lens, we theorize that changes in the firm's board of directors parallel the evolving stakeholder audience that accords legitimacy to the firm--a key resource to the firm's survival. Powerful new stakeholders post- initial public offering (IPO) such as the listing exchange and the securities regulators are anticipated to impact board gender diversity through their regulatory pressure, while pre-IPO investors such as venture capitalists are reducing their equity positions and thus providing opportunities for director turnover. At the same time, the firm is increasing in size and visibility, building additional sociocultural legitimacy pressures for increased gender diversity. While prior research centers on the effect of different types and intensity of legitimacy pressures on board characteristics, we explore how changes in the question of firms' legitimacy "to whom" affects board composition, that is, we examine the comparative effect of regulation and society on board composition. We test our hypotheses by analyzing panel data for all North American technology firms doing IPOs on the NASDAQ exchange during a 12-year time frame between 1997 and 2011. Our analysis shows that regulation, although not explicitly directive, can play a key role in accelerating board gender diversity. Implications for future research on corporate governance and managerial and policy takeaways complete this article. (c) 2018, (c) The Author(s) 2018.

This paper explores the role of board characteristics of Indian banks on their market performance. We conducted panel data analysis on a sample of 29 Indian banks that form part of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) 500 index (covering a period of 8 years from 2009-2016). While ten board characteristics were considered as independent variables, Tobin's Q was considered as the dependent variable (Tobin?s Q was assumed to be a proxy for market performance of banks). Findings suggest that only three out of ten board characteristics (average number of boards served, CEO duality and number of meetings conducted) positively affect market performance of Indian banks. Our sample included 29 Indian banks covering a period of 8 years. Also, other corporate governance mechanisms, such as characteristics of audit committee, stakeholder relations committee, nomination and remuneration committee and risk management committee were not considered for the study. Hence caution must be taken in generalizing the results of the study. (c) 2018 AESS Publications. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether a private firm's demand for a Big4 auditor is influenced by the auditor choice of its main supplier, customer and competitor. The authors rely on institutional theory to explain this stakeholders' influence. The authors also examine whether the extent to which the firm's board of directors engages in networking moderates this influence. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire data are combined with archival data of 210 Belgian private firms with a statutory audit requirement. Logistic regression analysis is applied to examine to what extent firms follow their main competitor, customer and supplier in hiring a Big4 auditor. Findings: The results reveal a positive association between the firm's choice of a Big4 auditor and its main supplier being audited by a Big4 auditor, supporting the conformance effect (isomorphism) toward suppliers as hypothesized by institutional theory. The extent of board networking, however, seems to weaken this effect. Toward competitors, a divergence effect instead of a conformance effect is found, which indicates the existence of competitive differentiation regarding auditor choice. Research limitations/implications: While prior studies mainly focus on the agency relationships between shareholders, debtholders and managers to explain auditor choice, this study also takes into account the firm's other main stakeholders by relying on institutional theory. Both the conformance effect toward suppliers as well as the divergence effect toward competitors provide interesting additional perspectives on why auditors are demanded, leading to interesting future research opportunities. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to consider additional theories in explaining audit outcomes. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Directors of firms are theorized to fulfil control, service and resource dependence roles. However, the ways in which directors' of Chinese MNCs govern their foreign subsidiaries, and perform these roles remains unclear. Building on the institutional logics perspective, this study explores the roles enacted by the boards of directors eight Chinese-controlled companies in Australia to gain an appreciation of their governance practices. In depth semi-structured interviews with insider and independent directors, consultants and market analysts were undertaken. A content analysis of company annual reports and web sites complimented primary sources of data on board functions. Findings reveal that control is the most dominant role played by these boards, rather than service or resource dependence. It also appears that the dominant logics of Chinese institutions influence the corporate governance of Chinese MNCs as they internationalize. These findings extend our understanding of corporate governance practices in China and abroad. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The study examined the linear and curvilinear relationships between the number of women on boards and corporate social responsibility (CSR) among medium- to large-sized publicly listed for-profit companies in Australia. The relationship was predicted as positive linear based on the resource dependence theory (RDT) and inverted U-shaped based on the integration of RDT and group structure theory. The results show a positive linear relationship between women on boards and CSR, whereas the curvilinear relationship was not significant. Our findings suggest that the presence of women on boards increases the organizations' focus towards the CSR activities. Future research might consider the impact of women on boards on CSR in different cultural contexts or by segmenting population based on industry type.

The paper examines the leading causes of abrupt and massive changes in the top management in a successful entity in an emerging economy - Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited. The paper is based on an extensive case study method. The study uses both primary and secondary sources of data. Primary data include direct conversation with various stakeholders of the bank using unstructured questionnaire. The data were collected before and after the changes in the top management. The study found the leading causes of reshuffle in top management including chairman, vice-chairman and chief executive officer are: pressure from government, involvement of a political party with the bank management - Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami an opposition to the present government, lack of transparency of corporate social responsibility expenditures, and pressure of foreign investors. However, no negative impacts were seen within the first month of the changes on stock prices of the bank in the country's two stock markets. Copyright (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether the theoretical relationship between the board composition and the cost of capital (CC) is mediated by risk disclosure (RD) practices. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares techniques are used, and a sample of all the companies belonging to manufacturing industry listed on Standard and Poor's 500 for the year 2009 is studied. In relation to board composition, several recommendations issued by US governance codes are considered: board independence, board size, CEO duality, gender diversity, ethnic diversity, and financial expertise. Content analysis techniques are employed to measure RDs. Findings: The results show that boards that follow governance codes recommendations lead to a reduction in the CC through the disclosure of information on risks. Research limitations/implications: These results provide encouraging opportunities for future research about the real role of the board of directors and suggest the need for the analysis of the participation of directors in firm strategy to better understand the effect of boards on the corporate outcome. Practical implications: This evidence must help regulators and owners to set up adequate corporate governance mechanisms regarding the composition of boards. This evidence also presents direct implications for managers, who can better understand the value-relevance of RDs. Originality/value: This paper provides new insight into the literature, which highlights that the effect of boards of directors on firm outcomes must be mediated by the involvement of boards in specific strategies.

Employing a synthesis model, this chapter examines the relationship between board structure and board processes within family firms. By reviewing the family firm governance literature from the past 20 years, we apply the Ilgen et al. (Annu Rev Psychol 56:517-543, 2005) input-mediator-output-input framework to identify heterogeneous family processes which ultimately impact the forming, functioning, and finishing stages of boards of directors in family firms. In doing so, we help to answer questions of why family firm boards are effective rather than what predicts board effectiveness, as well as provide guidance for future research.

In the board of directors is common to observe the interaction between companies from inserting the same counselor in different councils, which is called the Board Interlocking (BI), disseminating information and experience among advisers who seek to use them for decision making. The aim of the study is to assess the influence of Board Interlocking in audit firm selection in mandatory rotation in companies listed on the BM&FBovespa. This is a study, documentary and quantitative. We used a sample of 235 companies that had the exchange of the audit firm in 2012. The processing and analysis of data using descriptive statistics and logistic regression. The results indicate the existence of BI in the enterprises. The result of the regression indicates an improvement in the model assertiveness, but without statistical significance. It was concluded that the BI is practiced by Brazilian companies and does not influence the choice of audit firm on mandatory rotation.

This study empirically examines the relationship between wide-ranging board diversity and the quality of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure variables in Malaysia. We extend prior literature covering broader dimensions of board diversity (e.g., gender, education level, education background, age, tenure, nationality and ethnicity) and their impact on CSR after controlling for board and audit committee characteristics. Using 200 listed firms in Bursa Malaysia during 2009-2013 and applying both OLS and 2SLS instrumental variables (IV) approaches, we document significant positive effect of board education level and board tenure diversity on the quality of CSR disclosure. Further analysis using robust regression also shows positive association between gender diversity and CSR disclosure. Our findings also demonstrate that the quality of CSR disclosure is significantly negatively associated with board age and nationality diversity. These results remain consistent with using alternative measures for board diversity, and characteristics for board of director and audit committees as well as split samples between large and small firms. Additional tests exhibit complementary relationship of education level and nationality with gender, while substitutive relationship of age and tenure with gender in influencing CSR. These findings provide useful insights into the policy makers in setting regulations in respect of board diversity in Malaysia and other emerging economies in the Asian region. Our evidence is also useful for listed companies in setting the criteria to identify directors who can support their strategic decisions. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Purpose: Using a data set of listed firms domiciled in Taiwan, this paper aims to empirically assess the effects of ownership structure and board of directors on firm value. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of Taiwanese listed firms from 1997 to 2015, this study uses a panel estimation to exploit both the cross-section and time-series nature of the data. Furthermore, two stage least squares (2SLS) regression model is used as robustness test to mitigate the endogeneity issue. Findings: The main results show that the higher the proportion of independent directors, the smaller the board size, together with a two-tier board system and no chief executive officer duality, the stronger the firm's performance. With respect to ownership structure, block-holders' ownership, institutional ownership, foreign ownership and family ownership are all positively related to firm value. Research limitations/implications: Although the Taiwanese corporate governance reform concerning the independent director system which is mandatory only for newly-listed companies is successful, the regulatory authority should require all listed companies to appoint independent directors to further enhance the Taiwanese corporate governance. Originality/value: First, unlike most of the previous literature on Western developed countries, this study examines the effects of corporate governance mechanisms on firm performance in a newly industrialised country, Taiwan. Second, while a number of studies used a single indicator of firm performance, this study examines both accounting-based and market-based firm performance. Third, this study addresses the endogeneity issue between corporate governance factors and firm performance by using 2SLS estimation, and details the econometric tests for justifying the appropriateness of using 2SLS estimation.

Purpose: This study aims to reconcile some of the conflicting results in prior studies of the board structure-firm performance relationship and to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of agency theory in the specific context of Italian corporate governance practice. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a dynamic generalised method of moments on a sample of Italian listed companies over the period 2003-2015. Proxies for corporate governance mechanisms are the board size, the level of board independence, ownership structure, shareholder agreements and CEO-chairman leadership. Findings: While directors elected by minority shareholders are not able to impact performance, independent directors do have a non-linear effect on performance. Board size has a positive effect on firm performance for lower levels of board size. Ownership structure per se and shareholder agreements do not affect firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by reconciling some of the conflicting results inherent in the board structure-performance relationship. Firm performance is not necessarily improved by having a high number of independent directors on the board. Ownership structure and composition do not affect firm performance; therefore, greater monitoring provided by concentrated ownership does not necessarily lead to stronger firm performance. Practical implications: This paper suggests that Italian corporate governance law should improve the rules and effectiveness of minority directors by analysing whether they are able to impede the main shareholders to expropriate private benefits on the expenses of the minority. The legislator should not impose any restrictive regulations with regard to CEO duality, as the influence of CEO duality on performance may vary with respect to the unique characteristics of each company. Originality/value: The results enrich the understanding of the applicability of agency theory in listed companies, especially in Italy. Additionally, this paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of research evidence of agency theory studies. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Although increased board independence is a commonly offered solution to curbing corporate misconduct, scholars have expressed skepticism about its effectiveness, and empirical evidence is mixed. We argue that the relationship between board independence and corporate misconduct is likely nuanced--and may vary by the type of independence (e.g., independence on the whole board or on the audit committee) and by national context. We conducted a meta-analysis of 135 studies spanning more than 20 countries. We find that the board independence-corporate misconduct relationship (a) is generally negative, (b) varies based on the implementation form that independence takes on (i.e., independence of the whole board, on the audit committee, or between the roles of CEO and board chair), and (c) is more strongly negative in countries with less corruption. We advance corporate governance theory and research by demonstrating that the popular governance practice of increasing board independence must both account for the manner in which independence is implemented and consider the powerful influence of firms' broader societal context to clearly understand its effect. Further, based on our review of the literature, we uncover opportunities for the advancement of corporate governance and corporate misconduct research. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Going beyond the mere participation of female directors within boardrooms, we investigate which of the two major boards of directors' roles (advisory versus monitoring) is best played by female directors in order to make a difference to shareholders. More specifically, we investigate the impact that advisory and monitoring female directors have on managerial opportunism with a specific focus on earnings management. Using sample of US firms, we find evidence suggesting that female directors holding monitoring roles mitigate managerial opportunism, as measured by discretionary accruals. In contrast to the current argument that advisory directors in general are better able to sustain and improve earnings quality, we find no evidence that suggests that advisory female directors are significantly associated with lower managerial opportunism. Overall, the results remain robust after controlling for potential endogeneity problems, corporate governance, and external auditor quality. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We examine the resource provision role of the board of directors in ensuring substantive corporate sustainability practices. Specifically, we examine two channels of resource provision (i.e., the presence of non-executive directors with previous experience in environmental issues--EEDs--and network connections of EEDs) that can affect a firm's ethical and environmental behavior. Using greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data from FTSE 350 firms, as a measure of environmental performance, we show that the presence of EEDs on the board is associated with lower GHG emissions. Further, firms with better-networked EEDs have better environmental performance. A possible mechanism is that firms with EEDs invest more in environmental technology. These results suggest that, in addition to the traditional role of shareholder value maximization, the board of directors also caters to the interests of wider stakeholders of the firm by facilitating substantive ethical practices.

Research Summary: This study explores how external pressure for board gender diversity influences the increase of female directors. We propose that while external pressure has a positive effect on the increase of female directors on boards, it heightens the salience of gender in new director selection, making incumbent male directors more likely to treat the new female directors as outgroup members and consequently more likely to add them through addition of board seats rather than substitution of male directors. We further predict that new female directors added through additional board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through substitution of male directors. Results from a large sample of S&P 1,500 firms during 2004 to 2015 provide support our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Our study intends to enhance the understanding of how external pressure influences a firm's decision to increase the number of female directors on the board. We find that, although external pressure makes firms more likely to increase female directors, firms tend to do it through the addition of board seats rather than through the replacement of incumbent male directors to the extent that the increase is a response to the external pressure. Moreover, we find that new female directors added through addition of board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through replacement of male directors. These findings suggest that external pressure has a positive but limited effect on countering the gender bias on corporate boards toward female directors. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines the demand- and supply-side factors associated with audit partner selection and assignment in the United States. First, we examine whether audit partner gender and experience are associated with board and management gender and experience. Second, we investigate whether engagement audit quality varies with audit partner gender and experience, controlling for selection effects. The results indicate that companies with more gender-diverse boards of directors and top management teams are more likely to have a female lead audit partner. In addition, the experience of the client's board is positively associated with the experience of the lead audit partner. In terms of audit quality, we find that higher audit fees are positively associated with female and more experienced audit partners. Our results shed light on the important role that partner characteristics play in the demand and supply sides of audit quality. (c) 2019 American Accounting Association. All rights reserved.

Coalitions are important in organizational decision making, but the question of how coalitions are built and make decisions in response to firm performance is still not sufficiently explored. In this study, we develop and test theory on how potential coalitions are built through shared experience and recruitment of allies. When organizations respond to performance relative to aspiration levels, either as problemistic search following low performance or opportunity exploration following high performance, members form coalitions to influence decisions. We develop theory of coalition formation that builds on upper echelons theory and the theory of dominant coalitions to predict how past experience of decision makers leads to preferred actions by each member and subsequent coalition formation. We use this theory to make new measures of potential coalitions and apply it to acquisitions made by firms in China. We find evidence that the experience of members of the key decision-making group--the board of directors--affects the potential coalition building, and hence the type of acquisition target, as predicted.

Research Summary: We employ an exploratory approach to understand what differentiates boards that retain limited, potentially tokenistic, gender diversity (i.e., a single female director), and boards that more genuinely diversify their composition by appointing additional female directors. Previous studies have speculated that strategic leaders responsible for board appointments may influence this occurrence. Using longitudinal data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee increase the likelihood of additional female director appointments. Boards and nominating committees with younger members amplify these effects, respectively. We use interviews with board members and professional corporate governance consultants to discuss the probable causal mechanisms that underpin these relationships, highlighting novel theoretical insights related to gatekeeping and social psychology. Managerial Summary: We explore what compels firms to appoint additional female directors after the first one, as only one female director could be considered a token. Using data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee make firms more likely to appoint additional female directors. These likelihoods are highest when younger directors make up the board at large and/or nominating committee. Chief executive officers can be change agents for gender diversity in their organizations by hiring female top managers and pushing for better representation of women on boards. Likewise, younger directors appear to enhance board gender diversity. These findings can inform the director selection process. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines the relationship between boards of directors' demographic diversity and firms' financial performance. In particular, we highlight how women and ethnic minorities can affect Middle Eastern SMEs' financial performance. Using an unbalanced panel of 1,855 firm-year observations of 371 boards of directors from nine Middle Eastern countries, our results support the positive impact of women and ethnic minority group members on Middle Eastern firms' performance. However, our evidence implies that when Western ethnic minority members increase, firms' performances tend to decrease, because these board members are appointed for regional and international board reputation legitimacy, personal business agendas, and links to the external corporate environment.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the literature on two lines of research, corporate governance and innovation, explaining how different internal corporate governance mechanisms may be determinants of business innovation. Design/methodology/approach: It explores the theoretical background and the empirical evidence regarding the influence of both ownership structure and the board of directors on company innovation. Then, conclusions are drawn and possible future research lines are presented. Findings: No consensus was observed regarding the relation between corporate governance and innovation, with both positive and negative arguments being found, and with empirical evidence not always pointing in the same direction. Thus, new studies trying to clarify this relationship are needed. Originality/value: Over recent years, interest has grown in the influence of governance mechanisms on innovation decisions taken by the management. Innovation efforts and results depend on factors that are influenced by corporate governance, such as ownership structure or the functioning of the board of directors. Thus, the paper shows an updated state of the art in this field proposing future lines for empirical research. (c) 2018, Diego Asensio-Lopez, Laura Cabeza-Garcia and Nuria Gonzalez-Alvarez.

Purpose: This paper aims to use the passage of the Italian Gender Diversity Law to help isolate the effects of board gender diversity on firm value by investigating conditions under which such diversity provides greater role-enhancing resources to the board. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a one-day event study to measure when gender diversity matters to investors. Abnormal returns from Italian firms were used to study investors' anticipated outcomes of the effect of gender diversity on firm value. Findings: Board gender diversity is financially beneficial especially for firms with a male dual CEO and board chair and with few or no women on board committees and firms that operate in industries with greater levels of competition. Addition of these moderators more than doubles the variance explained. Moreover, the effect of gender is isolated in this study, which examined investor reaction to the expectation of increases in the number of female board members, rather than to specific female appointees. Social implications: Determining the conditions when a gender diverse matters to firm value is important for shareholders, policymakers and advocates for gender equality. The findings illustrate precise conditions for stakeholders to make the case for board gender diversity as achieving financial reward, in addition to societal benefit. Originality/value: The value of a gender diverse board is contingent on the company's need for diverse resources (e.g. more competition, lack of gender diversity on committees or CEO duality). This paper provides insight as to why prior research linking board gender diversity to firm value finds seemingly contradictory results. Thus, this paper provides useful insights for researchers, boards and legislative bodies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The authors hypothesize that customer presence in the boardroom of business-to-business (B2B) firms brings customer orientation and customer knowledge to the board of directors and thereby enhances B2B firm performance. Using an objective measure of customer presence in the boardroom and a sample of 329 B2B firms over a nine-year period, the authors find support for this hypothesis. Moreover, relying on the resource-based view, they hypothesize that the performance benefit of customers in the boardroom is contingent on the value, rarity, inimitability, and organizational fit of customer resources. Specifically, they find that a customer on the board is more effective when demand uncertainty is high but is less effective when the firm is highly diversified. Moreover, a board member who is an independent director of the customer firm is less effective than a board member who is an executive at the customer firm. The authors also find that research and development intensity partially mediates the relationship between customer presence on the board and firm performance. (c) American Marketing Association 2018.

Research Summary: We explore the selection of new CEOs with international backgrounds as a key microfoundation of global strategy. Building on executive succession, upper echelons, and international business research, we argue that firms choose CEOs with international backgrounds to match their task demands. We further argue that depending on the CEO's origin from inside or outside the firm, different task demands matter. Specifically, we propose that the relationship between internal (firm-level) task demands and the new CEO's international background is more pronounced for inside successions, whereas the relationship between external (industry-level) task demands and the new CEO's international background is more pronounced for outside successions. An analysis of a sample of 363 CEO successions in S&P 500 firms supports our reasoning. Managerial Summary: Choosing a CEO with the "right" experience is a crucial concern for many large firms. While firms increasing seem to select new CEOs with international backgrounds, not all firms do so. In this article, we explore several factors that might influence this choice. Our results reveal that the predecessor's international background, the firm's level of internationalization, and the level of internationalization of the firm's industry influence whether a CEO with an international background is selected. Moreover, while for inside successions, the firm's level of internationalization is particularly important, for outside successions, the level of internationalization of the firm's industry is particularly important. Our findings inform those who search, select, and appoint new CEOs, including boards of directors and (executive search) consultants. Copyright (c) 2017 Strategic Management Society

Research Summary: A number of studies examine the extent to which boards compensate CEOs for their firm's performance (i.e., pay-for-performance), but these studies typically do not incorporate what CEOs actually do to bring about those performance outcomes. We suggest that directors will make stronger internal attributions about firm performance when the CEO engages in high levels of corporate strategic investment. CEOs that invest in firm growth essentially "place their bets," so the pay-for-performance relationship is stronger for them than it is for CEOs who do not invest as much in firm growth. We also theorize and find that directors make internal attributions about firm performance more for prestigious, but not less prestigious, CEOs and more when the directors collectively exhibit conservative, but not liberal, political ideologies. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and other stakeholders often demand that CEOs should be paid for performance. In other words, CEOs should be paid well when the company is performing well and paid less when the company is not performing well. We add an additional dimension: boards might also consider what CEOs actually do to bring about performance outcomes. Our findings suggest that when CEOs make heavy corporate investments, they essentially "place their bets." In this scenario, boards attribute performance to the CEO so that CEO compensation rises and falls with company performance. When CEOs make fewer corporate investments, their compensation is not as strongly associated with company performance. This primary relationship is particularly true when CEOs have high social recognition or when the directors are collectively conservative. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study applied a quantitative research approach, secondary data, a sample of 71 corporations were selected from Top 250 corporations for one year (2016). The findings of this study indicated that the board independence has a significant impact on the reduction of earnings management. In contrast, the board size does not have any impact on the reduction of earnings management, due the larger the board size less efficient on monitoring of the board, when there are more members on the board it is more difficult for the board members to monitor the management, While gender diversity has a significant impact on the reduction of earnings management, Finally, The CEO Duality has a significant impact on the increase of earnings management, which means the separating the functions of CEO and Chair of the Board may enhance the Board of Directors' monitoring and control ability, and improve Directors' information processing capacities.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to use the dynamic capabilities framework to explain the effect of board networks, as a source of intellectual capital, on firm performance. The authors propose that the influence of board interlocks depends on their ability to contribute to strategic decision making. As a result, their effect is subject to the business context in which they occur and the different role of the interconnected directors involved. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use social network analysis to make board connections and to calculate centrality measures. The authors also identify busy boards to analyze whether their effect differs from centrality. The authors estimate the theoretical model using the Generalized Method of Moments in order to take advantage of the panel database. Findings: For a sample of Spanish firms from 1999 to 2015, the results show there is no direct significant effect of directors' networks on firm performance. However, the authors find a positive and significant influence of intra-industry board connections, particularly when they are established among outsiders. Research limitations/implications: The Spanish context of the study can limit the generalization of the papers' results. Practical implications: The results can be useful both for practitioners - since they can serve as a guide for companies to reformulate their boards in search of the optimal structure-, and when implementing good governance codes - establishing limits for director interlocking. Originality/value: This study helps to offer a better understanding of how directors' networks can add value to the firm depending on the kind of resources they provide (context) and the role of the director who is connected.

Purpose: As the primary decision makers, chief executive officers (CEOs) play pivotal roles in firm innovation. However, little is known regarding how CEOs influence the exploitation and exploration paradox. To advance theory and research, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the joint effects of CEO tenure and CEO-chair duality on a firm's shifting emphasis between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes the approach of a longitudinal sample of 81 US pharmaceutical firms. Findings: As CEOs' tenure advance, their firms' percentage of exploitative innovation increases. Furthermore, non-duality (separation of board chair and CEO) further strengthens the positive relationship between CEO tenure and the percentage of exploitative innovation. Research limitations/implications: This study integrates upper echelons theory and behavioral agency theory to juxtapose the effects of CEOs on technological innovation. This study extends knowledge of strategic leadership and innovation by showing that CEOs influence the balance between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Furthermore, this study also contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating that monitoring vigilance could inhibit capable CEOs from pursuing more exploratory innovation. Practical implications: Boards of directors should allow CEOs to have greater discretion over innovation, and vigilant monitoring and control may force CEOs to focus less on exploration. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies that explicitly investigate how CEO influences a firm's emphasis on exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation.

This article examines how the impact of Information technology (IT) governance by the board of directors on firms' financial performance can be mediated through IT operating capabilities, and how such board IT governance (B-ITG) can modulate the influence of IT operating capability on financial performance. Findings based on a survey of 89 corporate directors indicate that both B-ITG and IT operating capability increase financial performance. They further point to complex B-ITG effects on financial performance, including complementarity with and shaping IT operating capability. They show that high B-ITG suppresses the effect of IT operating capability on financial performance and that B-ITG effects on financial performance are partially mediated through IT operating capability.

Although personal attributes have gained recognition as an important area of effective corporate governance, scholarship has largely overlooked the value and implications of individual virtue in governance practice. We explore how authenticity--a personal and morally significant virtue--affects the primary monitoring and strategy functions of the board of directors as well as core processes concerning director selection, cultivation, and enactment by the board. While the predominant focus in corporate governance research has been on structural factors that influence firm financial outcomes, this paper shifts attention to the role of authenticity and its relationship to individual board member qualities and collective board activities. We explore how authenticity has the potential to influence board dynamics and decision making and to enhance transparency and accountability.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the influence of gender diversity on the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate governance (CG) and economic and financial performance of Brazilian publicly traded companies. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises 68 non-financial public companies comprising the IBX100 index of BM&FBOVESPA. For that, it was used panel data modeling, correlation and ranking by TOPSIS method. Findings: The results suggest a significant relationship between CG and economic-financial performance when mediated by gender diversity. This relationship was not observed between CSR and economic-financial performance. Thus, it can be concluded that in a diversified board of directors, in terms of gender, better monitoring of managers can occur because of the increase in their independence in decisions, as well as performance increase. These results diverge from the literature on the influence of women's participation in corporate boards in CSR. It is assumed that this result is because of the fact that the participation of women is recent in Brazil. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations are the number of companies analyzed, the choice of ISE index to verify the CSR variable and the metric used to verify the CG mechanisms. Originality/value: In general, this research contributes to the literature of the area, especially in Brazil, in confirming that the mediating variable gender diversity makes the relationship between CG and performance more significant.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an extension of the behavioral agency model (BAM) by focusing on the moderating role of CEO gender on the relationship between CEO stock options and risk "systematic vs idiosyncratic" and the performance consequences "positive vs negative" of these option incentives. Design/methodology/approach: Data on CEO's stock option portfolios are collected from the Standard & Poor's (S&P's) ExecuComp. This paper uses a panel data analysis for matched samples of CEOs in S&P's 1,500 listed firms over the period 2006-2013. Findings: The results indicate a more conservative, risk-averse posture in the case of female CEOs than for male CEOs when they are compensated with stock options for idiosyncratic (firm-specific) risk. The results also confirm that female CEOs in low systematic risk contexts, although more conservative, take more prudent risks that produce better long-term outcomes as compared to their male counterparts. Practical implications: Important implications for the design of optimal CEO's compensation packages emanate from this study. Findings provide useful tools for board of directors to design CEO's pay packages that take into account the different risk behavior of male and female CEOs with the aim of enhancing firm performance. Originality/value: This paper provides new evidence within the area of stock option-based compensation by focusing on the distinction between systematic and idiosyncratic risk when the effect of CEO stock option is analyzed and performance implications of awarding options to male and female CEOs.

Drawing on the identity fit perspective in organizational identity research, we investigate changes in new director selection patterns for family-influenced (i.e., family identity) and lone founder (i.e., entrepreneurial identity) firms experiencing growth. We collect over 7000 observations of new director placements from 2001 to 2014 and find that both family-influenced and lone founder firms tend to decrease the selection of new directors with similar firm-type board experience as firm size grows and firm performance deviates from that of similar firms. Lone founder firms also decrease the extent to which they hire new directors with previous board experience in lone founder firms following the appointment of a nonfounder CEO. We conclude that while family-influenced firms often use new director selection decisions to maintain the fit between family and firm identity, firm growth creates challenging conditions that threaten family-firm identity maintenance.

We examine the impact of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) on the compensation of powerful corporate leaders [i.e., boards of directors, including Chief Executives Officers (CEOs), Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), and Board Chairs] of acquiring firms. Using one of the largest datasets on M&As, directors' compensation, and governance to-date, consisting of a sample of UK financials (banks, insurance firms, private equity firms, and speciality finance firms) over a 13-year period, our results obtained by employing multivariate regression analyses show that acquisitions, on average, have a positive and significant impact on directors' compensation. This effect applies to both powerful corporate executives (CEOs, CFOs, and all other executive directors) and other non-executive directors. However, the positive acquisition effect on top executive compensation is much higher in larger and more complex acquisitions. We also find that much of the acquisition-related pay raises is equity-based rather than cash-based. Finally, we find CEOs to be the top beneficiaries from acquisitions. We interpret our findings within a multi-theoretical framework that draws insights from agency, executive power, managerial talent, and tournament theories of top executive compensation.

Purpose: This paper aims to draw on insights from team learning theory and stakeholder theory to examine the influence of board composition on firms' stakeholder management practices. The authors posit that board diversity is likely to enhance stakeholder management by shaping organizational goals by placing emphasis on the interests of a wide variety of stakeholders and providing firms with relevant knowledge to enhance their ability manage these interests. The authors further theorize on the moderating role of boards' learning environment, which they conceptualized as an important complementary governance-related factor, likely to further boards' ability to enhance stakeholder management. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test these predictions using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique on a panel of S&P 500 firms observed from 2001 to 2011. Findings: The findings provide evidence that more diverse boards in terms of gender, nationality and race/ethnicity are generally associated with more effective stakeholder management. Further, the findings also suggest that boards' co-working experience moderates the relationship between gender and national diversity and stakeholder management. Originality/value: While corporate governance research surveys many strategic implications of board composition, limited attention has been paid to the interplay of board characteristics with stakeholder management. This study is among the first to the authors' knowledge to explore the impact of board diversity on stakeholder management using team learning research, thus drawing attention to the role of boards' co-working experience in shaping their ability to impact firms' outcomes.

Considerable advances have been made in corporate governance research in recent years and opportunities exist to consider these developments within alliances. We extend the "scope of operations" hypothesis to the domain of joint ventures. This proposition suggests that the monitoring carried out by boards increases when organizations become more complex. The inherent characteristics of JVs generate unique sources of complexity that are currently unexplored in the corporate governance literature. First, we seek to determine their influence on monitoring by using primary data on JV board monitoring. Second, we adopt the size of JV boards as a proxy for monitoring in order to examine whether the determinants of board size and monitoring in fact coincide and to reveal if certain effects are masked by using board size as a simple proxy for monitoring. Doing so enables us to investigate the black-box of what boards actually do as well as extend governance research to other organizational forms. Our findings confirm that the unique characteristics of JVs influence the information needs by the boards resulting in more monitoring by JV directors. Our findings show there is value in bridging alliance theory and the literature on corporate governance research. We also advance practitioner's understanding by providing suggestions on how to structure JV boards in relation to their complexity. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

We study minority equity partnerships and the representation of investing firms on the boards of directors of their partners. In such alliances, an investor firm owns a minority position in the investee partner and may or may not secure a board seat. Prior alliance governance research has largely focused on the choice between equity and nonequity forms of alliances, and it has paid little attention to the particular administrative features of these organizational forms, notably their governing boards. We extend corporate governance research that has emphasized the monitoring and advisory roles of boards by examining how an investee's concerns about knowledge misappropriation can reduce the likelihood that an investor obtains board representation. We suggest that, although there exist opportunities for an investee to benefit from the investor's advice, the investor's ability to use an investee's knowledge by itself and indirectly with the help of its other partners negatively affects the likelihood of a board seat for the investor. We further argue that this negative effect is amplified when the investee has particularly valuable technologies at risk of appropriation by the investor. Our evidence from minority equity partnerships in the biopharmaceutical industry indicates why and when investors do not obtain board seats, despite the monitoring and advisory benefits that directors can bring to cooperative commercialization agreements.

Research Question/Issue: How does organizational context influence the impact of board control over managerial decisions on shareholder wealth?. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce a new theoretical concept--organizational discretion--to characterize the upper limit of managers' latitude of actions presented by their organizational context and propose that it moderates the impact of board control on shareholder wealth. Specifically, we first argue that strategic control by boards over managerial decisions reduces managers' latitude of actions and leads to trade-offs between the containment of managerial opportunism and the pursuit of strategic opportunities, which consequently influence the relationship between strategic control and shareholder wealth. We then suggest that the trade-offs incurred by strategic control over managerial decisions are more prominent in firms with high organizational discretion. Because of the trade-offs, we propose that boards are likely to decide whether to rely more on strategic control or financial control in internal corporate governance based on their firms' level of organizational discretion. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By introducing the concept of organizational discretion and highlighting the trade-offs caused by boards' strategic control over managerial decisions, we advance a contingency perspective to enhance the understanding about the impact of board control on shareholder wealth. It also bridges the strategic management and corporate governance research on managerial discretion that has largely evolved separately in the literature. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Boards should attend to the trade-offs between the containment of managerial opportunism and the pursuit of strategic opportunities when exercising strategic control over managerial decisions. Moreover, considering the trade-offs involved, boards should carefully design and implement internal corporate governance mechanisms based on their firms' level of organizational discretion.

In this article, I investigate the effect of multiple directorships on investment efficiency. Through the study of Korean firms, this article confirms that the existence and proportion of multiple directorships were negatively related to investment efficiency. The study also found that multiple directorships were strongly related to underinvestment. Accordingly, it concludes that multiple directorships are an obstacle to directors' fulfillment as it impedes effective investment opportunities and prevents them from playing leading roles in managerial decision-making. This, in turn, affects investment efficiency negatively. (c) 2019, People and Global Business Association. All rights reserved.

Risk in financial institutions is vitally important to regulators, policy makers, investors, and the stability of the financial system, yet some critical aspects of that risk remain poorly understood. In the case of U.S. startup banks, a critical choice that can influence risk-taking behavior is which of three regulators--with varying levels of stringency--to choose. The board of directors of the new bank makes this important decision, which may result in different risk implications, depending on board's structure. Here, we examine banks' risk behavior associated with the degree of board independence and the choice of regulator. We find that the regulatory environment and board independence jointly influence new bank risk. Our evidence suggests that the intensity of regulatory scrutiny is a partial substitute for board independence in achieving an optimal level of risk. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and policy. (c) 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to examine the relationship among the board of directors' characteristics, internal control mechanisms, and corporate sustainability performance. In particular, it aims to uncover how the board specific characteristics influence internal control, which, ultimately, would enhance the sustainability performance of public listed companies. The premise of the resource dependence theory is utilised to identify the board characteristics that may influence the sustainability performance; namely, size, composition, leadership, ownership, diversity, and expertise. Inspired by the institutional theory, the mediating role of internal control mechanisms, proxied by enterprise risk management (ERM) and management control systems (MCS) is also examined in this relationship. The majority of the previous studies concentrated on a few particular dimensions of sustainability like environmental and social aspects, whereas the governance and economic aspects remain unexplored in the literature. This paper fills this important research gap through holistically conceptualising sustainability performance. (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Structural sources of power have shifted dramatically in corporate America. Recently, the fracturing of the corporate interlock network threatens corporate managers' capacity to act as a unified group in support of their shared interests, potentially destroying managerialism and elevating shareholder power. Paradoxically, however, the fracturing of the corporate elite has not led to a widespread retreat of managerialism. Corporate managers have replaced their collective structural resources, embedded in their board interlock network, with organizational structural resources located within their firms. By adopting lone-insider board structures where the CEO is the only employee on the board of directors, CEOs establish brokerage positions within their focal firms, allowing them to preserve their autonomy even as the broader network withers. Firms nested in cohesive communities were the first to adopt lone-insider boards, supplementing and eventually replacing closure with brokerage as a structural resource. These alternative structural resources operated to preserve managerialism during different times. Network closure traditionally helped to preserve managerialism against shareholder pressure, but this effect disappeared as the network fragmented in the mid-2000s. In its absence, managers increasingly relied on organizational brokerage positions to maintain their autonomy. Consequently, managerialism remains surprisingly robust in the era of a fractured corporate board interlock network because top managers have become more focused on establishing positions of power within their own firms.

The central hypothesis of the managerial power approach (MPA) states that power is the main driver of executive compensation. The positive impact of power on compensation is allegedly demonstrated by a large number of empirical studies. We argue that the hypothesis of a positive impact of power on pay is not falsifiable empirically. The MPA is thus not testable. Empirical studies in this vein can only be interpreted as validation procedures for the empirical power measures employed. We suggest a new theoretical framework for research on the power-compensation relationship. This framework can be used to identify valid power measures empirically. The arguments presented in our paper allow for a reassessment of the role of power in the corporate governance debate. (c) 2018, The Author(s).

Extending the proposition that boards of directors influence firms' mergers and acquisitions (M&As), studies have investigated how board interlocks - network ties formed by directors -- may shape M&A processes and outcomes. While board interlocks and M&As are two streams of research, each underpinned by voluminous studies, their cross-fertilization has been relatively limited. In this chapter, the authors take stock of prior research investigating the relationship between board interlocks and M&As. Specifically, emphasizing the network features of board interlocks, the authors highlight a connection aspect and a structure aspect of board interlocks in appreciating their effects during pre-acquisition and post-acquisition phases. Based on this framework, the authors then lay out a research agenda that can further bridge board interlocks with M&As. Overall, this chapter endeavors to integrate and expand our knowledge on the acquisition implications of board interlocks. (c) 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Building on research within corporate governance and strategic management, this paper explores how managerial discretion stemming from managerial task environment influences the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision-making. Two sets of alternative hypotheses about the moderating effects of managerial discretion on the performance effects of board monitoring and CEO human capital were formulated. The results indicate partial support for governance-driven explanation showing that the association between board monitoring and market-based performance is strongest in environments characterized by high levels of managerial discretion. The findings also show that CEO human capital is positively associated with market-based performance in low-discretion environments, while in high-discretion environments this relationship turns negative. The central contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that managerial discretion is a useful tool to explain the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision making.

Corporate governance of entrepreneurial firms comprises mechanisms through which directors, shareholders, entrepreneurs, and top management teams are involved with start-ups. On the basis of a literature review, we identify three interrelated themes frequently discussed by previous empirical studies: (1) the role of key stakeholders (e.g. directors, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs), (2) governance process (e.g. social networking and strategic decision making), and (3) outcomes of corporate governance (innovation, growth, and internationalization). We augment previous studies' investigations of various stakeholders' roles in corporate governance, by examining the relationships and interactions among various stakeholders or groups of stakeholders, especially between boards and top management teams. We conclude by proposing how future research can explore the effect of interactions between board of directors and top management teams on organizational outcomes. (c) David B. Audretsch, Erik E.

Overwhelming evidence from prior research suggests a positive association between corporate board characteristics and carbon performance; however, very little is known about the mechanisms linking the two variables. This study attempts to fill this gap by developing and empirically testing a conceptual model that highlights the role of carbon strategy in the relationship between board environmental orientation (BEO) and carbon performance. We argue that BEO can directly and indirectly influence carbon performance through carbon strategy. Using structural equation modelling to analyse data consisting of 2,301 U.S. firm-year observations over the 2005-2015 period, we find that the greater the BEO is, the better its carbon performance (i.e., lower greenhouse gas emissions). The results also provide evidence of the mediating effect of carbon strategy on the relationship between BEO and carbon performance. Splitting the sample into high and low carbon-intensive industries shows a partial mediation effect in high carbon-intensive industries and a full mediation effect in low carbon-intensive industries. The findings of the study and its implications for scholars, policymakers, managers, investors, and environmentalists are discussed. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

We investigate the effect of politically connected boards (both supervisory boards [SBs] and boards of directors [BODs]) on cost of debt and equity capital of listed companies in Indonesia which has established a two-tier corporate governance system. The results, based on 250 firms, suggest that companies with politically connected SBs experience lower cost of debt and equity capital, whereas politically connected BODs have no association with cost of either debt or equity. Furthermore, we find that family firms and firms belonging to business groups with politically connected SBs enjoy lower cost of debt and equity capital. Our main results are robust to alternative measures and to tests for endogeneity. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate governance of Oman's financial sector companies. Intellectual capital has been found to successfully contribute to the economic wealth creation of firms in germane literature. Unfortunately, financial statements do not necessarily capture and reflect the contributions of intellectual capital, thereby leading to an information asymmetry between companies and users of financial statements. The research also investigates the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital efficiency across various financial subsectors. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports available on Muscat Securities Market for 31 listed financial sector companies for the period 2012 to 2016 and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Intellectual capital is measured using Pulic's efficiency measure of value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). Corporate governance individual components such as board characteristics, audit committee characteristics and ownership structure are presented as independent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that board size and frequency of audit committee meetings have a significant association with the intellectual capital efficiency of Oman's financial sector. VAIC and human capital efficiency of banks are also significantly influenced by most of the corporate governance mechanisms; however, other subsectors do not report such findings. Corporate governance of banks in comparison to other subsectors effectively engages in utilizing the potential of intellectual capital efficiency. Agency theory and resource dependency theory find limited support as a result of this study. The GMM results are not robust to the alternative instruments. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small as the study is limited to the listed financial sector of Oman. Future studies can be extended to include all of Oman's or GCC's listed companies. Additionally, the intellectual capital is measured using the construct of VAIC which suffers some limitations and can be overcome using other tools such as content analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that Oman's regulators can create an awareness strategy on highlighting the importance of intellectual capital for companies (board of directors and managers), investors, debtors and creditors. Further, Oman's Capital Market Authority and Muscat Securities Market need to strengthen the regulations related to intellectual capital. Originality/value: This study extends intellectual capital and corporate governance literature by presenting the research outcome for Oman's financial sector. It is useful for Oman's financial sector companies to direct corporate governance measures for driving value creation of firms through the management of intellectual capital efficiency.

Research Question/Issue: We review the literature on the relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the theoretical lenses that researchers apply when studying strategic leadership and innovation, most notably agency theory and upper echelons theory. We review the innovation constructs and measures that scholars employ, and we survey the links among strategic leaders' characteristics and technological innovation. Ultimately, we organize the literature into an integrative framework that provides a concise overview of the extant knowledge, and we outline an agenda for future research. Theoretical/Academic Implications: First, we offer scholars a discipline-spanning overview of the extant knowledge on the topic. Second, by integrating important aspects of corporate governance, such as the role of the board of directors, incentives for the chief executive officer or the top management team, and firm ownership, into the context of technological innovation, we highlight the vital role it plays in the realm of technological innovation. Third, we provide a useful guide for scholars and direct their work towards fruitful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer insights for practitioners interested in better understanding the bidirectional relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. In particular, our framework and our detailed analysis of the impact of strategic leaders on technological innovation can guide shareholders and board members in matters related to board composition as well as top executive selection and compensation.

Purpose: This study aims to draw on the resource dependence theory to synthesize the conflicting arguments as well as commonalities of the agency and stewardship perspectives on the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 212 large-scale publicly listed companies representing 20 sectors in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings: The research results based on all of 212 publicly listed companies in Sri Lanka show, in support of the agency theory, that CEO duality exerts a negative effect on firm performance when the CEO is equipped with additional informal power. Conversely, CEO duality exhibits a positive effect on firm performance when board involvements are high, a finding that supports the commonalities of the agency and stewardship theoretical perspectives. Practical implications: By examining the governance practices and concepts in an Asian developing economy, this study provides insight into the power dynamics between the CEO and the board of directors in managerial contexts that are largely different from those in western countries. Originality/value: This study expands the theoretical underpinning of corporate governance research by identifying the performance implications of CEO duality within the broad context of the resource provision of the board of directors and the informal power of CEOs.

To better understand how executives impact resource allocation, we investigate the three underpinnings of dynamic managerial capabilities (DMCs) as antecedents of related business diversification (RBD) and how they interact with firm resources to influence RBD. Taking football as the research subject, we analyze the joint impact of managerial human capital, managerial social capital, and managerial cognition within the board of directors of English Premier League clubs. We rely on a unique 15-year panel dataset and show that more specific managerial human capital and a long-term orientation among the board of directors increase RBD while additional general managerial human capital and managerial social capital diminish RBD. In addition, our findings reveal that DMCs moderate the relationships of physical and financial resources with RBD in different directions. Our study is amongst the first to analyze all three underpinnings of DMCs and to endorse the practical relevance of DMCs for RBD. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the relationship between corporate governance mechanism and firm performance among Shariah-compliant firms using an integrated theoretical framework. This study is carried out on the top 200 Shariah-compliant firms listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2017. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the researchers employ generalized least squares and random effect with robust and clustering standard error models to estimate the impact of ownership structure, board independence, board competence, firms' characteristics, and debt structure on firm performance as measured by the firm's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The findings show that ownership concentration has a statistically positive effect on firm performance. Having an external Chair and independent board members with an educational level beyond a bachelor's degree also have a positive effect on firm performance while CEO duality has a statistically negative impact instead. Insider representation has a positive impact on firm performance but when these inside board members are also the owners, the impact turns negative. Furthermore, the statistical significance of holding a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and other type of qualifications imply the need for board members to have greater knowledge in order to positively influence ROA and ROE. This is the first study to examine the influence of corporate governance mechanism on firm performance using a multi-theoretical approach in the context of Shariah-compliant firms. The interaction terms of elements in agency theory, stakeholder/resource-based theory, and stewardship theory are used as pre-conditions to the direct effect of these regressors on firm performance.

Research Summary: Boards of directors make high-stake decisions that involve hiring, compensating, and dismissing CEOs. Building on theory about choice-supportive bias and escalation of commitment, we theorize that "hiring directors" (directors who were present during a CEO's hiring) will display choice-supportive bias and escalate commitment to poorly performing CEOs. Primary data from 73 directors indicate that directors are indeed biased toward CEOs they help hire. Archival data from S&P 1500 firms reveal that, following poor performance, the number of hiring directors is positively related to the increase in CEO pay and lower likelihood of CEO dismissal. Building on theory about board experience, we also predict and find that more experienced boards reduce the tendency to escalate. Thus, bias among hiring directors can be mitigated via experience. Managerial Summary: Making a choice such as casting a vote or selecting a restaurant leads people to view their selection favorably even if evidence emerges suggesting it was a bad choice. We examine whether corporate directors fall prey to this choice-supportive bias when involved in CEO hiring. We found that directors who are part of the hiring process tend to have an overly rosy view of the person selected. Moreover, if the firm is performing poorly, a board with more directors who helped hire the current CEO will tend to increase the CEO's pay more and are less likely to fire the CEO than a board with fewer such directors. This problem is reduced if the board has highly experienced directors among its ranks. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

During recent years, there has been a growing interest in CEO narcissism across disciplines. Various scholars document that CEO narcissism is an important factor that should not be overlooked when analyzing various organizational outcomes and strategies. Research on CEO narcissism has focused on its negative implications on organization outcomes. However, little attention has been paid to its effect on corporate social responsibility (CSR). This study explores the relationship between CEO narcissism and two distinct facets of CSR (stakeholder management and social issue participation), while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. Using a sample of publicly traded U.S restaurants, the results document that an outside board of directors plays a moderating role on the relationship between CEO narcissism and the two distinct facets of CSR.

Corporate governance research suggests that boards of directors play key roles in governing company strategy. Although qualitative research has examined board-management relationships to describe board involvement in strategy, we lack detailed insights into how directors engage with organizational members for governing a complex and long-term issue such as product innovation. Our multiple-case study of four listed pharmaceutical firms reveals a sequential process of board involvement: Directors with deep expertise govern scientific innovation, followed by the full board's involvement in its strategic aspects. The nature of director involvement varies across board levels in terms of the direction (proactive or reactive), timing (regular or spontaneous), and the extent of formality of exchanges between directors and organizational members. Our study contributes to corporate governance research by introducing the concept of board behavioral diversity and by theorizing about the multilevel, structural, and temporal dimensions of board behavior and its relational characteristics.

Purpose: Despite agreement on the importance of adopting governance structures for developing competitive advantage, we still know little about why or how governance mechanisms are adopted in the first place. We also acknowledge that family businesses with formal governance mechanisms in place still resort to informal means to make decisions, and we lack knowledge about why certain governance mechanisms are sometimes, but not always, effective and functional. Given these research gaps, and drawing on institutional theory, we aim to explore: How are governance structures adopted and developed in family firms? Once adopted, how do family businesses perceive these governance structures? Design/methodology/approach: Using Mokken Scale Analysis, a method suitable to uncover patterns/sequences of adoption/acquisition over time, we analyze a dataset of 1,488 Spanish family firms to explore if there is a specific pattern in the implementation of governance structures. We complement the analysis with descriptive data about perceived usefulness of such structures. Findings: Our findings highlight two important issues. Family businesses follow a specific process implementing first business governance (board of directors, then executive committee), followed by family governance (family council then family constitution). We suggest they do so in response to institutional pressures, given the exposure they have to business practices, and their need to appear legitimate. Despite formal adoption of governance structures, family businesses do not necessarily consider them useful. We suggest that their perception about the usefulness of the implemented governance structures may lead to their ceremonial adoption, resulting in a gap between the implementation and functionality of such structures. Research limitations/implications: Our article contributes to the family business literature by bringing novel insights about implementation of governance structures. We take a step back to explain why these governance mechanisms were adopted in the first place. Using institutional theory we enrich governance and family business literatures, by offering a lens that explains why family businesses follow a specific process in adopting governance structures. We also offer a plausible explanation as to why governance structures are ineffective in achieving their theorized role in the context of family businesses, based on the family's perception of the unusefulness of such structures, and the concept of ceremonial adoption. Practical implications: There is no single recipe that can serve the multiple needs of different family businesses. This indicates that family businesses may need diverse levels of development and order when setting up their governance structures. Accordingly, this study constitutes an important point of demarcation for practitioners interested in examining the effectiveness of governance structures in family firms. We show that an important pre-requisite for examining the effectiveness of governance structures is to start by investigating whether these structures are actually being used or are only adopted ceremonially. Originality/value: Our paper expands current knowledge on governance in family firms by taking a step back hinting at why are governance structures adopted in the first place. Focusing on how governance is implemented in terms of sequence is novel and relevant for researcher and practitioners to understand how this process unfolds. Our study uses institutional theory, which is a strong theory to support the results. Our paper also uses a novel method to study governance structures in family firms.

The purpose of this study is to understand the dynamic relationships between managerial human capital, dynamic managerial capabilities and strategic change within boards of directors. Building on the dynamic managerial capabilities perspective and upper echelons theory, we theorize and investigate the impact of managerial human capital on strategic change as well as the mediating role of boards' sensing, seizing and reconfiguring abilities, defined as dynamic managerial capabilities. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 606 Norwegian firms. The main findings suggest that while managerial human capital positively impacts strategic change, boards' sensing and seizing abilities (not reconfiguring) positively mediate the relationship between human capital and strategic change. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This study explores how board leadership may influence the board dynamic managerial capabilities. We draw on the dynamic capabilities perspective to examine the effect of board chairs on the dynamic managerial capabilities of the board of directors. Using survey data from a sample of 410 Norwegian firms, our results reveal that board chair human capital is positively related to the board's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities. Moreover, we find the positive effects of board chair human capital on board sensing and seizing capabilities to be stronger under higher environmental dynamism. Our study suggests that board chairs can play an important leadership role in developing dynamic managerial capabilities at the board level, particularly in more dynamic environments.

Evidence suggests that focusing on the needs of the marketplace to create customer value and firm advantage, an outside-in (OI) approach to strategy, yields superior firm performance. However, despite the acknowledged advantage of an OI approach to strategy, it has not yet achieved widespread adoption by industry practitioners. Absent formal insight regarding how a firm-wide OI approach to strategy emerges, we introduce the premise that a firm-wide practice requires influence from those at the top of firm hierarchy, i.e., its Board of Directors. We posit that if the OI construct is both: (1) strategic rather than tactical in nature, and (2) enterprise-wide rather than function specific (e.g., marketing), then firm-wide adoption requires BOD acceptance, if not advocacy and leadership. We present 10 research propositions that describe how the board influences a firm-wide OI approach to strategy and provide specific implications for scholars from marketing and corporate governance as well as boards and chief marketing officers.

Managerial oversight is strengthened and firms' strategic performance improved when boards are gender-diverse. Yet the rate of women's appointment to corporate boards is decelerating. This study proposes an explanation for the unexpected attenuation rooted in social movement dynamics, particularly cross-movement influences originating from the contemporary governance reform movement. Seeking to alleviate managerialist tendencies, the governance reform movement has compelled major changes to board structure, composition, and activity, as well as the broader logic surrounding corporate boards. By definition, social movements' cognitive and structural advances manifest "spillover" effects - unintentional impacts affecting the opportunity structure, and ultimately progress, of neighboring campaigns. Drawing on social movement theory, a conceptual model is outlined explicating the mechanisms by which governance reform's broad enactments have incidentally impeded board gender diversity's advance. Theoretically-grounded strategies for reversing those effects are also outlined and the study closes with a discussion of implications for research, practice, and policy. (c) 2020

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess whether the gender composition of the board of directors affects the sensitivity to gender issues in defining university strategies and therefore strategic plans. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an ordinary least square regression to test the relationship between gender sensitivity approach and board composition in Italian state universities (ISUs). The authors measured the gender sensitivity approach of each university by an index (gender sensitivity approach index) determined based on content analysis. Gender board composition is, instead, analyzed by heterogeneity (homogeneity) index (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) of the board. Findings: The finding suggests that, if the board has a certain level of heterogeneity, then university strategic plan (USP) is a more gender-sensitive approach. Research limitations/implications: The study analyses only the 2018 USPs of ISUs and considers the presence of women within the board, and not their actual role and their position in the university hierarchy. Practical implications: The practical implication of this study is that if universities want to guarantee gender equality, they should open their boards more widely to women. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that analyzes the relationships between board composition and sensitivity to gender issues within the USPs. The paper therefore contributes to the literature on governance in the public sector, particularly in universities. Moreover, it stimulates the accounting debate on gender issue and highlights that gender issues cannot be taken up by decision-making bodies that are not heterogeneous enough.

Research Summary: Board scholarship has generally taken the perspective that when it comes to board expertise, more is better. This study, in contrast, explores contingencies that may stretch board experience beyond the limits of its usefulness. We integrate insights from extant research in board leadership and international strategy to identify and test internal and external contextual factors that can limit the effectiveness of boards' international experience. Exploring this in the context of cross-border M&As, we find evidence that the positive effects of boards' international experience are attenuated when the CEO lacks such knowledge, and when the institutional distance between the home and target countries is high. Overall, our findings suggest the need to exercise caution in viewing board expertise as a "panacea" of board effectiveness. Managerial Summary: Boards are generally viewed as experts that CEOs can look to for advice when formulating corporate strategy. Accordingly, the predominant view has been that the more relevant expertise on the board, the better the strategic advice they can offer. The results of our study, however, suggest that is not always the case. As it pertains to cross-border M&As, in order to get the maximum benefit from boards' international experience, CEOs must have enough international experience of their own, and the institutional environment of the target firm's country must not be too dissimilar from the acquiring firm's home country. Otherwise, it is possible that the boards' international experience will be stretched beyond its strategic usefulness. (c) 2020 Strategic Management Society

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to show that social relations in a corporate governance platform between members of supervisory boards and between members of supervisory and executive board tiers can serve as an alternative viewpoint for understanding mechanisms of social selection in corporate governance networks. The study shows that through the lenses of social network analysis, it is possible to identify and understand how the process of corporate governance member selection unfolds within companies and how that selection process may have been potentially influenced by the cross-board relations, such as interlocking directorships. Design/methodology/approach: To estimate network parameters and attribute effects of network tie emergence, this study has used exponential random graph models (ERGMs) on corporate governance data of Danish publicly listed companies. Econometric models are applied to estimate parameter statistics which serve further to explain tendencies of tie emergence. Findings: The results of this study reveal that the process of selection of both supervisory boards and executive directors is interdependent. Also, the study showed that board members are more likely to select popular supervisory board members and top managers who have their expertise gained through multiple companies affiliated with multiple industries. However, these conditions for CEO selection apply only to the extent to which they have their experience gained from multiple companies but not multiple industries. Originality/value: On one hand, this study demonstrates that being a dynamic practitioner who is exposed to diverse corporate environments by being affiliated with different companies belonging to different industries generally increases practitioners visibility in the corporate governance network, and therefore their attractiveness to boards of directors. On the other hand, the results show that the research on board assemblage, nowadays, should be rather observed through the methodology of social network analysis as the method gives an opportunity to understand structures through relations, from which the executive tier should not be exempted as well.

This article reviews the existing academic research on the determinants and consequences of board tenure. Primarily, this article focuses specifically on international empirical studies. We find that different corporate governance characteristics determine board tenure. In addition, our review summarizes the influence of board tenure on corporate outcomes, such as accounting performance, financial reporting quality, and business strategy. This review contributes to an understanding of the implications, benefits, and limitations of board tenure. In the absence of any specific guidelines on current corporate governance best practice codes in different jurisdictions, this article would benefit regulators and professionals wishing to understand the importance and consequences of board tenure. We also suggest future research needed to fill the gaps in the existing board tenure literature. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

This paper explores the development and articulation of the agency and stakeholder theories of the firm and their corresponding logics of shareholder wealth maximisation and stakeholder interest optimisation. We note how these two perspectives have been viewed as diametrically opposite normative, instrumental and descriptive theories, despite efforts by some authors to find common ground. Each has served as a basis for firm governance. We explore the relationship of the agency and stakeholder theories to the conceptualisations of the roles of boards of directors, and how both theories hold value in understanding two board functions/roles: control/monitoring roles and service roles (which covers both resources and strategy).

Governance and leadership failings have been a common feature of Scottish football (McLeod, 2016). In response, many Scottish football clubs have adopted the approach of an 'ethical strategist' - meaning stakeholder engagement has become central to their strategies (Noland and Phillips, 2010). Such strategies are argued to necessitate sustainability (Mason and Simmons, 2012), but little is known about how they can be implemented effectively. The purpose of this paper is to address that gap and examine how social capital influences the effectiveness of stakeholder engagement-focused strategies in Scottish football. Using a multiple-case study approach, we make two contributions to the literature. First, we add to existing knowledge of how ethical strategists can utilise social capital to achieve strategic success. Second, we make a theoretical contribution to Nahapiet and Ghoshal's (1998) three-dimensional model of social capital by showing how contextual factors influence the interaction process between dimensions.

While boards of directors play a critical role in the formulation of strategic actions of family firms, up-to-date research examining the antecedents of boards' influence on strategic decisions remains limited. This study examines whether and how boards' task conflict impacts boards' control and advisory tasks, as well as to what extent these relationships vary with different degrees of boards' openness. Our main hypotheses are tested on a sample of 94 family firms from Norway. Our main findings confirm the complex and context-sensitive nature of conflicts in the context of family firms' boards of directors. In particular, we advance the debate by suggesting that task conflict benefits both boards' control and advisory tasks only when boards function in an atmosphere of openness. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

The governance of non-profit organisations is complex, as these organisations are not only intended to create value for third parties but also dependent on their donors. When the donor is a for-profit firm, it may be challenging to align and balance the firm's for-profit interests and the non-profit organisation's social aims. The board of directors has the main responsibility for supporting and monitoring managers' decisions so that all perspectives are considered, but doing so requires appropriate information about stakeholders' expectations. Adopting the agency theory perspective, this study focuses on corporate governance in corporate foundations (CFs), a type of non-profit organisation with a private firm as its founder and main donor. We hypothesise that bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between CFs and their founder firms, which are the main donors and consequently the main stakeholders, can increase the involvement of the board of directors, thereby leading to higher organisational effectiveness. We argue that the implementation of bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm can strengthen corporate governance and provide the board of directors with the information needed to be more involved; such implementation fosters organisational effectiveness because it aligns the profit-oriented objectives of the founder firm and the social-oriented objectives of the CF. By analysing data from interviews of 188 CFs from six European countries, we aim to contribute to the debate on the role of corporate governance in non-profit organisations under the agency theory perspective. We provide evidence that the implementation of coordination and bureaucratic control mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm gives the board more information and leads to higher board involvement, thereby minimising agency issues and fostering organisational effectiveness.

Despite the association between the board of directors and firm performance having been examined extensively in the literature, empirical evidence on whether and how boards contribute to firms' long-term success is scarce. Using 14-year panel data of all Australian listed firms, this study examines the effects of board potential and board dynamics, the key factors of board effectiveness, on firms' investment efficiency. We find strong evidence that both board potential and board dynamics are positively associated with firm investment efficiency. The findings support the view that both firms' resources and internal processes that enable boards to mobilize those resources to resolve complex tasks are critical for a firm's long-term success.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether foreign directors' influence on opportunistic behavior among managers varies between Islamic banks (IBs) and conventional banks (CBs). It also examines how religious ethics and morals guide foreign directors to be better monitors. Design/methodology/approach: A panel fixed effects regression is used to analyze the effect of foreign directors on opportunistic behavior among managers in IBs and CBs. The authors use different proxies such as loss avoidance, discretionary loan loss provision and expense preference behavior to measure management opportunistic behavior. Findings: Based on sample of 3,758 bank-year observations for 164 banks over the period 1993-2015, the authors show that the presence of foreign directors in IBs increases boards' effectiveness in impeding management opportunistic behavior, whereas the presence of foreign directors in CBs reduces boards' effectiveness in curbing management's unethical acts. The authors also document that IBs (CBs) with foreign directors demonstrate less (more) earnings management and expense-preference behavior among managers. In addition, the authors' evidence indicates that the existence of the Shari'ah supervisory boards helps foreign directors be more effective monitors. Research limitations/implications: The current study focuses on banks only which makes its results subject to sample bias; there are many other forms of financial institutions (e.g. investments, real-estates and mutual funds) complying to the Shari'ah law. Second, owing to the lack of foreign board directors characteristics, the authors cannot investigate the intensity of the specific characteristics that could have specific directions in affecting managerial behavior. Practical implications: The findings in this paper may help standards-setters, auditors, investors and regulators take appropriate measures and create better policies that reduce managers' discretion. This could in turn improve information transparency decision-making, monitoring, advising and accounting quality. Originality/value: The authors' theoretical framework combines the agency, contingency, resource-dependence, stewardship and stakeholders' theories and applies them to Shari'ah as an alternative ethical and internal governance mechanism. The authors find that the impact of foreign directors on management opportunistic behavior depends on the corporate religious norms within boards of directors, in particular, suggesting that religious values affect how foreign directors influence bank managers' behavior.

Purpose: This paper attempts to examine the activity and involvement of board of directors in internationalization activities of firms in emerging markets, by evaluating the resource provisioning roles of interlocks provided by board of directors, and the frequency of board meetings. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of board involvement is contingent upon the levels of family ownership in firms since family ownership could impact the firm's ability to utilize the presence of different types of board members. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test our hypotheses on a sample of listed Indian companies, extracted from the Prowess database published by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a database of the financial performance of Indian companies. On a panel of 3,133 firm years of 605 unique Indian firms with foreign investments, over a time period of 2006-2017, the authors apply different estimation techniques. Findings: The results demonstrate that both board meeting frequency and director interlocks are instrumental in supporting internationalization activities in emerging market firms. However, family ownership moderates the role of insider and independent interlocks on internationalization investments in different ways; the authors find that interlocks provided by independent directors support internationalization activities in family firms, whereas those provided by insider directors do not. Further, the study also finds that board meetings are less effective in internationalization of family firms. Practical implications: The authors conclude that family firms aiming at international diversification require to develop more connected and networked independent directors to enable internationalization in firms. While independent director interlocks enhance the international investments, it is also useful to know that board meetings are ineffective in utilizing the resources in family firms. This points to the possibility that family firms should device mechanisms to integrate family meetings with board meetings so that they can utilize the within-family processes to aid in their internationalization decisions. Originality/value: The study contributes to resource dependence theory by understanding its limiting role in family firms. Theoretically, it helps delineate the limiting resource provision role of the insider directors vis-a-vis independent directors. The authors argue that the resource provision role of insider director interlocks does not effectively help in internationalization in comparison to independent director interlocks in family-dominated firms. Consequently, the study shows the limiting role of resource provision and utilization by family-owned firms in comparison to non-family-owned firms. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Based on the resource dependency theory, this article investigates the relationships among board gender diversity, innovation, and firm performance. Specifically, this article examines the mediating role of innovation, which may explain how board gender diversity is related to firm performance. Using a sample of 120 SBF companies from 2009 to 2012, the results indicate a negative effect of board gender diversity on innovation. In addition, we do not find evidence of a mediating role of innovation within the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

From a corporate governance point of view, this paper addresses the question of how corporate ownership and board characteristics influence firm value for a sample of Ibero-American companies. Specifically, we analyse indexed non-financial companies from Chile and Spain for the period 2007-2016, using the GMM panel data technique. Our research is novel in considering a two-country approach, with one emerging and one developed country, and in analysing how corporate ownership and board characteristics, in addition to contextual variables, determine firm value. Our results assess the efficiency of corporate governance mechanisms. Although findings are intriguing regarding ownership concentration, they confirm the benefits of a good board of directors. This type of board is characterised by a large size, sufficiently independent directors, and a balance in terms of gender diversity. We provide several policy recommendations from our main findings.

Establishing a corporate governance strategy that promotes the efficient use of organisational resources is instrumental in the economic growth of a country, as well as the successful management of firms. This book reviews existing literature and identifies board structural features as key variables of an effective corporate governance system, establishing a multi-theoretical model that links Board structural characteristics with firm performance. It then, using a comprehensive empirical study of 265 companies listed on the Karachi Stock exchange, tests this conceptual model. This research serves as a significant milestone, reflecting the socio-economic setting of emerging economies, and highlighting the need for the corporate sector in emerging markets to move away from a 'tick-box' culture. It argues that the sector needs to implement corporate governance as a tool to mitigate business risks; appoint and empower non-executive directors to achieve an effective monitoring of management; and establish their own ethical and governance principles, applicable to the Board of Directors. Based on an extensive data base, collected painstakingly over five years, this book offers new insights and conceptual framework for further research in this area. Given the breadth and width of the research, it is a useful source of future reference for students, researchers and policy makers.

This book takes the central issues facing board members today and applies the giving voice to values framework while also providing insights from practicing board members who have faced these issues. It covers such topics as strategic planning and monitoring, director independence, privacy and cyber risk, executive compensation and CEO succession planning. With this book, readers will also grapple with the conflicts of interest that might arise in the director selection process, role of the nominating committee and the compensation committee in order to cultivate more optimal board dynamics. The principles of giving voice to values start by asking a deceptively simple question: 'What if you were going to act on your values-what would you say and do?' The book then provides an overview of the current landscape of corporate governance along with the major rules and director duties applicable to the board of directors. The book's latter chapters contain a series of five scenarios common to the board of directors that are presented as a set of "Board Challenges" involving the tensions often found in board work. In Giving Voice to Values in the Boardroom, the author, Cynthia E. Clark, provides practical strategies for board members and other constituents of corporate governance to deal with these challenges. These cases are designed to help users of the book implement prescripting and action planning. Each case will also have discussion questions about the stakes and stakeholders, common reasons and rationalizations and examples of how firms and governance professionals have handled similar board challenges.

This research explores the interfirm interlock networks that currently exist among publicly traded media conglomerates operating in the United States of America. Directorship information was gathered from annual reports and definitive proxy reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for 68 media conglomerates across seven media sectors for year ending 2018. This investigation applies social resource theory to assess the social networks formed by interfirm interlocks among media conglomerates and how such network structures address environmental uncertainty. Results indicate that not all alliances are mutually beneficial and those that are more resource-dependent endure negative cooptation effects. Moreover, today's financial interlocks look very different than they did at the turn of the century. This research discusses how these changes in interfirm interlocks have resulted in directorship wars. Practical implications are discussed.

This study examines the relationship between board attributes and firm performance. In accordance with agency theory, effective board of directors plays a key role in establishing good corporate governance and enhancing firm performance by mitigating earnings management. Based on panel data set drawn from Tunisian listed firms over the period 2011 - 2017 and while using dynamic panel GMM estimator to alleviate endogeneity problems, a U-shaped relationship was found between board size, board independence and firm performance. Indeed, results show that a higher firm performance is confirmed if the board size is composed of at least 6 members and 15% of independent board members. For a robustness check, this study measures a composite score of the effectiveness of board of directors to capture the aggregate impact of board's effectiveness on firm performance. The findings of regression analysis find a significant positive relationship between the board effectiveness score and firm performance. Indeed, there is a synergy between mechanisms that act together to enhance firm performance in the Tunisian context. Copyright (c) 2020. Mejda DAKHLAOUI And Imen FREDJ.

Corporate governance has long been the subject of interest for researchers in business administration. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices decided by boards of directors are now a key issue in the decision-making process of companies. The relationship between the governance structure and CSR policies is crucial to defining the companies' strategic view. In this paper, we identify how the characteristics of corporate governance impact CSR disclosure. Our findings show that a large board of directors reduces the probability of adhering to practices that involve stakeholders more closely in company activity, while companies with more independent directors have a higher level of stakeholder protection almost by definition. Thus, there is a need for additional ways of involving stakeholders in company activity. Our results also reveal that an overlap between the roles of the CEO and the board chairman is an undesirable influence on a CSR report. (c) 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Growing evidence suggests that gender diversity on boards of directors is important for corporate governance and overall organizational effectiveness. Yet, progress in increasing female board representation has been slow. Prior studies have focused primarily on either the role of organizational characteristics in board gender composition or the role of national institutions as predictors of female board representation across countries. In this study, we integrate psychological theory related to implicit biases and agency theory, with institutional theory, to propose that the national context for gender equality moderates the extent to which characteristics of organizational leadership relate to female board representation. We conduct a meta-analysis of 158 samples encompassing 60,648 organizations across 36 countries to test our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the importance of the national context for gender equality as a boundary condition for understanding the relationship between organizational leadership characteristics and female board representation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for increasing the representation of female directors across countries. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to understand the circumstances under which board behavior is affected by gender diversity. The "reasoned action approach" is used as a lens through which to assess the extent that the behavior of the board varies with its gender diversity. Research Findings/Insights: The study uses archival data from a panel sample of 80,395 directorships observed between 1998 and 2012. Boardroom gender diversity is significantly related to director personal responsibility (board attendance), CEO accountability, and risk taking. Our findings highlight the key importance of the exposure of male directors to women directors on boards beyond the focal board. This suggests a positive externality or a spillover effect. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The empirical findings of this study highlight the importance of allowing for the operation of social norms when studying boardroom decision making. Experience gained by male directors of working with women directors on other boards, beyond the focal board, is shown to enable women directors to contribute more effectively. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers encouragement to policy makers' intent on increasing the presence of women on corporate boards. These results point to a spillover effect: there is an observed impact of women on boards that acts not only directly on the board on which they sit but also through the network of boards on which their male counterparts sit.

Does the appointment of more women and ethnic minority directors on corporate boards help combat discriminatory work environments? This empirical study addresses this question by exploring the occurrence of large-scale discrimination lawsuits. Drawing from social identity theory and empathy-based perspectives, we propose that a greater presence of female and minority directors on boards reduces the likelihood of large-scale discrimination lawsuits given their propensity to advocate for underrepresented groups in the workplace. Our analysis of data from 452 US firms from 2010-2015 indicates that a higher proportion of female and minority directors on boards is associated with a lower likelihood of such lawsuits. Specifically, the likelihood of such lawsuits is lower where there are three or more (a critical mass) female and minority directors. "Token" appointments (one or two female or minority directors) do not reduce the occurrence of these lawsuits. Further, the joint presence of minority and female directors on boards significantly reduces the likelihood of such lawsuits. Finally, we found that female CEOs help in reducing the occurrence of such lawsuits when the board has two or more female directors. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of greater gender and ethnic diversity on boards in combating workplace discrimination. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

We theorize that female candidates considering CEO roles will perceive greater termination vulnerability in such roles than their male counterparts. We further theorize that indicators of recent organizational distress will exacerbate female CEO candidates' perceptions of termination vulnerability, while the presence of female leaders will mitigate these concerns. To test our arguments, we examine the initial values of newly appointed female and male CEOs' severance agreements from 2007 to 2014. Results support our arguments and begin to shed light on the factors that influence female executives' concerns about CEO roles and ultimately firms' ability to appoint female CEOs.

Research and development (R&D) is a key contributor to organizations' pursuit of innovation. In turn, CEOs can influence important decisions related to changes in R&D spending--the kind of spending with the potential to lead to innovation. We seek to understand the motivation and conditions under which CEOs may influence R&D spending changes. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, this study investigates how CEO motivation affects changes in firm R&D spending. We explore the effect of CEO promotion and prevention foci on yearly R&D increase. We use a panel dataset of 688 S&P 1500 firms to test our hypotheses. Our findings suggest a negative relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase, while CEO promotion focus produces no meaningful effect. We further test CEO compensation as a moderating mechanism, testing both incentive and fixed CEO compensation. We find that incentive compensation negatively moderates the relationship between CEO promotion focus and R&D increase, and positively moderates the relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase. Additionally, CEO fixed income negatively moderates the relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase. Based on these results we discuss theoretical implications of our findings, including differing effects of CEO regulatory focus on firm risk-taking behavior and how compensation packages may alter those effects. We further discuss the practical necessity for boards of directors to understand both the R&D goals of an organization and the individual motivational orientation of CEOs when crafting compensation packages.

Purpose: It has been over 20 years since the landmark publication of Mizruchi (1996) and his examination of "what do interlocks do?". Since then, the nature of interlocks and subsequent research on the subject has evolved. This paper aims to revisit the literature on interlocking directorates through a quantitative bibliometric analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This study undertakes a bibliometric analysis of literature citing the Mizruchi (1996) to examine the state of research following up on "what do interlocks do". This study examines 718 publications using keyword and co-word analysis, along with a thematic analysis to revisit the research that has followed Mizruchi's topic of what do interlocks do. Findings: This study finds that the topics of the corporate elite, capitalist economy and corporate governance have remained prominent themes in the field. Research areas that are emerging in the field of interlocking directorates include gender diversity, globalisation and advancing theoretical frameworks. Originality/value: This paper provides a quantitative bibliometric analysis to revisit the extant literature on "what do interlocks do", examining a high number of articles to identify areas which could be developed to advance research in the field.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how banks' climate strategies affect environmental performance. To extend this line of research, the carbon disclosure of worldwide banks is examined. In particular, we focus on specific governance strategies: board of director monitoring and managerial incentives. Panel data are employed on a sample taken from 330 bank-year observations in the period after the financial crisis. The results show an increase in environmental performance through the implementation of managerial incentives related to climate change, associated with the highest level of responsibility of the board of directors. Overall, the present study contributes to both the academic literature and corporate governance, highlighting the importance of banks' business strategy on climate change risks and opportunities with respect to environmental performance goals.

This study contributes simultaneously to research on women board members and competitive dynamics by investigating two unresolved research questions: What is the effect of female directors on the firm's competitive repertoire? Under what conditions is this effect more pronounced? Leveraging the "Awareness-Motivation-Capability" (AMC) framework, we predict that having women on the board of directors should impact the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of the firm's competitive moves. Relying upon a sample of U.S. pharmaceutical firms for the years 2000 to 2017, we find that adding female directors on the board positively affects the complexity and volume of a firm's competitive moves, but negatively impacts the heterogeneity of competitive actions. In addition, the presence of a female CEO moderates these effects, leading to more complex competitive actions and increased volume. Thus, our study lends a greater understanding of how female board members influence competitive dynamics and shape the strategic direction of the firm. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This paper examines the effect of Board of Directors' (BD') roles and composition on exploratory, exploitative and ambidextrous innovations. A quantitative research was operated on Tunisian listed companies. Semistructured interviews were also realised with directors of these firms to discuss the findings. Results of the multiple regression analysis conducted indicate that BD' service role positively influences exploratory, exploitative and ambidextrous innovations. These types of innovation are negatively linked to BD' control role and not significantly associated with BD' strategy role, board independence and gender diversity. This paper sheds light on an innovative and unexplored topic in the literature, as prior studies focused on the effect of BD on innovation rather than on innovation types or even on ambidextrous innovation. This study provides interesting insights for firms that seek to improve their corporate governance. It highlights the BD' key attributes that firms must focus on to innovate.

Business-as-usual is likely to drive us to an unsustainable world. To solve the problems human industrial activity has created, such as climate change, species extinction, and biodiversity loss, business leaders (CEOs, top managers, and boards of directors) must be central to the solution for corporate sustainability. In particular, "heroic" leaders are needed to transform their companies into business beyond usual. In this essay, we briefly outline what researchers already know about microfoundational or socio-cognitive and motivational underpinnings of leaders that affect corporate sustainability. However, gaps remain in our understanding of affective drivers and values of leaders. We question whether microfoundations research has the potential to understand true business transformation for positive deviance and suggest that positive organizational scholarship and research on sustainability change agents can provide insights. We next highlight how empirical and research design shortcomings might be addressed. Finally, we discuss how to identify, develop, and empower leaders with transformational potential so that we can proactively create heroic leaders rather than wait for them to magically appear.

Research Summary: Director retention is a common practice during acquisitions, whereby the acquiring firm adds at least one director from the target onto its board. Despite the regularity of the phenomenon, little is understood about the post-acquisition financial implications of director retention. In this exploratory study, we investigate the financial impact (via long-term investor value appropriation) of director retention in a sample of acquisitions among publicly traded firms. Our empirical analyses consistently illustrate negative financial ramifications of director retention for the acquiring firm across multiple analytic models, time horizons of performance, and samples. We delineate implications for research on boards of directors and acquisitions, and we offer preliminary theoretical logic and empirical analyses for future scholarship to elucidate the mechanisms driving antecedents and outcomes of director retention. Managerial Summary: Despite the prevalence of director retention--a practice where an acquirer adds at least one director from the target onto the board of the ongoing firm--research on the topic is equivocal about the financial implications of this practice. We argue this is a crucial oversight because new directors can have an incredible influence on the trajectory of the firm and its subsequent performance, a fact that is particularly true in the turbulent post-acquisition period. In our study, we empirically examine the impact of director retention on post-acquisition performance. Across multiple analyses and time intervals of performance, we consistently find that director retention is negatively associated with the performance of the acquiring firm. Accordingly, our findings suggest that acquirers should generally approach direction retention with caution. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Building on the argument that corporate boards are responsible for the creation and leveraging of a firm's intellectual capital (IC), this study empirically examines the relation between boardroom characteristics--namely board size, director independence, leadership structure and gender diversity--and IC efficiency. Additionally, we propose that the family firm (FF) status is a specific condition that moderates the effect of board features on IC efficiency. We test the above propositions using data on 113 nonfinancial firms continuously listed on the Italian stock exchange over the period 2011-2016. The empirical results indicate that (1) IC efficiency is significantly lower in FFs, which challenges previous research claiming that FFs have some performance advantages over non-FFs and (2) that board size and director independence have an opposite effect in FFs and non-FFs (positive and negative, respectively), suggesting that the role of individual board mechanisms as drivers of (or brakes on) IC efficiency is contingent on firm characteristics. This paper extends the empirical literature supporting the link between board composition and IC efficiency, which has been scant and inconclusive. Furthermore, the literature has seldom considered the firm contingencies potentially affecting this relation. Regarding practical implications, our findings indicate that there is no one best way of structuring corporate boards that can fit all firm conditions; specifically, the results call into question conventional 'best practices' of board composition that emphasise director independence, suggesting that this governance mechanism may not have a consistent effect on organisational outcomes such as IC efficiency.

Financial corruption has an extensive adverse impact on corporate stakeholders. Over the last two decades, numerous prescriptions have been offered to improve the governance of US public firms, yet financial corruption is still prevalent. Board of directors' audit committees are typically charged with the responsibility of assuring that the corporation's financial reports satisfy the criterion of accuracy. We propose that a quad-qualified audit committee director can serve as an exemplar corporate overseer of financial reporting and minimize the likelihood of corruption. We predict that by having the qualifications of independence, directorship experience and financial expertise, bandwidth, and stock ownership, the effectiveness of monitoring financial reporting by such a director will be considerably enhanced, thus complementing the benefits of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) enacted in 2002. To test our predictions, we employed a time-lagged, matched-pairs sample of 328 large US corporations (164 financially corrupt firms plus a comparison group of 164 compliant firms). Controlling for covariates, we found that the presence of a quad-qualified audit committee director reduced the likelihood of financial corruption in a public firm by 72%. Combined with the benefits from SOX, having at least one quad-qualified audit committee director decreased the probability of financial corruption by 92%. Our results also show that having just one quad-qualified audit committee director is more effective than the combination of the individual qualifications dispersed among the committee members.

In their pursuit to garner resources and support for their IPO, the issuing firms prepare well on all fronts. Corporate governance, specifically board structures, is a critical issue that affects the decision quality and also influences the investors' psyche. Building on theories of agency, resource dependency and signaling, this article attempts to study the effects of presence of foreign directors on firm-specific and board-related characteristics of IPO issuing firms. Adding to the scant literature on national diversity, this study concludes that foreign directors do signal a firm's intent of internationalization and contribute to strengthening corporate governance but national diversity does not translate into IPO returns. Exploring a sample of Indian IPOs issued from April 2001 to March 2017, this study finds that presence of foreign directors on the boards brings about differences in governance mechanisms wherein internationalized boards were found to be stronger on governance front. Larger boards, more committees, less number of related directors, better board interlocking were the benefits that manifested from presence of foreign board members. Issue size and issue price of shares at the time of IPO are found to be significantly higher for firms with foreign directors on their boards reflecting better acceptance among the investors.

Research Summary: Boards are unlikely to be effective if they do not have sufficient collective expertise to understand, monitor, and address future risks. This begs the question, does the board, in fact, have this expertise? If not, can they reconfigure their expertise to address those risks? Building on agency theory, we analyze the alignment between the board's expertise and the firm's future risks, with the expectation that board composition will change over time to reflect the firm's future risks--strategic reconfiguration. Our results show that misalignment has negative implications for firm performance, misalignment also motivates appropriate board reconfiguration, and that this reconfiguration positively effects firm performance. Managerial Summary: Our study illustrates the need for board expertise to be aligned with firm risks. While there has been increasing pressure for firms to assess their directors' expertise (i.e., skill matrices), simply identifying expertise which is present or absent does not speak to whether that expertise is actually needed (or not) by the firm given the risks faced. We analyze boards' collective expertise, compare that with the risks that firms are facing, and identify the gaps which may detrimentally impact the monitoring ability of the board and cause firm performance to suffer. Consequently, understanding the degree of (mis)alignment is of paramount importance for boards to be effective monitors and positively influence firm performance. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Ownership concentration remains a salient institutional feature among public listed firms in emerging and transitional economies. This study examines how a listed firm's ownership concentration interacts with its governance mechanisms in shaping corporate R&D investments. By analyzing panel data of Chinese listed firms between 2010 and 2012, I have three core findings. First, ownership concentration by the largest controlling shareholder negatively affects a firm's R&D intensity, but a small team of shareholders' ownership concentration plays a positive role. Second, a firm's monitoring mechanisms (measured by its sizes of the board and independent directors) and CEO stockholding positively affect the firm's R&D input. Third, CEO stockholding's positive role in promoting firm R&D is stronger in the firms with a more dispersed ownership structure. This study discloses the ways ownership concentration influences corporate governance and, in turn, affects corporate innovation. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Studies on demand side mechanisms related to experience goods argue that demand is driven by recommendation and reputation. In an auditing context, research showed that both of these mechanisms play an important role in determining partner selection, however, only when the mechanisms are observed in isolation. On this basis, this study raises a concern about whether the mechanisms are mutually exclusive, and if not, how does recommendation and reputation in auditor selection context create an interplay in the process of auditor selection. We test our hypotheses on network data of Danish public companies. Findings from the social network study indicate that auditor selection is a sensitive and complex task for boards of directors, as it is not only driven by either of the mechanisms. Rather, partner selection is driven by the combination of both recommendation and reputation, which creates the interplay and, thus, indicates that the demand mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and should not be observed in isolation of one another.

The continuous escalation in cybersecurity risk and the frequency of operational IT failures have drawn attention to the importance of the board of directors' monitoring function and responsibility for maximizing IT value-protection. In response, boards have sought to enhance their IT competence levels. We assert that, while higher board IT competence has positive implications in IT value-creation, it could have a negative implication in the IT value-protection context. When firms have a more IT competent board, equity investors' ex-ante expectations of superior oversight of IT by the board are baked into those firms' equity prices. When such firms experience operational IT failures, investors would view their boards as relatively ineffective in IT oversight and adjust more sharply the ex-ante expectations built into equity prices. Using agency-theoretic arguments, we develop this reasoning into a hypothesis that board IT competence is negatively associated with firm market performance post operational IT failures. Our analysis of 107 operational IT failures in public U.S. firms provides support for this hypothesis, even after we address the potential endogeneity of board IT competence. (c) 2021

Scholars endorsing the embeddedness outlook call for directors' greater engagement in the strategic management process. In contrast, scholars endorsing the control outlook argue that directors should focus on fulfilling their fiduciary duty of supervising top executives. Based on the behavioral-agency theory, this paper outlines a conduct outlook on boards. Recognizing the benefits of directors' participation in the strategic management process, we hypothesize that it may boost directors' satisfaction with firm's performance, strategic planning, and strategy. This could lead to cognitive entrenchment and spur inertial tendencies. Structural equations modeling analysis of the data from a survey of 367 Canadian directors supports the hypotheses. These findings add knowledge to latest research on the advantages vs. disadvantages of activist boards. (c) 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Every year, companies spend billions of dollars in board time and headhunter fees on CEO searches. In fact, by many accounts, the selection of the next CEO is the single most important task of the board of directors. Yet, despite the huge amount of time, money, and attention given to the task, many CEO changes fail, with disastrous consequences for all concerned.With so much at stake, it is natural to ask what companies and their boards can do to increase the odds of success. Illustrated with an abundance of real-life examples from interviews with CEOs, C-suite members, members of the boards, and headhunters supporting CEO searches, The Next CEO explains how boards can improve the odds of success with CEO succession by identifying clear CEO mandates and associated CEO profiles and by selecting CEOs that are fi t for purpose. It further explains how the CEOs of leading corporations effectively take charge and create results, providing a roadmap for incoming CEOs. These ideas are brought to life with case studies and interviews with well-known corporations such as ABB, Alibaba, Freudenberg, GE, Google, HNA, HP, Microsoft, Nestle, Nike, Nokia, Novartis, Roche, Sony, Tata, and Zurich Insurance.

Purpose: Several empirical attempts have investigated boardroom processes and their impact on the governing team decision-making. Such attempts, however, have derived in inchoate results opening new methodological debates and leaving the underlying patterns of board processes obscure. This paper aims to shed light on these patterns by empirically examining the interrelation among the three central constructs involved in board decision-making: know-how, demographic diversity and directors' social interactions. Design/methodology/approach: A framework of interrelation among know-how, demographic diversity and social interactions was conceptually built and empirically validated with partial least squares structural equation modelling applied to archival data from a sample of 87 boards of directors of Spanish, German and UK listed companies. Findings: Results unmask the intricacies of behavioural processes involved in know-how-demography relation: demographic diversity contribution to know-how is totally and positively mediated by directors' social interactions. This reveals the power of directors' socialization frequency in determining processes and predicting know-how. Practical implications: The paper offers a new pathway to manage board know-how and to make board diversity effective. It also opens a door to an innovative empirical methodology to make board processes emerge, one that overcomes methodological limitations of previous efforts. Originality/value: This is so far the only study that examines and measures holistically the structural interrelation among the three central constructs determining board decisions and performance: know-how, diversity and social interactions.

Integrating theoretical perspectives on tokenism and perceived preferential selection, we explore whether the relationship between chief executive officers' (CEOs') external board memberships and CEO compensation is gendered. Based on recent pressures to diversify corporate boards, we theorize that female CEOs' memberships on external boards will result in less monetary compensation relative to male CEOs due to concerns of organizational decision-makers that female CEOs generally inhabit token or "symbolic" positions of limited value. Additionally, we present competing hypotheses (i.e., mitigation vs. exacerbation) regarding how this devaluation will be affected by female representation on the board of directors and compensation committee, respectively. Using a panel sample of 12,464 firm-year observations comprising of 1,805 unique firms and 2,782 unique CEOs, the relationship between CEO external board memberships and compensation is indeed weaker for female compared to male CEOs. Furthermore, this devaluation primarily occurred in organizations where there was stronger (vs. weaker) female representation on the board of directors or compensation committee. However, supplemental analyses revealed that this differential devaluation was mitigated when female executives on the board held greater power (i.e., chaired important committees), highlighting the importance of moving beyond mere representation to ensuring influence on boards for female directors.

This study investigates how firm structure, chief executive officer (CEO) power, and federal legislation influence hiring of corporate directors from a diverse background. Combining the value-in-diversity hypothesis and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the impact of economically rational (i.e., business need) and social preference (i.e., similar-to-me bias) drivers of board diversity post-the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms from an eight-year period spanning SOX, we find that SOX is positively correlated with board diversity. Although SOX was not intended to increase board diversity, the changes it put in place have subsequently facilitated more board diversity. Results show that the economically rational predictor (firm operational complexity) had a positive and statistically significant effect on board diversity pre-SOX but that effect disappeared post-SOX. Meanwhile, CEO power, a social preference inhibitor of board diversity, had a negative and statistically significant relationship with board diversity pre-SOX which also disappeared post-SOX. It appears that SOX has mitigated both economically rational drivers to want more diversity as well as social preference drivers to want less diversity. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The goal of corporate spin-offs, as a corporate restructuring technique, is to create better value for both the divesting firm and its subsidiary/division. These corporate transactions lead to the creation of independent, publicly traded entities, which are called spun-off subsidiaries. In this study, we examine the effect of board independence and directors' industry experience on the market performance of spun-off subsidiaries by setting two main hypotheses. Our sample includes 123 completed U.S.-based spin-off events during a 14-year long time frame. According to our empirical analysis, we find support for both hypotheses, which appear to be significant and positive. In addition, our moderation analysis shows that the interaction effect of directors' industry experience and board ownership is positive and significant. Based on the arguments of agency and resource dependence theories, this study contributes to the governance literature by proving the significant importance of board of directors (namely, their independence and industry experience) on the market performance of spun-off subsidiaries after being separated from their corporate parents. From the managerial contributions aspect, this study tells us that if the board is independent and includes directors with the same industry experience, these spun-off subsidiaries will experience positive change in their market performance. Our interaction effect also shows that if board members are offered more shares on the top of their industry experience, the change in market performance will be stronger.

The social entrepreneurship literature increasingly acknowledges that the board of directors is of major importance in dealing with the multiple goal pursuit of social enterprises. Using a team production perspective, we study the relationship between stakeholder knowledge in the board and the engagement of the board in counseling and decision-making (i.e., board service performance) and subsequent organizational performance. The results of our study, using a sample of Flemish social enterprises, reveal that board stakeholder knowledge is positively related to board service performance. This relationship is moderated by board behavioral integration, which is strengthening the relationship in case of high stakeholder knowledge. Finally, while board service performance is positively related to social performance and, specifically, the social goal of hiring disadvantaged people, it is not significantly related to financial performance.

We attempt to bring clarity to the concept of strategic leadership and guide its development by reviewing and synthesizing the existing management literature on how top managers and board directors influence organizations. We propose a new definition of strategic leadership and offer a framework organized around the essential questions of what strategic leadership is, what strategic leaders do, why they do it, and how they do it. To answer these questions, we organize our review around the eight functions strategic leaders serve, the key attributes of strategic leaders, the theories scholars have used to relate these functions and attributes to outcomes, contextual factors, and the organizational outcomes that strategic leaders affect. We identify how strategic leadership research is concentrated in five streams that rarely interact with each other, and offer suggestions for connecting these streams. Our review provides a big picture of what is known about individuals at the top levels of organizations and highlights the key areas where future investigation is essential. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We examine how gender diversity on boards of directors affects investment in research and development (R&D), thereby providing the platform for future ambidexterity of the organization. Using quantitative data from 44 countries, that are exemplified by qualitative data, our findings show that gender diverse boards result in more complex organizational outcomes in regard to R&D investment than assumed originally. Our findings show that gender diverse boards encourage ambidexterity. On the one hand, increased gender diversity has a negative direct effect on R&D. However by positively affecting equity based remuneration, these diversified boards actually encourage indirectly higher R&D investments that are better correlated with the organization goals. Gender diversity on boards, therefore, encourages organizational behavior that increases the chances for higher ambidexterity over time by encouraging exploitative behavior as well as explorative behavior.

Given the mixed evidence that having both women and men in the top management team (TMT) or in the board of directors (BOD) has a significant influence on organizational innovation, we resolve this issue by conceptualizing TMT-BOD gender diversity as part of a multiteam system, that has joint effects which impact organizational innovation. Evidence from the study of both Chinese firms and UK firms confirm our conceptualization by showing an interaction effect between TMT gender diversity and BOD gender diversity such that innovation is greatest when both are high. The positive TMT-BOD gender diversity interaction effect on innovation improves subsequent firm performance particularly in dynamic environments. The findings refine current thinking by going beyond research that tests intra-team TMT or BOD diversity independently and instead considers inter-team diversity across both leadership teams within the strategic leadership upper echelons. In sum, findings show that high levels of TMT and BOD gender diversity result in more organizational innovation, which ultimately improves firm performance. We offer implications for women's inclusion in leadership as well as for research on the upper echelons. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Female representation on boards is perhaps one of the most studied topics in board-governance research. At the same time, much is unknown about female directors' task engagement within boards. Drawing from psychological theory on societal gender beliefs, our study tests whether the impact of director gender on supervisory task engagement hinges on status dynamics in two relational interfaces: the director-board interface and the director-CEO interface. According to this perspective, female directors show less task engagement because gender is a diffuse status cue that creates status differentiation within the director-board interface. Multi-source board survey data (n = 61 boards, n = 315 directors) confirms that, within the confines of the boardroom, female directors do, indeed, receive lower-status ratings than male directors. This effect is weaker when boards have a female chair. Furthermore, lower status explains perceived lower task engagement of female directors, but this link critically hinges on the CEO-director interface. The impact of status differences is more pronounced when directors intersect with a relatively dominant CEO. All in all, the results demonstrate that relational interfaces play a key role for female directors' task engagement in their board duties. (c) 2021 The Author(s)

The behavioral theory of corporate governance is employed to investigate the relationship between managerial entrenchment and corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement. Effective corporate governance is argued to reduce managerial entrenchment, thereby increasing CSR engagement. The role of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) is investigated as a moderating variable in this relationship, such that high levels of EPU will increase the impact of entrenchment on CSR engagement. These arguments are supported using a panel of 386 US firms from 2011 to 2018 representing 3,088 firm-year observations in a variety of industries. In supplementary analysis, the CSR measure is disaggregated in order to provide further insight regarding these relationships as they pertain to the individual CSR dimensions under study. Findings inform research regarding the entrenchment-CSR link in particular environmental contexts. Practical implications include potential governance guidelines for boards of directors; stakeholder management given the policy environment; and the impact of government decisions as they affect policy uncertainty, firm actions, and CSR engagement.

We examine the relationship between board of director committees tasked with risk management and environmental performance, based on a sample of 1466 firm-year observations from 2007 to 2015. We find that the presence of board committees dedicated only to risk management is associated with better environmental performance. The human capital of risk committees (measured by board tenure, committee tenure, experience, and qualifications) is also positively related to environmental performance. Our findings suggest that the benefits of risk management committees extend to non-financial matters, such as environmental performance. Our findings further suggest that environmental performance is now managed through the regular governance mechanisms within firms. This supports the notion that environmental performance is managed for economic reasons and for the benefit of investors, rather than for the aggrandisement of individual managers. Our findings should be of interest to boards, CEOs, and CFOs who are interested in risk management, as well as to investors, lenders, and auditors who are interested in assessing risk.

This study extends research on the board nationality and gender diversity to a new, unchartered, methodological territory of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). QCA is based on Boolean algebra and facilitates the application of set-theoretic reasoning to the data analysis. This work adds to the repository of academic studies, which put forward a 'business case' for the board nationality and gender diversity in terms of their positive impact on the board outcomes. Based on the upper echelons theory and the 'value-in-diversity' proposition, we assess the influence of board nationality and gender diversity on board commitment, which is measured with two proxies: the annual number of board meetings and board evaluation. The findings indicate that both board nationality and gender diversity are part of the intermediate solutions for the outcome variable. The impact of both variables on board commitment is typically detected in large firms that are internationalised but not product-diversified, the boards of which tend to be small. These results confirm that the increasing emphasis on ensuring significant board nationality/ethnic and gender diversity in board composition within the regulatory documents on corporate governance represents a step in the right direction.

This paper is an attempt to empirically examine the influence of corporate governance on zombie theory. Recent data indicates that the problem affects more than 10% of all firms and is worth close to a billion Euros in the European Union. It is thus an important problem worth analysing in European countries, and Spain is one of the worst affected. The sample studied here thus consists of Spanish companies with negative equity over the five business years from 2013 to 2017. The analysis focuses on establishing how corporate government aspects-board size, dedication to board meetings, concentration of ownership, owners and gender of the CEO-, affect the severity of extreme zombie firms. It uses the amount and temporality dimensions of EZIndex. The results confirm that internal dimensions such as corporate governance are important aspects to be introduced into zombie analysis. To control zombiness our results suggest structuring boards of directors with more than one member, CEOs with non-exclusive dedication, non-concentrated ownership and female CEOs. We also find that all these factors affect both amount and temporality, so factors do not affect zombie companies partially but totally. The contributions of the paper are twofold: first it includes corporate governance factors as a relevant approach for understanding zombie theory; and second, it encourages companies to manage risk-taking decisions efficiently so as to avoid the proliferation of zombies.

The social construction of gender has led to differences in beliefs, knowledge, experiences, or networks between women and men. Some argue that mixed gender teams can show perform better. However, empirical research at the firm level has provided mixed evidence. Moreover, these studies mainly focus on the board of directors or top management teams. Few have examined how middle management and staff levels affect firm performance. These levels form the operational layers that execute the business strategy and run daily operations. Using a unique dataset of 159 large French firms, we find that gender diversity at the two organisational levels positively impacts a firm's economic performance and contributes to its competitiveness. Gender diversity at these levels is a strategic resource that provides a sustainable competitive advantage by creating value and cannot be easily imitated by competitors quickly. We also find a nonlinear relationship due to a threshold effect related to a critical mass condition, and a hat-shaped relationship (two flat borders around the top) between gender diversity and firm performance. Specifically, firms with balanced diversity (between 40 and 60% women as employees) at the middle management and staff levels tend to be more profitable. Finally, predominantly male firms have similar performance to predominantly female firms, and that balanced-gender diversity is the real contributing factor to firm performance.

This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of existing international accounting and finance research on the structure, characteristics, and diversity of corporate boards (SCDBs), as well as their effects on the corresponding corporate outcomes. Emphasis is particularly placed on synthesising and expanding current knowledge from both theoretical (i.e., economic and governance, regulatory, resource-oriented, and psychological/sociological) and empirical (i.e., multi-level antecedents of SCDBs and various themes of SCDB-related corporate outcomes) perspectives. Adopting the SLR method, we review 511 articles from 69 journals between the years 1973 and 2020. Our main findings are as follows. First, the majority of the papers in our SLR are descriptive in nature and/or use a single traditional theory (e.g., agency theory), rather than adopting an integrated multi-theoretical approach. Second, studies on the determinants or antecedents of SCDBs are scarce and have tended to focus on firm- and board-level issues rather than on institutional- and individual-level issues. Third, given the absence of cross-country, mixed-methods, and qualitative investigations, current articles in our SLR suffer from methodological constraints, such as inconsistent definition and measurement, insufficient variables, and repetitive quantitative research methods. Finally, opportunities and a future research agenda are explored and outlined. (c) 2022 The Authors

We examine the minutes of Indian banks' board meetings and offer insights into the issues tabled and discussed in bank boards. We find that risk issues account for only 10% of the issues tabled with regulation and compliance accounting for the most (41%), followed by business strategy (31%). Majority of the issues are not deliberated in detail. We interpret the evidence as suggestive of under-investment in risk and over-investment in regulation and compliance by bank boards. (c) 2022

Corporate governance has received substantial scholarly attention for decades, although the focus of this research has by and large been on publicly traded for-profit organizations. However, agency problems are increasingly recognized in nonprofits. As such, we examine the application of corporate governance logic in the context of nonprofits. Our study relies on nearly a decade of data spanning 6853 US-based charities and comprising nearly US$346 billion in total revenue. Our results show that common corporate governance practices--such as independent boards, chief executive officer oversight, and transparency--enhance the degree to which donor contributions are allocated toward a charity's mission. Overall, we assess the broader applicability and benefits of corporate governance and build on literature highlighting links between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In doing so, we demonstrate the usefulness of governance in this economically and socially consequential context. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential influence of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms on audit risk in Tunisian companies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of Tunisian non-financial firms listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange (TSE) over the periods 2005 to 2010 (pre- 2011 revolution) and 2011 to 2017 (post -2011 revolution), consisting of 371 observations for the whole period, the authors apply the generalized least square (GLS) to test the research hypotheses and model. Findings: The results are consistent with the agency theory suggesting that efficient corporate governance is able to control and reduce a company's agency problem. Evidence reveals that the effectiveness of the director's board/ownership structure and audit quality have the most influence on audit risk before than after the 2011 revolution, although governance mechanisms should play a more active role in encouraging companies to be more transparent in the post-revolution period. Moreover these findings are confirmed when identifying a composite measure of corporate governance. Practical implications: Significant implications are provided for analysts, investors, regulators and academics. First, findings can help Tunisian regulators determine corporate governance disclosure requirements. Second, this research will make investors and stakeholders aware of the fact that minimizing auditor risk will be effective in reducing agency problems in emerging markets like Tunisia. Then, this work can help researchers better understand and realize the corporate governance role in the quality of audit process and financial statements and encourage them to deeply and broadly investigate this issue on other emerging markets. Originality/value: This study stands for an extension of the existing research on corporate governance and audit risk. It fills a research gap in the local context. In fact, the considered data are those of the pre- and post-revolution Tunisian market, mainly in periods of instability. Although emerging markets make up the vast majority of economic activity around the world, they have received limited attention in academic research. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines whether board attributes determine firms' exchange rate risk by influencing their hedging activities. Prior literature demonstrates that strong corporate governance encourages value-enhancing hedging, but the effects of firm-level governance such as board structure on the level of firms' risk exposure have rarely been investigated. By analyzing a sample of firms in 10 emerging markets during 2011-2019, I investigate the effects of board attributes--such as size, leadership, independence, and gender diversity--on firms' exchange rate risk. This study provides the first evidence that firms with larger boards and higher board independence face lower exchange rate risk due to more efficient hedging. Moreover, firms with gender-diverse boards become more effective in hedging and face lower exposure when board independence is higher. The findings signify that better monitoring by the board of directors over managers makes hedging more effective, resulting in lower exchange rate risk. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Research on the outcomes of shareholder activism has gained momentum among management scholars in recent years. However, studies focusing on the way shareholder activists affect top managers' cognition are still in its infancy. Thus, this study examines the relationship between shareholder activism and chief executive officers' (CEOs') future focus on the basis of signaling theory. By applying a contingency view and considering various characteristics of proposals by activists as pivotal moderators, it intends to reveal the conditions under which activists stimulate CEOs' future focus. Empirical analyses not only confirm that shareholder activism shapes CEOs' future focus but also reveal that this effect is stronger when shareholder proposals are written in an analytical and powerful tone, contain more adverbs and verbs, and trigger CEOs' cognition by highlighting negativity. Conversely, more self-related proposals reduce activists' positive impact. Supplemental analyses indicate that the relationship between shareholder activism and CEOs' future focus may vary under the different characteristics of the boards of directors. Generally, the study provides an innovative and more 'humanized' perspective on the literature being among the first to examine the impact of shareholder activism on CEOs' future focus based on signaling theory. By exploring communication characteristics, the study also applies a relatively novel lens in management research. Moreover, it offers valuable practical implications for shareholders (proposals as effective means to increase interest alignment between shareholders and top-level executives), CEOs (proposals as an impetus to become more aware of future events), and boards of directors (proposals as an important governance tool).

The boards of directors of state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea is the subject of this research. These boards have not received significant attention in previous studies, despite their distinctive features and control role. The focus is on gender diversity with reference to task-related variables such as insider/outsider, tenure, and occupation. The extent of the board's monitoring was measured following the rates of revision and rejection of management plans in the board's minutes. The idea is to assess decision-making as a measure of the effectiveness of the boards. Based on longitudinal data on state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea, gender diversity was positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. Understanding of the positive impact of gender diversity was enhanced with the inclusion of task-related diversity variables in the model. Tenure and occupation diversity were positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. It is proposed that the various diversity factors specific to organizational context be examined to improve understanding of diversity. (c) 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Drawing on institutional theory and homophily network theory, we argue theoretically and support empirically that higher economic freedom reduces the board of director diversity. Using a large U.S. sample of 26,142 firm-year pairs for 1996-2015, we find that firms located in the states with higher economic freedom are less likely to foster gender or ethnic diversity on their boards. The results are robust to a battery of variables that capture differences in economic freedom, gender, and ethnic diversity. The results are also robust to various empirical tests, including endogeneity analyses, such as propensity score matching and the instrumental variable approach. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

With the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in company activities, discussions on how to use AI in company management have emerged. Although AI is not legally recognised as a director in company law, there are examples of robot directors such as Vital, which have managed to get a seat in the corporate boardroom. Today, AI is on the verge of playing an important role in corporate governance. However, whether it has a seat on the board of directors or an important role in decision making is still a hot topic. Another critical discussion in the field of corporate governance in recent years is board diversity, which aims to improve the corporate decision-making process and create efficiency. This article attempts to anticipate the potential impact of AI on corporate board diversity policies and regulations. Therefore, this article seeks to examine the effects of the inevitable use of AI in the corporate decision-making process on corporate board gender diversity discussions and regulations under three possibilities: AI as a board member, AI as an enabler to assist a decision maker or AI being used to help decision making such as selecting board members.

In this article we investigate the effect of the presence of women on the board of directors and in executive positions on the risk and profitability of75 banks in ten ASEAN countries during the period of 2002-2018.We find that banks with more women in executive positions show higher capital risk, i.e., Z-score and capital ratio. However, the women-led banks have higher market to book ratios and they are more profitable in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Furthermore, our findings shed light on the relationship between gender diversity and financial decision-making in the company by highlighting that the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) banks with more executives' women are more risky and have higher profits than the men-led banks. We also find that the proportion of women on the board standing as a director or a chair reduces performance in ROA and ROE. Bank performance measured by market-to-book (PB), is the lowest when there are females on the board. This highlights the gender differences in investment behavior and the women's needs in banks at Asian region. Given that bank performance has a direct effect on the stability of the financial system as well as on economic growth in the country, it is essential for the regulatory authorities to assess variety of sources which can improve performance and governance in (ASEAN) banks.

This study examines the effect of CEO-connected directors on firm value. Empirical analyses are conducted on US firms between 1999 and 2016 using a local supply of directors as an instrumental variable. CEO-connected directors contribute to the firm by resolving information asymmetry. I find that firms with more CEO-connected directors produce more innovative outputs than those with fewer CEO-connected directors. However, such directors exacerbate managerial entrenchment. Hence, it is necessary to establish rules for the board of directors that reflect firm-specific characteristics, such as information transparency.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the potential influence of multiple directorships (MDs) on the firm value of listed firms in Jordan. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 1,067 firm-year observations of Jordanian listed companies from 2010 to 2020, this study applies a pooled ordinary least squares regression model to examine the above-stated relationship. This technique was supported by conducting a generalized method of moments estimation to address the possible occurrence of endogeneity concerns. Findings: The results show a significant negative relationship between MDs and firm performance, thereby supporting the "Busyness Hypothesis", which suggests that directors with MDs are expected to be over-committed, too busy and less vigilant. Thus, their ability to effectively monitor the company management on behalf of the shareholders is quite limited. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study in Jordan, and one of the very rare studies in the Middle Eastern and North African region, to examine the relationship between MDs and firm performance. This study provides important policy and practitioner implications in the field of corporate governance by highlighting the necessity of imposing stricter limits on the number of directorships allowed for board directors. Crucially, the empirical evidence implies that limited directorships ensure that directors are able to fulfil their board responsibilities appropriately, which is significantly associated with the firm value.

This article studies, over the period 2006 to 2019, both the structure and the evolution of corporate networks built on shared board directors between the largest listed firms of three European countries: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. It offers a longitudinal and up-to-date analysis of the state of links between companies through examining interlocking directorates. Contrary to previous studies which have emphasized a decline of interlocks when analyzed at the board director level, we observe relative stability of these networks at the corporate level with a number of connected firms remaining quite stable despite a decline of board ties. As a result, the most central companies remain mainly the same at the national and international level over the considered period. Our findings provide evidence for the resource perspective: access to key resources seemingly pushes firms to continue their network participation despite strengthened national regulations on directors with multiple board seats. This evolution echoes the concept of weak ties of Granovetter (Am J Sociol 78: 360-1380, 1973). Lastly, it is worth noting that it cannot be affirmed that there has been an emergence of a cross-national network which operates to substitute national board ties.

Board director independence is critical to achieving and maintaining control to address the agency theory-based issue of interest misalignment between the principal (the organization) and the executives (agent). However, theoretical and empirical research and strategic risk considerations have brought into question the role or relevance that director independence plays in these control task and agency theory domains. We ask, using a quantitative survey method, whether board activity-based applications of independence may be associated with the service task of the board, namely its resource dependence mission. Our findings suggest that the resource dependence duty of the board may be positively associated with some autonomous activities, and yet other activities might be driven primarily by normative practices. Based on this, we suggest that a theoretical scope beyond and greater than agency theory may be needed when reassessing the role of director independence.

Purpose: This study aims to examine whether the age and tenure of the chair of the board of directors are related to research and development (R&D) investment in China. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses A-share manufacturing firms that traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange between 2009 and 2018. This study uses OLS regressions, controls for self-selection bias, and uses an instrumental variable to alleviate the concern of endogeneity. Findings: This study finds that chair tenure has a negative relationship with R&D investment. This study does not find a significant relationship between chair age and R&D investment. Originality/value: This study contributes to corporate governance and strategic management literature by highlighting chair tenure as a new factor affecting R&D investments. It also adds a significant contribution to the limited literature on the chair's role in strategic decisions. Moreover, companies that are eager to strengthen corporate governance and maintain sustained innovation may reconsider the chair tenure. Given that many proposals for board governance reform explicitly stress the importance of limiting board tenure, this study contributes to policymakers by providing evidence in support of these proposals.

Recently, regulators and investors have shown an increasing interest in the promotion of diversity in the corporate boards of directors. In this paper, we employ data from the Australian bank boards to provide new insights on the diversity-risk nexus, based on a dataset of the Australian banks for the period of 2004 to 2019. We examine board gender diversity from two perspectives across the board and among board leaders. Our results support the context-dependent impact of gender diversity on the board of directors and highlight the beneficial impact on the risk of banks when considering gender diversity and the presence of a dominant gender group in the boardroom.

Research Summary: We investigate the relationship between outside board members (OBMs) and short- versus long-term strategic orientation of new ventures in the startup phase. Owing to their smallness and newness, a short-term orientation may be more desirable. Using a dataset of 170 Belgian new ventures in the startup phase, we find a positive association between the proportion of OBMs and a short- rather than long-term strategic orientation, attributed by our interviewees to concern for firm survival. This association is stronger in new ventures operating in highly competitive environments, and where the founding team performed few pre-startup activities. Greater focus on the short-term may be beneficial in the long run, as a positive association is found between a high relative short-term orientation and ventures' growth. Managerial Summary: New ventures in the startup phase should primarily focus on short-term issues: get a better understanding of who are the customers and try to validate the business model. This article reveals that the board of directors plays a pivotal role in influencing the extent to which startups have a short-term strategic orientation. Specifically, it explains how OBMs provide advice, monitor the startup's progress, and guide entrepreneurs on key short-term priorities. This strategic role of OBMs is more pronounced in new ventures where the entrepreneurial team is less prepared at founding and in firms operating in highly competitive environments. Importantly, our paper provides evidence that a short-term orientation in the startup phase does not jeopardize future venture growth in the scale-up phase. (c) 2022 Strategic Management Society.

This study investigates the relationship between various attributes of boards of directors on bank performance in light of Saudi corporate governance regulations. The data set of this study is extracted from the annual reports of all 12 banks listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) over a period of 10 years from 2009 to 2018. To test the study hypotheses, check the robustness of the results, and address potential endogeneity issues, this study applies different statistical methods, including FGLS, OLS, RE, PLCSE, and 2SLS, using STATA version 17. The results of multivariate analysis show that board size has a significant positive influence only on operational bank performance (ROA). For board composition, the results show that while board independence has a significant negative impact on accounting-based performance (ROA and ROE), it affects positively and significantly the market-based performance (Tobin's Q). Regarding board education, the results indicate that board members with at least a Bachelor's degree have a significant negative impact on ROA and ROE. In contrast, PhD holders on the board have a significant positive impact on ROA and ROE, while Master's holders affect positively and significantly all measures of bank performance. With respect to board diversity, only the CEO nationality has a significant positive effect on ROA and ROE. Board IT experience is found to be significantly and positively associated with ROA and ROE, while board meeting attendance has a significant positive influence only on ROE. These findings have important implications, especially for Saudi regulatory authorities to assess the current practice and compliance with the Saudi corporate governance regulations (SCGRs) and the principles of corporate governance for banks operating in Saudi Arabia (PCGB) regarding board characteristics and provide insights to improve board effectiveness and corporate governance practice in general.

Our study investigates the effects of board acquisition experience on value creation in cross-border acquisitions and the dependence of this relationship on acquirer and target country institutions. We draw on cross-border acquisition research and institution-based corporate governance research to argue that the effect of board acquisition experience depends on the institutional characteristics of the acquirer and target countries and on cultural differences between these two countries. Based on 1775 cross-border acquisitions of U.S. and European acquirers, we show a positive effect of board acquisition experience on the announcement returns of cross-border acquisitions, which is even stronger when the target country's takeover regulations are less friendly and when the target and acquirer countries are culturally more distant.

The objective of this case-based study is to understand how the dyadic interaction between the key governance actors can influence the decision-making aimed at directing and controlling a family firm. The study provides evidence that dyadic interaction at the back stage of the formal governance process can offer a privileged position for the family firm owners who serve on the board, and the non-family member Chair of the Board, to influence decision-making before, after and between board meetings. The cases studied suggest that dyadic interactions can serve as preparation for formal board processes and complement and clarify them, yet they also have the potential to conflict with them. Dyadic interaction is also shown to offer important relational and emotional benefits that may not necessarily be achieved through larger group interaction. The findings suggest that although the actors can self-regulate their behaviour through informal rules, the rules may imperfectly address one risk of dyadic interaction--the reduced cognitive conflict among the board.

Purpose: The relationship between interlocking directorates and firm performance has been increasingly debated, with a focus on whether firm's centrality in interlock networks is associated with performance. The purpose of this study is to examine not only how a firm's position in this network is associated with performance but also how the performance of network partners can impact a firm's performance. This study examines how firms effectively utilise the interlock network to achieve the goal of higher market capitalisation - termed market capitalisation rank (MCR). Design/methodology/approach: The premise of the study is the UK FTSE 350 firms from 2014 to 2018. The paper makes use of a temporal network autocorrelation model to examine how firm characteristics, the structural position in the interlock network and the performance of network partners affect MCR over time. Findings: The analysis indicates that firms with ties (via the interlock network) to firms with high market capitalisation are more likely to enhance their own MCR, highlighting network partners have the opportunity to play a critical role in a firm's dominance strategy to optimise firm value. Originality/value: The value of this research is that it does not only look at the impact of a firm's position in the network on performance, but the impact of the performance of network partners on a firm's market performance as well.

Following its 40th anniversary and more than three decades after its introduction to the strategic management literature, agency theory remains the predominant theory of corporate governance. In this paper, we examine affect, an underexplored dimension in principal-agent relationships. Using the CEO-board of directors relationship as a context, we develop a theoretical lens that explains how interpersonal affect underlying relationships between CEOs and directors of boards shapes behavior in ways that deviate from traditional agency theory predictions. We discuss how the incorporation of an affective perspective advances principal-agent research by revising agency theory's assumptions concerning human nature and behavior and suggesting new research directions. By acknowledging a central role of affect, we connect existing behavioral approaches to organizational agency and advance our understanding of socioemotional foundations of principal-agent tensions, problems, and agency costs.

Research Question/Issue: We contrast the predictions of gender socialization theory and "fem-power washing" (deceptively positioning as a firm promoting female empowerment without any tangible actions) to investigate whether promoting female directors on the board of directors associates with a reduction in the prevalence of firm-level workplace sexual harassment (SH). Research Findings/Insights: We estimate the incidence rate of SH through textual analysis of US employees' job reviews published online during the period 2011-2021. We find that an increase of one female director is associated with a 21.81% decrease in workplace SH and that firms with high board gender diversity synchronize the reduction in SH with improved social policies (e.g., policies to better employee relations, health and safety, or diversity challenges). Our results do not support the fem-power washing theory but rather imply that nominating female directors may have a profound impact on the firm's ethical culture. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study validates the ethical dimension of corporate governance: Nominating female directors impacts a firm harassment culture and, by extension, a firm's ethical and corporate culture. This study adds to the governance literature that debates the merits of board gender diversity by highlighting an oft-ignored channel through which board diversity affects firm value: ethics and corporate culture. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For boards of directors, having more female directors can curb workplace SH, a behavior that is associated with a severe and lasting negative effect on firm value. For practitioners, regulators, and the business community, this study reinforces the merits of aiming towards more gender-balanced boards. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Priorliterature does not provide a clear prediction of how executive confidence affects the degree to which a firm engages in "myopic marketing management," the tendency to decrease current marketing spending to mitigate any potential earnings shortfall. We propose that highly confident CEOs are more likely to cut marketing spending to raise current earnings numbers because they believe in their ability to generate high future firm earnings that can cover the long-term losses arising from their current short-term actions. The effect is heightened when the board of directors is more independent and monitors more, but attenuated if CMOs are more confident and thus are better able to convince their CEOs and boards of directors to support continued investments in marketing. The moderating impact of CMO confidence is proposed to be stronger as the CMO becomes more powerful. Using secondary data from a broad cross-section of firms, we provide robust empirical support for our model. Our results highlight situations in which CMOs need to be wary of cuts to their marketing budget, and also provide a potential mechanism through which marketers can protect their budget in the presence of highly confident CEOs--through their own confidence levels.

This study examines whether and when, in a stigmatized industry, firms' negative publicity can lead to the appointment of their CEOs to the boards of directors of other firms within that sector. Building on research on ingroup identification and on stigma, we propose that within a stigmatized industry, when a firm receives negative publicity, its CEO is more likely to join the board of other firms in the industry, possibly because these other firms interpret the negative publicity as a sign of the social identification of the CEO with the stigmatized industry. We also suggest that this relationship is more likely when the negative publicity reveals information otherwise not available about the CEO. We test our hypotheses using a novel, hand-collected dataset of 408 CEOs in 205 firms in the global arms industry, between 1998 and 2017, and find that within this stigmatized industry, when a firm receives negative publicity, its CEO is more likely to join the board of other firms in the industry, and that lower levels of CEOs' reputational capital and visibility magnify this effect. Our findings advance the conversations in stigma research about upper echelons, highlighting the importance of internal and external actors and of the type of stigma, when investigating the consequences of stigma for upper echelons' careers.

Research question/issue: Corporate governance codes of practice require non-executive directors (NEDs) to challenge and question managers. Prior literature and best practice guidance remain silent on the precise meaning of, and on how directors might execute, "challenge", and how management might respond. We explore the ways in which NEDs challenge, question, and dissent during board meetings, and how managers respond. We observe, audio-record, and video-record three boards during nine board meetings. Our boards are unique in holding part of their meetings in public and part in private. Research findings/insights: Our dataset comprises 418 questions and 510 answers. We develop a typology of NEDs' challenge/questions comprising six categories/48 subcategories and managers' responses/answers comprising eight categories/69 subcategories. Our findings support the assertion that NEDs may be reluctant to offer moderate (i.e., constructive) challenge in public. We find significant differences between the level of dissent and the types of answers offered in public versus in private. We find an association between the type of question asked and the type of answer provided. Who asks and answers questions varies significantly in public versus in private, as do the questions and answers by each board. Theoretical/academic implications: Our empirical findings suggest board behavior varies in the presence of an audience of stakeholders. In public, boards go through the motions by engaging in the performativity of governance, while more substantive governance occurs in private. Practitioner/policy implications: We show that regulatory calls for robust challenge by NEDs have not been met, at least judging by the three boards in our study. There is a lack of guidance and advice on how NEDs should exercise challenge and how managers might respond. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Boards of directors play a central role in governing corporate strategic change. We systematically review corporate governance research on strategic change published over the past 40 years, differentiating between strategic change types and board characteristics. We identify three developments: a focus on specific strategic change types, board composition and structure, and North American listed firms as a dominant study context. Yet, our analysis of the literature shows that research on board governance of interrelated strategic changes, on different board roles and behaviour, and on the governance of strategic changes across different contexts remains underdeveloped. To address these research gaps, we suggest three future research avenues: (1) examining how boards govern interrelated changes in a strategic change portfolio and its evolution over time; (2) studying the mediating relationship between board governance (particularly different board roles and behaviour), strategic changes, and corresponding outcomes; and (3) gaining a better understanding of the role of context in board governance of interrelated strategic changes. We contribute to corporate governance research by developing a framework that synthesizes extant research on the relationships between different board governance variables and strategic change types, highlights important research gaps, and outlines several future research directions to address these gaps. Our framework and literature overview serve as analytical tools to examine whether boards are well-designed and prepared to govern multiple and interrelated strategic changes. (c) 2022 The Authors.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every boardroom in the world. However, neither the extant leadership literature nor the corporate governance literature offers succinct guidance on what constitutes effective board leadership during such a calamity. To address this theoretical and practical need, we develop a moderated mediation model, in which directive leadership from the board chair promotes competitive simplification at the onset of the crisis, which in turn promotes firm financial performance during the crisis. Using survey responses from 120 directors of U.S. public firms in Spring of 2020, combined with firm-level archival data from multiple sources and time periods, we find support for this mediated relationship--but only if the chair is not CEO. If the chair is CEO, we find no evidence of a positive relationship between directive leadership and either competitive simplification or firm financial performance; rather, we find some evidence of a negative relationship. We explore the implications of these findings for the theory and practice of corporate governance and crisis management. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of managerial myopia on information technology (IT) investment. Specifically, it aims to investigate the influence of chief information officer (CIO) compensation on IT investment and the moderating role of the board monitoring strength on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The study examines a sample of 194 firms listed on US stock exchanges with a CIO position in 2019. The authors employ hierarchical regression analysis to test the hypothesis. Findings: The results show that CIO compensation negatively influences IT investment. Further, even though vigilant board monitoring does not necessarily reduce such opportunistic behaviors, weak board monitoring creates an environment for such actions. Research limitations/implications: First, the cross-sectional data can limit the results' generalizability. Second, the sampling frame is not perfectly random as it consists of firms that have CIO compensation information in the ExecuComp for 2019. Third, we include only two measures of board monitoring strength. Practical implications: Board of directors should wisely select compensation packages' components since equity incentives potentially exacerbate managerial myopia. Moreover, firms may regulate CIOs' investment behaviors through board-level IT governance. Originality/value: This study is one of the few studies that utilize CIO sensitivity to measure CIO compensation. Moreover, by examining the factors affecting IT investment behavior, this study sheds light on CIO incentives' impact on IT investment behaviors. Finally, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate board monitoring's role in the relationship between CIO sensitivity and IT investment intensity.

This study investigates the effect of the Chair-CEO chronological age gap on the performance of commercial banks listed on the London Stock Exchange. We examine either the Chair-CEO generational gap (a minimum age gap of 20 years) or the Chair-CEO age difference (+/- or absolute). We find significant evidence for the hypothesis that the Chair-CEO age dissimilarity is likely to increase bank performance. Additional identification attempts include the use of the 2007-2009 financial crisis as an exogenous shock to monitoring needs. We find that during the crisis, the positive linkage between age difference and bank performance was more intensified. Copyright (c) 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Debates around sound corporate governance in the corporate world have a legal obligation to work on shareholders' dividend and cost-efficiency. The purpose of this study is to investigate the board size with interaction effect of boards' ancestry on shareholders' dividend. Furthermore, the study explores the interaction effect of educational diversity with board size on cost-efficiency. Data analysed in the current study were obtained from the financial reports of 77 firms listed in Karachi stock exchange from 2012 to 2019. A panel regression model based on fixed and random effects was employed on gathered data. Moreover, the moderating effect of board's ancestry and directors' education is investigated through hierarchical regression. Our findings contribute to the previous literature by investigating the impact of corporate governance on shareholder's wealth and cost-efficiency. In addition, the moderating effect of directors' ancestry and education is also examined. The results show that board size has a significant impact on the investor's wealth and cost-efficiency. The interaction effect supports the idea that directors' ancestry in board size enhances shareholders' dividend. Moreover, the board of directors' education also moderates cost-efficiency of firms. The results suggest that the corporate sector of Pakistan must promote the directors' ancestry in developing shareholders' interest. The policymakers must focus on the directors' education to enhance cost-efficiency of a firm to take care of the ultimate consumer. (c) 2022 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

Innovation is a key factor for firms' competitive advantage in the long-term and for their financial success. Scholars highlight the underinvestment problem with respect of R&D investment. This chapter focuses on two relevant variables of corporate governance that influence firms' innovation performance: firm ownership and board of directors. In the first section, the effect of ownership structure on R&D investment is analyzed. More specifically, the chapter will illustrate the effects of family ownership and institutional ownership on innovation investments. The second section explores the main theoretical perspectives investigating the functions of board of directors and the main board tasks. Lastly, three attributes of board structure and their effect on R&D investments are explored. (c) 2022 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

This chapter provides readers some theoretical connections between board busyness and stability of banks. As such, some knowledge about the busyness of the board of directors in the dual banking system (i.e., Islamic versus Conventional banks) will be discussed. This will be followed by the theoretical linkage between Shari'ah governance busyness and banking outcomes. Next, researchers and students will be introduced to some empirical evidence in this field, so that they can better visualise how the theoretical link between board busyness and bank outcomes was empirically examined in academics. Interestingly, this chapter provides researchers and students some good directions for endogeneity problems existing in corporate governance and board busyness research and some suggested methodology that could address such issues.

On the basis of the view that the board's evaluation of the CEO is determined by the board decision-making as a group, we adopt the faultline approach to analyze group dynamics in the board. Faultlines can split a board based on the alignment of multiple attributes of individual directors and potentially create subgroups within the board. In this study, we argue that different types of faultlines have distinct effects on board decision-making. Specifically, we predict that demographic faultlines can increase conflicts among directors, hampering the board's ability to decide on CEO dismissal when firm performance is below the aspiration level. On the other hand, information-based faultlines can facilitate exchange of diverse knowledge and elaboration of alternative perspectives, which can improve the board's ability to dismiss a CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level. Our analysis of S&P 500 boards supports our prediction that board faultlines based on demographic attributes of directors significantly reduce the board's ability to fire the CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level, whereas faultlines based on information-related attributes magnify the board's ability to dismiss a poor-performing CEO. By demonstrating different effects of faultlines based on heterogenous types of director attributes, this study contributes to the board faultline literature. We also contribute to CEO dismissal research by showing how group dynamics of boards moderates the relationship between firm performance and CEO dismissal. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

We analyze the impact of board of directors (BoD) tenure and audit committee (AC) tenure on environmental performance (EP) to test whether BoD and AC members' rotation generates higher environmental performance. Data were collected from the Refinitiv Eikon database, structuring a sample of European Union (EU) listed companies belonging to the "old" country members in the period from 2018 to 2020. We found that longer board tenure and longer audit committee tenure each enhance environmental performance, demonstrating that firms could view the tenure rate as a proxy of the quality of the board monitoring. On the contrary, the interaction term (BoD and AC tenure) is negatively related to environmental performance, showing that when two boards have a low rotation, companies may achieve lower environmental performance. These findings help understand the dynamic and complex nature of tenure in corporate governance mechanisms. (c) 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The present study examines the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance using a panel data sample of the top 73 EU nonfinancial sustainable firms across 13 countries from 2016 to 2020 based on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). We specifically examine the impact of structural (board independence) and demographical (age, gender, education, tenure and industry experience) board diversity on firm performance. Drawing on the agency and resource base perspective, the results indicate that firms with a diverse board of directors (structural and demographic) perform significantly better with firm performance. Additionally, when viewed through the lens of stakeholder theory, the findings indicate that environmental, social and governance disclosure (ESG) moderates and partially mediates the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance. We also performed robust checks to validate our results. Diversity contributes to a firm's understanding of its market and, as a result, its overall performance. The current study demonstrates a considerable gap between the theoretical and empirical support for various board indicators (structural and demographic), their relationship to performance, and how ESG acts as an intervening element in increasing firm financial performance.

We explore the extent to which board political connections shape the firm's disclosure behavior. We focus on the disclosure of non-GAAP earnings measures and argue that board political connections reduce the firm's propensity to report non-GAAP earnings through two mechanisms: the reduction in capital market pressure (insulating effect) and the concerns about public scrutiny (constraining effect). Our theory is tested and supported by an analysis of U.S.-listed firms in the period 2003-2019. We further exploit the variation in firms' media exposure to identify the primary mechanism underlying this disclosure strategy and find that the constraining effect plays a more important role than the insulating effect in driving the financial reporting behavior of politically connected firms.

Meta-analytic results show that board gender diversity is modestly associated with firm performance, but there is notable heterogeneity among findings. Board gender diversity allows access to women's perspectives, potentially helping boards, but diversity can also trigger biases that exclude women directors, such that boards do not integrate meaningful perspectives. Addressing this problem, we leverage the categorization-elaboration model, contact theory, and critical mass theory to build new theory as to how men directors can serve as allies to women directors to better leverage diverse perspectives. We empirically test how considerations that reduce out-group categorization and bias against women moderate the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. Our results show that gender diverse boards perform better with more formal contact among men and women director colleagues, and that gender diverse boards with more men directors who only have prior experience working with token-women, perform worse. Our work helps explain how and why board gender diversity can improve or detract from firm performance. This extends the literature by illustrating the important consequences that occur when firms do (or do not) have men directors who are likely to be allies of gender diversity.

For several decades, the boards of directors have been relatively homogeneous groups consisting of white old men (the so-called 'good-old boys'). This static and apparently immutable feature has been changed recently, as social movements and the evolution of corporate law and good governance codes promoted an increasing diversity in the boardroom. In parallel with the diffusion of more diverse boards, leadership and governance scholars have started to analyze the consequences of board diversity. Based on the idea that members' diversity increases group experiences and viewpoints, most scholars argued that higher board diversity positively affects board decisions and firm outcomes. However, despite the soundness of this perspective and the number of previous studies, the empirical evidence provides only partial, mixed and inconclusive findings. Building on these premises, we did a systematic and interdisciplinary literature review aimed at taking stock of our understanding of board diversity's antecedents and consequences. Our analysis and critical assessment of 184 studies synthesizes major results, identifies main gaps, and highlights important avenues for further research. Finally, we outline several ways to overcome current (theoretical and methodological) barriers and further advance research on board diversity. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Endowed with significant firm-specific knowledge, inside directors can contribute to the decision-making processes of the boardroom. However, regulatory changes, focusing primarily on the monitoring function of the boards, have driven inside directors out of the boardroom. This article argues that suppliers with firm- and industry-specific knowledge are uniquely positioned to fill a critical void in boardrooms. It also suggests that the value of having a supplier on the board (SOTB) is influenced by environmental contingencies faced by a firm: operational efficiency, diversification, and demand uncertainty. Using an objective measure of supplier presence in the boardroom, the authors find that a supplier's presence enhances firm performance. They also find that the value of an SOTB in enhancing performance is greater in firms with lower operational efficiency and higher demand uncertainty and, is lower in firms with higher diversification. These results are robust to potential endogeneity issues, alternative estimation methods, and measures of moderator and outcome variables. (c) 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.

This study examines boardroom connections that form when corporate executives sit on mutual fund boards. These connections have the potential to facilitate information flow that informs fund investment decisions. I find that fund trades in the executive's firm anticipate future earnings news and stock returns during the period that the fund and firm are connected. The evidence is consistent with a broad scope of information being transferred through the connections, implying the potential for these connections to have an economically significant impact. For example, trades in the executive's firm predict returns both inside and outside of the earnings announcement period, and trades in stocks in the same sector as the executive's firm also predict returns. This study highlights the potential for the role of fund directors to extend beyond their formal monitoring responsibilities and act as conduits of information.

Purpose: This study intends to test the relationship between banks' board diversity, detected with age and gender characteristics, and banks' social performance. The resource dependence theory posits that board diversity is a strategic tool able to enrich the board of directors by expanding skills and the number of links with stakeholders, which have a strategic role in achieving a competitive advantage and sustainable goals, especially in the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are tested using a sample of 46 European banks observed from 2009 to 2017. The gender and age diversity data of bank board members are hand-collected from banks' social reports. Findings: The empirical results show that bank social performance is positively influenced by board gender and age diversity. Thus, the human capital determined by a higher bank's board diversity constitutes an essential resource for adopting more sustainable business models. Originality/value: This paper analyses the association between board diversity and social performance, providing empirical evidence for the European banking sector in the period after the 2008 global financial crisis. The banking literature provides scarce evidence on the topic; however, the empirical results claim the strategic importance of the appointment of directors to the banks' boards to balance corporate strategy with social and environmental issues generating a positive impact on sustainable growth.

Recently, many firms that have caused direct pollution to the environment have begun to think about the necessity of environmental management. As buildings have played an important role in environmental issues, the real estate industry can no longer ignore demands for environmental management. Research on environmental management has mainly focused on its financial implications. However, there has been no consensus in the literature about the relationship between environmental management and firm performance. By comparing portfolios of environmentally certified properties of 19 lodging Real Estate Investment Trusts, this study explores the relationship between environmental management and firm performance, while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. The relationship between environmental management and firm performance appeared to have mixed results, but this study found a positive moderating effect of outside board of directors. This study provides new insights into the hospitality and the real estate literature from a corporate governance perspective. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between chair-chief executive officer (CEO) demographic dissimilarities and firm internationalization. Design/methodology/approach: The pooled ordinary least squares regression is used on a sample of listed firms in Malaysia from 2013 to 2017. This study considers three demographic dissimilarities between the chair and CEO, i.e. differences in age, educational background and nationality. Findings: The results reveal that demographic dissimilarities between the chair and CEO, notably differences in nationality, may result in conflicting cognitive styles, which in turn may impede the firms' ability to expand internationally, as compared to differences in age and educational background. The findings demonstrate the deleterious effects of demographic dissimilarity between these two individuals in the highest echelons on the firms' internationalization strategy due to poor communication and lack of ability to cooperate when dissatisfaction and conflicts intensify between these corporate elites. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this paper makes the first attempt to examine the influence of chair-CEO demographic dissimilarities on firm internationalization. Previous studies examining firms' internationalization strategy, for the most part, restricted their scope to either the board members or top management team characteristics, but had largely overlooked the nexus between nonexecutive and executive directors through the chair and CEO. A focus on the demographic dissimilarities between the co-leaders of the firm is essential to improve the understanding of the collaboration and rivalry between them, which may affect board effectiveness and firm internationalization.

Purpose: This study elaborates on the process through which gender-diverse boards of directors increase representation of females in management positions. This study draws on the gender spillover effect to examine whether gender diversity on boards of directors significantly influences the number of women promoted to managerial positions. The authors also employ implicit quota theory to examine the interaction effects of female board directors and their related strategies to target female customers as a source of female talent on the promotion numbers of female managers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw from female manager panel data surveyed and gathered by the Korean Women Development Institute (KWDI), a Korean government-sponsored research institution, for the period 2008-2014. The total sample, comprising 5 biannual waves, includes 906 Korean companies across four wage rates. The authors apply zero-inflated negative binomial regression analyses to examine the effects of gender diversity on board director positions and its interactions with strategies targeting female markets on the number of female managerial promotions. Findings: The authors find that gender diversity on boards of directors is positively related to the number of female managers promoted. Furthermore, in corporations where gender is not relevant to firms' strategy and decision-making, broader gender diversity increases the number of female managers promoted at lower- but not higher-level positions. Originality/value: The current study demonstrates the complex role of gender diversity in board director positions in initiating and promoting the career development of female managers. On the one hand, gender diversity in board director positions has spillover effects on women's representation in management positions. On the other hand, female board directors impede the career progress of senior female managers to maintain their status in quotas when the female market is not critical to firms' competitiveness. Therefore, it is crucial to integrate two different concepts about gender diversity--the gender spillover effect and implicit quota theory--that elaborate on the effects of gender diversity in board director positions on female manager promotion numbers.

Despite increasing attention to gender diversity on corporate boards, we have only limited understanding of what occurs within the boardroom when women are present. Prior empirical research has used various theories to infer how board gender diversity may influence firm outcomes, but without identifying the theoretical mechanisms underlying women directors' influence on the board. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with women and men who have collectively served as directors with over 200 publicly listed companies in the United States and Europe. While prior research has suggested that the diverse cognitive perspectives women directors bring influence board decision-making, our study reveals novel insights as to the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we contribute to the board gender diversity literature with the finding that women behave in ways contrary to existing board norms. By coming to board meetings highly prepared, being willing to acknowledge that they do not know something, asking questions, and getting things on the table, women impact the dialogue and interactions in the boardroom. Thus, our study sheds light on how the presence of women influences board dynamics, which has implications for corporate governance. Our findings also challenge prevailing gender theories as to how women are likely to behave, in that we do not find that women conform to gender stereotypes. Yet, we also find impediments to women directors' ability to gain influence, in that men directors may not always acknowledge them or afford them respect as equal board members.

SOX requires that the audit of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) is "integrated" with the audit of the financial reports, which means the same audit firm conducts these two audits. Prior studies found that audit costs and quality were lower for non-integrated audits in the Chinese context (Gunn et al. in Account Rev, 2021). This paper reports the association between firms' internal corporate governance mechanisms and the decision between integrated and non-integrated audits in Chinese companies. The empirical results demonstrate that firms with a larger proportion of controlling owners or those in which the same person is the BOD chairman and CEO, or those that are state-owned or have a smaller proportion of independent directors, are more likely to choose non-integrated audits than integrated audits. Our study implies that firms with weak internal corporate governance mechanisms choose non-integrated audits or switch to non-integrated ones if integrated audits are not mandatory. Our conclusions provided evidence that helps regulators understand the consequence of the regulation enforcement on public companies with different corporate governance models if these regulation compliance options are available.

Purpose: One of the most active areas of study in the field of corporate governance, board interlocks is a phenomenon that is both pervasive and perplexing. This paper aims to examine and integrate the empirical research on board interlocks to fill the void left by the lack of a recent review. Design/methodology/approach: The bibliometric analysis methodology, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, was used to analyze the board interlocks literature. Eighty publications published since 2000 were chosen as the subject of this research because they reveal the key contributions to the field of board interlocks. Additionally, their clustering pattern is also identified. Findings: The authors classify various studies conducted on board interlocks into three clusters: "Social Capitalization", "Antecedents and Outcomes" and "Corporate Governance". Originality/value: This literature review helps better comprehend the board interlocks literature by pointing out several areas of study that, if pursued, would add to the existing body of knowledge and open future research directions.

Purpose: This study aims to test whether the introduction of a gender quota impacts functioning of boards of directors and internal committees thanks to female capacity in effort norms, cognitive conflicts and use of skills. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a difference-in-differences method to trace the staggered mandatory adoption of gender quotas on boards on Italian listed firms, representing the regulative institution pillar of institutional theory. Findings: This paper find that mandatory adopter firms have more frequent internal committee meetings and less frequent board of directors' meetings after the introduction of the law. This confirms that the regulation re-prioritizes work in internal committees, thanks to women effort, capacity to resolution and use of skills. Originality/value: This research provides empirical evidence on female contribution and on the impact that a specific mandatory regulation, as regulative institutional pillar, can have on board organization, showing how gender characteristics influence board functioning in terms of meetings.

Research summary: Drawing on research about power and faultlines, we identify the subgroup of directors in the board who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup) and develop a concept of CEO subgroup power. We examine how CEO subgroup power affects the board's decision to dismiss the CEO, particularly when the firm experiences a performance decline. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we find that powerful CEO subgroups reduce the risk of CEO dismissal and that the negative effect of CEO subgroup power on CEO dismissal is magnified when the firm experiences a decline in performance. Managerial summary: Why do some boards fire the CEO when the firm is performing well, while others retain the CEO despite poor performance? We believe that looking into power dynamics among directors may help answer this question. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we investigate how the risk of CEO dismissal varies by the power of the subgroup within the board that consists of directors who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup). The results reveal that a powerful CEO subgroup can reduce the CEO dismissal risk and that this effect becomes stronger when the firm goes through a performance decline.

The board of directors' behavioral dynamics can strongly influence an entrepreneurial firm's success. Drawing on the behavioral theory of corporate governance, this study identifies and tests factors that facilitate behavioral integration in boards of high technology start-ups. We unpack the black box of board behavior with primary data collected from a survey-based sample of 149 CEOs of Norwegian high-tech start-ups supplemented by quantitative archival information. We find that intra-board behavioral integration (i.e., board members' propensity to clearly understand one another's issues and needs, actively solve, and share relevant information and resources) is positively affected by greater levels of informal communication between CEOs and board members. Next, we find that inter-board trust (i.e., board members interact with absolute integrity, tell the truth at meetings, trust one another, and keep mutual promises) mediates this relationship such that higher levels of inter-board trust result in greater concordance between information communication frequency and inter-board behavioral integration. We then examine the role of an efficacious board chair who motivates and uses each board member's competence, formulates proposals for decisions and summarizes conclusions after board negotiation, and chairs board discussions without promoting their agenda, finding that efficacious board chair leadership moderates the relationship between informal communication frequency and intra-board trust. We discuss the implications of these findings for the theory and practice. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

The goal of this study is to see how gender diversity on bank boards affects the value and profitability of the company. Financial institutions, both public and private, are examined in the study. Data from 28 Indian banks have been analysed for this study. Panel data analysis has been applied to data collected from 2012 to 2020. Private sector banks' stock values suffer when they have more than one woman on their board of directors; public sector banks' stock values benefit when this occurs. Our research demonstrates that ROA has a negative correlation with the gender diversity of boardrooms. We believe this is the first comparative study of its kind in the banking industry to focus on paper. It is recommended that policymakers increase the number of female board members so that they can serve as effective decision makers to improve the firm's performance.

How private firms can overcome their unique governance challenges remains an important but understudied topic. Using novel data on more than 28,000 private firms in India from 1988 to 2017, we examine whether private firms can improve their survival prospects by having board interlocks with public firms and, specifically, interlocks whereby a public firm director subsequently joins the private firm's board. In our data, we found a U-shaped relationship between the number of incoming board interlocks and the probability of private firm exit. We also found that board interlocks formed by public firm directors of public firms audited by Big Four companies improve private firms' survival more than other interlocks, consistent with the notion that such interlocks improve monitoring at private firms. Overall, our study points toward the importance of considering the role of incoming board interlocks when explaining private firm survival. (c) The Author(s) 2023.

Purpose: This study aims to contribute to the academic disciplines of entrepreneurship and management by developing a new theory that explains Founder-CEOs' succession in family and non-family firms. Many scholars failed to generate a specific theory to describe the succession of Founder-CEOs. Family firms remain complex enterprises comprising interconnectedness of cultural interests in which corporate governance occurs by families, Founder-CEOs and sometimes a board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This study's design/methodology/approach reflects post-modernist epistemological and ontological perspectives for conducting systematic literature reviews. To identify relevant studies in the review, the several databases (Australian Business Dean's Council Journal Quality List; EBSCO Database, including PsycINFO and Psych studies; Web of Science) and a mix of ranked journals from entrepreneurship, management and psychology were used. Findings: The findings and results in this paper reflect the purpose, methodology and literature analysis culminating in 1,582 peer-reviewed studies. A total of 182 peer-reviewed studies met the criterion for review. Throughout the research process, a systematic literature review uncovered management literature gaps overlooked for decades during the theory-building process. Hence, developing a theory of Founder-CEOs succession used a combination of systematic, inductive, comparative and interactive approaches. Originality/value: A Theory of Founder-CEOs Succession explains the strategic process of replacing a founder systematically. The promotion of, and incentives for, internal executives have been topics of great interest and deliberation among scholars and practitioners for a long time. This study contributes research implications for theory building in the academic disciplines of entrepreneurship and management by offering scholars and practitioners a theory that does not exist to describe Founder-CEOs' succession encompassing both strategic successes and failures. By incorporating successes and failures, this study provides realistic reflections of Founder-CEOs. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the thematic content of research addressing the relation between board of directors (BoD) and business transformation (BT) to obtain better understanding of status and to derive future areas of study. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews literature through a bibliometric analysis based on co-occurrence of articles published in Web of Science Core Collection (tm) (WoS) between 1990 and 2022, identifying key concepts, setting network of relations and identifying the strategic importance of clusters of concepts. Findings and implications are discussed, future lines of research are presented and limitations are noted. Findings: Thematic research on boards addressing transformation shifted from the analysis of individuals' traits to an organizational approach with majority of research centered on the role of boards under different theories and the consequences of strategic changes on firm's performance. Further research is around gender diversity, sustainability and the moderating role of ownership structure and business culture. Research limitations/implications: Some limitations are also noted. This analysis considered articles indexed by WoS for Q1+Q2 publications as source of literature, while including others such as Scopus would increase knowledge base. Also, to identify main streams of research, the authors considered keywords with cumulative occurrence spanning from 30% to 40% while increasing this percentage would add terms that might improve precision to the connections among keywords. Other techniques could have been used such as co-citation or bibliographic coupling, although the authors find these as better suited to investigate the basic structure behind the foundational knowledge of the topic while the authors' intention was to understand the positioning of study fields regarding the degree of research progress. Practical implications: This paper presents some practical implications for future researchers. Those who wish to leverage previous evidence to address new research questions might look into principal themes covering BoD dynamics and composition to exert CG, and the relation between strategic decisions and performance measured by different variables. Those who wish to position their research as new findings to shed light on dilemmas, might find opportunities in the fields of climate change-sustainability, R&D for growth and innovation under the perspective of intangible assets.

Purpose: Based on the agency and resource dependence theories, this study aims to investigate whether nomination committee (NC) characteristics could serve as key attributes for reducing environmental, social and governance (ESG) disputes and whether NC composition affects the appointment of ESG-friendly directors to the board. Design/methodology/approach: This study focuses on a sample of 30 global systemically important banks from 2015 to 2021. The authors estimate panel data models with fixed effects, clustering heteroskedastic standard errors at the bank level to account for the serial correlation of the dependent variables for each bank. Findings: Banks' exposure to ESG controversies can be reduced when NC members have specific skills, in particular when at least one member of this committee also belongs to the sustainability committee and is a foreign director. Moreover, banks' ESG disputes decrease when the NC members are younger, while the share of independent NC members has a negative impact. Finally, a positive influence of NC composition and its members' features as well as the appointment of ESG-friendly directors on the board is found. Originality/value: The findings are particularly useful during periods such as the current one, when there is growing attention to both banks' corporate governance, the subcommittees' role and functioning and social and environmental issues. This study shows that the NC is important in reducing the likelihood of banks incurring ESG disputes and in appointing more ESG-friendly directors. NC effective functioning and its members' qualities serve as a key attribute for fulfilling objective assessment and improving board effectiveness.

This study investigated the diversity of the BOD and explored its impact on corporate governance through quantitative empirical analysis. This study uniquely adopted Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporate Governance 100 Index (TWSE CG 100 Index) as the measurement of corporate governance performance. Five highly related indicators, i.e. gender, independence, education, legal, finance or accounting profession, and seniority to measure board diversity, which could be efficient variables on predicting the firms' likelihood being listed in the TWSE CG 100 Index, were used as independent variables. The results showed that board independence and the seniority of directors have a positive impact on corporate governance. This study made several important contributions. First, this study shed light on the conflicting evidence on the relationship between board diversity and firm corporate governance performance for the Taiwan economy. Second, this paper uniquely adopted TWSE CG 100 Index, and the findings can contribute to giving investors predictions about the quality of corporate governance and can serve as an incentive for corporates to enhance superior corporate governance. Furthermore, this study can contribute to practice by providing optimization suggestions for BOD composition and nomination. At last, this paper demonstrated policy justifications and implications for Taiwan government. (c) 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Research Question/Issue: Information processing, agency, and resource dependence perspectives provide diverging predictions regarding the relationship between board interlocks and firm performance, which are rooted in different perspectives on the roles of boards of directors. This study argues that these various approaches are reconcilable when considering the nature of board committees to which the interlocked directors are assigned. Research Findings/Insights: We test our hypotheses on a sample of 5133 firm-year observations in India. Our analyses support our hypotheses. The results show that interlocks between audit committees, whose primary function relates to providing financial oversight and ensuring compliance, are negatively related to firm performance. In contrast, interlocks between nomination and remuneration committees of Indian firms, which provide them with access to resources such as human capital and information on appropriate incentive structures, are positively related to performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study clarifies the relationship between board committee interlocks and firm performance by taking a multi-theoretical perspective. Our analysis suggests that information processing, agency, and resource dependence theories complement one another in explaining the effect of interlocks on firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that it is not board interlocks per se that are detrimental to firm performance; in fact, appointing well-connected directors with experience in serving on other boards might be beneficial for firms. However, firms should not assign specific monitoring-intensive tasks such as auditing to directors who also serve on other firms' audit committees. Our findings suggest that these directors should have greater independence and focus. (c) 2023 The Authors. Corporate Governance: An International Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose: Are board ties among competitors harmful to customers? The prevalent assumption on board ties among competitors is that they harm customer benefits. This study examines the mechanism by which board ties with competitors result in an outcome conducive to customers. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 79 savings banks in South Korea, we investigate the extent of banks' board ties with other banks and their engagement in a project financing (PF) consortium from 2014 to 2020. The generalised least square was adopted to test the hypotheses. We also performed several supplemental analyses to further support our results. Findings/results: Savings banks with greater board ties with rivals provided more financial opportunities to their customers by forming PF consortia more actively with other banks. Furthermore, the positive impact of board ties on banks' participation in a PF consortium increases, especially when the proportion of external shareholders is smaller or when savings banks are family firms. Practical implications: Outside directors can not only play the role of monitoring the management but also serve as assistants who can help banks provide financial services (or products) that banks could not provide individually. Originality/value: While prior studies have clearly recognised the negative impacts on customers of board-friendship ties among rivals, little attention has been paid to the potential mechanism by which board ties among competing firms can benefit customers. This study challenges the dominant assumption by demonstrating that savings banks with greater board ties with other banks provide more financial opportunities to their economically weak customers. Contribution: Finally, this study contributes to the family business literature by providing insight into how the unique characteristics of family firms in strategic choices make outside directors contribute as assistants than supervisors.

Purpose: Considering corporate governance (CG hereinafter) practices' variety across Anglo-American and European countries, this study relies on contingency and complexity theories to investigate the effect of environmental sustainability performance (ESP hereinafter) on shareholder value under various configurations of board of directors (BoD hereinafter), firm and country characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The author used the Thomson Reuters Environment Pillar Score (ASSET4) and the Total Shareholder Return to assess ESP and shareholder value respectively. The author applied a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA hereinafter) to an unbalanced panel of 2,284 observations from 486 European and Anglo-American non-financial listed firms over the period 2016-2020. Findings: The author found a positive association between ESP and shareholder value and he displayed notable differences between Anglo-American and European economies regarding causal predictors of this positive association. Within European firms operating under civil law code where investor protection is low and family ownership is widespread, ESP creates shareholder value under configurations of causal predictors that significantly differ from those of their Anglo-American peers. The author's findings are robust to different identification strategies. Practical implications: This study assists researchers, practitioners, shareholders and policymakers the significant roles that BoD diversity, organisational and institutional traits are jointly playing as determinants of the ESP-shareholder value relationship. Originality/value: The author's study offers a more encompassing, complete and theoretically richer picture of the key drivers and outcomes of ESP. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research Question/Issue: We approach the ongoing debate in the literature on when and why a female leadership advantage exists in the context of China. In particular, we examine whether female CEOs outperform male CEOs in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Research Findings/Insights: We show that a female leadership advantage exists in SOEs. We find that the female leadership increased performance is attributed to improved profitability, capital structure, and operating efficiency. The magnitude of this gender effect is bigger in central state-owned enterprises (CSOEs) than that in local state-owned enterprises (LSOEs). The results are robust to additional tests that mitigate the sample selection and other endogeneity concerns. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We use the role congruity theory to motivate and develop the hypotheses drawing insights upon the literature in psychology and leadership. Female CEOs are perceived as less congruent with their leadership roles given the gender role stereotypes. Thus, they face more challenges and difficulties than male CEOs. These obstacles take at least two forms which are significant in SOEs: shareholder activism and sex discrimination. Female CEOs have to outperform their male counterparts to alleviate the pressure from shareholder activism and showcase their managerial skills and abilities. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For the state shareholders, the extra scrutiny in selecting female CEOs should be lifted given this outperformance. The evidence is also relevant for CEOs to choose their career paths among different types of firms, for boards of directors on their strategic decisions on CEO hiring, and for policy makers to promote the female leadership advantage.

This paper contributes empirically to the debate on who should nominate new directors: shareholders or the board? While nomination committees composed of incumbent board members are common around the world, the use of nomination committees composed of shareholders (SNBs) is recommended in several Nordic countries. We use the unique case of Finland as a quasi-experiment to examine the relation between the type of nomination procedure and board turnover. We find that firms with SNBs have boards with shorter average tenure, and fewer long-serving directors. We also find evidence suggesting a higher turnover performance sensitivity in the case of SNB firms: the average board tenure is more strongly related to firm performance in the case of SNB firms, and the relation between board tenure and the presence of experienced directors is more related to performance in SNB firms. In all, our results support the claim that SNBs might be useful tools to turn around board structures and tie individual director's performance to company performance.

Boards of directors have been the subject of extensive conceptualization and empirical research. We review literature addressing boards of directors from the perspective of the control, service, and resource dependence roles that directors are hypothesized to fulfill, with particular focus on that research reported after the Zahra and Pearce (1989) compendium. We also discuss a number of methodological and conceptual elements which complicate the aggregation of research in this area of inquiry. (c) 1996 JAI Press Inc.

We investigate the role that a voluntary corporate restructuring can play in the design of efficient internal corporate control mechanisms. To this end, we examine the post-restructuring internal control practices in 78 voluntary corporate spin-offs that were completed between 1972 and 1987. We find that the selection of the new CEOs, the design of their compensation contracts, and the staffing of the boards of directors and their compensation committees in the spun-off firms can be seen as ex ante efficient. These governance and control practices, however, are not strongly related to the observed positive market reactions to the spin-off announcements. The results indicate that equity reorganizations facilitate the implementation of efficient internal governance and control practices, but that other factors must influence the share price reactions to the announcement of such voluntary corporate restructurings.

Incentive or performance contingent compensation plans are rapidly becoming the norm in corporate America, as boards of directors attempt to make executives more accountable to shareholders. However, incentive plans also expose executives to risk, and may also impart a short-term bias on their decision-making processes. This article suggests that the tension between the pressures for accountability and long-term decision making can be managed by aligning firm strategy with an incentive plan that is based on an appropriate performance criteria.

This paper examines CEO compensation, with an emphasis on the power of CEOs to influence their own compensation by managing the compensation process. It analyzes the CEO's power over the board of directors and the political tactics used by the CEO to manage the board and its compensation decisions. An empirical examination of CEO compensation in 203 large American manufacturing firms in 1985 illustrates the effect of CEO power on compensation and the flexibility available to the CEO in establishing the legitimacy of compensation. The implications of this perspective for management control of corporations and for CEO compensation research are considered. (c) 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Although a host of theory-driven rationales suggest a relationship between board of directors size and firm performance, the literature provides no consensus about the direction of that relationship. A meta-analysis of 131 samples (N = 20,620) provided systematic evidence of nonzero, positive, true population estimates of board size-performance relationships.

In this demonstration article, the authors explain procedures for combining the richness of detail that is characteristic of qualitative data collection with the hypothesis testing advantage of statistical inference techniques. Qualitative data came from a 5-year participant observation study of a corporate board of directors. Quantification of the participant observer's qualitative field notes was achieved by using content analysis to code directors ' verbal behaviors. Based on counts of directors'verbal behaviors, the authors tested illustrative hypotheses concerning group process within the board. Univariate (Cox-Stuart's test of trend), bivariate (Kendall's nonparametric correlation), and multivariate (log Poisson regression with post hoc contrasts) analyses were conducted. The study's use of qualitative and quantitative information promoted both "discovery" (i.e., theory development) and "justification" (i.e., theory evaluation) and facilitated a "discovery-justification-discovery cycle" that was particularly useful for understanding group processes with the corporate board.

This paper examines the impact of the entry and exit of board of directors on the share price of United Kingdom listed firms. Unlike previous studies in the area, this study distinguishes between the different type of board changes. The results of the study suggest that changes in the composition of management boards affect shareholders wealth. Small but significant positive abnormal returns are experienced on the day of the announcement. The results also indicate that the informational effects of new appointments are perceived differently by the market from resignations from the management board.

The coefficient of variation (V) is a statistical measure commonly used for comparing diversity in work groups. It has been employed by organizational researchers to index the relative internal variability of top-management teams, task groups, boards of directors, departments, and other social aggregates on numerous dimensions. Commenting on its widespread application, this article reviews cautions and pitfalls associated with its use for this purpose. Research implications associated with using V are also discussed.

Using both agency and institutional theories, we examined factors associated with the board's adoption of a formal process for evaluating the performance of the corporation's chief executive officer (CEO). Our sample was drawn from the hospital industry. Results show that an independent board chairperson, the level of market competition and the degree of managed care penetration were significant predictors of whether or not the board had adopted a formal CEO evaluation process. These findings imply that initiatives to improve governance effectiveness based on agency theory should take into account the institutional environment of corporate boards.

Utilizing Rest's moral development and Victor and Cullen's ethical climate surveys, we examine differences in moral reasoning and ethical climate between board members in the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors. Six for-profit corporations and seven not-for-profit corporations, all with base operations in a major midwestern state, participated in the study. We find that profit and not-for-profit boards may not differ in moral reasoning, but do exhibit different types of ethical climates. We also find that for-profit board members may utilize higher stages of reasoning a greater percentage of the time than not-for-profit directors. In contrast, the ethical climates of the two types of organizations are significantly different. For-profit companies had climates higher in egoism than did not-for-profit companies. In addition, not-for-profit firms reflected higher benevolence factors than for-profit firms. Not-for-profit organizations also had somewhat higher, but not significantly different, mean scores on the principle factor compared to the for-profit organizations.

Because shark repellents decrease the vulnerability of firms (and their incumbent managers) to the market for corporate control, the decision to adopt these devices represents an excellent test of agency theory. In this empirical study, we examined the relationships between the adoption of shark repellents and several mechanisms that, according to agency theory, should align the interests of corporate board members and shareholders and/or make directors more effective monitors of management behaviour. Of the variables included, only board stock ownership (especially by employee directors) was linked to a reduced propensity to adopt shark repellents in the predicted manner. Two variables not immediately associated with agency theory - the proportion of inside directors appointed by the incumbent chief executive officer (CEO) and a lower ratio of CEO compensation to the compensation of other top executives - were linked to higher rates of shark repellent adoption. Given that agency theory explains relatively little of the variance in shark repellent adoption, we advocate serious consideration of other theoretical formulations for corporate governance, including two approaches -stewardship theory and agent morality - that take the moral ('other regarding') obligations of directors seriously.

This article studies which of the directors of the largest corporations in Israel were invited to sit on additional boards of directors between the years 1974 and 1988. The article compares organizational affiliations, and the human and social capital of directors who accumulate directorships with those who do not. The study uses logistic regression to discern which variables increase the likelihood of being invited on to an additional board. The findings strongly support the hypothesis that it is a combination of the structure of the national economy and human and social capital of the directors which determines who will join additional boards.

This paper analyses and describes the possible role and responsibility of workers (via their representatives) in the process of strategic decision-making at corporate level, especially in the Netherlands where the Works Council (Ondernemingsraad) has achieved a certain degree of maturity in the last decade. It is a reaction to the lack of attention to workers' participation in the actual debate on Corporate Governance. From our point of view workers also have to be seen as equal 'stakeholders' and partners in decision-making. In several Dutch companies forms of partnership in corporate governance are starting to develop. But also in other countries (like Germany) and at European level Works Councils are starting to discuss strategic topics with the Board of Directors. After describing the position and role of the most important boards and stakeholders at corporate level (the Board of Directors, the Supervisory Board, the shareholders, the trade unions and the works councils), the paper presents a stakeholder model in which also the workers participate and exercise influence on strategic decision-making. Finally it gives practical suggestions for the improvement of the position of workers' participation in corporate governance. These suggestions and recommandations are mainly based on experiences in Dutch companies.

This study investigates the influence of growth potential on corporate governance mechanisms. Results suggest that firms with high growth potential make greater use of managerial equity ownership and long term incentives and have higher proportions of insiders on their boards of directors. The findings are congruent with the argument that firms with high growth potential make use of more flexible, future-oriented mechanisms of corporate governance.

Prior research has investigated determinants of CEO compensation. However, that research has been primarily limited to large firms. This study investigates the impact of CEO influence over the board of directors on CEO pay for both large and small firms. Additionally, other determinants of CEO pay for both large and small firms are examined. Results suggest that CEO influence over the board significantly affects CEO pay for large firms. However, we do not find the same evidence for small firms. Firm size is the primary factor of CEO pay for small firms. Evidence in this study suggests that CEO pay of large firms is mostly a function of CEO influence over the board, firm size, and firm performance. (c) MCB UP Limited 2000.

Managing the succession process by the hiring and firing of key executives is one of the important functions of a board of directors. In this research we study successions of fund managers in the closed-end mutual fund industry. The agency issues inherent in closed-end mutual funds makes them a unique laboratory for such a study. Our results suggest that while the overall abnormal returns of these manager changes are statistically insignificant, that the returns are more positive for funds with large expense ratios and for funds trading at a discount. We also find the abnormal returns are negatively related to the percentage of inside director stock ownership. Corporate bond funds and international equity funds react more negatively to these announcements than other types of funds. The abnormal returns do not appear to be related to board composition, but board composition does vary across fund type, and may therefore indirectly influence the results.

While boards of directors are usually recognized as having the potential to affect strategic change in organizations, there is considerable debate as to whether such potential is typically realized. We seek to reconcile the debate on whether boards are typically passive vs. active players in the strategy realm by developing a model that specifies when boards are likely to influence organizational strategy and whether such an influence is likely to impel vs. impede change. Specifically, we develop arguments as to when certain demographic and processual features of boards imply a greater inclination for strategic change, when these features imply a greater preference for the status quo, and how differences in such inclinations will influence strategic change. We then also propose that a board's inclination for strategic change interacts with a board's power to affect change, generating a multiplicative effect on strategic change. These ideas are tested using survey and archival data from a national sample of over 3000 hospitals. The supportive findings suggest that strategic change is significantly affected by board demography and board processes, and that these governance effects manifest themselves most strongly in situations where boards are more powerful. We discuss these findings in terms of their relevance for theories of demography, agency, and power. Copyrighi (c) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The corporatization reform in Chinese SOEs has been largely influenced by the Anglo-American corporate governance model, but at issues is whether or not this model suits China's current institutional and cultural contexts. Agency theory and stewardship theory are two corporate governance theories that provide conflicting assumptions about human behavior and different prescriptions about governance mechanisms. In this study we drew upon both theories and developed competing hypotheses about the relationships between board composition, leadership structure, and organizational performance in Chinese shareholding companies. We gave special attention to China's unique institutional context and its influence on board attributes. The hypotheses were tested with a sample of Chinese listed companies. Overall, the stewardship hypotheses received stronger empirical support. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

While many aspects of stock and option based compensation for corporate officers remain controversial, we suggest that the growing trend for similar practices in favor of boards of directors will prove to be even more contentious. High-ranking corporate managers do not set their own salaries nor authorize their own stock options. By contrast, boards of directors do, in fact, set their own compensation packages. Other potential conflicts of interest include setting option performance targets, stock buybacks, stock option resets and reloads, consolidations (mergers and acquisitions), and service on multiple boards. As trust is the most valuable commodity in a capitalist society, we suggest that these potential conflicts of interest and related outcomes may ultimately serve to erode any anticipated benefits of director stock compensation.

Research on inter-organisational networks reflects their acknowledged and growing importance. Strategy research, however, is only beginning to investigate the nature of networks and how network participation can affect organisational performance. Networks embody a relational viewof the organisation and their study draws attention to the mechanisms by which relationships are secured and managed. Board of directors interlocks are a principal traditional indicator of network ties, yet little has been written on the role of interlocks in different types of networks and their potential effects on performance.We develop a typology of inter-organisational networks based on the key dimensions of organisational interdependence and network durability; a 'micro-typology' of embedded networks in East Asia based on formalisation of ties and networking scope; suggest that key aspects of directors' roles differ based on the type of network in which they are engaged; and develop specific propositions for further investigation.

Accounting, auditing, and tax professionals constantly evaluate the integrity, competence, and financial performance of clients as factors in practice that influence both client acceptance decisions and the manner in which professional services are rendered. Yet, from an accounting perspective, previous research investigating the corporate board of directors as a governance mechanism has focused only on the representational role of board members. Moreover, many of these studies resulted in conflicting findings according to these attributes. Other disciplines address the particular influence of the board with respect to overall corporate performance, but arrive at little agreement on either the effect of or the most critical of board attributes. This literature review synthesizes the existing research to provide a framework in which to evaluate the effect of the board of directors in accounting settings and, in particular, when conducting future research that employs elements of corporate governance as dependent or independent variables in accounting studies.

In this article we investigated the degree to which nonprofit organizations have developed succession plans and to what degree there is room at the top for insiders to succeed incumbents. Twelve nonprofit community-based organizations (CBOs) within a major urban center in the northeastern portion of the USA served as our sample. CEOs responded to a questionnaire and were interviewed to collect personal and organizational data. Findings included that most of the organizations did not have succession plans; boards of directors, not incumbent CEOs, appointed successors, except in the case of founders; and despite the fact that insiders are provided with leadership training, they are often not promoted to the position of CEO. Implication for leadership and organization development and recommendations for future research are made. (c) 2001, MCB UP Limited

Examining the relationship between governance and corporate innovation strategies, we found, in opposition to the assumption that owners have a unified voice, differences among governance constituencies' preferences for corporate innovation strategies. The managers of public pension funds preferred internal innovation, but professional investment funds' managers preferred acquiring external innovation. The profiles of boards of directors also shaped these innovation strategies. Inside directors with equity emphasized internal innovation, and outside directors with equity emphasized external innovation. The two types of fund manager equally preferred boards composed of outsider representatives with equity. However, pension fund managers preferred inside directors with equity more strongly than did professional investment fund owners.

This article examines the compensation of top managers of nonprofits in the United States using panel data from tax returns of the organizations from 1992 to 1996. Studying managers in nonprofits is particularly interesting given the difficulty in measuring performance. The article examines many areas commonly studied in the executive pay (within for-profit firms) literature. It explores pay differences between for-profit and nonprofit firms, pay variability within and across nonprofit industries, managerial pay and performance (including organization size and fund raising) in nonprofits, the effect of government grants on managerial pay, and the relationship between boards of directors and managerial pay in nonprofits.

Although scholars have studied outside executive succession for decades, there is still no clear definition of the term "outsider". We focus on a new dimension of outsiderness, the industrial background of executives hired from outside the firm into a CEO position. This paper examines the antecedents of boards' decisions on the industry origin of outside successors as well as the short-term stock market response. We find that firms with more independent boards and with blockholders owning large amounts of stock are more likely to hire industry unrelated successors. However, the board's decision does not strictly follow the rhetoric of stockholder's interests. The stock market reacts more positively to outside CEO succession announcements when the CEO comes from an industry related firm. These findings support our theoretical arguments that the boards of directors may use a logic or rule of appropriateness in deciding the industrial origin of outside successors.

One of the primary responsibilities of a board of directors is to assess management practices and to make sure that the organization is being run in a fashion that is consistent with the interests of shareholders. This responsibility becomes especially important when the firm is performing suboptimally. The current paper integrates corporate governance theory with attribution theory to examine the processes by which board members attribute poor firm performance to either external or internal causes. A framework is presented that suggests that inside directors and outside directors differ significantly in the constraints they face and in the ultimate attributions they make. Facing primarily social constraints, such as loyalty to the CEO and fear of retaliation, inside directors are more likely to consistently attribute poor performance to industry or environmental factors, as opposed to top management. Facing primarily cognitive constraints, outside directors will use specific informational cues to attribute poor performance either to industry/environmental factors or to top management. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided. (c) 2002, MCB UP Limited

In many respects, Australian boards more closely approach normative "best practice" guidelines for corporate governance than boards in other Western countries. Do Australian firms then demonstrate a board demographic-organisational performance link that has not been found in other economies? We examine the relationships between board demographics and corporate performance in 348 of Australia's largest publicly listed companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. We find that, after controlling for firm size, board size is positively correlated with firm value. We also find a positive relationship between the proportion of inside directors and the market-based measure of firm performance. We discuss the implications of these findings and compare our findings to prevailing research in the US and the UK.

White-collar crime can cost a company from 1 percent to 6 percent of annual sales, yet little is known about the organizational conditions that can reduce this cost. Previous governance research has examined the link between block holders, boards of directors, or CEO compensation and fraud. In this study, these traditional measures of governance are found to have little impact. Instead, operational governance, including clarity of policies and procedures, formal cross-company communication, and performance-based pay for the board and for more employees, significantly reduces the likelihood of a crime commission.

Hostile takeover attempts oftentimes signal that a target firm has an over-diversified and ineffective corporate strategy. What does this signal mean when takeover attempts fail? Drawing from agency theory, we argue that target firms managed by independent directory boards are likely to ignore the takeover attempt and not refocus their firms' strategy. Conversely, target firms managed by nonindependent boards are more likely to view the failed takeover attempt as a 'wake-up call' and will refocus their firms' strategy so as to preserve the firm's survival. These arguments are tested using a sample of 76 firms that were targets of failed hostile takeover attempts. Logistic regression analyses confirm the predictions. This study suggests that in the aftermath of a failed takeover attempt board of director characteristics can help predict changes in corporate strategies.

Board configuration is discussed in the context of the perceived needs of the board as a strategic resource of the organization. This is highlighted in the context of the differing governance, performance and social requirements of organizations pertaining to private sector, state and local government ownership structures. Examined is the view that in bringing particular perspectives resulting from their professional, ethnic or gender backgrounds, directors contribute to board effectiveness. This notion is evaluated in terms of directors' coping devices and their perceptions of their ability to be heard on the board. Initiatives that boards may use to ensure the success of such appointments are highlighted. Consideration is also given to enhancing the dynamics of established but dysfunctional appointments. In concluding, the paper develops criteria for success in making board appointments where the prospective appointee is a minority in terms of professional discipline or other forms of diversity.

This paper examines two recent trends relative to boards of directors' compensation, and their potential incompatibility. There has been some progress in increasing board diversity, specifically the inclusion of women and minorities on boards. The increasing trend requiring directors to hold/purchase equity as a requirement of board membership may seriously compromise further improvements in diversifying boards. Also, an increasing number of companies compensate directors partially or fully in stock grants and options. These compensation policies may be exclusionary, especially for women and minorities, impacting the quality of boardroom discussions and decisions. This study systematically examines whether corporations requiring director equity are exclusionary toward women and minority directors. Contrary to being exclusionary, companies with director stock requirements and annual stock awards have greater representation by women and minorities on their board. Moreover, larger companies are both more likely to have such policies and have higher proportions of women and minorities on the board.

Most of studies on corporate governance are based on the Anglo-Saxon view. However in France the majority of the top managers graduate from Ena and Polytechnic. Belonging to one or the other of these two clans, with the underlying link to the civil service, can have serious repercussions on the system of corporate governance. The clan tries to increase their power in the firms. In order to do this, it needs to control firms' leaders, but also the board of directors. The control of the board allows the system to master all shareholders' objections. It is also a means to widen its influence. This study proposes an analysis of the links between the characteristics of leaders and boards as well as the consequences of this control of the clan on the performance of the firm.

This article examines the mechanisms underlying the worldwide diffusion of organizational practices. We suggest that the two main theoretical explanations in the diffusion literature, efficiency and legitimation, can be complementary. More specifically, we argue that endogenous forces seek to enhance the efficiency of existing systems, while exogenous forces seek to increase legitimation. To assess our argument, we explore the worldwide diffusion of codes of good governance. These codes are a set of 'best practice' recommendations regarding the behavior and structure of a firm's board of directors issued to compensate for deficiencies in a country's corporate governance system regarding the protection of shareholders' rights. We have collected data on codes of good governance for 49 countries. We operationalize efficiency needs in terms of the characteristics of shareholder protection, and legitimation pressures in terms of government liberalization, economic openness, and presence of foreign institutional investors. Our analysis supports the argument that both efficiency needs and legitimation pressures lead to code adoption. In addition, our empirical results show that countries with legal systems with strong shareholder protection rights tend to be more prone to develop codes, possibly for efficiency reasons. This article contributes to organization theory by illustrating that the diffusion of codes fosters both cross-national corporate governance convergence as well as some degree of country hybridization, particularly depending on the type of code issuer.

This study combines elements of the upper echelons and agency perspectives to resolve some of the ambiguity surrounding how corporate elites affect corporate strategy. We propose and test the notion that while differences in individual characteristics of corporate elites may imply different preferences for particular corporate strategies such as diversification and acquisitions, these basic preferences, when situated in different agency contexts (e.g., CEO, outsider director, non-CEO top management team member), generate very different strategic outcomes. Our detailed empirical findings, based on extensive longitudinal governance and corporate strategy data from large U.S. corporations, also highlight the pitfalls of using aggregate units of analysis (e.g., board of directors or top management team) when studying the influence of corporate elites on corporate strategy.

The role of the board of directors in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. However, research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies: the lack of an overarching theoretical perspective, reliance on proxies for the strategy role rather than a direct measure of it and the lack of quantitative data linking this role to firm financial performance. We propose a new theoretical perspective to explain the board's role in strategy, integrating organisational control and agency theories. We categorise a board's approach to strategy according to two constructs: strategic control and financial control. The extent to which either construct is favoured depends on contextual factors such as board power, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry.

Pressure on boards to improve corporate performance and management oversight has led to a series of inquiries and reports advocating governance reform. These reports largely reflect an agency perspective of governance and seek to ensure greater board independence from and control of management. While board independence is important to good governance, we contend that frameworks, models and advice centred on one element of governance ignore the complexity of how boards work. We develop a holistic board framework based upon the concept of board intellectual capital to address this concern. Our framework proposes a series of inputs (e.g. company history, company constitution, legal environment) that lead to a particular mix of board intellectual capital. We contend that the balance of the different elements of board intellectual capital will lead to a series of board behaviours. Further, the board needs to mobilise its intellectual capital to carry out a series of roles. The exact nature of these roles will depend on the company's requirements. Thus, the governance outputs of organisational performance, board effectiveness and director effectiveness will depend on the match between the board's intellectual capital and the roles required of it. We conclude by demonstrating the benefits of this framework as a diagnostic tool. We outline how boards wishing to improve their governance systems can diagnose common governance problems by evaluating their own board's capabilities in relation to the different components of the framework.

To date, corporate governance research agendas have tended to concentrate on one particular role that a board performs. For instance, agency theory concentrates on the monitoring role, resource dependence theory concentrates on the board providing access to resources and stewardship theory concentrates on the board's advice-giving or strategic role. While these approaches provide practitioners with useful guidelines regarding issues such as board independence, we contend that practitioners need to take care not to act on the recommendations from a single theory in isolation from the others. To address this concern, we provide a model of board effectiveness that uses the construct of board intellectual capital to integrate the predominant theories of corporate governance and illustrate how the board can drive corporate performance. We further contend that boards that wish to improve their performance need to review their intellectual capital. We conclude by linking the model to a practitioner-focused framework that identifies four key areas on which a board must concentrate to develop its intellectual capital.

This paper advances the resource dependence and social networks literature by investigating a board's structural social capital created as a consequence of interlocking directorates. Using approaches and measures developed by social network analysis we compare the interpersonal directorship networks of the top 250 companies in the United States and Australia. We find that the smaller, sparser Australian network is only marginally less compact and connected than the larger US network at the firm level of analysis. However, at the director level of analysis the US network is much larger and more connected than its Australian counterpart. As a result, we argue that scholars studying the resource dependence role of boards should consider using measures of interpersonal links as well as traditional measures of inter-firm links. Understanding how boards impact on corporate performance is a question central to the corporate governance research agenda. Agency theory, for example, argues that the key way a board adds value is by ensuring the interests of the managers of the firm are aligned with the interests of the owners (Eisenhardt 1989; Jensen & Meckling 1976). A quite distinct area of inquiry, however, relates to the role that the board plays in providing access to important resources such as customers (Pennings 1980), capital (Mizruchi & Stearns 1988), the business elite (Uscem 1984) and power in general (Pfeffer & Salancik 1978). We aim to broaden understanding of the resource dependence theory of corporate governance by examining the links provided to a board by interlocking directorships. We commence by reviewing existing research on the resource dependence role of the board before outlining how the emerging construct of social capital can be adapted and applied to investigate this role. In particular, we highlight how it is the personal director network that is critical to the development of social capital rather than the corporate network (i.e. network of corporations). While this study is primarily exploratory and descriptive, we contribute to the literature by employing a new methodology to measure the 'opportunity network' that interlocking directorates provide a board within a national corporate governance system (Adams 2002a; 2002b; 2002c). We show how the formal models, procedures and techniques developed in social network analysis can be applied to individual-level networks among directors. We stress that we are not considering the formation of social capital at the individual level; rather we are examining the systemic connections of individual directors in order to illustrate the opportunity network available to a board within the national corporate governance system. A comparison of the Australian and US systems highlights the divergence in network attributes between corporate networks and the networks of interlocking directors. We conclude with implications and areas for further research.

Greater use of qualitative research methods - including observing boards in real time and interviewing directors - needs to occur to advance the field. Quantitative researchers are, it would seem, measuring variables in respect of "structural independence," rather than board and individual director effectiveness, per se. Once "board effectiveness" and "director effectiveness" variables are able to be measured, together with their interaction, a greater likelihood of distilling a more definitive relationship between corporate governance and corporate financial performance may occur.

This study extends earlier research suggesting that board network ties may reflect the strategic and/or political concerns of top managers by considering how the managerial objectives that drive the formation and maintenance of board interlock ties may be subject to social influence. The particular form of social influence examined in this study derives from the social network research process itself. Specifically, we draw from research on social information processing and the framing of information to suggest how the administration of social network surveys can influence managers' perceptions about their relationship to directors and the potential benefits to be derived from director network ties, thus affecting their subsequent selection of board members in ways that change the firm's board interlock ties.We also consider how this social influence effect may diffuse beyond the actual survey respondents to create a more pervasive influence on the actions of managers at other firms in the board interlock network. We test our theoretical argument with an original quasiexperiment in which CEOs are randomly assigned to different versions of a survey questionnaire that have the potential to prime different schemata about the possible benefits to be derived from board network ties. Beyond addressing the potential for social influence in the formation and maintenance of board network ties, our study also addresses the potential for unintended reactive measurement effects in social network research, wherein network surveys influence the very ties that they are designed to measure.

This research examines one explanation for why replacing the chief executive officer does not seem to improve firm performance despite its positive effect on financial markets: some new chief executive officers (CEOs) are able to negotiate favorable agency contracts, and therefore protect their positions, at the expense of performance that would benefit shareholders. In a longitudinal study of 150 publicly-traded firms in the United States, we found that the governance systems that align the CEO's and owners' interests, the mechanisms by which compliance with the agency contract is monitored, and the firm's strategies and performance differed as a function of ownership concentration. In firms with dispersed ownership, new CEOs initiated changes favorable to them in the composition of the board of directors and in the level of and risk associated with their compensation. We also explore reasons for the differing patterns of institutionalized power resulting from the agency contract.

This paper examines board effectiveness through an examination of the work and relationships of non-executive directors. It is based on 40 in-depth interviews with company directors, commissioned for the Higgs Review. The paper observes that research on corporate governance lacks understanding of the behavioural processes and effects of boards of directors. Whilst board structure, composition and independence condition board effectiveness it is the actual conduct of the non-executive vis-a-vis the executive that determines board effectiveness. Data about behaviour and relationships on boards suggest that traditional theoretical divisions between agency and stewardship theory, and control versus collaboration models of the board do not adequately reflect the lived experience of non-executive directors and other directors on the board. Developing accountability as a central concept in the explanation of how boards operate effectively enables the paper to both challenge the dominant grip of agency theory on governance research and support the search for theoretical pluralism and greater understanding of board processes and dynamics. Practically, the work suggests that corporate governance reform will be undermined by prescription that supports distant perceptions of board effectiveness but not the actual effectiveness of boards.

We test the effects of stakeholder management on CEOs' salaries, bonuses, stock options, and total compensation. We also examine the extent to which the interaction of stakeholder management and financial performance determines compensation. Using a longitudinal database of 406 Fortune 1000 firms, our results suggest that stakeholder management is relevant to boards of directors when setting CEO compensation. Specifically, we found a significant, negative main effect of stakeholder management on CEO salaries. Further, we found that stakeholder management typically reduces the rewards CEOs may get for increasing levels of financial performance. In tandem, these results indicate that CEOs may jeopardize their personal wealth by pursuing stakeholder-related initiatives. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Macro- and microorganizational perspectives on strategy processes are typically treated as distinct lines of inquiry. This paper proposes an attention-based theory (March & Olsen, 1976; Ocasio, 1997) of strategy formulation processes to bridge both perspectives. In particular, it links evolutionary perspectives on strategy (Burgelman, 1991, 2002) and strategic choice (Child, 1972) perspectives on organizational and strategic decision making (Bower, 1970; Carter, 1971; Cyert & March, 1963; Frederickson, 1986). Our treatment of the strategy process extends theory by viewing strategy processes as assemblages of tightly and loosely coupled networks of operational and governance channels (Allison & Zelikow, 1999; Ocasio, 1997), strategy formulation as a fluid and distributed process, and environmental, organizational level and individual level forces as consequential. Like Lovas and Ghoshal (2000), we view strategy formulation as a process of guided evolution. Unlike Lovas and Ghoshal who view strategic intent as the objective function that guides evolution, we view strategy formulation processes as more fragmented and contested, with multiple foci of attention, rather than an explicit objective function, and both top-down and bottoms-up processes capable of generating changes in the strategic direction of the firm. Top-down perspectives on strategy formulation from Andrews (1971), Prahalad and Bettis (1986), Hamel and Prahalad (1989), and Lovas and Ghoshal (2000) focus on how strategy formulation is guided by policies and plans, dominant logic, or strategic intent of the top management of the firm. While attention is not an explicit focus of any of these perspectives, each can be interpreted as showing how the top management of the firm shapes the organization's agenda and focus, identifying issues and goals that guide organizational attention. In their retrospective account on dominant logics, Bettis and Prahalad (1995) make the connection with attention more explicit, positing that dominant logics provide a perceptual filter that channels managerial attention and choice-making behavior. In this paper, we will make the connection between organizational attention and the managed evolution of strategy more explicit. But rather than positing an exclusive role for top management in shaping organizational attention, we argue that attention is guided by distributed processes and the channels of decision making through which information flows and by which people engage in dialog. It is through these channels that the organizational managers communicate and make critical and discrete decisions that involve organizational resources. Channels allow actors to conjecture the future state of the environment, guide operations, establish rewards, and utilize feedback on key initiatives given a particular set of organizational and individual capabilities and priorities. Given the significance of these mechanisms, it is appropriate that the processes and their conduits become central to our investigation. It is, therefore, the form and characteristics of the firm's operational and governance channels - the vehicles for corporate decision-making processes - that are our focus. We propose that strategy formulation emerges from the pattern of organizational attention embedded in the interacting network of concrete operational and governance channels at both the corporate and business unit level. These operational and governance channels include formal decision-making channels, such as board of directors meetings, board committee meetings, Executive Committee meetings, operating committee meetings, capital and operating budgeting requests, financial performance reviews, strategic planning reviews, and employee evaluations. They also include ad-hoc channels for mergers and acquisitions, changes in organizational structure, joint venture activity, and informal interactions, not a regular part of formal processes. The objective of this paper is to explain the dynamics of corporate strategy formulation through the lens of an attention-based view and through a focus on channels. The paper explains how the firm's two types of channels - operational and governance channels - and its economic and social structures regulate the attention of its decision makers and thus impact the micro processes of strategy formulation. It further links decision making in channels to the macro processes of strategy evolution. We posit that strategy formulation is ultimately about the selective retention of strategic initiatives made in corporate decision-making channels in which actors are embedded, and that through this network, retained initiatives become enduring activities of the firm and strategy finds practical expression. We extend existing theory by exploring how decision-making channels may be tightly or loosely coupled from each other and how that results in an overall pattern of corporate strategy.

Recent corporate scandals have focused the attention of a broad set of constituencies on reforming corporate governance. Boards of directors play a leading role in corporate governance and any significant reforms must encompass their role. To date, most reform proposals have targeted the legal, rather than the ethical obligations of directors. Legal reforms without proper attention to ethical obligations will likely prove ineffectual. The ethical role of directors is critical. Directors have overall responsibility for the ethics and compliance programs of the corporation. The tone at the top that they set by example and action is central to the overall ethical environment of their firms. This role is reinforced by their legal responsibilities to provide oversight of the financial performance of the firm. Underlying this analysis is the critical assumption that ethical behavior, especially on the part of corporate leaders, leads to the best long-term interests of the corporation. We describe key components of a framework for a code of ethics for corporate boards and individual directors. The proposed code framework is based on six universal core ethical values: (1) honesty; (2) integrity; (3) loyalty; (4) responsibility; (5) fairness; and (6) citizenship. The paper concludes by suggesting critical issues that need to be dealt with in firm-based codes of ethics for directors. (c) Springer 2005.

A post-Enron consensus on corporate governance has emerged among investor groups, government regulators, and the private exchanges. The corporate board should function principally as a shareholder oversight body. To ensure independence from management, the board should have a substantial majority of independent, outside directors, who neither have business relationships with the firm nor social relationships with management. These reforms may decrease the probability for director complicity in managerial malfeasance. However, research has not demonstrated a relationship between board independence and firm performance. Corporate governance looks quite different when the firm is considered as a cooperative team to produce new wealth. From this "production" perspective, corporate governance recommendations differ substantially from recent reforms. Rather than have directors solely represent shareholder interests, boards should represent those stakeholders that add value, assume unique risk, and possess strategic information. Rather than restrict insiders to one or two, boards should include a group of employees (managers and workers,) who bring the firm's know-how to the table. The team production model for corporate governance has far-reaching implications. The recommendations derived from our model suggest that the latest reform proposals offered by the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission create a board of directors that does not adequately consider the firm's new wealth-producing capabilities. This, we argue, accounts for the missing positive link between board independence and firm performance. (c) Academy of Management Executive.

Good governance for SMEs is critical for economic development and growth in both developed and developing economies. In this paper we focus on boards and governance in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) by investigating the role and contribution of "outside" directors in this setting. By contrasting board role theories against different types of SMEs, firms are expected to recruit "outside" board members for various reasons. Illustrated by 52 empirical studies of "outside" directors in SMEs we show how agency theory, resource based view of the firm, and resource dependence theory can be applied to understand the multiple roles that "outside" directors can play in family firms, venture capital-backed firms and other SMEs. The illustration shows that the concept "outside" director is not the same in different theories and in different empirical settings. Based on this finding, we argue for the need to have a conscious and balanced use of theories for understanding the role and contribution of "outside" directors in SMEs.

Agency, strategic choice, and cognitive perspectives are used to examine the conditions under which chief executive officers (CEOs) of small private corporations involve the board of directors in strategic decisions. Logistic regression results (2,382 respondents to a cross-industry mail survey) indicate that board strategic participation is not the dominant practice in these firms but that boards are more likely to participate in strategic decisions when the firm is larger, the board has a critical mass of outside directors, the strategic issue under consideration involves an organizational transition or potential downturn, or CEO power (ownership) is low.

This study examines the impact that the publication of ratings of boards of directors by the business press has on stockholder wealth. We report findings from an event study of price reactions to the publication of Business Week's 7996 and 1997 ratings of boards of directors of U.S. corporations. As hypothesized, favorable ratings resulted in significant positive abnormal returns after controlling for market effects and confounding events, with only novel information explaining statistical variance. Contrary to expectations, unfavorable ratings also resulted in positive abnormal returns. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The Canadian Securities Administrators' National Policy 58-201 Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Policy"),1 released 15 April 2005, on which the author provided detailed advice, reads that: "[t]he board should develop clear position descriptions for the chair and the chair of each board committee" (section 3.5); the board should engage in an explicit two-step "competencies and skills" recruitment of individual directors (sections 3.12 and 3.14);2 and individual directors should be regularly assessed and that these assessments should consider "the applicable position description(s), as well as the competencies and skills each individual director is expected to bring to the board" (section 3.18). The Canadian Securities Administrators, subject to receiving the required approvals, intend for the Policy to come into force in Canadian jurisdictions on 30 June 2005. This article canvasses some of the aspects in assessing board leadership. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Crises in corporate accountability have prompted calls for boards of directors to monitor (i.e., oversee) top management teams (TMTs) more closely and become more involved in strategic decision making. Research on board processes has focused largely on the benefits of these board behaviors, with little attention paid to possible negative consequences. This study addresses that gap by examining the impact of board monitoring and involvement on affective conflict within the top management team. We find that board montoring and involvement interact with TMT power such that more powerful teams suffer less affective conflict when the board monitors their activities, but greater affective conflict when the board becomes involved in the firm's strategic decision-making process.

This study, based on a comparison of the Combined Code Guidelines for non-executive directors between listed and unlisted boards, suggests that on unlisted boards non-executive directors have a greater degree of involvement in strategic development, financial monitoring, shareholder communication and overall board contribution than on listed boards, but a lesser degree of involvement in the monitoring of management, the setting of executive remuneration, the appointment and removal of executives, and succession planning. The importance of risk analysis and induction is considered high across both sectors, although board development and independence is considered less important on unlisted boards.

Embedded within firms are unique stores of intangible human assets that likely influence the way firms compete. We argue that the human and social capital of a firm, particularly at the upper echelon and board of director (BOD) levels, contribute to the firm's awareness of the competitive environment and its motivation and ability to undertake numerous, complex, and forceful competitive actions. We also suggest that the firm's executive compensation systems moderate the effects of these intangible human assets on firm competitive behavior. By examining how human capital, intra-firm social capital, and executive compensation influence firm competitive behavior, we advance a strategic HRM perspective of firm competitive behavior and outline several implications for future research.

Purpose - The emergence of the information and communications technology (ICT) sector in Ireland over the course of the past decade has paralleled a period of exceptional national economic growth. This has raised questions regarding wealth distribution, power and governance. This paper seeks to identify some of the characteristics of the governance culture in this sector in Ireland. It deals specifically with issues such as board composition, non-executive directors and the perceived role and usefulness of accounting information in the decision-making process. Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaire feedback from chief financial officers (CFOs), focusing specifically on the board of directors of indigenous, private firms. Findings - The research indicates that firms operating in this sector adopt structures and cultures similar to those in more traditional sectors. However, there is evidence that Irish ICT firms have responded positively to calls for the roles and responsibilities of non-executive directors to be recognised and accommodated. It also confirms the continuing centrality of accounting information to the decision-making process. Originality/value - The research represents an initial survey of firms operating in this sector. As such it is concerned with identifying overall patterns and contours. It is unusual in seeking feedback from CFOs and, as such, offers some unique insights. The findings will be of interest to those operating in the ICT sector and those seeking to identify the governance features that characterise this emerging and dynamic area.

Among the many roles boards of directors perform, the monitoring role of the board has received the most attention recently, resulting in higher demands on boards and directors to be vigilant monitors. By presenting a framework to tailor the monitoring role of the board to the specific situation and needs of the company, this paper tries to overcome the negative effects of an excessive focus on control. In so far as boards are, to a certain extent, free to define their own delegation policy, this framework highlights two essential decisions of the board, namely the decision which responsibilities and authorities are delegated to management and the decision whether to delegate them to a single-headed or joint management. Some preliminary empirical findings supporting the central argument are presented, together with some suggestions for further research. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

Cannella and Holcomb ((this volume). In: F. Dansereau & F. J. Yammarino (Eds), Research in multi-level issues (Vol. 4). Oxford, UK: Elsevier Science) are unconvinced that top management teams (TMTs) are the appropriate level of analysis for upper echelons research and are, accordingly, unenthusiastic about the promise of multi-level analysis for research of this type. We agree and discuss (1) the fragility of agency theory as it pertains to TMT research, (2) various issues pertaining to TMT turnover (or lack thereof), (3) paradoxes in practice and theory regarding TMT homogeneity/heterogeneity, (4) the absence of boards of directors in the upper echelons perspective, and (5) the implications of these issues on the theory/conceptualization of TMTs and of the research dedicated to them. We question whether the variables, as currently configured, relied on in this literature are sufficiently developed to adequately test an upper echelons perspective, or to sensibly warrant a multi-level analytical approach.

Existing research on the effects of boards of directors on firm performance has failed to produce consistent empirical results. In the research presented, I argue that this may be due to the fact that such research has largely ignored the interactions that take place on a board and that serve as an enabling mechanism for the board to be able to contribute to firm performance. I introduce the concept of 'board capability', which allows scholars to consider a board's composition, structure and interactions simultaneously. Also, the results of two empirical studies of boards in adolescent companies are presented. Taken together, these studies support the theoretical argument for the importance of board interactions and shed light on the performance effects of boards in adolescent companies.

The extant literature on CEO succession has paid significant attention to the organizational outcomes of CEO successions such as strategic change and firm performance. Few studies, however, have explicitly examined the personal outcomes of the newly selected CEOs. In this study, we examined how successions contexts may influence the likelihood that a new CEO is dismissed within three years after succession, namely, "new CEO dismissal." Based upon agency theory and human capital theory, we argue that new CEO dismissal may represent a correction to an inappropriate CEO selection and accordingly, succession contexts that tend to lead to an inappropriate CEO selection will increase the likelihood of new CEO dismissal. With a sample of 204 CEO successions in the time period of 1993-1998, we find that the origin of the new CEO and the characteristics of the board of directors at the succession time have significant impact on the likelihood of new CEO dismissal.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Purpose - The objective of this article is to examine and conceptualise gender-related boardroom dynamics that affect how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Design/methodology/approach - Stories were collected from eight women directors about their experiences from more than 100 corporate boards. Narrative methods were used in the data analysis. Findings - Women as well as men need to understand the power game inside and outside the boardroom. Their contribution depends on the ability and willingness to make alliances with the most influential actors, to spend time on preparations, being present on the most important decision-making arenas, and to take leadership roles. Practical implications - The study has implications for theory as well as practice. Process-oriented theories should be included in studies of boards and governance, and the study showed that boardroom dynamics are not neutral to gender. Concepts and relationships are suggested that should be included in further theory development. The study has also given several practical examples and suggestions on how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Originality/value - The study has value for developing the role of women directors. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Boards of directors have a number of roles. The board's monitoring function has been the subject of much work. Less examined is the role that the board has in setting company strategy. This paper uses agency and network perspectives in developing and testing the relationship between board characteristics and involvement in strategic decision making. Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the level of board involvement in strategic decision making is related to a number of governance variables. We demonstrate that involvement is generally lower where boards are highly interlocked. We also show that certain types of board interlocks - namely horizontal (same industry) and those involving direct links with the banking sector - are particularly associated with this negative effect. There is weaker evidence that board strategic involvement is lower where the roles of company chief executive and chair are combined. We find no evidence that factors such as board size, or the percentage of outside directors per se are related to board involvement in strategic decision making. In doing so, this paper adds to the growing literature synthesizing the structural features and processes of boards. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006.

Research on organization-environment relations has focused primarily on formal linkages between organizations such as board interlock ties as a strategy for managing resource dependence. This study examines whether top corporate executives may maintain more informal ties to executives of other firms in order to manage uncertainty arising from resource dependence. Our point of departure is prior research on boards of directors that has examined whether so-called 'broken board ties' (i.e., ties that are disrupted due to executive turnover) tend to be reconstituted, and whether resource dependence explains the likelihood of reconstitution. These studies have generally provided little evidence that corporate board ties are used to manage resource dependence. We draw from theory and research on social embeddedness and friendship to suggest that, as a strategy for managing dependence, the maintenance of friendship ties between top executives provides benefits that are comparable to the supposed benefits of board cooptation, while imposing fewer constraints on the organization. Our theory leads to the contention that, despite limited prior evidence that resource dependence determines the formation of formal board ties, corporate leaders may nevertheless reconstitute informal (i.e., friendship) ties to leaders of other firms that have the power to constrain their firms ' access to needed resources when those ties have been disrupted (e.g., due to turnover of the CEO's friend). We test our hypotheses with a unique dataset that includes survey data from U.S. corporate leaders collected at two points in time, thus permitting an assessment of whether top executives reconstitute broken social ties to leaders of other firms, and whether various sources of resource dependence predict the likelihood of reconstitution. We discuss implications for strategic perspectives on inter-organizational relations and the sociological literature on embeddedness. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The board of directors is regarded as one of the most imperative governance mechanisms in small and medium-sized family firms. Empirical studies examining both the roles these boards fulfil in a family business context, as well as evaluating the CEO's perceived importance of these roles, are scarce. Founded by a range of conceptual and multi-theoretical board role definitions, this paper contributes to the literature by empirically determining board roles. Furthermore, the importance of these board roles and differences between the board's performance and perceived importance are assessed. The results show it is indispensable to differentiate between two aggregated roles that boards in small and medium-sized family firms perform: control and service. The control role is predominantly based on agency theory, whereas the service role includes multiple theoretical perspectives. The CEOs of the family firms perceive the service role of the board as most important. However, in order to direct succession and to compensate for the owner/manager's altruistic behaviour, the board's control role should not be neglected. The acknowledgement of these two aggregated board roles and their importance may enhance future research on board roles within specific contexts. (c) 2006 Blaekwell Publishing Ltd.

Subsequent to a host of corporate corruption scandals, boards of directors are facing amplified pressure from investors, creditors and shareholders in a bid to ensure effective corporate governance of their investments. In previous research and public debate, the effectiveness of corporate governance structures has come under close scrutiny. However, boards' effectiveness in fulfilling their strategic role by guiding strategy execution mostly has been left unaddressed. Due to the high degree of secrecy and sensitivity of strategy issues, boards' effectiveness in guiding strategy execution is much more difficult to assess externally compared to structural governance issues. Against the backdrop of these difficulties and based upon insights from strategy process research, we suggest taking "strategy consistency" between a firm's resource allocation and its announced strategy as a proxy for boards' effectiveness in guiding strategy execution. In doing so, the paper contributes to extant research by going beyond structural governance issues and paying direct attention to strategic governance issues. Specifically, the paper develops a new approach and set of standard measures to assess boards' effectiveness in strategy execution. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this research paper is to explore the proposition that diversifying the board in terms of gender, ethnicity or skill base may require consideration of the specific strategic environment of the organisation. The proposition arises from the question as to whether or not greater diversity in board configuration is desirable in certain circumstances and considers the group dynamics, skill mix and capabilities that are required by boards under different conditions of change and strategic complexity. Design/methodology/ approach - The study examines the financial performance of New Zealand publicly listed companies over a five-year period and focuses on changes in board composition, strategic activity and implications for corporate performance. Findings - The study finds limited support for the idea that board configuration, strategic context and corporate decision quality may be linked. Originality/value - This paper will be of particular value to those involved in the appointment of directors within the private and public sectors. In particular, it focuses discussion on the strategic environment faced by the organisation and the relevance of a range of potential selection criteria when appointing new directors. It is also of interest to researchers evaluating the value of social capital and gender equity in contemporary organisations as, based on empirical reseach, it challenges conventional thinking. By implication, the paper also questions whether or not boards are actually able to influence key outcomes in the manner expected by legislators. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

How many directorships are too many? Globally, normative advice emphasises the importance of limiting the number of directorships any individual should hold due to the workloads they entail. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this view. Rather, there is a strong tradition of supporting multiple directorships as a mechanism for the firm to co-opt external resources. To explore the issue of director workloads and multiple directorships, we first consider the issues related to multiple directorships and outline the conclusions of extant international and Australian studies into multiple directorships. We then detail our objectives in undertaking this research and our approach to data collection. Our findings indicate that the incidence of multiple directorships in Australian listed companies is low. We also find that many of the apparent examples of multiple directorships are due to related entities, which share common directors and, due to the nature of these entities, have much lower workload requirements. Further, there does not appear to be any relationship between holding multiple directorships and firm financial performance. Finally, we discuss the implications for boards and those interested in governance, particularly the need to ensure governance recommendations and guidelines reflect empirical findings. We offer one solution to address the concerns of boards, investors, other stakeholders and the community regarding multiple directorships: board and individual director evaluations.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which firm's performance, the structure of the board of directors and ownership determine directors' remuneration in Malaysia among distressed firms. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses publicly available data from a sample of 86 distressed firms and matched 86 non-distressed firms for 2001 financial year. Findings - The findings for the full sample show that directors' remuneration is not associated with firm's profitability, as measured by ROA. A negative and significant association is observed between directors' remuneration and lagged ROA. With regard to corporate governance, board independence and the extent of non-executive directors' interests are found to have negative influence on directors' remuneration. In addition, findings also reveal directors' remuneration is positively associated with firm's growth and size. In sub-sample analyses, a strong negative relation is observed between ROA and directors' remuneration for healthy sub-sample. Research limitations/implications - Future research on this area could examine period after the adoption of the Malaysian Code by the Bursa Malaysia in 2001. Further, interviews with directors and managers about the need to link remuneration and performance could be carried out. Practical implications - There is a need for companies to link remuneration with performance, which this paper found to be lacking in practice. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is its examination of directors' remuneration among distressed firms. Findings of this paper would be useful to both regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - To examine an under-researched area, namely the dynamics of chairman-CEO interrelationship and its effect on the enterprise. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative methodology has been adopted through in-depth interviews with chairmen, CEOs and non-executive directors on the nature of chairman-CEO interactions and their effects. Findings - Four critical themes form the basis of this paper, chairman's role and contribution, nature of chairman-CEO relationship, impact of the chairman-CEO relationship on board effectiveness and the attributes of an effective chairman. Practical implications - Enhances understanding of the determining influence of the chairman-CEO dyad on board and organisational performance and also on the influence of formative context on this dyadic interaction. Originality/value - One of the few studies that has explored through in-depth interviews the chairman-CEO relationship. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates the effects of investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board of directors on their judgments. I hypothesize that investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board will be negatively related to their judgments of investment risk and positively related to the amount they are willing to invest. I also hypothesize that the association between effectiveness of the board and investment judgments will be moderated by investor type such that professional investors will be less conservative than non-professional investors. Forty non-professional investors and 33 professional investors participated in the experiment. Generally, the results of the study are consistent with the hypothesized effects. The results suggest that even in the context of sound financial performance, investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board are a key determinant of their investment judgments. This association is moderated by investor type and suggests professional investors are less conservative than non-professional investors. Such evidence is consistent with agency theory, "use of the house money" hypothesis and recent anecdotal scandals involving professional investors. Overall, the results provide evidence that investors are more confident in firms with effective corporate boards and support regulatory reforms strengthening corporate boards. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Based on Brickley's (2003) call for research on the CEO/turnover relation, we examine determinants of CEO age at succession. Utilizing the similarity-attraction paradigm, we propose that board members will select new CEOs that are similar to their own age. We find a strong positive relation between successor CEO age and average board member age. Thus, the similarity-attraction paradigm seems to play a role in board of director selection of CEO successors. However, we also propose that poor prior performance may mitigate similarity-attraction. Our results are also consistent with this hypothesis because we find no relation between successor CEO and board age following poor prior performance. Finally, the hiring of an age-similar CEO does not reduce the companies' subsequent financial performance and may even have a slightly positive impact on it. (c) Springer 2006.

Purpose - This paper seeks to provide a comprehensive review of the literature on the governance of international joint ventures (IJVs). Design/methodology/approach - Through focusing on IJV boards and top teams, examination of the current debate regarding IJV directors' contribution to board performance and effectiveness is undertaken and, in so doing, directions for future research are identified. Findings - The literature review reveals that little consideration has been given by researchers to the work of the IJV board and the role and contribution of IJV board directors to board effectiveness. Further, it is concluded that current understanding of IJV board functioning and the ways in which directors of IJV boards contribute to board effectiveness remains incomplete. Originality/value - Apart from highlighting the need for further study into the role and contribution of IJV board directors to board effectiveness, the paper suggests ways in which IJV director contribution and performance could be explored further, and offers current practical implications.

This study examines the association between the gender and ethnic composition of boards of directors and firm performance in a transitional nation. In contrast to prior research that largely focuses on firm performance within a financial context, this study concentrates on intellectual capital performance. Using data collected from 84 South African, empirical results indicate a positive association between the percentage of female and non-white directors on the board and a firm's intellectual capital performance. Additional analysis shows the designation of female directors as an insider has a negative effect of intellectual capital performance. Designation of female and non-white directors as outsiders, meanwhile, has a positive influence on a firm's intellectual capital performance. Finally, there was no association between the percentage of non-white inside directors on the board and intellectual capital performance.

Despite a large body of research in the management, accounting, economics, and finance literatures, the relationship between board composition and firm performance is still controversial and ripe for debate (for a recent study, see Boone et al., 2004). Utilizing the theoretical approach of Zahra and Pearce (1989) that identifies the three key roles of the board as oversight, strategy, and service, we examine the effects of having board interlocks between an industrial firm and of financial services firm, and firm characteristics. Using publicly available data on all listed Italian firms for the year 2001, we find that for industrial firms, there is a positive relationship between the number of board interlocks with a bank and current year return on assets, however, the opposite is true for financial services firms. Finally, we find no relationship between interlocking directorates with banks and firm capital structure.

Women are increasing in number among corporations' boards of directors, yet their representation is far from uniform across firms. In this study, we adopted a resource dependence theory lens to identify organizational predictors of women on boards. We tested our hypotheses using panel data from the 1,000 U.S. firms that were largest in terms of sales between 1990 and 2003. We found that organizational size, industry type, firm diversification strategy, and network effects (linkages to other boards with women directors) significantly impact the likelihood of female representation on boards of directors.

We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper investigates how governance mechanisms affect the ability of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to introduce strategic change. Previous research typically assumes that governance mechanisms operate independently of each other. Building on agency theory and insights from the literature on small firm governance, we hypothesize that governance variables related to ownership, the board of directors and the top management team all affect strategic change and that it is important to examine the interaction effects of these governance mechanisms. Using a longitudinal sample of over 800 SMEs, our general logic and hypotheses are supported by the analyses. We find that closely held firms exhibit less strategic change than do SMEs relying on more widespread ownership structures. However, to some extent, closely held firms can overcome these weaknesses and achieve strategic change by utilizing outside directors on the board and/or extending the size of the top management teams. Implications for theory and management practice in SMEs are discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This study examines the presence and roles of female directors of U.S. Fortune 500 firms, focusing on committee assignments and director background. Prior work from almost two decades ago concludes that there is a systematic bias against females in assignment to top board committees. Examining a recent data set with a logistic regression model that controls for director and firm characteristics, director resource-dependence roles and interaction between director gender and director characteristics, we find that female directors are less likely than male directors to sit on executive committees and more likely than male directors to sit on public affairs committees. There is little if any evidence of systematic gender bias in director assignment to other board committees. We find some evidence that boards evaluate resource dependence differently for women than men. (c) Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

Prior studies of the relationship between the composition of boards of directors and firm performance offer equivocal results. Drawing on agency and power circulation theories, we attempt to reduce this equivocality by asserting that CEO power moderates the relationship. Specifically, an outside director dominated board is needed to check a powerful CEO, but monitoring by other executives provides sufficient constraints on CEOs with low power. We used event study methodology to test the effects of the interaction between board composition and CEO power on stock market reaction to 73 unexpected CEO deaths. We found support for our theorizing among two of three sources of CEO power. Thus, although regulatory trends increasingly support outside director dominated boards, our findings indicate that this may not always benefit shareholders and that CEO power should be considered when constructing boards.

In this paper we analyse boards of directors as workgroups, i.e. groups of people that perform one or more tasks within an organisational context. Building on previous studies, we developed a model that relates group's social-psychological processes to three different board tasks: service, monitoring and networking. We tested our model through a survey on 301 large manufacturing firms in Italy. Our findings support the idea that (a) process variables and, to a limited extent, demographic variables significantly influence board task performance; (b) board processes have a different impact on each specific board task; (c) board task performance varies depending upon firm and industry characteristics.

This article explores how the boards of small firms actually undertake to perform strategic tasks. Board strategic involvement has seldom been investigated in the context of small firms. We seek to make a contribution by investigating antecedents of board strategic involvement. The antecedents are "board working style" and "board quality attributes", which go beyond the board composition features of board size, CEO duality, the ratio of non-executive to executive directors and ownership. Hypotheses were tested on a sample of 497 Norwegian firms (from 5 to 30 employees). Our results show that board working style and board quality attributes rather than board composition features enhance board strategic involvement. Moreover, board quality attributes outperform board working style in fostering board strategic involvement. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This paper examines the relationship between firm complexity and board of director composition. Utilising the board typology of Baysinger and Zardkoohi (1986), we classify board members either as insiders, business experts, support specialists, or community influentials, and examine board composition in relation to firm internal and external complexity. Internal complexity refers to the sophistication of internal work processes (proxied by firm R&D expenditures, and the amount of invested capital), while external complexity relates to the external competitive structure (proxied by the number of business and geographic segments, and industrial leadership). Utilising a random sample of 150 firms drawn from six industries over the 2003-2005 time period, and after classifying 4,408 directors to one of our board categories, multivariate results confirm conjectures that complexity is related to the specific capabilities that each board member brings to the firm. We find that externally complex firms substitute community influentials for insiders. Additionally, internally complex firms have lower levels of community influentials, which are substituted by insiders and support specialists. This study adds to a small but growing literature that examines the economic determinants of board structure (Boone et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2005; Gillan et al., 2003; Linck et al., 2005), by providing a unique lens in examining board characteristics that goes beyond the traditional insider/independent classification.

To understand the evolving perspectives and behaviour of directors and institutional investors, field research was conducted in 2004-2005 by way of a survey with corporate directors in four countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States; n = 658) and institutional investors in Canada (n = 34). Reported changes in directors' views and practices are substantial and consistent across countries, the defining characteristic of which is a fundamental shift in the positioning of the board toward becoming a strategic partner to management. The role of institutional investors also shifted in ways that are complementary to this new role of directors (e.g., toward increased monitoring). While most research has focused on agency concepts of the board as monitors of management, our research suggests that the board is evolving towards a more collaborative role with management, consistent with stewardship theory. Our findings also suggest that directors are seeking a balance between collaboration and their role as monitors of management, rejecting the notion of the board as primarily a monitoring body. An evolutionary model is offered to explain these changes and implications are discussed. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In this article we examine what affects the board of directors' involvement in the advice to management, with emphasis on the influence of crises on the board advisory tasks performance. Based on a survey of 881 small Norwegian firms, we analyse responses from CEOs in order to determine whether and to what extent the board is actively involved in the governance process during crises through providing advice. The study has two major contributions to board research in general and research of into small firms in particular. The first is the go beyond the "usual suspects" of board size, CEO duality, and board independence when looking for determinants of board involvement in advice. The second contribution is a clearer understanding of board involvement during crises. Our results show that board member diversity becomes particularly important during crises, since this provides the CEO and firm access to a more diverse pool of competences and experiences. We also find that crises moderate the effects of incentive on the board's involvement in advice. This evidence sheds new light on the determinants of directors' involvement in board tasks, suggesting that directors' incentive to perform certain board tasks vary according to the contingent situation the firm is experiencing.

Decisions by boards of directors can have a critical impact on the success or failure of a firm. These decisions range from the hiring and firing of a CEO to market entry and exit to the way in which a firm reports accounting profits and losses. In seeking to understand boards of directors more fully, we have come to think that we need a more complete picture of intraboard relationships among directors, including but not limited to relationships with the CEO, because these relationships affect critical decisions for the firm. The authors propose that the study of boards of directors could benefit by using a conceptual lens that scholars have yet to apply to this setting-that of the board as a social network unto itself.

This study examines participation of African-Americans on the boards and board committees of the US Fortune 500. Prior work suggests the use of committee assignment to discern active versus figurehead involvement on boards. We use a logistic regression model that controls for director traits, firm characteristics and director resource-dependence roles to compare the odds that a black director will be assigned to key committees to those for a white director. We find that black directors are more (less) likely than whites to sit on audit and public affairs (executive) committees. Black female directors are more likely than both white females and black males to serve on finance committees. Thus there is some evidence that race plays a role in determining assignment to corporate board committees. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Moves by regulators to drive governance reform have cascaded across the globe. The U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the U.K. Combined Code are leading examples. The article discusses how boards can contribute to strategic conversations and share responsibilities for strategic management with the CEO and top teams. We discuss how tools like balanced scorecards can align the focus of directors towards future opportunities and risks. It is suggested that boards adopt a strategic scorecard as implemented by CIMA1Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.1 to engage in strategy.

Although the Combined Code (Financial Reporting Council, 2003, 2006) clearly identifies the roles and responsibilities of PLC board members, current academic literature offers little guidance to FTSE 250 boards - many of whom are managing different Issues compared with their FTSE 100 counterparts including high corporate growth, existing founder and/or family board members, and/or newly formed boards - on ways In which they can improve the quality of decision-making, increase individual board contribution, and enhance overall board performance and effectiveness. This paper attempts to outline the key issues faced by board members, particularly non-executive directors, serving on FTSE 250 company boards with regard to three distinct roles-strategy, succession planning and risk management - and examines the relevant influences on board members derived from corporate lifecycle, board structure, existing process and board culture which affect board performance and standards of corporate governance. Its conclusions draw on the author's previous research on non-executive contribution (Long, 2004) and her recent experience of reviewing performance and effectiveness of FTSE 100 and 250 boards of directors through Boardroom Review.

Reports citing excessive CEO compensation continue to make the news with evidence of peer relationships between the CEO and the compensation committee often the center of debate. The compensation committee of the board of directors determines CEO pay and is often comprises CEOs from other companies as well as non-CEOs such as academic, exgovernment, and professional individuals. This study examines the influence of the psychological factor of social comparison over accounting performance measures in a compensation experiment with 176 subjects. The results of this study are consistent with social comparison theory in that CEO director-subjects award greater pay and shield the compensation of the CEO when firm accounting performance is below average. Additionally, we find shielding is mitigated when subjects are informed that the decision of the amount of compensation awarded will be revealed to the public. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This article contributes to the literature on board effectiveness by being perhaps the first to systematically examine how the nature of outside directors' prior experience, and resulting expertise, will influence the performance of a focal firm's strategic initiatives. Our theoretical model is grounded in the psychological literature on expertise and its role in group decision making effectiveness. We focus on outside director expertise in acquisition decision making, and its implications for the performance of the acquisitions of a focal firm. Our conceptual framework indicates that directors will develop expertise in making particular kinds of acquisition decisions (e.g., related or unrelated acquisitions or acquisitions in specific industries or product markets) through their past experiences at other firms with decisions about those specific types of acquisitions, and we predict that this experience and expertise will have positive effects on the performance of a focal firm's acquisitions. We extend our theoretical model to consider the conditions under which relevant director experience will prove most beneficial. Our model predicts that outside director acquisition expertise will deliver the greatest benefits when the focal firm's board is independent from management. We find empirical support for all of our hypotheses. In considering how and when director experience and resulting expertise may influence the performance of corporate acquisitions, our theory and results help to highlight a potential second main focus for research on the long-standing question of what factors render boards of directors effective.

Scholars and practitioners are interested in board effectiveness, yet we know relatively little about directors' engagement in the boardroom. We integrate identity theory and social identity theory research with literature on board monitoring and resource provision to model how directors' multiple identities affect their behavior. We propose that directors' strength of identification with multiple identities affects the extent to which they engage in monitoring and resource provision. We discuss implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

This study makes a contribution to the growing literature on the board's resource provision role by examining a specific type of resource provision (i.e., industry experience supplementing) and demonstrating the criticality of the liabilities of newness to this particular role. In this study, we find that among younger entrepreneurial firms, a dearth of top management industry experience is offset by the presence of outside directors with significant managerial industry experience, providing evidence of experience supplementing by outside directors. Our study highlights that the notion of experience supplementing at the upper echelons prevails in young firms as they try to alleviate the burdens of the liability of newness. Experience supplementing underscores board-management collaboration during early years of firm development. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

By examining the level of ownership concentration across firms, we determine how principal-principal conflict, defined as the incongruence of ownership goals among shareholder groups in a corporation, impacts agency costs of Chinese boards of directors. Based on data from Chinese companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges during 1999-2003, we found that ownership concentration had a U-shaped relationship with board compensation, board size and the presence of independent directors. These results provide corroborating evidence that principal-principal conflict can lead to high agency costs. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Using a sample of 714 private family influenced businesses in Germany, we investigate the relationship of goal alignment between owners and managers and the existence of a board of directors. Agency theory and stewardship theory serve as theoretical bases for our study. We find that firms with relatively high levels of goal alignment are less likely to have a board of directors. Our results provide support for the substitution hypothesis of formal by social control mechanisms. Furthermore, the findings show that firms without a board and with relatively low levels of goal alignment have less family members in the top management team. This circumstance might in turn be a trigger for owners to install a board. (c) 2008 International Council for Small Business.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: How and to what extent does national culture influence the composition and leadership structure of the boards of directors of multinational firms? Research Findings/Insights: Societal norms about corporate structure are treated as components of national culture. Hofstede's measures of national culture were shown to predict the board composition and leadership structure of firms based in that culture. The hypotheses were tested with data on 399 multinational manufacturing firms based in 15 industrial countries. The results suggest that national culture can have strong effects on corporate governance and should be considered in any transnational study. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The predictive accuracy of the culture variables provides strong support for the argument that norms embedded in a society's culture affect organizational structure, at least at the board level. The results of the study contribute to our understanding of institutional theory in explaining observed variations in corporate board composition and leadership structure across countries. By linking board composition to the cultural environment, institutional theory provides an explicit framework for analyzing variations in board structure across national boundaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: When considering board composition and leadership structure, it is important to consider national culture norms. The findings of the study also have important implications for multinational firms setting up boards for their subsidiaries in different countries. (c) 2008 The Authors.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the current debate regarding the role of a board director. Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive review of the corporate governance (CG) literature is undertaken, with a particular focus on director contribution to board effectiveness. Findings - The literature review revealed a number of issues in the CG literature that highlight the need to clarify board director role and pay closer attention to the processes needed for directors to perform their role effectively. These issues have broadly been classified into: conceptual issues regarding board effectiveness and director contribution; a methodological issue of level of analysis (board as a group and a director as individual); failure of much of the literature to account for the external context in which the board directors operate; and prescriptive nature of the literature. Originality/value - Issues pertinent to the CG literature identified in this paper hold theoretical and practical implications.

Corporate governance regulations across the globe increasingly push for a model in which top management is supervised by an independent, vigilant and skilled board of directors. Academic research, however, produces ambiguous results as to the direct effects of such board characteristics on firm performance. We therefore analyze the relationships between board attributes, board working processes and board role performance through intermediate relationships. Several hypotheses are derived and tested by analyzing data obtained from a survey at the board level in The Netherlands. Our results partly confirm the relevance of the model of board processes related to board role performance, as suggested by [Forbes, D.P., and Milliken, F.J. (1999) Cognition and corporate governance: Understanding boards of directors as strategic decision-making groups. Academy of Management Review, 24, 489-505]. Particularly, this study exemplifies the relevance of different board processes for explaining board role performance. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is considered by many to have made the most sweeping changes affecting corporate governance since the Securities and Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. About 4 years after its passing, however, many governance experts question whether the time and expense of compliance engender any real reforms. This article examines whether corporations have restructured their boards in response to the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley and finds evidence that companies are implementing changes that should strengthen the monitoring ability of their boards.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

The separation of ownership from control in modern corporations has led to some interesting questions and much debate among researchers and practicing managers (Baysinger and Hoskisson, 1990; Berle and Means, 1932; Johnson, Daily, and Ellstrand, 1996; Zahra and Pearce, 1989). Individual shareholders, unless they are also managers or hold a large block of stock, have very little influence on the company. Managers, as agents for the shareholders, make most important decisions with regard to corporate operations. Stewardship theory suggests that managers should be given maximum liberty to make decisions so that they are not encumbered by rules and influences that can jeopardize optimal performance (Davis, Schoorman, and Donaldson, 1997) However, many researchers and practitioners wonder whether managers can be relied upon to sacrifice their own self-interests and behave in a manner that is in the best interests of the shareholders.

In this paper I first review the basic tenets of agency theory and theory of managerial capitalism as well as some of the major research in these areas then suggest for areas for future research that go beyond the extant empirical work. First, I suggest that it would be useful to reconsider the basic nature of the agency relationship, taking into account that while equity holders can be considered the principal, the board of directors may be more realistically in need of agent-like controls. Second, the complementary or supplementary nature of the monitoring/incentive alignment relationship has been shown theoretically but the empirical evidence is equivocal and needs future investigation. Third, there has been very limited research on the construct validity of archival measures of the sort used in agency theory. This requires the use of methodologies outside those of the more conventional type used in agency theory (i.e., from economics and finance). Finally, agency theory development would profit greatly by more extensive use of research methods such as laboratory studies and survey methodology and the integration of concepts such as personality and control processes.

This paper considers industry-specific contingencies that may account for some of the inter-firm heterogeneity in the deployment of specific corporate governance mechanisms in IPO firms. We examine how differences in demand, competitive, and technological uncertainty in the industry influence the levels of IPO firm monitoring by board outsiders and institutional investors. We test our theory using a sample of U.S. firms that completed an IPO in 24 manufacturing industries. The results indicate that industry uncertainty is, indeed, significantly related to the use of corporate governance mechanisms. In particular, the empirical results indicate that industry effects on IPO firm board monitoring and institutional investor ownership are the strongest and most consistent for demand uncertainty and competitive uncertainty.

Purpose - The purpose of this research is to explore the potential role and the measurement of the effectiveness of boards of directors in strategy formulation and implementation - two aspects that have so far been left largely unaddressed by corporate governance research and practice. Design/methodology/ approach - Based on insights from strategy process literature, the paper suggests that, by ensuring consistency between resource allocation processes and the firm's intended strategy, boards could fulfil a meaningful role in strategy implementation. The proposed outside-in analysis of resource allocation decisions is illustrated by a single case study of a major Swiss pharmaceutical company. Findings - The proposed approach enables corporate governance scholars to look at how boards fulfil their role in strategy implementation from a perspective similar to that of financial analysts. It might thus be suited to complement existing methods in empirical corporate governance research. Practical implications - The presented outside-in analysis of resource allocation decisions helps board members to prevent role conflicts with executive management. In addition, boards may benefit from an analysis of implementation consistency, because it enables them to detect weak early warning signals of strategic divergence that require early intervention. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the discussion of alternative methods for exploring strategy issues in corporate governance research. The suggested approach outlines a potential new vantage point to investigate board involvement in strategy implementation in the event that action research is not feasible. The tentative findings from the case study put forward a set of indicators for measuring the effectiveness of boards in guiding strategy implementation. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

There is an absence of research about what information boards of directors have access to and how they use that information. The purpose of this paper is to explore and theorize about the content and use of information to boards of directors. The paper introduces and elaborates on the concept of 'board accounts', which is defined as the information supplied to boards of directors by top-management. The paper locates the board accounts in the Swedish institutional setting and demonstrates how the concept can be operationalized in an empirical setting. On the basis of a unique material of archived board records in a Swedish company, the paper explores the board accounts over a period of 10 years (1989-1998). It is found that while use of the board accounts in the case study company changes considerably over time, the content of the board accounts remains largely unchanged. This raises questions about where and when directors receive information, the reliability of the information in the board accounts, and recent attempts to integrate corporate governance and management accounting (CIMA, Performance reporting to boards: a guide to good practice, 2003; CIMA strategic scorecard: boards engaging in strategy, 2005; Seal, Management Accounting Research 17(4):389-408, 2006). Finally, the paper discusses the merits of historical archive-based approaches in this field and possibilities for future research. (c) 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This study examined the human and social capital factors associated with higher post-succession firm performance in family enterprises in Singapore. We also investigated the moderating influence of the board of directors in terms of its service role as stewards of the enterprise. We found that a successor's industry experience and diversity of network ties were positively associated with firm performance and boards that focused their role as advisors to the successor enhanced post-succession firm performance.

Research about boards and governance has been characterized by the dominance of few concepts and a limited number of methods. This article introduces methods and concepts that help us explore board processes. Six illustrative studies of board processes are presented, including the use of 'one of the lads' - methods, 'flies on the wall' - methods, interpretation of 'board life stories' of women directors, reconstructive case studies and the use of questionnaire surveys directed to multiple respondents in each case. The article shows directions for how to open the 'black box' of board processes.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: Prior research on corporate elites has focused on how interlocking directorships serve to create inter-organizational linkages and on what happens when board members lose their seats and those linkages are broken. Rather than focusing on the ties in corporate networks, here we focus on the nodes of these networks, the individual members of boards of directors. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the conditions under which a director will be able to retain his/her board seat even after he or she loses the executive position that provided initial entry onto the board. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The case of outside directors who have lost their executive positions in their home organizations provides an excellent opportunity to examine two competing theoretical perspectives: the inter-corporate and intra-class perspectives on corporate elites. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002), directorships are demanding an increasing amount of directors' time and directors without full-time executive positions elsewhere can actually devote more energy to board activities. An unintended consequence of this legislation is a potential decrease in the number of directors who hold several board seats simultaneously. This may reduce the efficiency of information flow across organizations and slow the diffusion of innovation. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The empirical support for agency theory explanations for the great variance in CEO pay has been equivocal. Drawing from the performance appraisal literature, we hypothesize that boards of directors incorporate human judgment into the evaluation and reward of CEO performance in order to balance managerial risk with agency costs. We test Baysinger and Hoskisson's (1990) proposition that insider-dominated corporate boards rely on subjective performance evaluation to reward the CEO, and we argue that R&D intensity influences this relationship. Using a sample of Fortune firms, findings support our contention that human judgment is important in evaluating and rewarding CEO performance. (c) 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

The 'value creating board' surveys have been conducted in several European countries, and initiatives have also been under taken to conduct similar studies on other continents. The objectives of this article are to present methodological issues in relation to survey research about boards of directors and to document some of the methodological reflections from the 'value creating board' surveys. Some studies using 'value creating board' survey data are also presented. A main concern in survey research about boards of directors is the common method bias. Questionnaire surveys are the common method in the 'value creating board' surveys, but the development of the instrument and the interpretation of the findings are based on results and experiences from board research using other methods. Furthermore, another methodological strength of the surveys is that they have been conducted in different countries, with different samples, at different points of time, with various respondents and by different researchers. The various studies are not only individual articles, but also pieces in a big puzzle. Details about samples and responses in the Norwegian 'value creating board' surveys are presented here as an input to this discussion. The article thus serves as a point of reference for contributions drawing from these and similar surveys. Ten studies are presented to illustrate the concepts, methods, samples and contribution from the 'value creating board' surveys.

In this study, we examine firm and board characteristics that predict whether a new CEO will come from the firm's current management, from the board of directors, or from outside the firm. This study is the first to recognize the potential for outside board members to compete for the CEO position. Though classified as firm outsiders, outside directors have many of the advantages of insider candidates for CEO: firm-specific knowledge and familiarity with the board of directors. This form of succession is likely to be valuable in high-technology industries, as competition is faster paced and information asymmetry is greater than in lower technology industries. In this study, we focus on a single high-tech industry (semiconductors) in the period between 1993 and 2000. We find that the presence of an heir-apparent increases the likelihood of insider succession while outsider board members' availability increases the likelihood that an outside director will become the new CEO. We also find that firms with high levels of R&D spending and rapid sales growth favor insiders as new CEOs. We discuss the implications of these findings for the CEO's relationship with the board.

There has been concern expressed in the financial press and focus established in the accounting literature over rising levels of executive compensation. Individuals on the compensation committee, a sub-committee of the board of directors, collectively determine executive compensation and are responsible for maintaining the pay-for-performance standard, a concept that warrants further attention. This study examines the process of exaggeration of a group decision over individual beliefs and the impact of leadership upon a committee's outcome when making compensation awards. In an experiment with 98 subjects role-playing as compensation committee members, results show that in a committee of individuals where a coterie and a majority belief is present, group polarization occurs and the compensation results are exaggerated as compared to individual beliefs. The findings also suggest, though, that the appointment of a leader as chair of the committee, either in the majority or minority view, has a moderating effect on the group outcome. These results highlight and add to the literature the potential for agency costs in the group decision process that may be found in the executive compensation-setting environment.

A prerequisite for building a field of research is to accumulate knowledge. I will here present some of the building blocks that are important for understanding behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Theoretical perspectives, a stream of research and some seminal articles are presented. When put together and not only presented as fragmented pieces, they constitute a framework that introduces a new field of research about behavioural perspectives on boards and governance. Five articles in particular are mentioned as seminal building blocks in this framework.

In this article, we present an overview of empirical research on boards and governance in leading U.S. and international academic journals in general management. Samples, methods, theories, and main concepts are presented and compared. The contributions are positioned with respect to contingency perspectives, behavioral perspectives, and evolutionary perspectives. Through an analysis of 127 empirical articles, we find that most studies on boards and governance have been influenced by a research tradition that treats the board of directors as an isolated 'black box.' Only few studies explore boards in context or explore behavioral perspectives of boards. Almost no studies include evolutionary perspectives. Based on our analysis, we explore alternative research streams and outline various directions for future research.

The ways in which boards of directors can create value for SMEs has received a considerable amount of attention in the governance literature. Inconclusive results from input-output studies have asked for another approach, focusing on the influence of contingencies, board processes and actual board task performance. In this article, we examine the effect of the board's actual task performance on the value that boards create in Dutch SMEs. Because of the two-tier governance system, we distinguish between the value creation of the supervisory board and the executive board. A factor analysis on a wide range of board tasks results in six distinguishable sets of board tasks: 1) operational control, 2) behavioural control, 3) output control, 4) strategy, 5) advice and counsel, and 6) networking. Results show that - from a CEO's perspective - the supervisory boards mainly create value through their performance on the advice and counsel tasks. Executive boards are found to create value through their performance on the advice, counsel and strategy tasks.

This paper examines board responsibilities and accountability by management and Board of Directors in relation to the National Australia Bank's (NABs) performance. The NAB, an international financial service provider within the top thirty most profitable banks in the world, is compared with the Australian major banks. The evidence suggests that NABs poor performance was consistent with a lack of accountability, poor corporate governance and board dysfunction associated with fraudulent currency trading and the subsequent AUD360 million foreign currency losses. The NAB's performance is investigated by utilising accounting-based measures of profitability and cost efficiency as proxies for performance. Following the foreign currency trading losses in 2004 the NAB under-performed the other major Australian banks in terms of profits, cost to income ratio and growth in assets. In terms of profitability and cost efficiency NAB had the lowest ROE and ROA with a 19.7% fall in net profit and the highest cost to income ratio of 57.4% of any of the five largest banks. This case study provides an Australian example of poor corporate governance and suggests that financial institutions and regulators can learn from the NAB's experience. Failure to have top-down accountability can have significant impact on over-all performance, profitability and reputation. In particular, it suggests that management and Boards need to review their risk management procedures and regulators need to be more pro-active in their prudential oversight of financial institutions.

In focus of this paper are selected characteristics of enterprise boards and their influences on performance in companies located in Gnosjo, one of Sweden's best known industrial districts. The aim and contribution of this paper are to propose and test a model that reflects how the relationship between board characteristics, administration and company age can have an effect on company performance. Our results show that number of commitments among board members as well as company age are significant for company performance measured with sales and sales per employee. The support of the model proposed is strong and we believe the results have practical as well as theoretical implications. (c) Ossi Pesamaa, Johan Klaesson, Antti Haahti, 2008.

This paper provides some strong support for existing literature in an under-researched context (the emerging economies of the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe). We develop and apply a model linking Board formation and environmental uncertainty, finding some partial support for our anticipated relationships in the area of Board establishment and perceived financial sector uncertainly, although no support for our anticipated relationship between governmental sector uncertainty and Board formation. research is supportive of the broad assertion that strategy in emerging economies is different and a 'one size fits all' (generally American) approach to the questions we ask regarding strategy in emerging regions will rarely provide accurate insights for management academics and practitioners with an interest in understanding and improving management decisions in the context of emerging economies.

This study analyses the influence of various characteristics of the Board of Directors on the control and risk of the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). It also examines the effect on these variables of some of the CEO personal characteristics and of various contingencies of the firm. The results reveal that control of the CEO compensation is determined fundamentally by the CEO participation in the capital of the firm, while the level of risk of the CEO compensation package is higher when the firm is diversified and implements a proactive competitive strategy.

The study sought to explore the role that director behavioral-type might play in leading to board effectiveness. The study involved direct observation of twenty-one boards of directors or committee meetings, together with interviews of 194 respondents. The study suggests that board process may be an equal if not more important factor than board structure in determining board effectiveness. The study's data suggests that board processes, in turn, may be influenced by the behavioral-types of individual board members. Based on the three dimensions of dissent/consensus; individual/collective; and persuasiveness/non-persuasiveness, five director behavioral types leading to a functional board emerged from the study including: (i) change agents; (ii) consensus-builders; (iii) counsellors; (iv) challengers; and (v) conductors. Five director behavioral types leading to a dysfunctional board also emerged including: (vi) controllers; (vii) conformists; (viii) cheerleaders; (ix) critics; and (x) caretakers. The study concludes with its limitations.

Thirty years have passed since Pfeffer and Salancik's seminal work on resource dependence theory (RDT). During this time RDT has been applied broadly across the research domain to explain how organizations reduce environmental interdependence and uncertainty. In this review, the authors assess the conceptual development, empirical research, and application of RDT. They structure their review around the five options that Pfeffer and Salancik propose firms can enact to minimize environmental dependences: (a) mergers/vertical integration, (b) joint ventures and other interorganizational relationships, (c) boards of directors, (d) political action, and (e) executive succession.The authors summarize past work, synthesize contemporary thought, and propose future research directions.

This book integrates and assesses the vast and rapidly growing literature on strategic leadership, which is the study of top executives and their effects on organizations. The basic premise is that, in order to understand why organizations do the things they do, or perform the way they do, we need to comprehend deeply the people at the top-their experiences, abilities, values, social connections, aspirations, and other human features. The actions-or inactions-of a relatively small number of key people at the apex of an organization can dramatically affect organizational outcomes. The scope of strategic leadership includes individual executives, especially chief executive officers (CEOs), groups of executives (top management teams, or TMTs), and governing bodies (particularly boards of directors). Accordingly, the book addresses an array of topics regarding CEOs (e.g., values, personality, motives, demography, succession, and compensation); TMTs (including composition, processes, and dynamics); and boards of directors (why boards look and behave the way they do, and the consequences of board profiles and behaviors). The book synthesizes what is known about strategic leadership and indicates new research directions. (c) 2009 by Oxford University Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

In this article, the authors develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of outside directors' human and social capital on firm growth. They posit that outside directors' board memberships and managerial experiences have additive and interactive effects. Using a longitudinal sample of high technology firms, they test their theory and find that outside directors' membership on multiple boards, industry-specific managerial experience, and firm-specific founding experience have strong additive effects on firm growth. They also find negative interaction effects, indicating the costs of acquiring and combining certain types of outside director human and social capital within the board.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: Over the last four decades, research on the relationship between boards of directors and strategy has proliferated. Yet to date there is little theoretical and empirical agreement regarding the question of how boards of directors contribute to strategy. This review assesses the extant literature by highlighting emerging trends and identifying several avenues for future research. Research Findings/Results: Using a content-analysis of 150 articles published in 23 management journals up to 2007, we describe and analyze how research on boards of directors and strategy has evolved over time. We illustrate how topics, theories, settings, and sources of data interact and influence insights about board-strategy relationships during three specific periods. Theoretical Implications: Our study illustrates that research on boards of directors and strategy evolved from normative and structural approaches to behavioral and cognitive approaches. Our results encourage future studies to examine the impact of institutional and context-specific factors on the (expected) contribution of boards to strategy, and to apply alternative methods to fully capture the impact of board processes and dynamics on strategy making. Practical Implications: The increasing interest in boards of directors' contribution to strategy echoes a movement towards more strategic involvement of boards of directors. However, best governance practices and the emphasis on board independence and control may hinder the board contribution to the strategic decision making. Our study invites investors and policy-makers to consider the requirements for an effective strategic task when they nominate board members and develop new regulations.

ABSTRACT Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: A coherent alternative to an economic approach of corporate governance is missing. In this paper we take steps towards developing a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance. Research Findings/Results: Building upon concepts such as political bargaining, routinization of decision making, satisficing, and problemistic search, a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will focus more on (1) interactions and processes inside and outside the boardroom; (2) the fact that decision making is made by coalitions of actors and objectives are results of political bargaining; and (3) the notion that not only conflicting, but also cooperating, interests are parts of the boards' decision making and control over firm resources. Theoretical Implications: The consequences are a new research agenda for boards and corporate governance. The agenda will focus on actual instead of stylized descriptions of board behavior. In a behavioral perspective the emphasis on problems of coordination, exploration, and knowledge creation may dominate over problems of conflict of interest, exploitation, and the distribution of value. A future research agenda based on a behavioral framework calls for novel and adventurous research designs. Practical Implications: A behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will be closer to actual board behavior than the traditional economic approach and research about boards and corporate governance may thus become more actionable for practitioners.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

We present results from a study about women and employee-elected board members, and fill some of the gaps in the literature about their contribution to board effectiveness. The empirical data are from a unique data set of Norwegian firms. Board effectiveness is evaluated in relation to board control tasks, including board corporate social responsibility (CSR) involvement. We found that the contributions of women and employee- elected board members varied depending on the board tasks studied. In the article we also explored the effects of the esteem of the women and employee-elected board members, and we used creative discussions in the boardroom as a mediating variable. Previous board research, including research about women and employeeelected directors, questions if the board members contribute to board effectiveness. The main message from this study is that it may be more important to ask how, rather than if, women and employee-elected board members contribute, and we need to open the black box of actual board behavior to explore how they may contribute.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: This paper extends the theory of bundles of corporate governance mechanisms to address agency issues within the Anglo-Saxon system of corporate governance. The focus of our study is to detail the role of firm performance as a key determinant of how the governance mechanisms of monitoring and incentive alignment serve as complements or substitutes in addressing agency issues. Previous research has looked at these mechanisms in isolation from each other, with limited regard for the contingencies of firm performance and external monitoring. We propose that it is best to look at these mechanisms as a bundle of mechanisms to protect shareholder interests, and that firm performance is a key determinant of the composition of this bundle. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce firm performance as a critical contingency that heightens shareholders' concerns over governance issues as they seek to retain control over adverse selection and moral hazard problems. We propose that when firms are performing poorly, outside monitoring by institutional investors can complement internal monitoring by boards of directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We examine governance bundles under both agency and stewardship theoretical lenses to tie together previous empirical research and advance theory. In specifying the role of firm performance in determining the mix of mechanisms within the governance bundle, we reconcile prior disparate findings as to whether or not these governance mechanisms act in a complementary or substitutable fashion. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The conceptualization of these governance mechanisms has practitioner merit in analyzing the challenges that board members face managing agency conflicts through the mix of governance mechanisms, given different levels of firm performance. Our research also shows that, under conditions of poor performance, shareholders can provide effective external monitoring that can improve the overall governance effectiveness of the firm.

This study contributes to the debate on the benefits and costs of multiple directorships by investigating the impact of multiple directorships on board meeting attendance. Individuals with multiple board seats (or "busy" directors) exhibit a higher tendency to be absent from board meetings. The results are robust even after controlling for firm-specific characteristics, board of directors structure and endogeneity. Furthermore, our results do not support the hypothesis that directors with higher ownership stakes are more motivated to attend board meetings. Monetary inducements such as board meeting fees and annual director retainers do not appear to enhance attendance. Finally, the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) appears to have a material impact on board attendance. (c) 2008 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

It is often assumed that directors with human capital such as prior management experience or independence from the company are the most influential board members. By contrast, in a survey of all the board members in 14 companies we found that ties to others in a network of strong ties among those who meet outside of board meetings were more important predictors of social influence than human capital or ties across boards. These ties within the board represent the social capital of members in the form of prior relationships with other directors, ties to others on the board, and membership in cliques within the board's network of ties. These results support a social capital perspective on influence that emphasizes relationships with others on the board as important factors in the social dynamics of board decision-making.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between board diversity, as represented by the percentage of female, minority or female and minority directors on the boards of directors, and firm financial performance, and to explore the potential determinants of board diversity, using data from the Australian corporate sector. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the top 500 Australian companies as the initial data-set. Firm performance measures include return on assets, return on equity and shareholder return. Several control variables are introduced in the regression analysis. Findings - The results indicate that gender and racial diversity do not have significant influence on performance. It is reported that larger firms tend to have relatively more female members, and smaller firms or firms with larger boards may have more minority directors. Research limitations/implications - The findings should not be extrapolated to all firms as the sample is restricted to listed companies. To examine the complete impact of board diversity future research could consider non-financial performance indicators. Practical implications - The analysis shows that greater diversity does not lead to poor performance, which suggests that gender and racial diversity could be achieved without a negative effect on shareholder wealth. Originality/value - In addition to giving improved evidence on the effect of gender diversity on performance, the paper may be the first study which ascertains whether there is a "business case" for greater minority participation in boardrooms in the Australian context.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the association between the composition of the board of directors and corporate diversification, to explore the role of the board in corporate strategic choice. Research Findings/Results: Based on a sample of 101 Australian publicly listed firms in 2005, this study finds that there is no link between corporate decisions on product and/or geographic diversification and two aspects of board composition - board independence and institutional representation. However, there is a positive link between total diversification and a third aspect of board composition - the proportion of directors who have ties to boards of corporations in other industries. Theoretical Implications: The results provide support for the managerial hegemony and the resource dependency theories. Corporate strategic decisions regarding diversification are more likely to be made by management than boards of directors, and to be encouraged by interlocking directors with extra-industry ties. Practical Implications: Contrary to the requirement or recommendation in many jurisdictions that boards be more independent, these results indicate that shareholders' interests, represented by lower levels of diversification, are not promoted under such circumstances. Interlocking directors appear to effectively link the corporation to the external business environment and to encourage diversification. Existing recommendations and regulations to align management with shareholders' interests through independent boards should be revised. Board composition should also consider directors' knowledge, relevant expertise, availability, and length of tenure. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study analyses the form of the board-TMT interaction and the firm's level of strategic change. Relatedly, we explore the premise that there needs to be a good fit between the board of directors and the top management team to effectively bring about strategic change. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a sample of 119 firms in the period 1993-2000, we found that when a synergy exists between the board and the TMT, there will be a greater inclination for strategic change. The results indicate that a board's inclination to contribute to strategic change increases as the board size increases. Equally, it is possible to accept that the relationship between board tenure and their inclination towards strategic change is not linear. Finally, the simultaneous analysis of board composition and the ratio of directors on the TMT, demonstrates that the interaction of both variables has effects on the firm's strategic change. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support in favor of an active role of the board shaping the firm's strategic decisions. We have developed and tested a set of arguments regarding with the role of the board on the firm's change in strategy. We have investigated as well, the leveraging effect of one of the variables that define the composition of the management team on the relationship board-change in strategy. Practitioner/Policy Implications: In order to create an effective board, a broader governance structure must be examined with a detailed study of aspects of the composition of the board and the TMT (previous research has only considered characteristics linked to the CEO). The dynamics of the relationships between both governance mechanisms are essential and leverage the board capability. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study investigates how the implementation of special attributes of CEO compensation contracts is determined by both the acquisition and the acquirer features for a set of M&A deals undertaken by Canadian acquiring firms. Our findings reveal that when agency problems are higher, manifested by larger control premiums and poor firm performance, boards of directors tend to implement stronger mechanisms of incentive alignment around M&A transactions. Relying on multiple interdisciplinary logics that are activated to explain directors' ability to effectively perform their monitoring function, we show that boards are reactive rather than proactive in dealing with agency problems. Data are further interpreted in light of the unique aspects of the Canadian institutional context. Based on asymmetric risk properties of two different groups of executive compensation modes examined in this study, testing the substitution effects between alternative governance mechanisms is proposed as an interesting avenue for future research.

We propose a research agenda that can assist in developing a dynamic and comprehensive theory of boards of directors. It is based upon the concept of temporality, with time being organised around the life-cycle metaphor, and integrates research on agency theory, decision-making theory and resource dependence theory. We identify three key roles of boards of directors: 1) Monitoring and controlling top management 2) Involvement in strategic decision-making; and 3) Providing access to resources and networks. Our analysis suggests that boards perform all three roles, but that these roles change over time. We propose clear researchable questions for each stage of the organisational life cycle as well as the transition between the stages.

Debates about the ethics of executive compensation are dominated by familiar themes. Many writers consider whether the amount of pay CEOs receive is too large-relative to firm performance, foreign CEO pay, or employee pay. Many others consider whether the process by which CEOs are paid is compromised by weak or self-serving boards of directors. This paper examines the issue from a new perspective. I focus on the duties executives themselves have with respect to their own compensation. I argue that CEOs' fiduciary duties place a moral limit on how much compensation they can accept, and hence seek in negotiation, from their firms. Accepting excessive compensation leaves the beneficiaries of their duties (e.g., shareholders) worse off, and thus is inconsistent with observing those duties. (c) 2009 Business Ethics Quarterly.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between board composition and firm performance variance in the context of recent corporate governance reforms, based on the agency and organisational literatures. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses 384 of the top 500 Australian companies as its dataset. Board composition measures include the percentages of affiliated, executive and independent members on the board. Firm risk is represented by the standard deviation of shareholder return. Several control variables are introduced in the regression analysis. Findings - The results show a negative impact of executive directors on subsequent risk. Affiliated and independent directors, however, have no significant effect on the level of performance variance. Blockholders give a positive influence on firm risk. Moreover, companies with poor dividend payout or low managerial shareholdings tend to be riskier. Research limitations/implications - This paper does not examine the actual risk preference of individual directors, which could involve an attitudinal survey of board members. Future research may also examine the specific attributes towards risk for each type of affiliated directors. Practical implications - The findings cast doubts on the hope that promoting board independence would reduce agency conflicts relating to managerial risk aversion, and support the proposition that, although firms may comply with the demands for more independent directors, they could employ a number of tactics to neutralize the power of outsiders. Originality/value - The empirical work surrounding this topic has been scant. This study may present the first Australian empirical evidence on the relationship between board composition and firm performance variance. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether anti-director laws and legal director liability rules affect the diligence of directors in setting the compensation of CEOs. The study uses a world-wide data set covering 27 countries for the period 1995 to 2005. Research Findings/Results: Controlling for a number of legal and economic determinants, we find that independent of managerial risk-aversion, CEO pay is always less generous under stricter anti-director rules and a stronger rule of law. Director liability rules are associated with more generous pay schemes. The results persist once we control for the presence of institutional investors and cross-listing in the US. Theoretical Implications: Our results suggest that there exists an agency conflict between shareholders and outside directors reflected in the degree to which directors act diligently when negotiating the pay contract with the CEO. However, this conflict may be alleviated by specific legal rules making boards more accountable to shareholders. Private measures of shareholder protection do not seem entirely capable of substituting for legal institutions. Practical Implications: Reducing managerial agency cost is commonly viewed as a desirable policy goal. We advocate the view that specific legal institutions that strengthen procedural rights of shareholders' voting on directors and the overall quality of the legal system help to achieve this goal. Director liability rules, however, appear to be ineffective for this purpose. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - This paper aims to review how corporate governance is institutionalised in Nigeria and examine the relationship between board size, CEOs' duality, board composition and the board's involvement in strategy. Design/methodology/approach - A structured questionnaire was sent by post to the chairmen of 138 publicly quoted companies in Nigeria in November 2004. Findings - Using primary and secondary data, our results suggest that the Nigerian public companies have embraced some principles of the Code of Best Practices for Public Companies. There is a high level of board involvement in strategy decision-making process, but no correlation was found between board involvement and a number of governance variables (board size, board independence and CEO duality). Research limitations/implications - The sample of 39 responding companies is small although it represents a 28 per cent of response rate and is representative of the Nigerian stock market. However, we are unable to look at other factors such as industry sectors and we cannot generalise our findings regarding corporate governance practices in Nigeria. Practical implications - The investment climate in Nigeria can become more reassuring than in the past although there is room for further improvements as the effectiveness of the corporate government practices is still in doubt. Originality/value - This paper adds to the scanty literature available on corporate governance practices in developing, countries. Findings extend our understanding about the strategic functions of the board in Nigeria, which is Africa's most populous nation, and the world's sixth larger producer of oil.

The division between ownership and management and the existence of minority shareholders have led to the need for control systems which allow for the convergence of shareholders and managers' objectives. The disclosure of information for shareholders and corporate governance stand out among these control systems. This work analyses the nature of this relationship for non-financial Spanish quoted corporations. Unlike the current efforts devoted to improving both systems, our findings reveal a substitutive relationship, by showing the disclosure of less information in those companies whose Boards of Directors are more effective.

This research study focuses on the problems involved in nominating board members based solely on rules and regulations, which neglect the affective dynamics of board behaviour and board process. For example, choosing board candidates who are independent (not part of a company's management), a rule imposed by the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) guidelines, may ensure that an organisation remains listed on this lucrative exchange. However, it does not ensure that the candidates have the necessary knowledge or are well versed in the company's business activities to effectively serve on a particular board. Having independent board members does not ensure that they ask tough questions of themselves or of management or that they have an extensive network from which to draw for advice on strategic issues. These are equally important areas of board governance that cannot be ignored when choosing candidates for the board, and these questions should not be suppressed in favour of concentrating solely on formal concerns such as independence. Information about board characteristics can provide management theorists with a broader range of informal variables that can contribute to the decision-making process. Board characteristics assist the board in operating as a team, improving the efficiency of the board. Selecting board members with the most suitable and effective characteristics for a particular board ensures that directors are spending their limited time on the company's most important challenges. This research was carried out in several stages in order to gather both qualitative and quantitative data. In this research there was a significant relationship for values and decision-making and no relationship for TSXFormal and decision-making, which is consistent with the literature, suggesting there must be a change in executives values to ensure changes in behaviour. A corporate governance model was developed. This model helps in ensuring that boards populated with board members who have knowledge and values (skills matrices) are more aware of the detrimental effect that groupthink can have on the decision-making process. Several executives mentioned the ability of board members to apply due diligence to strategic decision-making. This means that directors apply their experience and expertise to better understand issues and bring these to bear upon the decision-making process. Additionally, knowledge, values and groupthink (skill matrices) may be used both when nominating new board members and as an annual evaluative tool. Businesses are continually diversifying and board members need to continuously embellish their skill set and knowledge in order to adapt. However, the finding and the development of this corporate governance model are significant as they mark the start of how board characteristics can be operationalised. What is needed is more balanced research that looks at both the formal and the informal system. In doing so, more articulate measures of board decision-making process will evolve. The business environment is ever changing and dynamic; research in these areas will convey the interrelationship between the formal and informal system. Nevertheless, this research is unique as it has investigated the formal and informal system using both primary qualitative and quantitative data analysis and therefore provides much needed information about the characteristics requisite for nominating board members.

An effective system of corporate governance has both internal and external aspects that have to be sufficiently responsive if governance is to succeed. In this book, Ahmed Naciri examines these two core aspects or the latest buzzword in business and management theory. Internal aspects include ownership structure, the board of directors and committees, internal control, risk management, transparency and financial reporting. External aspects can either be market-oriented, or can take the form of credit ranking, and/or social requirements. Due to the original orientation of the Sarbanes/Oxley Law, concentrating solely on financial disclosure and given its decisive and tremendous influence on all other similar corporate governance legislations all over the world, most writings on corporate governance have dealt with solely internal corporate governance mechanisms. This book aim is to fill up the gap by using a systemic approach and giving a global picture of the corporate governance theoretical foundations, mainly by putting the emphasis on its double dimension: internal and external.

This study investigated the intermediation of expropriation in the linkage between corporate governance and firm value. We manifested the triple principal-agent relationships among minority shareholders, majority shareholders and the board of directors, and conceptualized the expropriation as rents demanded by majority shareholders to compensate their agency function in a theoretical framework of internal and external corporate-control mechanisms for firms with concentrated ownership structure. By using related party transactions as a direct measure for expropriation, and the data of related party transactions between 2002 and 2006 on China's stock market, we corroborated the negative value effect of expropriation, and found that the controlling capability of controlling shareholders, ownership balancing, identity of controlling shareholders, stock incentives for the board/executives, and the proportion of tradable shares are significantly associated with expropriation. Our work on expropriation would provide insight to understand the relationship between corporate governance and firm value, and lay a basis for future theory building on corporate governance.

This article focuses on the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and the innovation policies in the Tunisian context from a cognitive perspective of corporate governance. The method used in this study is based on the regression analysis. We directly regress the board of directors' characteristics with the firm level of innovation. Our model includes some control variables such as the firm's size, the firm's sector of activity and even whether firm is listed or not. We empirically demonstrate that only the inside directors and the duality of the CEO are positively and significantly associated with the firm's level of innovation. Moreover, the empirical results show that the big size of the board has a negative impact on the development of innovative firms. In the same way, we demonstrate that the compensation system which is based on long-term objectives has no influence on the determination of the innovation policies in Tunisian firms.

122 initial public offerings (IPOs) occurring on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from January 1996 until September 2006 have been examined to assess the impact of institutional isomorphism on the selection of directors for boards facing the transition to listed companies. A high level of union representation as well as the restructuring of boards prior to an IPO and in anticipation of legal changes gives strong support for the influence of coercive isomorphism on IPO firms. Companies within industry sectors make similar choices with regard to their directors, their choices being dissimilar from their associates in other industry groupings. This supports the concepts underlying mimetic isomorphism. Finally normative isomorphism is largely supported by the reliance of corporations on a closed group of directors with similar educational backgrounds. All in all, societal and regulatory pressures, as modelled under institutional theory, are influencing the processes of corporate governance during an IPO.

Based on the results of a survey of 161 Canadian companies, this study focuses on board characteristics and their relationship to two essential board roles: strategy involvement and management monitoring. To examine these issues, a typology highlighting four possible board types is presented based on the level of independence and expertise of boards (authoritative, executive, institutional and convenient). The study demonstrates that board characteristics do have a significant impact on board roles. This study's findings are consistent with basic agency arguments regarding the importance of creating independent boards. However, it highlights the importance of board expertise as an essential criterion for board performance. Copyright (c) 2009, Inderscience Publishers.

This paper is a survey of the literature on boards of directors, with an emphasis on research done subsequent to the Benjamin E. Hermalin and Michael S. Weisbach (2003) survey. The two questions most asked about boards are what determines their makeup and what determines their actions? These questions are fundamentally intertwined, which complicates the study of boards because makeup and actions are jointly endogenous. A focus of this survey is how the literature, theoretical as well as empirical, deals-or on occasions fails to deal-with this complication. We suggest that many studies of boards can best be interpreted as joint statements about both the director-selection process and the effect of board composition on board actions and firm performance.

This article explores how the diversity of board resources and the number of women on boards affect firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR) ratings, and how, in turn, CSR influences corporate reputation. In addition, this article examines whether CSR ratings mediate the relationships among board resource diversity, gender composition, and corporate reputation. The OLS regression results using lagged data for independent and control variables were statistically significant for the gender composition hypotheses, but not for the resource diversity-based hypotheses. CSR ratings had a positive impact on reputation and mediated the relationship between the number of women on the board and corporate reputation. (c) 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The increased attention to women on corporate boards presents new challenges to governance research. In this paper we go beyond demography and open the " black box" of board behavior by drawing upon theories of gender differences and group effectiveness. Research Findings/Insights: A unique survey of 201 Norwegian firms is used. The findings suggest that the ratio of women directors is positively associated with board strategic control. In addition, we find that the positive effects of women directors on board effectiveness are mediated through increased board development activities and through decreased level of conflict. However, our results show no evidence for a positive association between women directors and open debate. Nonetheless, open debate enhances board's strategic and operational control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Recognizing the limitations of traditional governance theories to explain the role and contributions of women on corporate boards, this paper draws upon group effectiveness and gender differences theories to shed some light on whether and how women make a difference to board effectiveness in strategic and operational control. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Women's ability to make a contribution to the board may be attributable to their different leadership styles. The presence of women on corporate boards seems to increase board effectiveness through reducing the level of conflict and ensuring high quality of board development activities.

We develop the construct of board capital, composed of the breadth and depth of directors' human and social capital, and explore how board capital affects strategic change. Building upon resource dependence theory, we submit that board capital breadth leads to more strategic change, while board capital depth leads to less. We also recognize CEO power as a moderator of these relationships. Our hypotheses are tested using a random sample of firms on the S&P 500. We find support for the effect of board capital on strategic change, and partial support for the moderating effect of CEO power. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors' attention to monitoring represents an understudied topic in corporate governance. By analyzing hundreds of board meeting transcripts, we find that board members do not maintain constant levels of attention toward monitoring, but instead selectively allocate attention to their monitoring function. Drawing from the attention-based view, prospect theory, and the literature on power, we find that deviation from prior performance and CEO duality affect this allocation. Specifically, while negative deviation from prior performance increases boards' attention to monitoring, positive deviation from prior performance reduces it. The presence of duality also reduces the boards' allocation of attention to monitoring. Additional analysis demonstrates that the effects of duality are realized in part by the CEO-chair's control of the meeting's agenda and location. Finally, the results show that duality and deviation from prior performance interactively affect boards' attention to monitoring. In total, we find that board members do not consistently monitor management in order to protect shareholder value, a proposition often assumed within governance research; rather, our results demonstrate that board members' monitoring behaviors are contextually dependent. The contextual dependency of board attention to monitoring suggests that additional efforts may be needed to ensure the protection of shareholders' interests.

Using upper echelons theory and the concept of "faultlines," we argue that heterogeneity on a board of directors influences discussion of entrepreneurial issues in board meetings. We also propose that meeting context can influence such discussions. Results suggest that tenure variance, firm/industry background heterogeneity, and the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds are positively associated with a board's discussion of entrepreneurial issues. Weak faultlines increase and strong faultlines decrease such discussion. Meeting informality moderates these relationships: functional background heterogeneity decreases discussion of entrepreneurial issues, but the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds and strong faultlines increase it.

Our study investigates an unexplored succession process-interim CEO successions. We define an interim CEO succession as a case where the title of chief executive officer is vacated by the incumbent and the board of directors has not announced a permanent successor, but instead designates a particular individual as 'interim CEO,' or 'acting CEO,' or 'CEO until a permanent successor is named.' Theory predicts that interim CEO successions will lead to the type of disruption that can harm firm performance, even after a permanent successor is appointed. Our data show that interim CEO succession processes are widely employed by publicly-traded U.S. firms, and that they are associated with lower performance during the period in which the interim serves. However, whether the interim CEO also simultaneously serves as chairman moderates the impact of this type of succession on firm performance, as well as on long-term firm survival.

This study contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating how greater board of director control of management at a given firm can have unanticipated adverse effects on the leadership of-other-companies. We specifically show that greater board control reduces affected CEOs' willingness to provide various forms of strategic help (e.g., advice on strategic issues) to other CEOs, making it more difficult for other-company CEOs to access assistance on strategic matters that would otherwise enhance their firms' performance. Our theory and results indicate that these effects are mediated by CEOs' reduced social identification with the "corporate elite." (c) Academy of Management Journal.

An in-depth analysis of 11 cases is used to provide insight into the neglected area of the dynamics of boards in academic spin-offs. Drawing on stage-based, resource dependence, and social network theories, we explore board formation and changes in board composition occurring in Norwegian and US spin-offs. We find that these theories are important complements to earlier research on boards in technology-based new ventures. The process of board formation is mainly driven by social networks of the founders. Although we find differences in the initial board compositions in Norwegian and US spin-offs, there is convergence over time in subsequent board changes, which are mainly driven by the social networks of the board chair. Additions of key board members are associated with the progress of a spin-off developing from one stage to another. Several avenues for future research and implications are discussed.

Few aspects of corporate board diversity have generated the focused attention that the participation, position, and promise of women's service on the board has generated, especially in recent years. Of particular note is the extent to which women serve on large firm boards of directors (e.g., Fortune 500 firms). Increases in levels of participation have been described as glacial. While critics decry the level of participation of women on large-scale corporate boards, careful scrutiny suggests substantial progress. Concurrent with steady increases in the overall participation of women on corporate boards are increases in their presence on key board committees. Importantly, women's leadership of key board committees and their service as lead directors has improved in parallel with increases in their board memberships. These increases are particularly noteworthy in the post Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) period. Such trends suggest the continued progress of women in assuming prominent positions in the corporate governance landscape, and provide evidence that the increasingly challenging environment in the post-SOX era has not attenuated the gains noted in the pre-SOX period.

We highlight how directors and senior managers perceive the roles of a board to involve overseeing risk and compliance, strategy, governance, developing the CEO and senior management and managing stakeholders. We find that managers and directors perceive board effectiveness as linked to different combinations of these roles and that there appear to be differences in perceptions between different types of firms. We conclude that clarity around the board's role set is critical to furthering the corporate governance research agenda, and that the relationship between board roles and perceived board effectiveness differs between managers and directors.

Corporate governance and finance are dynamic academic fields that offer myriad opportunities for business ethics analysis. Within the corporate governance triad in recent years, shareholders have increased their power over boards of directors and executives through both regulation and movements to change corporate by-laws. The impact of board characteristics on firm performance has proven elusive, leading to questions concerning board processes and individual director beliefs and behaviors. At the same time, CEOs have lost considerable power, leaving many struggling to regain their control and maintain their compensation levels, while others adopt a stewardship approach to their posts. In the field of finance, the recent financial debacle has led to a reexamination of financial regulation and of the fundamental nature and purpose of the industry. All of these issues provide business ethicists fodder for investigation and analysis. (c)2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: Do the presence and independence of nominating committees within boards of directors affect the extent of rewards and sanctions provided by the labor market to directors with a reputation for being active in monitoring management? Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a director's reputation for being active in increasing control over management, the larger the number of his or her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that excludes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors. In contrast, we found that a director's reputation of being active in increasing control over management does not impact the number of his or her subsequent appointments (1) to boards without a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that includes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by executive directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director's appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of directors with reputations for being active in exercising control over managers. On the other hand, nonexistence of nominating committees or presence of weak nominating committees under the influence of the CEO decouple directors' reputations for being active in controlling management from the likelihood of obtaining new appointments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in increasing the efficiency of the labor market for directors. More specifically, it highlights the conditions under which directors with a reputation of being active in increasing control over management are likely to be rewarded by the labor market for directors. These conditions include (1) the creation of a nominating committee; (2) exclusion of the CEO from this committee; and (3) domination of this committee by outside directors.

Literature on acquisition places more concern on the consequence of an acquisition event and pays less attention to what factors influence the motive for initiating the acquisition strategy of a firm. Through the lenses of organizational learning and corporate governance theories, the study examine whether the prior acquisition experience and board characteristics affect firms' acquisition behavior. Hypotheses are tested on a sample of 92 acquisition events of Taiwanese electronics firms during the period from 1997 to 2007 by employing the survival function model. Empirical results indicate that business acquisition experience positively influence the inclination of the acquirer adopting a subsequent acquisition, while board characteristics do not relate to the likelihood of the acquirer making a subsequent acquisition. These findings provide theoretical and managerial implications for organizational learning and corporate governance theories in general and acquisition management in particular.

This study examines the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) pay fairness and future stakeholder management (SM) as well as the effect of the board of directors on this relationship. The results show that CEO pay fairness has an effect on future SM such that when underpaid, CEOs decrease SM and when overpaid, CEOs increase SM. Additionally, the relationship between CEO pay fairness and SM becomes stronger as the ratio of inside directors on the board increases, which suggests that as both management control increases and board diversity decreases, the CEO's control over SM increases. Implications for SM and CEO pay are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The board of directors is an important entity in a company, creating a link between shareholders and managers and therefore playing an important role in the governance of a firm. This study focuses on board structure and the extent of the corporate governance statement disclosure. This study found that the size of the corporate board does have some influence on the extent of the corporate governance statement disclosure. It is quite surprising to find that the rest of the variables involving the board structure do not have any association with the extent of corporate governance statement.

The study of the effectiveness of boards of directors is a tremendously interesting area of investigation, heightened by the many financial scandals of the recent past. Research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies like the inconsistency of many of the results achieved (Daily, Dalton and Cannella, 2003; Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand and Johnson, 1998; Johnson et al., 1996). It emphasises the need to go further with this research subject. Within this framework, our paper examines board effectiveness through board members' level of knowledge and experience and board structure. We understand that both dimensions: board composition and structure are not enough to board effectiveness but determine the potential to get a strategic capability. Our results show how board size, length of tenure of directors and board members' experience in senior management positions, have effects on firm financial performance.

This article presents both theoretical and empirical support for a movement from a traditional governance research paradigm towards a more holistic research approach. This includes taking into account behavioural, contingency and evolutionary theories, in an effort to better understand governance processes and effective board behaviour. Specifically, the authors highlight the importance of three groups of relationships (board dynamics, board-management relationships and board-stakeholder relationships) as contributing to good governance practice. Whilst historically researchers have largely ignored the behavioural aspects of corporate governance, the authors have made an attempt to open the 'black box' of governance processes and practices, and illustrate with examples from three New Zealand companies how the development of these relationships are important for effective board functioning.

We test whether Thai listed firms with higher levels of good governance policy adoption are less likely to violate listing rules and laws designed to protect shareholders. Our results suggest that firms on average implement, substantively as opposed to symbolically, recommended governance policies, as violations occur less frequently among firms with higher governance policy adoption scores. However, we also find evidence of symbolic governance among a small group of 'talk-only' firms that issue statements about governance while lagging in the adoption of policies related to shareholder rights and the board of directors.

Purpose - This paper aims to develop a model to assess the effectiveness and compliance of bank boards, taking into account their unique characteristics, financial industry standards and regulations. Design/methodology/approach - The literature on the roles and effectiveness of boards and directors in the financial industry is reviewed. Findings - The main finding in the literature suggests that evaluating the effectiveness of a board must include characteristics of the entire board as well as individual contributions of directors. Practical implications - Banking boards, more than in the past, must proactively evaluate their effectiveness and compliance with existing rules. Originality/value - The paper proposes a model for assessing the effectiveness and compliance of boards and directors of banking organizations, considering their characteristics, financial industry standards and regulations.

This study explores the influence Boards of Directors' demographic characteristics on the process of making strategic decisions. Empirical testing is based on a sample of 105 Greek companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. The results suggest that educational level affect both the financial reporting and the hierarchical decentralisation in the strategic decision-making process. Also, functional background of executives was found to be related with financial reporting. However, the educational specialty did not appear to have any significant influence on the strategic decision-making process. In light of these findings, implications for practitioners are made and avenues for future research are suggested.

Decades of research on corporate boards of directors resulting in diverse and often inconsistent findings have not dampened scholarly interest in the topic. Instead, researchers are attempting to more effectively model the board-firm relationship. One such modeling approach considers the power of the board in relation to top management. Drawing on upper echelons thinking (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) and the concept of managerial power (Finkelstein, 1992), this conceptual study develops the notion of board power in relation to CEO duality. Based on a framework composed of structural, ownership, expertise, and prestige power of the board, the study develops several propositions predicting the impact of board characteristics on a key aspect of managerial power - the appointment of the CEO to the position of board chair. This work contributes to scholarly understanding of the role of agency theory in explaining corporate governance phenomena by extending upper echelons thinking to the study of boards.

In the theoretical framework of corporate governance, this article studies the efficiency of the control exerted by the ownership structure and the board of directors on managers for the purpose of privileging investment in R&D. This efficiency is sensitive to national systems of governance. Tests realized on a sample of 531 U.S., Japanese and French firms with the canonical method corroborate the existence of positive relationships between concentration of ownership, the internal administrator dominance and the non-dual structure on the one hand, and the investment in R&D, on the other.

Using a large sample of European listed Companies and their Directors our study supports the hypothesis that European corporate governance do not yet converging towards a common model. Our results put in evidence in fact the existence of three dominant corporate governance profiles in European listed companies, different each others. The determinants of these profiles depend on the typical governance system adopted by the same companies and on country's culture and history; as a consequence, each of them has a own attitude of the board, in terms of structure, organization and skill mix characteristics. Finally we suggest some important implications on European governance practices.

The significance of boards of directors is often considered minor in unlisted companies due to the low degree of agency problems. Research on the topic has also been limited due to data access issues. However, networks are essential to the success of internationalizing new ventures and interlocked boards of directors have the potential to act as important information and resource conduits. To improve understanding on these dynamics, we performed an exploratory cluster analysis on board interlocks of Finnish software companies using board data we obtained from the Finnish Trade Registry and a custom survey. Our results indicate that companies that have international revenue are often interlocked with each other. In addition, companies without international revenue plan to internationalize if they have an interlock to a company that has international revenue. Our results are mirrored against management theory and future research is outlined. (c) 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The paper has two primary aims. First, to develop an appropriate network analysis to investigate whether any individual directors comprising the social network of New Zealand company directors is sufficiently connected so as to be in a position to exercise any form of cohesion, control or exertion of power. Second whether any directors could be identified as being in a position of power to take advantage of the network? This paper uses social network analysis to map and measure the structural features and patterns of relationships of the directors of companies listed on the New Zealand stock exchange and alternative exchange. The social network analysis was performed using the social network software Pajek(tm). The techniques used in the study reveal that the vertices (directors) in the network are moderately connected. The findings suggest that there is a small group of directors who are in a position to exercise cohesion, control and power over the network.

This paper examines the relationship between board of director independence and restructuring. Although poor performance driven by inadequate governance is a widely investigated antecedent of portfolio restructuring, it is also widely contested since governance structures of restructuring firms are automatically labeled as weak. Research has not proven that governance is weak in the pre-restructuring period, yet this philosophy has become institutionalized. This paper incorporates institutional arguments by suggesting that firms will adjust governance structures to reflect socially valid indicators of governance - greater board independence. Results revealed that firms do modify board independence in the post-restructuring period.

While a great deal of research has focused on the factors driving adoption of codes of best practice in corporate governance, only recently has the influence of the news media been considered. Corporate governance literature has largely converged upon internal monitoring and shareholder activist strategies as methods of shareholder protection following the decline of the market for corporate control. Commentators and activists alike have generally neglected the opportunity for an independent party, which watches over the management of companies, to guard shareholders' interests. Ireland is just one country where the value of media coverage of corporate governance violations to: (i) shareholders, (ii) policymakers and (iii) company directors has not been assessed. This paper investigates the reaction of these groups to newspaper coverage of corporate governance violations so as to determine the influence of the newspaper media on the corporate governance practices of public limited companies (plcs) listed on the Irish Stock Exchange. Using newspaper articles, media activity was analysed and measured in 15 instances of corporate governance violations and the relationships between this activity and the actions and behaviours of investors, policymakers and company directors as indicated by stock market data8, government reports9 and newspaper articles respectively were examined. Evidence from this study suggests that the Irish newspaper media influences (i) the boards of directors of Irish listed plcs, in that subsequent newspaper articles report reformatory measures taken by the boards in the vast majority of companies in the sample; (ii) the government authorities who are responsible for the legislative and regulatory infrastructure in which they operate, with statistical evidence of increases in government attention to corporate governance issues following increased newspaper coverage of theses issues and (iii) the investing decisions of investors in Irish listed plcs, with statistical verification of a relationship between movements in share price and volumes of newspaper articles relating to corporate governance violations by listed companies.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the educational qualifications and experience of executive and non-executive members of directorial boards in Australia. Inspired by Galbraith's (1967) analysis of the 'technostructure', we examine the educational qualifications of managerial (executive) directors and non-executive directors to assess the extent of divergences in the relevance (to the company's operations) of executives' and non-executives' educational qualifications. In addition, we measure the 'relatedness' of executives' and non-executives' educational qualifications to determine the extent to which the set of educational qualifications of executive directors diverges from that of non-executive directors. We find significant differences in the relevance of the educational qualifications possessed by executives and non-executives. We also find very low relatedness between the two sets of educational qualifications. The advantages of board diversity on the one hand and the disadvantages that may attend potentially sub-optimal technical information flow on the other are discussed.

This study contributes to the work on board composition and firm corporate social responsibility by extending it to the environmental domain. It evaluates the relationship between boards of directors' composition and environmental corporate social responsibility (ECSR) by integrating literatures on board composition, firm corporate social responsibility, and individual differences in attitudes toward and information about environmental issues. Using disclosed company data and the natural environment ratings data from Kinder Lydenberg Domini (KLD) Inc. for 78 Fortune 1000 companies, the study finds that a higher proportion of outside board directors is associated with more favorable ECSR and higher KLD strengths scores. Firms with boards composed of three or more female directors received higher KLD strengths scores. And, boards whose directors average closer to 56 years in age and those with a higher proportion of Western European directors are more likely to implement environmental governance structures or processes. Our results also reinforce growing concerns around unidimensional KLD measures. (c) 2011 SAGE Publications.

This study investigates the relationship between strong firm environmental performance and board characteristics that capture boards' monitoring and resource provision abilities during an era when the natural environment and the related strategic opportunities have increased in importance. The authors relate the proxy for strong environmental performance to board characteristics that represent boards' monitoring role (i.e., independence, CEO-chair duality, concentration of directors appointed after the CEO, and director shareholding) and resource provision role (i.e., board size, directors on multiple boards, CEOs of other firms on the board, lawyers on the board, and director tenure). The authors provide evidence consistent with both theories of board roles. Specifically, consistent with their agency theory-driven predictions, the authors find evidence of higher environmental performance in firms with higher board independence and lower concentration of directors appointed after the CEO on the board of directors. Consistent with resource dependence theory, they show that environmental performance is higher in firms that have larger boards, larger representation of active CEOs on the board, and more legal experts on the board. Their findings are generally robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. These findings have implications for managers, firms, shareholders, and regulators who act on behalf of shareholders, if they are interested in influencing environmental performance.

This study sought to investigate if there is a link between women on boards of directors and corporate sustainability. Using a sample of publicly listed firms from Australia, the results suggest some level of support that a link does exist. Boards that have a strong complement of gender diversity are expected to offer more effective monitoring of agents, as well as offer more stringent enforcement of ethical conduct, thereby minimizing affects of subversion of shareholder funds that can be detrimental to their returns. Accordingly, findings confirm a positive link between women on boards and economic growth. Because of their relational abilities, women on boards are more likely able to engage with multiple stakeholders and respond to their needs, resulting in an avenue for demonstrating social responsiveness, which is confirmed by the results. However, due to their backgrounds and work experiences, sex-based biases and stereotyping might exist in boardrooms with men directors discounting input from women directors on issues relating to environmental quality. The results of this study find that women directors are not significantly associated with environmental quality. Discussion is given to these findings along with paths for future research.

This paper offers a review of the theoretical and empirical literature addressing boards of directors within the unique organizational setting of family businesses. By reviewing and structuring past research, this paper aims to improve the understanding of how family involvement in firms affects the roles and behaviours of boards. The review of the literature is structured according to the family business board's two primary tasks as an internal administrative body, namely the exercise of control and the provision of advice. For both board tasks, theoretical perspectives and the match between theory and empirical findings will be discussed. The review concludes by offering an integrative discussion of the relevant theories and by highlighting the need for multi-theoretic, process and contextualized approaches in future research on boards of directors in family businesses.

This study extends work on independent directors to examine the influence of their human capital and social capital on investor reactions to the board's CEO selection decision. We predict that human capital, as represented by the board's CEO experience and industry experience, and social capital, as represented by directors' co-working experience on the board and external directorship ties to other corporate boards, will influence the stock market reactions to new CEO appointments. In a sample of 208 new CEO appointment events in U.S. manufacturing firms between 1999 and 2003, we found that the stock market reacted favorably to the appointments made by boards with higher levels of human and social capital. We also found that the effect of internal social capital was stronger when the new CEO was an insider rather than an outsider. The implications of the results for director selection and CEO succession are discussed. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Manuscript Tytpe: Empirical Research Question/Issues: The resource-based view of the firm may provide the theoretical explanation as to how boards can be a source of firm competitive advantage. Directors' experience, knowledge, expertise are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable resources that make up the board potential. These resources must be integrated with other firm resources in strategic processes through dynamics of relations. Research Findings/Insights: Given the preliminary nature of this work, the empirical section is an exclusive analysis of the board's potential. Our specific aim is to establish whether resources that directors bring to board are sources of board competence and ability with consequences for international strategic decisions. To do this, we use a sample of 562 board members of 45 listed Spanish companies. Our results show that average board tenure is negatively related to the firm's degree of international diversification. Directors with long tenures may operate from the basis of routines that are built up over time and their knowledge of the firm could eventually become a less valuable resource. The empirical findings also indicate that the directors' managerial experience within the specific industry to which the firm belongs and a high level of academic achievement affects the firm's degree of international diversification. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The contribution of this article is three-fold. First, it emphasizes the role of directors in board effectiveness, investigating why and how relevant elements of directors' human capital can enhance board ability to perform their roles making up the board potential. Secondly, it refines and extends the concept of "board capability" as an adequate configuration of potential and relationship dynamics that allow boards to undertake their task competently over time. Third, this article stresses the active participation of a board in firm internationalization. Practitioner/Policy Implications: One of the important practical implications of these results refers to the selection of board members. In order to increase board effectiveness, in the context of firm internationalization, the selection process must be guided by the search of intangibles, inimitable and unique resources, that the board can capitalize on in order to differentiate its potential over competitors.

We examine whether corporate governance matters more for firms facing financial distress. We theorize that financial crisis changes the relative costs and benefits of governance mechanisms and that more independent and smaller boards become more valuable in distressed firms. We further hypothesize that CEO power becomes increasingly beneficial as concentrated power allows the firm to respond more rapidly to the crisis. Event-history analysis of the failure of publicly traded Internet firms over the period 2000-2002 confirms our hypotheses. Our results suggest that the association between governance and survival depends on firm and environmental context and that one-size-fits-all prescriptions for governance mechanisms are therefore likely to be ineffective.

We develop and test a novel theory about strategic noise with regard to CEO appointments. Strategic noise is an anticipatory and preemptive form of impression management. At the time it announces a new CEO, a board of directors seeks to manage stakeholder impressions by simultaneously releasing confounding information about other significant events. Several CEO and firm characteristics affect the likelihood that this will happen. Strategic noise is most likely when long-term CEOs have a wide pay gap between other top managers at high stock price performance firms, and when a new CEO does not have previous CEO experience or comes from a less well-regarded firm. Results showing that CEO succession announcements are noisier than they would be by chance have some interesting implications for impression management theory, traditional event study methodology, and managerial and public policy. Interviews with public firm directors on CEO succession provide additional validity for the strategic noise construct and help us to articulate key elements of the theory.

Scholars and practitioners have recently devoted considerable attention to boards of directors, but far more research is needed. We still know little about how boards actually work and how their behavior may be improved to contribute to value creation. During more than two decades agency theory has been the dominant theory in studies about boards of directors. When relaxing some of the assumptions in agency theory several new pathways for new research arise. To present new perspectives on board research we follow in this essay some of the pathways arising from relaxing agency theory assumptions about complete contracts. Alternative theoretical approaches, research questions and methods are suggested. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Interactions between CEOs and their boards of directors are a prominent focus of management and strategy research. Despite the extensive literature on CEO-board relations, to date there has been limited integration of theoretical perspectives and measurement schemes. Through an extensive analysis of published studies, we hope to facilitate future research on CEO-board relations. We begin with a comparison of key theoretical approaches. Next, we conduct a content analysis of 51 empirical articles. We find that prior studies have an unbalanced focus regarding both topics and theoretical perspectives, and that there is limited consistency in the choice of measures. Based on this review, we lay out a number of promising directions for future research. We also find that, while there has been progress in international research on CEO-board relations, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the generalizability of governance theories across different geographic settings.

Each year shareholders, via exercise of their proxy votes, have the opportunity to voice their support or displeasure with firms and director nominees. Examining over 2,000 Fortune 500 director nominees, we explore those indicators available to shareholders at the time of directors' (re)election to provide insight into shareholder discontent with director monitoring. By studying actual voting behaviors, we provide new perspective to understanding director elections as a governance process. Employing a multilevel approach, we find support for agency-theoretic relationships between several firm and director characteristics and shareholder opposition to directors seeking (re)election to the board. At the firm level, we find that CEO compensation level and board size are positively related to the withholding of shareholder votes in director elections, a behavior indicative of shareholder discontent. Complementing these findings, at the director level, we find that affiliated director status, tenure, and number of outside directorships are positively related, and director block ownership is negatively related to shareholder discontent with director monitoring.

This study examines the influence of Mexico's efforts to improve corporate governance on firm performance and transparency. We utilize compliance data from the Code of 'Best' Corporate Practices, disclosed annually by public firms in Mexico, as a measure of corporate governance strength. We document a significant increase in compliance over 2000-2004 indicating Mexican companies view non-compliance as costly. However, we find no association between the governance index and firm performance, nor is there a relation with transparency. Instead, we find firms with greater compliance resort to the more costly mechanism of making dividend payments (higher propensity to pay and greater yield) to reduce agency conflicts. We conclude these associations are the direct result of the institutional features of the Mexican business environment, which is characterized by concentrated ownership of insiders, interlocked boards of directors, a lack of insider trading enforcement, and generally poor protection of minority investors. Our results show that monitoring mechanisms alone are not enough to fundamentally change economic behavior. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The origins of the global financial crisis have been attributed to the combination of a housing price bubble and innovative financial instruments, as well as the lack of restraint by corporate executives and boards to engage in excessive risk-taking. The rise in subprime lending between 1997 and 2005 played a crucial role in inflating the housing price bubble. We take a unique dataset of US financial institutions heavily engaged in subprime lending and ask the following research question: Did board configuration play a role in determining whether a financial institution specialized in subprime lending? Research Findings/Insights: We use a matched-pair sample of firms in the financial industry from 1997-2005 with half of the sample specializing in subprime lending and conduct panel data logistic regression analysis. We find that the board configurations of those financial institutions that engaged in subprime lending were significantly different from those that did not. Specifically, subprime lenders had boards that were busier, had less tenure, and were less diverse with respect to gender. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study uses the group decision making perspective in the context of subprime lending to examine board of director configuration and its influence on decision making processes around the issue of risky subprime lending. Findings show that how boards were configured did influence the decision to specialize in subprime lending. We find robust support for predictions based on the group decision making perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The deterioration of mortgage lending requirements that gave rise to the defaults of so many subprime loans, in retrospect, appears to be something that should have been entirely preventable. By demonstrating that subprime specialists had significant differences in board configuration that impacted group decision making, this study offers guidance to policymakers considering additional regulation and for corporate officers examining corporate governance issues.

This study explores the competing influences of different types of board interlocks on diffusion of a strategic initiative among a population of firms. We examine a broad social network of interlocking directors in U.S. firms over a period of 17 years and consider the likelihood that these firms will adopt a strategy of expansion into China. Results show that ties to adopters that unsuccessfully implement this strategy have a nearly equal and opposing effect on the likelihood of adoption as do ties to those that successfully implement the strategy. Ties to those that do not implement the strategy also have a suppressive effect on the likelihood of adoption. Furthermore, we examine a firm's position in the core-periphery structure of the interlocking directorate, finding that ties to adopters closer to the network core positively affect the likelihood of adoption. We discuss the implications of our study for social network analysis, governance, and internationalization research. (c) 2011 INFORMS.

Manuscript Type: Perspective Research Question/Issue: What were the reasons for poor risk management on the board level before and during the financial crisis? Were there systemic information processing problems that an alternative board design could alleviate? Research Findings/Insights: Using an information processing perspective, we identify two reasons for boards failing to manage risk well during the financial crisis: (1) board members did not have access to relevant information on the risks management incurred because they had no control over information supply; and (2) board members were unable to process the available risk-related information, and lacked incentives or power to influence managerial decision making. Based on insights from cybernetics and decision making theory, we suggest increasing board level information processing and decision making capabilities by including multiple boards for different stakeholders to create a division of power and labor. We label this alternative structure network governance and posit that it allows superior risk management. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The paper illustrates that the unitary board structure's systemic shortcomings increase the likelihood of poor risk management at the board level. The solutions proposed are an important theoretical advancement of the discussion on ongoing board failure in increasingly complex business environments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper is one of few providing actual recommendations based on a systemic insight. Enlightened shareholders and/or managers could introduce network governance by amending corporate constitutions. Regulators should require firms considered too big to fail to adopt network governance or pay the cost for regulators establishing a risk-monitoring unit in each firm.

Prior research shows that firms benefit from the social capital of their boards of directors but has not explored the antecedents of new director social capital. We argue that firms can attract directors with social capital by offering more compensation. We also argue that more complex firms (firms with a greater scale and scope of operations) are more attractive to such directors because of the greater experience and exposure that such directorships provide. Similarly, we argue that firms with high-status directors on their current boards will be more attractive to directors with social capital. We analyse the social capital of new outside directors added to boards of semiconductor firms between 1993 and 2007. Surprisingly, we find no support for the hypothesis that higher compensation is associated with adding directors with high status or board ties. However, firm complexity is associated with the ability to add new directors who have social capital, and the status of current board members is associated with the ability to add new directors who also have high status.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of prior firm performance on board composition and governance structure. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 90 companies listed on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations were used for this study. Hypotheses were tested using both general linear regression and logit regression analyses. Findings: The results showed that prior negative change in firm performance was significantly related to a decrease in the overall number of directors and a decrease in the number of outside directors. Research limitations/implications: The sample size used in this study was relatively small and the focus was on small to medium-sized firms, so the results found here may not apply to firms larger than those used in our sample. Practical implications: Directors may want to consider the implications for governance practices found in this study, specifically, whether smaller boards with fewer outsiders are appropriate following periods of performance decline. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine the effects of trends in prior firm performance on board composition and chief executive officer duality.

Background: Despite pressures to change the role of hospital boards, hospitals have made few changes in board composition or director selection criteria. Hospital boards have often continued to operate in their traditional roles as either "monitors" or "advisors." More attention to the direct involvement of hospital boards in the strategic decision-making process of the organizations they serve, the timing and circumstances under which board involvement occurs, and the board composition that enhances their abilities to participate fully is needed. Purposes: We investigated the relationship between broader expertise among hospital board members, board involvement in the stages of strategic decision making, and the hospital's strategic focus. Methodology/Approach: We surveyed top management team members of 72 nonacademic hospitals to explore the participation of critical stakeholder groups such as the board of directors in the strategic decision-making process. We used hierarchical regression analysis to explore our hypotheses that there is a relationship between both the nature and involvement of the board and the hospital's strategic orientation. Findings: Hospitals with broader expertise on their boards reported an external focus. For some of their externally-oriented goals, hospitals also reported that their boards were involved earlier in the stages of decision making. Practice Implications: In light of the complex and dynamic environment of hospitals today, those charged with developing hospital boards should match the variety in the external issues that the hospital faces with more variety in board makeup. By developing a board with greater breadth of expertise, the hospital responds to its complex environment by absorbing that complexity, enabling a greater potential for sensemaking and learning. Rather than acting only as monitors and advisors, boards impact their hospitals' strategic focus through their participation in the strategic decision-making process.

Posited on the asymmetric features of equity ownership and stock option pay, this article examines the extent to which acquisition activities affect boards of directors' decisions to restructure the incentive design of executive compensation packages in the post-acquisition period.For a recent dataset of 148 deals between 1996 and 2009, the article finds that acquirers' overpayment for target firms and equity financing are likely to require scapegoating, particularly under conditions of intervening poor performance and stronger board vigilance, inducing directors to respond to CEOs' overly risky and suboptimal selection of acquisition terms by enlarging the proportion of equity ownership disincentives at the expense of stock option incentives in executive pay contracts.By linking the incidence of large acquisition deals to an altered agency problem, the article proposes an alternative way to gauge how corporate boards enact their monitoring responsibilities based on CEOs' recent past strategic choices.(c) The Author(s) 2011.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study examines the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries maintain active boards of directors. Active boards are in this study defined as boards that perform tasks beyond fulfilling local legal requirements. We focus on both monitoring and service roles. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a sample of 83 foreign subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is a world mandate subsidiary, which has worldwide responsibility for a product line and performs a broad scope of value-added activities. Moreover, a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is larger relative to the multinational enterprise (MNE), if it has a higher level of local responsiveness, and if its past performance is poorer. Additionally, the presence of an active board in a foreign subsidiary is related to other control mechanisms deployed in the subsidiary. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results highlight the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries are likely to maintain active boards. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that agency theory and resource dependence theory are relevant and complementary in the analysis of active boards in foreign subsidiaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that an active board may be a control mechanism to govern foreign subsidiaries and an instrument to deal with the external environment. Corporate governance regulators may consider developing governance recommendations that emphasize the importance of subsidiary boards in the oversight of foreign subsidiaries.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate an interesting yet mostly ignored distinction within external CEO successions: outside successors who have previous CEO experience and those who do not. It examines stock market reaction, compensation and firm performance prior and post-succession. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used an event study, "Patell Z-statistic" and "Rank Z-statistic" to test cumulative abnormal return before and after the successions. They also used probit and OLS regressions to examine firm performance and CEO compensation prior and post-succession. Findings - The authors find that the stock market reacts positively to the hiring of an outsider who is an exCEO. Compared with firms that hire non-exCEOs, firms that hire exCEOs had higher debt ratios and greater bankruptcy chances pre-succession, but post-succession, these firms still have worse financial performances. Non-exCEOs come from better performing firms than exCEOs. There is no consistently significant difference in compensation between an exCEO and a non-exCEO, though the compensation for both increases significantly from that of the predecessors and that of their previous positions. Research limitations/implications - Future research could focus on the cost-benefit tradeoff of hiring an exCEO. It would be interesting to examine the role of the board of directors in assessing this cost-benefit tradeoff and determining the optimal choice for the firm. An important aspect that has not been sufficiently examined in the literature is the CEO fit. Hiring an exCEO may not always be the right choice for the firm. Another area for future research could examine how the post-succession performance is affected by exCEO tenure in previous CEO position(s) and whether the exCEO worked in several industries or in the same industry. Practical implications - This paper also has implications for the board of directors. There seems to be a negative transfer of human capital when it comes to hiring exCEOs. The human capital theory suggests that job-specific experience positively relates to job performance. According to Hamori and Koyuncu, prior CEO experience may "lead to the formation of knowledge corridors and decision-making templates that make it difficult for individuals to take in inconsistent information or take actions that are different from past ones in a changed context. This, in turn, undermines performance". Boards of directors should put more effort into considering inside relay successions and should be cautious when hiring an outsider who has prior CEO experience. A best-of-both-worlds scenario may be for boards to hire exCEOs into top executive positions, such as COO and/or president, so as to give them a chance to be groomed for the top position and familiarize themselves with the firm while still benefiting from their prior CEO experience. Originality/value - There is very little research on the distinction between outside CEOs with previous CEO experience and those with no such experience. This paper tries to shed some light on this important issue in corporate governance in order to explain why boards of directors would hire an outsider with or without previous CEO experience.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the effect of CEO preference proxied by CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity on non-CEO executive turnover, and how such effect is moderated by CEO power-related variables (the CEO's founder status and CEO ownership) and firm performance in a sample of Chinese listed companies. Research Findings/Results: The results show that when CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity is inconsistent with social norms (e.g., the non-CEO executive is older and has longer team tenure than the CEO), the non-CEO executive is more likely to exit from the TMT. This association is strengthened by the CEO's founder status and low firm performance, whereas it is weakened by CEO ownership. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The theory of organizational politics proposes that competition among top managers plays an important role in the internal monitoring of firms. In contrast with most literature centering on the role of non-CEO executives in CEO turnover and succession, this study focuses on what kind of non-CEO executives CEOs are likely to dismiss and demonstrates how this process is influenced by CEO power and low firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Given a CEO's intention to dismiss a non-CEO executive when CEO-executive demographic dissimilarity is inconsistent with social norms, particularly when the CEO is powerful and firm performance is low, the board of directors should keep an eye on any conflict of interests or power struggle between the CEO and the non-CEO executive. The CEO should also be prudent in making executive turnover decisions, because the implications of dismissing such a non-CEO executive for reasons relating to firm performance are largely unknown.

In the wake of this decade's corporate scandals, crimes and excesses, improving the effectiveness of corporate governance in the United States has become a priority. An important influence on a board's effectiveness at monitoring is its members degree of independence from senior management. While the current definition of independence revolves around the absence of familial and economic connections between a firm and its directors, research suggests that this standard may be inadequate in ensuring independent oversight. Rather, diversity along racial, gender and other dimensions has been proposed as a potentially more effective standard for board independence. This is especially welcome news for women, who currently comprise 51 per cent of the US managerial workforce but only 14.8 per cent of the directors on boards of large, publicly traded US corporations. Some explain the current dearth of women board members by claiming that there are no qualified women available for board service and/or that women are not interested in board service. However, there is more anecdotal rather than empirical evidence on the issue. Surveying women at a women's leadership conference in Boston, this research investigates the extent to which women are currently involved in some type of board service and the extent to which women aspire to future board service. We find that women are currently more active in governance activities than prior research on corporate boards suggests and that they aspire to play a continued and expanded role in governance activities.

The concept of stakeholder engagement is gaining increasing attention in the mainstream media and may feature as part of a corporation's strategy for corporate social responsibility. Not only are boards considering how they might engage with key stakeholders, but stakeholders are also pursuing greater participation in the strategic decisions of companies in which they invest. While this is an emerging concept in companies governed by unitary boards, as in North America, the issue of stakeholder engagement in various forms is also entering debate in other countries around the world. In general, however, the idea of shareholder or stakeholder representation on the boards of most UK and Commonwealth companies is anathema. Forces now influencing the development of strategies for stakeholder engagement and the rise of active investors include changing corporate governance rules which give investors more power in the election of directors, the increasing role of pension plans and hedge fund investment groups which have produced investors who keep a close eye on company performance and value, and a sluggish or turbulent stock market as a result of the financial crisis initiated by the credit crunch in the sub-prime mortgage markets. In this paper the phenomenon of stakeholder representation is examined and results of a recent survey conducted among a large sample of New Zealand directors are presented. The findings suggest that these traditionally oriented boards are increasingly inwardly focused and are without an agenda for building and managing shareholder and stakeholder relations. Accordingly, such boards are unlikely to regard stakeholder engagement as a serious strategic issue and are thus also likely to miss significant opportunities in the changed business environment to benefit from stakeholder support.

Purpose: Amid ongoing criticism that corporate boards do not receive adequate information to help them fulfill their current and emerging roles, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the type of information directors receive. Specifically, to examine whether greater board independence and greater board expertise were associated with receiving more information, in five specific categories. Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses about the relationships between the composition of corporate boards and the various types of information they receive were tested by means of a survey of 161 Canadian companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Findings: The authors findings indicate a strong association between board expertise and each type of information received and suggest a weaker relationship between board independence and information received. Specifically, the results demonstrate that more independent boards do not receive larger amounts of information that is more forward-looking in nature. Research limitations/implications: These findings contribute to the literature on governance by providing relevant empirical evidence, based on primary data on board information issues. However, these results must be interpreted within the context of the use of various perceptual measures. Practical implications: Now that the composition of corporate boards has changed considerably, the findings of this study underline the need to re-examine the supporting information processes. Hence, this study should help provide guidance to organizations examining the content of their current information strategy. Originality/value: An important contribution of this study is its detailed characterization of the information provided to corporate boards, including financial and non-financial information and reflecting the five traditional stages of the strategic management process.

Stakeholder theorists distinguish between normative stakeholders, those who gain moral standing by making contributions to the firm, and derivative stakeholders, those who can constrain the corporate association even though they make no contribution. The board of directors has the legal authority to distinguish among these stakeholder groups and to distribute rights and obligations among these stakeholder groups. To be sure, this stakeholder formulation appropriately seizes on the firm's voluntary, associative character. Yet, the firm's constituents contribute assets and incur risks to participate in market, economic activities. And, as such, the firm's "stakeholders" must share an imperfect language to assist in making two key economic decisions: (1) who are the legitimate and who are the derivative stakeholders; and (2) who should sit on the board? Still, stakeholder theorists have good reason to be skeptical of neoclassical economics. Its assumptions that all act opportunistically and that all can calculate rationally and fully hardly correspond to studies on the managerial experience of corporate coordination. However, advances in behavioral law and economics now provide a cogent economic logic that readily fits into a stakeholder mode. In brief, we argue that (1) the firm's economic purpose designates legitimacy to core stakeholders, to those who add value, assume unique risk, and can incur harm; (2) the board serves as the principal who coordinates these core stakeholders to sustain competitive advantage and new wealth creation; and (3) state incorporation law, Delaware in particular, reinforces the board's function. These, in turn, supply selection criteria for board membership. We aim to synchronize concepts from behavioral law and economics with stakeholder theory. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Stemming from different theoretical perspectives the article examines the conflicts of interest arising among the actors (citizens, local governments, private shareholders, service providers) that at various levels are involved in local public utilities governance systems. The main results of a multiple case study analysis on 10 Italian listed local public utilities are summarized. Different and coexisting situations of conflicts of interest among multiple principals and agents are identified. In this context, governance mechanisms (e.g., the board of directors) have different roles and functions and may prevent and mitigate such conflicts. However, our findings suggest that the ownership structure influences board composition and functioning and that higher numbers of independent directors do not necessarily mean "actual" board independence. The article contributes to the debate on conflicts of interest and governance mechanisms in local public utilities. (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Boards of directors are a vital part of corporate governance systems. In the on-going discussion about the development of national corporate governance systems, however, little interest has been given to the issue of how and why board behavior changes over time. In this article, we use an institutional approach and study the development of board behavior in Sweden between 1994 and 2004 and if it is affected by board composition and board network characteristics. In order to do so, we introduce the constructs of board activities, i. e. what the boards do, and board involvement, i.e. when in the decision process they get involved. Findings show that range of board activities and board involvement have increased drastically during this period, which indicates a change in the logic of appropriateness of Swedish board behavior. There are robust indications that new types of actors affect activities and involvement positively, as do board interlocks, whereas network centrality affects activities and involvement negatively.

This research focuses on the board role evolution analysis which took place simultaneously with the development of different corporate governance theories and perspectives. The purpose of this paper is to provide understanding of key factors that make a board effective in the performance of its role. We argue that analysis of board role performance should incorporate both structural and process variables. This paper's contribution is the development of an integrative model that aims to establish the relationship between the board structure and processes on the one hand, and board role performance on the other.

The theoretical framework for a comprehensive trust model is presented using McAllister's affect- and cognitive-based trust model and Siegrist, Earle, and Gutscher's trust-confidence-cooperation model as the foundation. The enhanced model includes cognitive and affective domains of personality, culture, motivation, reliability, competence, and intuition (as a latent variable) to measure perception of trust between two individuals. The model applies the intercognition of self-leadership for improving trust and building effective relationships within boards of directors. Furthermore, the authors consider the multiplicity of board of director roles and how such complexity affects formation and maintenance of optimal trust. (c) Baker College 2011.

This research examines how the board of directors affects the relationship between Research and Development (R&D) investment and firm performance. The study, conducted on a sample of French companies listed on Euronext Paris, shows that the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance is significantly positive. However, this relationship varies significantly with the characteristics of the board of directors. Specifically, the results show that board independence, chief executive officer and chairman duality and the number of board meetings have a positive effect on the R&D investment-firm performance relationship, whereas board size affects this relationship negatively.

This work aims to contribute to the field of research on Agency Theory, based on an approach that is different from the previous literature. It focuses on analysis of characteristics of the structure of the Board of Directors as mechanisms for control over the level of remuneration awarded to executive personnel, both in the context of "concentrated" as well as "dispersed" share ownership, with the aim of determining whether or not the postulates of this theory are applicable to both. To achieve this objective, the study is based on a sample of 80 traded Spanish companies for the period 2004-2007, to which crosscutting and panel data models are applied. The results obtained show that the characteristics that define the structure of the Board of Directors constitute efficient mechanisms for supervision and control of compensation received by Top Management, although its influence in this regard is conditioned by the concentration of ownership.

The role of boards in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. Over the last four decades, research on the relationship between boards of directors and strategy has proliferated. Ye t to date there is little theoretical and empirical study regarding the question of how board information affects the boards of directors' strategic involvement. Using a survey data from 104 responses of chairpersons collected in the year of 2010 in China, we examine how board information affects boards' behaviors of strategic involvement. Our study shows that quality of information, information diversity, frequency of board interaction, and proactive seeking information positively influence boards' strategy monitoring and advisory. These findings provide empirical support for agency theory and resource dependence theory on boards. (c) 2011 IEEE.

This study examines the relationship between board structure and board process on capital structure decisions of Malaysian public listed companies. The study combines a survey approach and secondary data from the year 2007 to 2009. Based on a sample of 175 companies, the findings reveal that directors' risk appetite is positively correlated to company leverage while directors' tenure has negative relationship with leverage. With regards to board process, four variables are identified to be negatively correlated to capital structure which is boards' risk oversight, performance of independent directors, CEO's performance evaluation and accessibility of information.

In an environment with poor quality of Corporate Governance Mechanisms, the quality of directors' attributes might exert an important role to improve firm's value and performance. I developed an index to explore the quality of Board of Directors based on Brazilian and international corporate governance codes to measure directors qualitative attributes. The sample consist in 24 Brazilian firms that traded at NYSE in the period over 1999-2006. The results show us that board of directors with high types of attributes can improve value measured individually and by the quality index. The main results indicate that firm value improved with high types of professionals, accountants seated in boards, directors with high level of education and that participated in executive training.

The literature on the relationships between board attributes and corporate performance is mixed, and one important reason is that the intermediate variable, i.e., board behaviors are ignored. With the data coming from listed company of China, the paper empirically researches the relationship between the characteristics and monitoring function of board. Using Principal Component Analysis, we get 6 variables reflecting the characteristics of board and 4 variables for the monitoring function. The study shows that the share held ratio of board's members has a negative impact on the directing function of board significantly, but the gender ratio and the average age of board members has a positive impact on the position function of board significantly. This may be valuable to regulate the behavior of board. (c) 2011 IEEE.

Through the lens of agency theory, the paper examines the conflicts of interest arising among the actors (citizens, Local governments, private shareholders, service providers, etc.) that, at various levels, are involved in local public utilities governance systems. The main results of a multiple case study analysis on ten Italian listed local public utilities are summarized by identifying different and co-existing situations of conflict of interest among multiple principals and agents. Although governance mechanisms (e.g., the board of directors) have different roles and functions and may prevent and mitigate such conflicts, our findings pointed out that various problematic issues exist. First, the effects of the ownership structure on board composition and functioning needs to be further explored. Second, higher numbers of independent directors do not mean actual board independence. Third, service charters as tools for promoting transparency, accountability and public participation are not well implemented yet. The chapter contributes to the debate on local public utilities governance suggesting possible agency theory developments by focusing on different forms of citizens' participation (e.g., co-production).

In Spanish listed firms, taking into account the predominant modes of ownership structure, which are characterized by a high concentration of shares in the hands of a few shareholders who are strongly represented on the board of directors, it might suppose that there are strong stimulus for a close top managers' supervision and a straight interest alignment. However, the empirical evidence indicates the opposite, and this paradox needs to be explained within the theoretical framework of institutional theory. The high concentration of ownership and the high level of cross-holdings generate conflicting interests by those who have multiple roles as directors and top managers, suggesting that board's supervisory effectiveness may be compromised by social pressures in search of legitimacy. These features of Spanish firms are undermining governance mechanisms, and may explain the high pay levels, the low variable packages and, in general, the lack of connection between top managers' compensation and firm performance in comparison with those in other countries of Continental Europe.

Corporate governance scholars are increasingly interested in firms' social and environmental performance. Empirical research in this area, however, has moved forward in an uncoordinated fashion, producing fragmented and contradictory results. Our paper seeks to address this situation by adopting a fact-based research approach that comprehensively explores the link between corporate governance and environmental performance. Specifically, we aim to understand how the relationships between and among the firms' owners, managers, and boards of directors influence environmental performance. We are particularly interested in understanding the interactions among these three key sets of actors. In the end, we offer some observations about governance practices and discuss the implications for theory. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Prior research on CEO succession has omitted consideration of a critical institutional reality: some exiting CEOs do not fully depart the scene but instead remain as board chairs. We posit that predecessor retention restricts a successor's discretion, thus dampening his or her ability to make strategic changes or deliver performance that deviates from pre-succession levels. In short, a predecessor's continuing presence suppresses a new CEO's influence. Based on analysis of 181 successions in high technology firms, and with extensive controls (for circumstances associated with succession, the firm's need and capacity for change, and for endogeneity), we find substantial support for our hypotheses. In supplementary analyses, we find that retention has a more pronounced effect in preventing a new CEO from making big performance gains than in preventing big drops. (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We build on a stakeholder-agency theoretical perspective to explore the impact of particular corporate governance mechanisms on firm environmental performance. Our empirical evidence shows that several important corporate governance mechanisms such as the board of directors, managerial incentives, the market for corporate control, and the legal and regulatory system determine firms' environmental performance levels. These results suggest that these different governance mechanisms resolve, to some extent, the existing divergence of interests between stakeholders and managers with respect to environmental activities.

Director selection is a critical board process and outcome that influences the board and its overall performance. Because of this influence, research from a variety of different disciplinary areas examines the antecedents and outcomes of director selection. The authors offer a synthesis of this literature from these different disciplines. The authors first delineate the process that drives the selection of an individual to a board. They then review and categorize the director selection literature into two distinct perspectives-a rational economic perspective focused on the organization-level benefits driving the selection decision and a socialized perspective emphasizing the social processes that influence the director selection process. Finally, from their review, the authors suggest promising areas of future research regarding director selection. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of corporate board characteristics on the financial performance of Nigerian quoted firms. Board characteristics studied comprise board size, board skill, board nationality, board gender, board ethnicity and CEO duality. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed the random-effects and fixed-effects generalised least squares (GLS) regression to test the six hypotheses formulated for the study, while controlling for firm size and firm age. Findings: Using panel data from 122 quoted firms in Nigeria between 1991 and 2008, it was found that board size, CEO duality and gender diversity were negatively linked with firm performance, whereas board nationality, board ethnicity and the number of board members with a PhD qualification were found to impact positively on firm performance. The result of the robustness test using the same board characteristics for 160 small firms showed that board duality was positively linked to firm performance, while a PhD qualification was negatively linked to firm performance. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of the board-performance link by examining both the traditional variables such as board size, CEO duality and other organisational attributes such as ethnic diversity, foreign nationality and competence variables represented by women and PhD holders, respectively. The results provide an insight for practitioners and policy makers on the importance of relying on institutional specifics in the prescription of corporate governance codes. Originality/value: The study adds value to the global corporate governance discourse in two ways: first, the use of Nigeria, which is claimed to have one of the weakest business cultures in the world, and secondly, using a good number of proxies that are country-specific for corporate boards.

Using a sample of 4,278 listed UK firms, we construct a social network of directorship-interlocks that comprises 31,495 directors. We use social capital theory and techniques developed in social network analysis to measure a director's connectedness and investigate whether this connectedness is associated with their compensation level and their firms overall performance. We find connectedness is positively associated with compensation and with the firm's future performance. The results do not support the view that executive and outside directors use their connections to extract economic rents. Rather the company compensates these individuals for the resources these better connections provide to the firm. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The prevalence of ownership concentration in Asian firms presents a challenge to the influential agency theory-based understanding of the role of corporate boards. In this paper we develop and test hypotheses about board attributes and firm performance that reflect Asian institutional conditions. We present the first meta-analysis of the relationship between board attributes and performance of Asian firms using a varied set of meta-analytical techniques on a database of 86 studies covering nine Asian countries. First, we find that board structure and composition preferences are influenced by the identity of the concentrated owner. Second, consistent with US data, we find very limited evidence of a direct relationship between board attributes and firm financial performance in the Asian context. Third, we find that the relationship between board structure and composition and firm performance is mediated by the revealed strategic preferences of Asian firms specifically by the level of R&D investment.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: To what extent can group faultlines and their potential value-destroying effects be detected on corporate boards? Task-related attributes of the type of directorship, education, board tenure, and financial background of board members are considered as directors' characteristics that give rise to the faultline phenomenon. The impact of task-related faultlines on firm performance as well as the moderating effects of busy boards, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) tenure, executive directors' (EDs) compensation structure, and the average non-executive directors' (NEDs) involvement in board committees are examined. Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel of FTSE 350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find a strong negative effect of task-related faultlines on firm performance. Further exploration of the moderating effects demonstrates that the condition of a busy board and CEO tenure exacerbate the negative effects of faultlines. At the same time, the executive pay contingency is found to have a remedying effect on boardroom cohesiveness, whereas the involvement of NEDs in board committee work is not likely to make the adverse effects of board faultlines less pronounced. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the arguments of social identity theory, this study shows that task-related faultlines on corporate boards have strong negative value-creating implications. The positive moderating impact of the executive compensation structure renders support to agency theory predictions about executive incentive alignment. This work also underlines the usefulness of the concept of faultlines in the corporate governance literature, because unitary boards, where NEDs and EDs share board responsibility, exhibit pre-existing factions, similar to top management teams of family-controlled firms and teams managing international joint-ventures. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This research points to the importance of a careful selection process of directors by nomination committees. It also underlines the role for active leadership on boards, who should be aware of available strategies to ameliorate the negative consequences of board schisms, such as accentuating superordinate board identity and/ or informal meetings.

Corporate governance research indicates that corporate boards of directors may be overly beholden to management, which can be detrimental to firm value creation. Drawing upon agency theory and the governance law literature, we examine the effects of a new SEC rule designed to lessen managerial power by increasing large, long-term shareholders' influence in the director nomination process. We predict and find support for a positive overall market reaction to the rule's announcement as well as a greater reaction for firms with characteristics that suggest compromised board independence or greater CEO control. Moreover, we examine the implications of greater shareholder voice for another key stakeholder group, firm bondholders, and find evidence that it is also value increasing. We conclude by discussing important implications for theory and practice. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Directors may play their most important role during organizational crisis; however, extant research suggests that they are often more willing to exit than remain on the board of a firm facing a crisis. We develop theory regarding directors' voluntary exit by integrating insights from identity theories with the organizational crises literature. Specifically, we model how directors' individual, relational, and collective identities work sometimes in concert and other times in opposition to each other to influence directors' voluntary decisions to remain on or exit from a board facing an organizational crisis.

This study examines the impact of corporate boards on firm performance during the current financial crisis. Using buy-and-hold abnormal returns over the crisis to measure firm performance, we find that board independence, as traditionally defined, does not significantly affect firm performance. However, when we redefine independent directors as outside directors who are less connected with current CEOs, a measure we call strong independence, there is a positive and significant relationship between this measure and firm performance. Second, outside financial experts are important for firm performance. We find that the positive impact of outside financial experts on firm performance is more significant than that of strong independence. Overall, our results suggest that firm performance during a crisis is a function of firm-level differences in corporate boards. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The global financial crisis in 2008 has generated increasing recognition of the importance of board diversity reflected amidst the capabilities and skills of directors on a board. As the primary institutional mechanism designed to strengthen the director selection process, nomination committees (NCs) occupy centre stage of this discussion. However, there is a dearth of studies which focus either specifically on NCs or on diversity as a board composition outcome. In this study, we examine the research question of the likely antecedents in terms of NC characteristics of two board composition outcomes, i.e., diversity as variety in terms of gender and nationality, and diversity as separation in terms of a board demographic faultline. Research Findings/Insights: For a panel of FTSE350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find that the increasing presence on the NC of females or non-British nationals is likely to have a positive impact on the level of board gender and nationality diversity, respectively. In addition, we report that the presence of the chief executive officer (CEO) on the NC is found to interact with the NC independence, as a result of which a board demographic faultline is likely to emerge. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We bring together three concepts from social psychology research to create the theoretical basis for our study of the influence of NCs on board diversity: these are similarity-attraction, homosocial reproduction, and social identity. The strong empirical findings suggest that these socio-psychological dimensions are applicable to the operations of NCs, which has implications for the outcomes of the director nomination and selection process, and consequently also for board composition. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research indicates that NC characteristics are significant antecedents of board diversity, hence composition of the NC is an important step and pre-requisite for assembling a diverse board. For example, appointing females and/or non-nationals to the NC increases the likelihood of greater representation of females and/or non-nationals on the entire board. At the same time, our evidence suggests that the presence of the CEO amidst the majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) on the NC is detrimental for board cohesiveness.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether director interlocks enable or inhibit a firm's adoption of a proactive environmental strategy. Specifically, using resource dependence theory, we argue that director interlocks with suppliers are linked to varying likelihoods that a firm adopts a proactive environmental strategy, depending on the relation between the provided resources and the environmental approach. Research Findings/Insight: Based on a sample of US electric firms, our results show that director interlocks with firms providing knowledge-intensive business services are positively linked to the adoption of proactive environmental strategies. However, director interlocks with firms providing financial resources and fossil fuel are negatively related to the adoption of these strategies for our sample. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Board linkages may enable and inhibit proactive environmental strategies. We contribute to resource dependence theory by offering empirical evidence that the reduction of uncertainty about critical resources by director interlocks may either make business change easier or constrict a firm's autonomy, making change more difficult. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The influence of interlocking directors varies depending on the type of resources that director interlocks transfer to their organizations. As a result, the selection of specific director interlocks can become very important to the strategic goals of the firm. Regulators should continue to pay attention to potential risks for other stakeholders from director interlocks. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper investigates gender differences on the corporate boards of Finnish listed companies. The personal characteristics, careers, and boardroom roles of female and male directors on boards were analyzed on the basis of empirical data collected by questionnaire. An analysis of the findings revealed only minor differences between the women and men in personal characteristics such as their marital status, number of children and education, or in their careers. However, female board members were on average younger than their male counterparts and considered themselves to be more protean, took more active roles on the board, and enjoyed power more than men did. They also felt a need for more women on the board. The goal of this study is to contribute to the existing research in two ways. Firstly, it provides empirical evidence on women's representation on boards from Finland, where women's and men's rights are regarded as more equal than in many other countries. Secondly, the study aims to increase our knowledge of gender differences, careers and roles of women in top positions in Finnish business. (c) 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This article brings together research on philanthropy, family business, and governance to examine patterns of giving by U.S. family versus nonfamily independent foundations. The authors use a sample comprising the 200 largest U.S. independent foundations in 2007 to show that family foundations are more focused in their grantmaking than nonfamily foundations. Board size moderates this relationship. They also offer a new typology of family foundations to show that the generation stage of the family and the foundation board's composition are associated with different levels of grantmaking diversity in family foundations but in dissimilar ways. Scholarly and practical implications are discussed. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Most organizations focus their attention on simply achieving gender diversity on their boards. This approach misses the point. A complex relationship exists between board gender diversity and good governance whereby such diversity can have a negative, positive, or neutral impact on organizational performance, indicating that organizations may only reap the benefits of gender-diverse boards under proper conditions. This article examines which conditions allow gender-diverse boards to flourish and which conditions lead to failure. Organizations usually increase female representation on boards of directors to achieve one of two goals: gender parity or improved governance. Each of these goals is influenced by different circumstances and thus must be approached in a unique manner. Three recommendations are offered herein for organizations trying to achieve each goal. Gender, ethnic, and cultural board diversity all share related justifications and challenges, so organizations that follow the recommendations in this article will be well positioned to benefit from all three sources of increased diversity on their boards of directors.

In order to compete, firms must constantly gather and assess information that will help them identify and evaluate emerging opportunities. Their social context is instrumental in determining what information they have to work with and how they might make sense of and act upon that information. Unfortunately, many firms allow themselves to become under-connected, which isolates them from new sources of information, or over-reliant on just a few connections, creating a bottleneck for the flow of information. Herein, we describe how these problems manifest themselves among the network of interlocked directors, which is created when directors of firms sit on multiple boards. This network is so vast and complex that fully understanding the position and structure of a given firm's board interlocks remains elusive. Toward solving this problem, we offer five keys to developing a board with effective interlocks, as well as three cautions regarding how board interlocks could potentially hurt firms.

Owner-managers of private family businesses are vulnerable to escalation of commitment, which can lead to costly failure. In an effort to help private family businesses reduce such costs and contribute to the resource dependence literature, we extend prior research on escalation of commitment (Staw, 1981). Specifically, we develop a model that examines how outside board members influence the antecedents, and moderate the processes, that lead to escalation of commitment. Our work encourages the use of outside board members, insofar as they are likely to help the owner-managers of private family businesses to avoid escalation of commitment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the effect of new governmental regulations on corporate Boards of Directors (BODs). We have reviewed the literature pertaining to agency theory and resource dependency theory, both of which have been assumed to explain the actions of BODs. We examine the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory regarding both the structure and actions of BODs in times of governmental regulatory change. We then describe four historical events in which radical changes were required by certain governmental regulations, and discuss responses by BODs to each event, and present a discussion of these responses and how they adhere to or stray from the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory. We conclude the paper with recommendations for the direction of further study.

The fields of leadership and corporate governance e have, in their own rights, become the domains of significant interest recently for academics and business practitioners alike. While they often focus on similar phenomena, they rarely interact or engage with each other. In this chapter we argue that there is much to be gained by integrating and cross-fertilizing research efforts within the corporate governance and leadership research fields. Their strengths and weaknesses mutually complement each other: leadership has been traditionally strong in highlighting significant interpersonal dynamic processes within organizations but has been biased by its attention to the middle and lower ranks of the organization. Corporate governance, on the other hand, has developed an upper echelons perspective but have been hamstrung by a preoccupation with formal, static and impersonal theoretical models. We therefore suggest that there is much to be gained by creating a theoretical rapprochement between the two fields which will have positive repercussions not only in terms of fresh empirical insights but also in terms of improving and energizing the everyday practice of corporate governance. By way of example, we highlight three important intersections at which governance and leadership processes can come together in any organization: team leadership on the board, the chair's leadership of the board and strategic leadership by the board. We conclude by raising a number of research questions that can be profitably researched by taking both a 'leadership in governance' and a 'governance in leadership' perspective.

Existing research on a board-of-director-sustainability performance relationship have largely examined inside directors, outside directors, and gender diversity-yet empirical results have yet to offer any definitive answers. I posit that this previous research lacks a thorough examination of the role of boards and the means and mechanisms by which they influence performance. Drawing on the board capital perspective and the role of boards, this paper develops a model that highlights the influence of board capital on the future sustainability performance of firms. The model takes into account specific types of human and social capital of outside directors which have previously been unexamined. Beyond the board capital perspective, an argument is put forth that values are largely neglected in the examination of boards of directors, but are necessary in the study of sustainability because of its normative implications. I therefore account for the value attunement concept as a moderating variable in the model The paper draws on corporate governance and business ethics' literature to generate propositions and offer original insight into the drivers of sustainability performance in organizations.

Over the last ten years, the corporate governance context in most Western countries has changed as a result of irregularities, increased regulation, heightened societal expectations and shareholder activism. This paper examines the impact of the changing context on the role of chairmen of supervisory boards in the Netherlands. Based on a combination of thirty semi-structured interviews with board members of leading Dutch corporations and secondary data on the position of supervisory board chairmen at the top-100 listed firms in the Netherlands, the study reveals that board chairmen have become increasingly involved in both their control and service roles. While the demographics (i. e., age, tenure, gender and nationality) of chairmen have hardly changed over the last decade, chairmen are spending considerably more time on boards and committees, have reduced the number of board interlocks and have become more active on the forefront of the corporate governance discussion. The paper highlights several implications for scholars and practitioners. (c) 2010 The Author(s).

This study researches the influences of CEO compensation on firm behavior to examine the interactive relationship between the behavioral momentum of innovation in R&D and CEO compensation. The models presented in this study are based on evolutionary, institutional, and agency theories to test hypotheses using data from 107 companies in the high-technology sectors in the United States. The results indicate that the pre-succession innovative behavior of these high-technology firms on R&D can positively affect these firms' post-succession innovative behavior towards R&D. That is, positive momentum in R&D innovation prevails in a firm across a change of the CEO. However, for the role of CEO compensation, short- and long-term compensation does not positively moderate this behavioral momentum in R&D. Hence, the moderating impact of short- and long-term CEO compensation to enhance the momentum of innovation in R&D can be romanticized. These findings provide boards of directors with evidence as to how a CEO succession matters to a firm's behavioral momentum in R&D, and whether CEO compensation can be strategized to change a firm's innovation and momentous behavior.

Purpose: There is no previous systematic and theoretical investigation of the interim CEO succession practice. This research attempts to fill the gap by studying this phenomenon and hence advance executive succession research/practice. Design/methodology/approach: Based on agency theory, the authors propose a model and several propositions to predict what determines the origin of interim CEOs, the length of the interim tenure, and the career prospects for the interim CEO after the interim tenure. Findings: Both firm performance and environmental uncertainty play an important role in the dynamic interim CEO succession process. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides the foundations for future empirical research on interim CEO succession. Practical implications: Board members at companies experiencing sudden CEO departures should choose a loyal non-aggressive veteran to be the interim CEO so as to minimize disruption and to smooth the transition. They should use caution when choosing an internal candidate because if such a candidate is not chosen to be the permanent CEO later, a talent may be lost. Originality/value: The research is the first to systematically examine the phenomenon of interim CEOs. The authors make a unique contribution to the literature on CEO succession.

Triggered by highly publicised corporate scandals, changing societal expectations and the collapse of financial markets, the roles of boards of directors have changed significantly in safeguarding the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders. Yet, relatively little is known about contemporary challenges non-executive directors face and whether their boards are well-equipped for their new tasks. Based on self-assessment reports by supervisory boards, a survey and interviews with supervisory board members, this paper investigates the challenges non-executive directors face in the Netherlands, particularly after a decade of corporate governance reform. Non-executive directors' inadequate role in scrutinising executive directors' performance, information asymmetries and dysfunctional working relationships between executive and non-executive directors are among the greatest challenges indicated by non-executive directors on Dutch supervisory boards. The paper discusses several implications for scholars and practitioners and provides a unique insight in boardroom dynamics. Copyright (c) 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study explored the role of strategic leadership in declining firms by empirically examining CEOs' founder status and extensiveness of external board of director appointments as predictors of the likelihood of successful turnaround. The authors used the resource dependence and board interlock literatures to develop their hypotheses. Their analysis of data collected from a matched pair of 82 turnaround and bankrupt U.S. firms indicate that the extensiveness of CEOs' external board appointments significantly increase the likelihood of turnaround. Contrary to the authors' prediction, there was no significant relationship between founder status and likelihood of turnaround. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

Boards have become increasingly independent, to the point where some firms have removed all of the insiders except for the CEO. The authors call this phenomenon a "lone-insider board" and submit that it constitutes a fundamentally distinct governance arrangement worthy of inquiry. This paper describes institutional pressures that give rise to increasing reliance on loneinsider boards, and investigates likely outcomes. According to agency theory, the greater the proportion of independent directors, the more effective boards are in monitoring CEOs. The authors submit, however, that a lone-insider board creates a fundamental shift in board effectiveness due to a loss of mutual monitoring and an increase in information asymmetry. Mutual monitoring occurs when members of the top management team actively monitor the CEO. Information asymmetry refers to the disparity in knowledge between the CEO and the board of directors. The authors propose that reduced mutual monitoring causes increased information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and increases rather than decreases CEO power. The authors hope this article will stimulate fruitful inquiry in the area of lone-insider boards.

This study explains the inconsistent findings of previous research on board management by examining the direct and interaction effects of board independence and the top management team's external ties on firm performance. The results obtained using a multiyear sample of firms indicate that outsider-rich boards improved firm performance when they worked with top managers imported from outside the focal industry. On the other hand, a high proportion of outsiders on the board and top managers imported from the focal industry were not a desirable combination for firm performance. The findings imply that researchers and practitioners should pay more attention to identifying the conditions under which board competence aligns with top management. (c) eContent Management Pty Ltd.

Representation of women on boards is getting more and more attention these recent years (Hillman, Shropshire, & Cannella, 2007; Nielsen & Huse, 2010), all the more as recent influence by the legislator accelerates the pace of change. Indeed, in France, a new law adopted in January 2011 stated that the proportion of female directors should not be lower than 40% in all major companies. Most previous research focused on the impact of the presence of women in boards on performance, but there are few studies on female directors' networks. In order to help to better understand the ties at the origin of these networks, we study several characteristics and network ties of female directors of French companies belonging to the SBF 120 index and we compare them with male characteristics. We test the specificity of four types of board of directors' networks: attendance at the same elite educational institutions, use of business networks, civil servants' networks, and interlocking directorates.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

Social activists and government agencies seek greater diversity on corporate boards without any considerations of firm or governance characteristics. Using a comprehensive dataset on over 8000 firms from 1996 through 2005, we explore the potential determinants of socially homogeneous boards based on the advisory and monitoring needs of a firm. We find that director-homogeneity is associated with lower advertising intensity, lower R&D intensity but greater firm risk. Director-homogeneity is also positively associated with measures of CEO influence such as CEO ownership, CEO tenure, non-independence of nominating committee and director ownership. Overall, the empirical evidence implies that firms choose social diversity on the board of directors based on the economic needs and existing governance structures. (c) 2018, SAGE Publications Ltd.

This study investigates variables that influence director compensation of listed Taiwanese companies using the new disclosure rule for director compensation. We divided the compensation from its structure into three types: non-incentive compensation, incentive compensation, and total compensation. This study collected the research samples of companies listed in Taiwan Stock Exchange from 2005 until 2007. Using multiple regression analysis, we investigated the variables, which influenced the director compensation. Our results show that the amount of director compensation is influenced by the relative performance of the industry. These companies considered performance level of competitors or the whole industry. The monitoring effect of inside directors can reduce agency conflicts. The company will lower the levels of director compensation to avoid the inefficiency of its directors. It should also be noted that the outside monitoring effect and director compensation are complementary to each other in governing the company and the board of directors. If the active institutional investors of a company have a high percentage of ownership, the levels of director compensation would be relatively high. When the company has a high level of future growth, then the shareholders will encourage directors to monitor the company vigorously and contribute to future developments of the company by an increased director compensation.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the orientation of a firm's governance choices along a continuum of shareholder voice to managerial power and tests whether the governance orientation of a firm can survive regulation. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of 873 firms, a set of three index measures is constructed reflecting the orientation of a firm's governing rules, the orientation of the board of directors and the overall orientation of both types of governance structures. The resulting measures are compared pre- and post-SOX. Findings - While specific, individual governance components, such as independence, can be regulated, the overall orientation of a firm's governance mechanisms, as manifested by its aggregate choice of governance structures, appears to be constant overtime suggesting that it is difficult to regulate the governance orientation of a firm. Research limitations/implications - The findings may be limited due to sample bias. There is both survivor bias and listing bias in the sample. To be included in the sample, firms needed to be publicly listed from 1998 through 2006 and needed to be listed on a major S&P index for each of those years. Practical implications - The paper highlights ways in which companies circumvent the intention of regulations such as SOX. The paper therefore has implications for regulators and shareholders. Originality/value - While the index method has been used before it has not been used to compare the impact of regulation on governance orientation. That makes this paper of value to regulators when considering the cost and benefit of regulations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Our work provides an analysis of the interaction effects between internal governance mechanisms on the components of initial returns during the listing period. The application of multivariate regressions on a sample of 110 IPO French companies during 2005-2010, has allowed us to conclude that the different interactions between these mechanisms significantly influence the level of under / overpricing. Indeed, the positive relationship between internal governance mechanisms and overpricing reflects a substitutability relationship. In contrast, the complementarity effect comes from the negative relationship characterizing the combination of governance mechanisms and the underpricing. Thus, the interactions effects between institutional ownership, board structure and under / overpricing are not conforming to the existence of a complementarity or substitutability relationship between these variables given the absence of a significant combination between these variables.

This research deals with the review of researches on strategic decision making and the factors that has contributed to its growth and how it has affected the organisational performance. This study is focused on five major themes; decision making environment; comprehensiveness and speed/timing; Top Management Team (TMT), Chief Executive Officers (CEO's) and Board of Directors (BOD's); communication, information system and decentralised strategy and culture, hierarchical decentralisation and power distance, lateral communication and individualism, formahsation and uncertainty avoidance. It has been established that all these factors will lead to high organisational performance even in a turbulent business environment. The methodological approach of the reviewed researches is based on survey method with the use of questionnaire that makes the studies to be empirical in nature. (c) Medwell journals, 2012.

Board composition is a critical element in the ability of the board to impact firm outcomes. While much of this research has focused on size and independence, there is growing literature that investigates the composition of directors' demography, human capital, and social capital. The purpose of this article is to synthesize this diverse literature. The authors first review the literature on board demographics, human capital, and social capital composition research. In doing so, they highlight the theoretical and methodological approaches utilized. Finally, they suggest avenues for future research that can advance our understanding of the effects of board composition. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Firms with central boards of directors earn superior risk-adjusted stock returns. A long (short) position in the most (least) central firms earns average annual returns of 4.68%. Firms with central boards also experience higher future return-on-assets growth and more positive analyst forecast errors. Return prediction, return-on-assets growth, and analyst errors are concentrated among high growth opportunity firms or firms confronting adverse circumstances, consistent with boardroom connections mattering most for firms standing to benefit most from information and resources exchanged through boardroom networks. Overall, our results suggest that director networks provide economic benefits that are not immediately reflected in stock prices. (c) 2013.

In this article, we examine the factors determining the representation of women on boards of directors by considering three main questions. The first question deals with the relationship between characteristics of ownership and governance on one side, and female directorship on the other. The second major question concerns the demographic attributes of women directors, such as nationality, foreign experience, educational level, business expertise, and connections to external sources. The third important question refers to women in senior positions on French boards (e.g., as independent members or board subcommittee members) in relation to firm characteristics and women's demographic attributes. Our study focuses on French large- and mid-capitalized companies belonging to the SBF120 stock market index during a 5-year period running from 2000 to 2004. First, our results give evidence that the appointment of women directors is strongly related to family ownership and board or firm size. Second, the appointment of women directors is related to their professional services, valuable skills, and network links. Furthermore, we show that women face a double glass-ceiling problem, and note that French firms rely more on the demographic attributes of their women directors when they are appointed to senior board positions. Our study sheds light on issues concerning the law that comes into force in 2016, which imposes quotas of women members on boards of directors in French companies.

This study investigates the joint effect of corporate ownership and board of directors' diversity configurations on the success of strategic merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions. Board diversity is defined as the extent to which its demographic diversity as measured by the culture, nationality, gender and experience of its directors complements its statutory diversity. A theoretical framework linking ownership, board diversity and M&A strategic decision making is proposed and tested. Based on a sample of 289 M&A decisions undertaken by Canadian firms over the period 2000-2007, demographic diversity is found to have a clear and non-linear effect on M&A performance while statutory diversity is of limited influence. Ownership is found to influence the effect of diversity, making the relation finer and more precise. This has practical implications. First, statutory diversity is not sufficient for well-performing boards. Also, ownership is an important factor. The most advocated board diversity aimed at insuring the board's independence is not valid across all ownership configurations. From a public policy perspective, results provide support for the principles-based approach in governance. Governance regimes should encourage the search for a balance between board diversity and the need for cohesion that best serves the firm's purpose and obligations. (c) 2011 The Author(s).

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We explore how the combinations of firm-level corporate governance (CG) practices embedded in different national governance systems lead to high firm performance. Research Findings/Insights: Using fuzzy set/qualitative comparative analysis, we uncover a variety of findings. First, we show that within each of the stylized national CG models, there are multiple bundles of firm-level governance practices leading to high firm performance (i.e., equifinality). Second, we provide evidence of complementarity as well as functional equivalence between CG practices. Finally, we demonstrate that there can be heterogeneity ("differences in kind") in firm governance practices within each stylized model of CG. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We build on the configurational and complementarity-based approaches to make the following theoretical claims. First, governance practices within firm bundles do not always relate to each other in a monotonic and cumulative fashion as this entails higher costs and possibly over-governance. Second, practices in bundles do not need to be aligned toward the insider or the outsider model ("similar in kind"). We argue that non-aligned practices can also be complementary, creating hybrid governance forms. Third, we predict functional equivalence across bundles of CG practices which grants firms agency on which of the practices to implement in order to achieve high performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We contribute to comparative CG research by demonstrating that there are multiple governance paths leading to high firm performance, and that these practices do not always belong to the same national governance tradition. Therefore, our findings alert of the perils of "one size fits all" governance solutions when designing and implementing CG policies. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: The article is concerned with the prevalence, character, and development of qualitative research within the field of corporate governance. The paper provides an overview of published qualitative research in the field of corporate governance based on a structured literature search of papers published in scholarly peer-reviewed journals between 1986 and 2011. Research Findings/Insights: A fine-grained search based on key words resulted in a sample of 78 qualitative corporate governance studies. A review and content analysis of these studies show that qualitative studies in governance have grown in number since the 1990s, but remain a small fraction of the published work on corporate governance. Studies are mostly developed by UK and European scholars, published in European journals and tend to explore boards of directors more than other governance related actors and mechanisms. These studies utilize a range of disciplines, predominantly management, adopting a wide range of methods, the most prevalent being that of the interview, often in combination with other methods to get a better account of the empirical phenomenon. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The search reveals an eclectic range of theories, spanning several disciplines, which is serving to generate, elaborate, and refine theorizing about corporate governance and the associated meanings, mechanisms, processes and relationships. There is much scope and need for more qualitative studies of significant rigor and relevance which explore the array of interactions and processes involved in corporate governance, across different levels of analysis and contexts. Practitioner/Policy Implications: After over two decades of research and reform of corporate governance, problems of practice remain, and corporate governance prescription via codes and other forms of regulation is increasing in search of better governance. Qualitative research can assist policy-makers and practitioners to develop more efficient governance mechanisms, by shedding light on the efficacy of policy prescription. Qualitative research provides a basis for rethinking and challenging some of the dominant assumptions and meanings about how governance actors and institutions actually function.

This paper explores the phenomenon of positive organizational deviance from institutional norms by establishing practices that protect or enhance the natural environment. Seeking to explain why some organizations practice positive environmental deviance while others do not, we locate our inquiry on the board of directors-the organizational body that interprets external issues and guides organizational response. We find a strong correlation between positive deviance and the past environmental experience of board directors and the centrality of the organization within field-level networks. Organizations located on the periphery of the network or whose boards possess a high level of environmental experience are more likely to deviate in positive ways. Our conclusions contribute to multiple literatures in behavioral and environmental governance, the role of filtering and enaction in the process of institutional conformity and change, and the mechanisms behind proactive environmental protection strategies within business.

This study investigates how a fundamental group decision-making bias referred to as group polarization can influence boards' acquisition premium decisions. The theory suggests that when prior premium experience would lead directors on average to support a relatively high premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even higher after discussions; but when directors' prior premium experience would lead them on average to support a relatively low premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even lower after discussions. Results provided strong support for the theory. Moreover, group polarization was reduced by demographic homogeneity among directors and by minority expertise but increased by board influence. This study introduces a fundamental group decision-making bias into governance research and explains how group processes can influence network diffusions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

When academic researchers, business commentators, and boards of directors have debated the merits of hiring new CEOs from outside the firm, the implicit or explicit assumption typically made is that outsider CEOs will provide an advantage in achieving strategic change. In this study, we challenge this assumption by employing a duality perspective on stability/change, and we provide an original conceptual framework to posit that it is the presence of corporate stability (ordinary succession, a long-tenured predecessor CEO, and good firm performance) that allows outsider CEOs to generate a greater degree of post-succession strategic change. We use extensive longitudinal data from US airline and chemical industries between 1972 and 2010 to test our hypotheses, and we discuss how our supportive findings challenge long-standing assumptions regarding the outsider succession-strategic change relationship, and we advocate embracing the non-intiutive notion that stable (unstable) conditions can be enablers (barriers) of strategic change for outsider CEOs.

Research Question/Issue: This research examines the relationship between board processes and corporate financial risk. Using a unique questionnaire survey about board behavior, several measures related to board processes are developed and used to explain certain aspects of financial risk during the recent crisis. Research Findings/Insights: In a sample of 141 companies with complete data collected from company chairs on both board structure and process, board process is found to be an important determinant of financial risk during the crisis of 2008-2009. In particular, financial risk is lower where non-executive directors have high effort norms and where board decision processes are characterized by a degree of cognitive conflict. The impact of cognitive conflict is, however, found to be less pronounced in boards with high levels of cohesiveness. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The study provides theoretical and empirical advancement of the governance literature towards an understanding of group process-oriented views of boards' work and effectiveness. This study identifies the significance of board processes and their impact on financial risk supported by quantitative empirics. Findings of a strong relationship between board process and financial risk augment existing theories to suggest that the effects of boards work through group processes that bring executives and non-executives together in relations laced with control and collaboration. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulators, acting post the financial crisis have produced governance codes that emphasize risk management as a key responsibility of boards. The link between board process and financial risk established in this paper provides evidence for company chairs and other directors on the possibilities and potential effectiveness of boards in discharging this responsibility.

Board diversity is important especially in countries which practice a one-tier board system, such as Malaysia. Under the system, board appointments are usually controlled by the firm's substantial shareholders, and as a result, directors are chosen based on "the old-boy" network or "people like us", who are typically middle-aged males and from similar ethnicity which could lead to "group think". Board diversity ensures breadth and depth of the board's judgments. To this end, this study examines board diversity of the top 100 non-financial Malaysian firms, specifically directors' gender, ethnicity and age and their effects on firm performance. Data are collected from the 2007 annual reports of the sample firms. The evidence indicates the lack of diversity of the Malaysian boards of directors. Results from the multivariate analyses reveal that gender diversity is negatively associated with Tobin's q and ROA. Age diversity is found to be negatively related to ROA. Ethnic diversity, on the other hand, is found to be positively associated with ROA. Hence, findings on the effect of board diversity and firm performance are mixed. Nevertheless, this study offers insights to policy makers in enhancing corporate governance in Malaysia where diversity is one of the areas that could strengthen the effectiveness of the board.

Much of the scholarship on boards of directors has examined either the control (i.e., monitoring) role or the resource dependence role that boards fill. Relatively little has examined the service role, wherein directors provide advice and guidance to management. This study builds on recent work exploring director expertise by asking how operational expertise on boards impacts firm performance. We find that having external COO/presidents on a board of directors positively impacts firm performance when the firm's operational efficiency is declining, but negatively impacts performance when the firm's operational efficiency is improving. We also find that other types of external executives serving as directors exhibit the opposite relationship, suggesting that the value of director expertise is context-dependent. We discuss the implications of these findings for director selection. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A focus on preserving socioemotional wealth may influence entrepreneurial activities in family firms. In this paper, we identify the emotion of empathy in the family CEO as an antecedent of socioemotional wealth creation. We argue that the presence of one or more external directors can have a direct as well as moderating influence on the relationship between CEO's empathy and the salience of socioemotional wealth to the family CEO. Our empirical tests confirm these hypotheses. Several areas of future research are suggested to incorporate empathy and other emotions in family business studies.

A significant amount of research has examined firms' decisions to adopt poison pills; however, firms today are increasingly repealing or allowing poison pills to expire. Based on agency theory, the authors examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than substitutes. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: Given its position as a dominant logic in corporate governance, this paper evaluates the theoretical and practical implications of agency theory on good governance. Agency theory is presented as consisting of two layers, one resting on the assumption of oppositional shareholder-manager interests and the other resting on the assumption of supportive shareholder-society interests. Given the dominance of the simple economic depiction of agency theory, its first layer is heavily researched and supported, while the second layer is largely unsubstantiated and often exploited to obscure inefficiencies in the first layer. Research Findings/Insights: Agency theory is shown to fill a highly institutionalized position in governance, despite often violating the second layer's assumption of aligned shareholder-society interests. We assert that the relationship between societal benefits and value maximization must be reconceptualized from interdependent to correlated but independent. Otherwise, when the second layer of agency theory is undercut, shareholders can eschew their role as societal guardians to partner with managers and engage in mutual managerialism at the expense of society. We detail how inefficiencies in first layer mechanisms (market regulation, monitoring, and contracts) impact agency theory's second layer and present the new mechanisms of oversight boards and expanded founding firm documents to reintegrate a societal orientation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Aligned shareholder-society interests are shown to be frequently undermined, artificially substantiating the second layer assumption that societal betterment can be sufficiently promoted via financial rewards and sanctions. We discuss agency theory's underlying logic and present the possibility that a violated second layer can be exploited to obscure first layer inefficiencies. Ineffectiveness in the first layer's key mechanisms is shown to potentially undercut agency theory's promotion of good corporate governance on an organizational and societal level. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Oversight boards and expanded founding firm documents are presented to make agency theory's second layer explicit, ensuring the assumed supportive nature of the shareholder-society relationship is substantiated. Specifically, oversight boards formalize how members of boards of directors are vetted, oversee societal claims to ensure that appropriate ones are sufficiently presented and addressed, supervise reporting, and sanction firms who fail to enact these duties. Revised founding documents ensure that both economic and social goals are enshrined in the mission of incorporated firms. Together the two help establish the foundation of a measurable approach to socially responsible actions. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This study investigated how female directors of corporate boards of directors (BoD) experience boardroom dynamics. The study represents an initial research trend that moves from a unilateral focus on financial outcomes of female representation in BoDs toward stronger attention on the social dynamics in the boardroom. Drawing on social identity theory, the study proposed that female directors often constitute an out-group within the BoD, preventing them from experiencing positive board dynamics. More specifically, the study explored the extent to which female directors do experience less justice, lower cohesion, and higher levels of conflicts within the BoD than their male counterparts do. Moreover, we assumed that female directors with nontraditional educational backgrounds would be particularly likely to experience negative boardroom dynamics whereas female chairpersons of BoDs would perceive boardroom dynamics more positively than other female directors. The sample consisted of 491 directors from 149 BoDs. Our findings revealed that there were generally few differences in the way female and male directors experienced boardroom dynamics and female chairpersons of BoDs did not perceive the dynamics differently than other female directors. Female directors with nontraditional educational backgrounds perceived the boardroom dynamics somewhat more negatively than other female directors, but the differences were not statistically significant. The conclusions from this study are that there are reasons to believe that female directors are welcomed into boardrooms, not perceived as out-groups, and BoDs are able to benefit from the female directors' experience and skills.

This study draws from the corporate governance literature to investigate the implications of board involvement for international joint ventures (IJVs). We extend recent corporate governance research on the value of board involvement by investigating unique sources of complexity related to the nature of the IJV. We argue and find that board involvement can enhance the performance of IJVs, particularly for collaborations that are complex in nature due to their broad functional scope as well the level of market overlap between IJV parents. We complement recent research on joint venture control that has focused on the antecedents and types of control, as well as studies on formal (e.g. contractual safeguards and monitoring) and informal governance mechanisms (e.g. trust) by providing empirical evidence that IJV board involvement is valuable when directors undertake their control and coordination responsibilities. We advance corporate governance research by providing evidence that joint ventures possess several unique characteristics that shape the value of board involvement, thereby showing that applications of corporate governance theory to joint ventures are useful, but should be made with care.

We adopt a construct validity lens to provide a critical reexamination of established corporate governance research. In particular, we focus on the body of work relying on the theoretical bases of agency theory and involving boards of directors' independence, CEO duality, equity holdings, and their relationships to corporate financial performance. We offer a five-step protocol involving the following components: (1) establishing the base rate for the phenomenon in question, (2) evaluating the extent to which the dependent variables are germane, (3) evaluating the extent to which the independent variables are germane, (4) determining whether explanatory power is improved as a consequence of improved measurement, and (5) concluding whether previously established estimates should be revised. We implemented the proposed protocol and used alternative measures that reduce threats to construct validity. Results yielded substantially higher estimates of relationships in corporate governance research. Future research can adopt the proposed protocol to understand whether a similar improvement in explanatory power could be achieved in other research domains. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

The paper discusses the ownership and control structures of local public utilities by showing evidence from the Italian case. In this discussion, the focus is on three main aspects: the ownership structure, the board composition and independence, and citizens' involvement (service charters). The main results from this study reveal that there are controversial aspects, which need further investigation. The existence of a principal-principal conflict is clearly arising from an in-depth analysis of the ownership structures. In addition, the board of directors, because of the lack of actual independence, does not seem to be a useful arena to manage and solve these conflicts. Other governance mechanisms are thus needed, to increase accountability to citizens. Within this, service charters seem to be a useful tool to protect the "public interest". However, service charters content analysis suggests that further implementation actions are due. The paper contributes to the debate on conflicts of interests and governance mechanisms in local public utilities suggesting possible developments of agency theory and discussing implications for further research.

Since the beginnings of the global debate over corporate governance in the early 1990s, academics, practitioners and policymakers have focused on changing boards of directors to improve corporate governance. The financial crisis of 2007-09 arose despite two decades of codification of corporation governance, a process that continues in the light of concern about corporate performance and accountability: codes have not eliminated the problems they set out to address. Analysing the three main versions of the UK code of corporate governance, we see a shifting discourse of 'structures' in Cadbury to 'independence' under the reforms in 2003, and then in the 2010 iteration towards 'behaviour', as the code seeks to improve boards as mechanisms of corporate governance. The evolution in the language and recommendations of the code reveals growing understanding both of the practical challenge of board effectiveness and of the limitations to codification.

We propose that CEO compensation and tenure moderate the relationship between multinational corporations' (MNCs) R&D intensities and their percentages of equity ownership in international joint ventures (IJVs). Transaction cost economics (TCE) suggests a positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, but this relationship has not been confirmed consistently in prior research. We examine the moderating effects of CEO compensation and tenure on the relationship between MNC R&D intensity and IJV equity ownership, thereby bringing more nuanced explanations from agency theory and upper echelons theory into the discussion. Our proposed relationships were tested using a sample of 202 IJVs formed between U.S. MNCs and foreign partners in high-tech industries for the period 1993 to 2003. We found an overall positive relationship between MNC R&D intensity and the percentage of equity ownership in IJVs. Moreover, CEO tenure and bonus compensation each weaken the positive R&D intensity-equity ownership relationship in our sample, while CEO stock options compensation amplifies it. These findings indicate that CEO compensation and tenure influence decision making about equity ownership in IJVs, suggesting that scholars and boards of directors should consider these CEO-related factors when evaluating strategic decisions regarding IJVs.

In this paper we develop and test a theoretical model that reduces relational risks to solve the puzzle of conflicting task requirements imposed on boards of directors in listed companies. Doing so unites two seemingly conflicting tasks-board control and service tasks-through examining relational risks between the board and the CEO. We also present two mechanisms that could reduce relational risks. One is board power over the CEO, and the other board trust in the CEO. Practitioners could apply these two mechanisms to achieve better performance of board control and service tasks simultaneously. We test hypotheses using 441 survey responses collected in 2005. The result shows a good fit between the model and survey data, indicating examining relational risks is a rewarding approach to understanding conflicting board task performance, and board control over the CEO and board trust in the CEO are two effective mechanisms to reduce relational risks.

This paper examines the impact of board governance mechanisms, namely board size, independence ratio, opacity of earnings disclosure, and ratio of genuinely independent nonexecutive directors to total board size on director remuneration, executive tenure and likelihood of individual executive salary disclosure in a unique and comprehensive sample of 69 North African IPO firms. I find evidence of the enhanced governance role of true independent nonexecutives in family as opposed to non-family firms in improving disclosure of individual salaries and moderating lengths of executive tenure. However while their role is only significant in the context of family firms the evidence suggests that their presence is associated with higher levels of remuneration. The evidence also ascribes a greater role for business angel as opposed to more formal private equity financing which is more applicable within the highly social networked economy of the Maghreb region.

Recent developments in corporate governance have put the board chair into the spotlight. The importance of positive leadership as a determinant for board effectiveness is well recognized. However, empirical research on board leadership is rather limited except for those studies that focus the attention on the benefits of combining or separating the roles of CEO and chair. This study addresses the critical issue of the pivotal role that a chairperson plays in transforming a board into an effective decision-making group. The article argues that a chairperson faces unique challenges as a leader. We then introduce the Decision-Making Grid as an analytical framework to get insights into the decision-making style of the chair. By means of a qualitative interview research technique, the study explores perspectives on board chair leadership for a sample of Belgian listed companies. The results point to three major issues. First, although the model of eye-to-eye decision making is considered to be the most effective one, board leadership is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in practice. Moreover, it appears to be related to the chair's personality and appeals to his personal competencies. Second, the study reveals that the chair needs to be a relational leader and that a clear delineation of his role is not an otiose luxury. Finally, the study calls for a more pluralistic theoretical lens, tapping insights from other research disciplines, to explain the nature and behaviour of board chairmanship. From our findings, we point out implications for practice. In particular, we plea for development opportunities, more attention for a well-defined selection process as well as for a periodical assessment of the board chair. (c) 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

This paper contrasts firm-level as opposed to state-level governance on directors self-rewarding behaviour in West Africa. Director self-reward or compensation is measured through fixed base salary as well as total remuneration which provides a conservative estimate of the full private benefits of control of directors. Using a unique hand-collected sample of 56 IPO firms from across West Africa from 2000 to 2012, I find that larger board sizes have less effective governance mechanisms while enhanced expropriation of private benefits of control is closely associated with lower government promotion of private sector policies, media and analyst freedom and corruption control.

Using a large sample analysis of Thai listed firms, we address an important question. Do board diversity and network add value to firms? This article extends the debate on the benefits and costs of board diversity and network and their effect on the broader picture of corporate governance. The sample period straddles 2001 to 2005, which allows us to examine board characteristics in response to the Asian financial crisis. We find that diversity in age and study majors are positively related to Tobin's Q ratio, while diversity in educational levels leads to lower firm value. Our results suggest that boards with diverse age groups and study areas might generate useful advice and complement each other; however, those with diverse educational levels might create costs due to possible conflicts and a lack of coordination and communication. In addition, the results show that alumni networks have a positive effect on Tobin's Q ratio. The findings further suggest that board networks could bring benefits to firms. An alumni network is significant to firms because it could help firms obtain external resources. It also provides significant findings for policy makers to design best practices of directors in emerging countries. (c) author(s) Creative Commons License CC-BY.

The purpose of this paper is to explore and verify roles of boards as bundle of tasks in the context of SMEs in a small country. This is a descriptive study based on the perceptions of CEOs. The objective was to find empirical evidence for what boards in small and medium sized companies perceive they do in terms of tasks and roles. A survey was sent out to 560 SMEs in Iceland and the response rate was 21%. Factor analysis shows that three different roles can be measured in SMEs: Monitoring role, Strategic role and Resource and Advice role. The results of this research show that boards in SMEs can and do have more than one role and are more active in strategy than often is assumed. (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study focuses on the impact of institutional quality on the amount of disclosure in IPO firms listing prospectuses using the six well established World Bank Governance indices, namely corruption control, government effectiveness in promotion of private sector development, political stability and absence from terrorism, regulatory quality, rule of law and lastly democratic voice and accountability. Using a unique hand-collected sample of 165 IPO firms from across Africa from 2000 to 2011 I find evidence that enhanced rule of law and regulatory quality impact on the amount of disclosure by firms, reflected in length of IPO listings prospectuses. In addition I find evidence that founder-led entrepreneurial firms are more likely to disclose more alongside firms in extractive and technology industries that rely on local stock exchanges as a source of external finance. In contrast IPO firms that have significant long term foreign partners or are subsidiaries of foreign Multinational Enterprises are likely to disclose less than other types of firm underscoring their apathy to domestic investors and relative lack of dependence on indigenous stock markets as a viable source of external finance.

This paper studies the differential impact on IPO firm listing prospectus length from increasing proportions of foreign directors from civil as opposed to common law societies and social elites. Using a unique hand-collected and comprehensive sample of 165 IPO firms from across 18 African countries the evidence suggests that increasing proportions of directors from civil code law countries is associated with shorter prospectuses while the opposite is true for their common law counterparts. Furthermore increasing proportions of directors drawn from elevated social positions in indigenous society is related to increasing prospectus length in North Africa while being insignificant in SSA.

This paper undertakes a unique study of the determinants of corporate governance in the West African developing region and their impact on director compensation. A new measure of director total remuneration is constructed providing a conservative estimate of expropriation of private benefits of control. Using a hand-collected sample of 51 West African IPO firms from 2000 to 2011 we find evidence that increased presence of true independent nonexecutives that are unconnected to CEO or dominant insider groups within firm and nominally independent board level committees are highly associated with expropriation inferring that firm's with directors engaging in this behaviour are more likely to adopt measures indicative of governance best practice.

The interlocking board directorships among corporations. as well as between corporations and social organizations, is important for defining the modern political economy. This article finds the networks of those interlocks for Koch Industries Inc. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation. Moreover, the article extends the networks to describe and analyze the accompanying political network of contributions to Nebraska political campaigns. For corporate and social networks, we utilize conventional theoretical structures to find the new database of those networks for Koch Industries and TD Ameritrade. The new theoretical structure and database concern the campaign contributions of the board of directors in the corporate and social networks, as we trace them to campaigns for federal offices. The new political campaign finance structure we uncover here includes thousands of interconnected campaign finance conduits, through which money flows to political campaigns.

In this study, we investigated the impact of academicians as board members on firm outcomes. Based on popular theories of corporate governance, we contend that firms with academicians as directors would have more vigilance on their boards, would perform better based on accounting measures, and would be perceived as more valuable based on a market measure. Using a matched-pair design, our results showed that firms with academician directors do not have more vigilance on their boards and do not differ based on their accounting performance. However, they are perceived to be more valuable, which signifies the possible positive impact of academicians on one of the organizational outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (c) The Authors 2013.

For organizations in high-technology industries, knowledge is a critical resource that can be accessed through inter-organizational networks. However, for industries characterized by a heterogeneous set of actors, little is known about how different networks within the industry interact. Therefore, our research question is: How similar are the strategic network and the innovation network in the biotechnology industry? To answer our research question, we study two networks of interest. First, the Board-of-Directors-network serves as a proxy for the strategic network that fosters knowledge transfer between organizations. Second, we analyze the innovation network by using the patent network that emerged from collaborative innovation activities. Subject of analysis is the Flanders biotechnology industry, which is characterized by strong performing research institutions, large firms and innovative SMEs. We use social network analysis methods to measure the similarity of both networks and to identify their key actors. We find that a connection between two organizations in the strategic network increases the probability of forming a new connection between the same organizations in the innovation network, or vice versa.

This study proposes a new determinant of executive pay dispersion by integrating two distinct mechanisms: inter-firm diffusion and intra-firm adaptation. Based on institutional theory (diffusion) and group development framework (adaptation), we assess the similarity between the pay dispersion change at executive compensation committee members' tied firm (i.e., where they serve as executives) and that at their focal firm (i.e., where they serve as board of directors). Using a panel sample of U.S. banks, we find the evidence of "diffusion" such that the change (either increase or decrease) of executive pay dispersion at their tied firms results in the change of pay dispersion at the focal firm in the following year. We also find the evidence of "adaptation" such that the extent to which pay dispersion practices are diffused across firms is contingent upon the length of shared tenure among committee members.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between board composition and financial vulnerability of non-profit organizations in Malaysia. Information on these variables is obtained from the content analysis of annual reports of 205 societies registered with Registrar of Societies in Malaysia for the financial period 2010. Results of this study revealed significant relationships between some board compositions and some measures of financial vulnerabilities. First, there is a significant positive relationship between board members with professional affiliations and solvency. Second, there is a negative relationship between board members with political connections and efficiency as well as solvency. These findings indicate that types of directors on the board are important as they bring specific critical resources to match the specific environmental needs facing the organizations. In addition, the findings also provide useful information that can facilitate screening, monitoring, and decision making processes for various stakeholders.

Corporate governance issues are especially important in transition economies, since these countries do not have the long-established financial institution infrastructure to deal with corporate governance issues. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was no need to discuss corporate governance issues because all enterprises were owned by the state and there were no shareholders. All that has changed since 1989. This paper discusses the view on corporate governance in some transition economies. Highly limited knowledge on executive pay in (post)transition economies creates demand for research in this filed; this paper explores executive compensation structure in Croatia. The research was conducted among Croatian public limited companies during December 2010 through February 2011 at a response rate of 18,44%. Paper also covers specificities of the development of the corporate governance structures and practices in the Republic of Macedonia.

Marta Cuadrado This study advances research on CEO succession and board monitoring of senior executives by examining how proprietary directors can affect the probability of CEO dismissal. Drawing on our newly developed database covering all CEO successions occurring in all Spanish listed firms during the period 2007-2010, we propose that proprietary directors may increase the board's monitoring efforts over the chief executive, forcing him to resign in situations of poor performance. Hypotheses are tested longitudinally, using CEO succession data taken from 111 publicly-traded firms in the Spanish mercado continuo' over a four-year period.

Increased business complexities coupled with enhanced global transformation have propelled corporations to behave as responsible citizens to drive the sustainability agenda. Many corporations incorporate their affirmative commitment to sustainable business practices into their corporate identities and give evidence for this in their sustainability reports. This paper examines the role of the board of directors in sustainability reporting quality (SRQ) in the Asia-Pacific region. Based on a cross-sectional study of 113 companies from 12 countries in the region, we find that the SRQ in the region leaves much room for improvement. However, we find that the institutionalization of the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in an organization provides a sound foundation for enhancing SRQ. We find that the value of CSR anchored in the vision and/ or mission statement and strategic alliances fostered with non-governmental organizations are positively associated with SRQ. This study contributes to strengthening the understanding, promoting discussion on the state of sustainability reporting in the Asia-Pacific context and laying a solid foundation for more aggressive efforts to enhance SRQ. The study identifies the significant drivers currently associated with SRQ. The weak role of the board of directors in upholding the sustainable development agenda through the reporting process is highlighted. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

CEO duality-the practice of a single individual serving as both CEO and board chair-has been the subject of academic interest for more than 20 years. In that time, boards' use of CEO duality has fluctuated and the scholarly conceptualizations of the phenomenon have become more complex. As such, the need to understand CEO duality has only increased with time. We review and integrate the disparate literature on this topic so that future attempts to study it will benefit from a more complete understanding of the knowledge already produced. We review the demonstrated antecedents and consequences of CEO duality, pointing out that while much work has been done in this area, much remains that we do not understand. Finally, we offer new theoretical, methodological, and contextual directions that researchers could explore to extend knowledge about CEO duality. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Diverse boards have been seen as providing impetus for initiating change. However, diversity may introduce conflict and impede decision making, which could hinder the ability of the firm to make strategic change, especially in times when firm performance is low. Integrating threat-rigidity theory and team diversity research, we examine how board gender diversity, firm performance, and the power of women directors interact to influence the amount of strategic change. Results support a three-way interaction, indicating that when the board is not experiencing a threat as a result of low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most positive. However, when the board is threatened by low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most negative. Results suggest that diversity is double-edged because it can propel or impede strategic change depending on firm performance and the power of women directors.

Research on human capital as a source of competitive advantage has focused largely on firm employees. In this article, we argue that outside directors' general human capital can also be a source of competitive advantage. Firm performance is likely to benefit from directors' human capital-that is, their prior experience and education-because such human capital is likely to make them more effective at monitoring management and providing advice. Drawing on insights from research on individuals' cognitive limitations, we further argue that the extent to which the firm is able to benefit from this human capital can be severely limited by the demands for information processing that directors face from their other board positions. Consequently, we find that the benefit of directors' human capital is contingent upon the information processing load placed upon them from their other board appointments. We find support for our hypotheses using data on over 5,700 directors from 650 firms sampled from the Fortune 1000. This study extends the nascent literature on board human capital by showing that in addition to specific expertise in relevant areas, directors' general human capital can also help firms create competitive advantage. The theory developed in this article also contributes to the literature on strategic human capital by incorporating the concept of information processing demands, suggesting that not only do such demands leave limited cognitive capacity for directors to focus on the focal firm but also that they can severely diminish the beneficial effects of directors' general human capital.

This article extends the literature on CEO succession and financial performance by addressing corporate owners' mixed motives and desires to protect their interest in being in business. We draw on a Socio-Emotional Wealth (SEW) perspective to investigate how the choice of one of three succession mechanisms - relay succession, 'horse races' among internal CEO candidates, and hiring from outside - may effectively balance trade-offs between corporate owners' non-financial SEW motives and the firm's financial performance. We find that implementing one of these succession mechanisms reduces the negative impact that typically characterizes CEO transitions in family firms. We also show that family presence on the board of directors offsets the benefits of having selected these balancing succession mechanisms, in either placing too much emphasis on SEW, or creating negative dynamics that make the chosen succession mechanisms less effective.

This paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by developing and testing theory regarding positive and negative synergies between the CEO's and the board's human and social capital. Using a sample of 360 biotechnology firms that went public between 1995 and 2010, we demonstrate that accumulated public company board experiences of the CEO and the board have positive synergistic effects on IPO performance whereas the current board appointments have negative effects. While scientific educational backgrounds have positive synergies, industry-specific experiences produce either positive or counterproductive effects depending on the age and profitability of the firm. Thus, our paper contributes to the corporate governance and human and social capital literatures by describing the costs and benefits of specific types and combinations of CEO and board capital.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

We propose a concept of structural equality as a compromise between competing policy preferences of equality and individual liberty to address a stunning property of the governance of corporations, namely, the paucity of female directors on corporate boards. An argument for imposing a quota for women directors on boards is the need to disrupt structural impediments to permit endogenous mechanisms to sustain female recruitment beyond a critical mass. Using estimates from the Norwegian experiment, we apply an agent-based model to American board data to show that modest numerical quotas generate well-connected networks of women directors who attain equality in their centrality and influence. The analysis demonstrates the utility of computational social science for identifying policies that generate alternative and possible worlds of greater structural equality.

This paper develops relational pluralism as a collective construct whose dimensions are heterogeneity, multiplexity, and asymmetry. Relational pluralism is instantiated in the board of directors, whose network of relationships influence a new venture's ability to establish external links beyond the networks of the founding team. We argue that relational pluralism speeds the establishment of a diverse alliance portfolio, which, in turn, speeds the attainment of major revenue milestones in a new firm. We examine these ideas in a population of de novo semiconductor firms and find that diverse alliance portfolios emerge faster when a board includes members with heterogeneous, multiplex relationships, as well as central network positions. However, the asymmetric influence of outside board members can have both positive and negative effects: the alliance formation process is aided by outsiders in central network positions, but impeded when central investors dominate the board. We discuss implications for our understanding of relational pluralism as a collective construct. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

The last two decades have witnessed substantial scholarly interest in corporate boards, yet little research has been devoted to boards of international joint ventures (IJVs). We combine the corporate governance and alliance governance literatures in order to study this important ex post governance mechanism for IJVs. We identify a fundamental tension inherent in IJVs, which arises from the unique features of this organizational form and influences the level of involvement by their boards. International joint ventures are hybrid organizational forms that can require administrative control to facilitate monitoring and coordinated adaptation in the presence of exchange hazards. At the same time, the fact that IJVs operate in different host countries can make it efficient to delegate authority to local management for certain collaborations. In investigating the determinants of IJV board involvement, we therefore examine characteristics of IJVs that reflect this underlying tension. We conclude that board involvement reflects efficiency considerations in individual ventures, and the administrative control provided by boards is an important dimension of IJV governance.

We examine the relationship between strategic change and CEO compensation by studying how a firm's refocusing program influences CEO compensation after completing the change. We contribute to the 'settling up' literature by arguing that strategic change is often uncertain for both the CEO and the board of directors responsible for executive compensation. As such the firm is likely to settle up with the CEO by paying for compensation risk and effort undertaken during refocusing after the extent and impact of strategic change are better known. We find that refocusing intensity is positively related to post-refocusing CEO total compensation, suggesting that 'settling up' through post hoc compensation is an important factor in strategic change. We also find that prior firm performance, governance structure and industry dynamism are important moderators of this relationship. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this paper, it is argued that boards internationalize by recruiting international directors in order to increase companies' performance. However, increasing nationality diversity on a board can be costly considering that it potentially creates cooperative problems on a board due to fault-lines and separation processes. As a result, boards will prefer international candidates who are more similar to themselves on a variety of 'distances'. Based on data collected regarding 5683 board members of 361 companies from 15 countries in 2005-2007, we discover that the greater the distance (cultural, institutional and geographical) between the candidates' and the companies' country-of-origin, the lower the fraction of board members of that nationality on boards. Subsequently, it is argued that historical ties between countries play a 'distance compressing' role and partially compensate for the effects of distance. A colonial tie between countries will make recruitment of these particular nationalities more likely than others. (c) 2013.

Boards of directors and corporate governance have gained much attention in recent years. Many reforms have been made, especially on board composition to ensure that boards of directors are effective, in order to improve corporate governance. The Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance codified the best practices of good governance and described optimal corporate governance structures. However, due to a different context for business practices and the nature of the business environment in emerging markets, we expect that the determinants of board structure will differ from those in developed markets. Our study investigates the determinants of board structure for Malaysian firms from 2000 to 2007. We also examine trends in corporate board structure and the level of compliance of boards of directors in Malaysia with the requirements of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance. Overall, we find that after an increase at the beginning of the study period, and then a decrease, board size remained globally stable over the period studied while board independence has shown an upward trend in recent years.Our results also suggest that board size and board independence are correlated with the operation level of the firms. Unlike most findings in the US market, we find no evidence that the measures under the monitoring hypothesis are related to board independence, which requires further investigation on the monitoring role played by Malaysian boards.

Our research aims at exploring individual's characteristics of women on Boards in the French context. In the first part of our paper, we discuss the different theoretical frameworks which supported the business case of gender diversity on Boards of Directors and expose our hypothesis regarding differences in women and men characteristics. The second part presents our methods, measurements and data. Then, we focus on our empirical study. Our sample consists of the French Index SBF 120 companies. We studied the profile of 1,250 directors collecting information from the firms' annual reports of year 2010, using various scales defined by previous research on that field in the Anglo-Saxon literature. Our findings confirm that integrating women on boards has an impact on the Human and Social Capital of Boards but not as much as might have been expected. It is worth noting that men and women board members seem to build their human and social capital through the same educational process in France. Nonetheless, our work shows significant differences between men and women regarding professional experience and board member status. (c) by author(s); CC-BY.

Chief information officers (CIOs) play increasingly strategic roles in firms in this competitive global economy, which is now largely powered by information technology (IT). However, research has shown a lack of board of directors' oversight on CIO- and IT-related issues. Drawing on agency, resource dependence, and alignment theories, we investigate the effect of board of directors' IT awareness on CIO compensation structure and firm performance. We conduct cross-sectional time series analyses of data collected from various sources. Our study underlines three important findings. First, we show that some commonly known executive compensation determinants, such as individual characteristics and governance structure, do not have significant effects on CIO compensation structure. Second, with regard to CIO compensation structure, firms respond to increasing information asymmetry differently according to the level of IT awareness of their boards. Finally, firms perform better when their boards have higher levels of IT awareness, and this positive effect of IT awareness is considerably larger in IT intensive industries. Overall, our study provides empirical support for the important role of boards' IT awareness in shaping CIO compensation and improving firm performance. Our results suggest that boards with functional area knowledge-or higher IT awareness in this case-can more effectively monitor and better incentivize executives, and consequently lead to better firm performance.

Purpose: This study seeks to explore how non-executive directors address governance problems on Dutch two-tier boards. Within this board model, challenges might be particularly difficult to address due to the formal separation of management boards' decision-management from supervisory boards' decision-control roles. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire among non-executive directors provide unique insights into three major challenges in the boardrooms of two-tier boards in The Netherlands. Findings: The study indicates that non-executive directors mainly experience challenges in three areas: the ability to ask management critical questions, information asymmetries between the management and supervisory boards and the management of the relationship between individual executive and non-executive directors. The qualitative in-depth analysis reveals the complexity of the contributing factors to problems in the boardroom and the range of process and social interventions non-executive directors use to address boardroom issues with management and the organization of the board. Practical implications: While policy makers have been largely occupied with the "right" board composition, the results highlight the importance of adequately addressing operational challenges in the boardroom. The results emphasize the importance of a better understanding of board processes and the need of non-executive directors to carefully manage relationships in and around the boardroom. Originality/value: Whereas most studies have focussed on regulatory initiatives to improve the functioning of boards (e.g. the independence of the board), this study explores how non-executive directors attempt to enhance the effectiveness of boards on which they serve.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines whether certain proxies for board incentives and board capital are linked with bankruptcy in unlisted firms. Research Findings/Insights: Based on data analyzed over a five-year period with a sample of 232 matched pairs of unlisted firms, results reveal that firms with boards led by an independent Board Chair (vs. CEO duality), and including longer-tenured directors, and directors with fewer additional directorships on average, are less likely to become bankrupt. Results of analyses of board size and board change support a "reputation" hypothesis, i.e. that directors begin to flee firms in a downward spiral prior to bankruptcy. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Results support an eclectic model of board incentives and board capital, which integrates elements of agency and resource dependence theories, and the group decision-making literature to explain governance antecedents of firms that went bankrupt. It builds on a model proposed by Hillman and Dalziel, while identifying important differences, including lack of support for predicted moderating effects between board incentives and board capital. Findings also support applicability of the threat-rigidity logic and reputation hypothesis in this context, and the importance of anchoring corporate governance research more precisely on prediction of certain levels of performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Findings support governance recommendations to separate Board Chair and CEO leadership and limit a director's number of outside directorships. Negative effects of director tenure on bankruptcy contradict the notion of "term limits," suggesting that benefits of firm-specific knowledge and experience may outweigh risks of entrenchment.

This study examines how chief executive officer (CEO) compensation decisions may be influenced by a major group decision-making tendency referred to as group polarization among outside directors. I start by explaining why outside directors on average tend to support relatively high (low) CEO compensation when they previously witnessed relatively high (low) CEO compensation across different boards. Group polarization theory then suggests that when outside directors on average tend to support relatively high (low) CEO compensation prior to board discussions, they will support even higher (lower) focal CEO compensation after the discussions. In addition, this study proposes three important moderators of the group polarization effect. Specifically, (1) demographic homogeneity among outside directors and (2) the similarity of the minority's prior decision context are proposed to weaken the group polarization effect, whereas (3) outside directors' power relative to inside directors is predicted to strengthen it. Longitudinal analyses (1995-2006) of Fortune 500 CEOs' compensation provide support for these theoretical predictions. This study contributes to corporate governance research on CEO compensation by advancing a novel group decision-making approach to examining this important decision. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

Developing and implementing a meaningful code of conduct by managers or consultants may require a change in orientation that modifies the way these precepts are determined. The position advocated herein is for a different approach to understanding and organizing the guiding parameters of the firm that requires individual reflection and empowerment of the entire organization to advance their shared values. The processes involved are discussed using four discrete stages that move from the personal to the work team and to the unit to the full company, followed by the board of directors' evaluation. The hoped-for end product is dynamic, employee-driven, codes of conduct that recognize the systemic and far-reaching impact of organizational activities across internal and external stakeholders. Operational details for and some issues associated with its implementation are also provided. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We examine the contingencies that sway independent noncore directors of S&P 500 firms to heed the norms of the corporate elite or the disciplining forces of the efficient directorial labor market in the context of executive entrenchment. We find support for the corporate elite perspective as the number of independent noncore directors is positively associated with an entrenchment index score. However, the positive association is moderated by contextual factors that influence whether these directors reflect the expectations of the corporate elite or the efficient directorial labor market. Specifically, this study shows that the association becomes more positive when these directors are highly embedded in the corporate elite network or have shorter board tenure but less positive when independent chief executive officer directors' equity ownership is high. We also found a crossover interaction effect where the association is negative (positive) when firm performance is low (high). These results shed light on an underexplored group of independent directors that play an increasing role in the effective governance of publicly listed firms. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

This paper presents a systematic literature review of 139 articles on board leadership that were published in business and management journals since 1980s. Journal names, author country affiliations, topics and focus levels, theories, empirical contexts, and methodologies are presented and analysed. We also assemble and analyse this data thematically in order to identify and frame developments and trends in researchers' ideas on board leadership. This analysis provides guidance for researchers by identifying different research streams on board leadership. The analysis may also serve as basis for theory development in board leadership research that can inform policymaking and best practice recommendations.

This study aims to examine the relationship between multiple directorships and the monitoring role of the board of directors in Malaysian listed companies (PLC). The monitoring role is proxied by the percentage of directors' attendance in board meetings, as attending meetings provides directors with resources about the management actions and assists directors to exercise their role effectively. The study uses a sample of 1023 directors from 134 companies on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia (Malaysian Bourse) in year 2008. The results of the study show that the incidence of multiple directorships is low. Independent directors are found to have more multiple directorships. Directors with multiple directorships are older directors, have less director ownerships and are on boards with a high fraction of independent directors. Based on the 75% cut-off for the percentage of meetings' attendance, the logistic regression suggests that no agency cost is associated with multiple directorships. However, the tendency to be absent from board meetings is associated with the high number of board meetings whilst the tendency to attend more board meetings is associated with the increase in age, tenure, and director ownership.

Research Question/Issue: When the stock options granted to CEOs go underwater, boards of directors tend to award additional stock options to their CEOs. Drawing on agency theory and attribution theory, this study explores social psychological mechanisms that explain why boards of directors increase new option grants to CEOs in response to underwater options. Research Findings/Insights: Using the compensation data of CEOs at 966 US firms, we found that contextual factors such as market conditions and industry performance affected boards of directors' decisions to grant new stock options. Consistent with our hypotheses, boards of directors granted a greater number of new options to CEOs in response to CEOs' underwater options during the recession period than the recovery period, and they granted fewer new options when the firm's industry performance was high rather than low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study incorporates attribution theory in understanding boards of directors' causal attribution of firm performance and its impact on executive compensation. It complements earlier studies on causal attribution by exploring the role of contextual factors. It also contributes to the research by examining the attribution process of boards of directors rather than that of top management, as well as the consequences of the causal attribution in terms of ex-post adjustment in executive option compensation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides up-to-date and improved evidence on boards' decision making about executive stock options. Practitioners and policy makers can benefit from the study's findings that board members rely on contextual information about the market and the competition when they make causal attribution of firm performance changes, which tends to affect their decisions about executive compensation.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to survey chairmens perceptions of female board representation in five Nordic countries, focussing on whether the chairmans perception of board work is related to gender diversity, and on differences between high- and low-risk firms. Design/methodology/approach The authors combine data from a questionnaire directed to the chairmen of the boards in Nordic listed companieswith data on firmcharacteristics and board composition. Findings The authors find that the chairmen (97.5 percent male) are significantly less satisfied with female board members as compared to male ones. The authors also find that firms with nomination committees have more gender diverse boards, as well as indications of a more positively perceived contribution of female representation in high-risk firms. Research limitations/implications The study is restricted to perceptions of chairmen for listed Nordic firms. The low response rate of 20.1 percent is a severe limitation. Practical implications The increasing practice of using nomination committees in the Nordic countries seems advantageous from gender balance perspective. Originality/value The authors contribute to the literature on gender diversity in boards by providing results from a board intern perspective. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend governance research in the small business context by examining the moderating influence of top executive involvement on the board of directors on market valuation. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a sample of initial public offering (IPO) high-tech firms engaged in late-stage funding, the study uses stepwise regression to test board involvement moderation effects. Findings: Primary market investors reward governance structures that limit founder power. Originality/value: The current study introduces the notion that optimal market valuation depends not only on whether a CEO-founder governs the firm, but also on level of involvement on the board of directors.

Drawing together literature on corporate governance, organizational behavior, and educational psychology, and using survey data from a sample of 300 Chinese company directors, this study examines the mediating role of director learning goal orientation in linking two widely-acknowledged director social identifications (identification with the organization and identification with executive-agents) and a key director task behavior, namely the monitoring of executive-agents. We also investigate the moderating role of director avoidance orientation in influencing this mediation since a predisposition to avoid loss of "face" is widely posited as having particular relevance in the Chinese context. Results show, first, that directors with stronger organizational identification monitor executive-agents more diligently than those with stronger executive-agent identification. Second, we find that while learning goal orientation mediates the positive effects of both organizational identification and executive-agent identification on monitoring, the mediated indirect effect of organizational identification on monitoring is stronger than the mediated indirect effect of executive-agent identification on monitoring. Third, results show that the indirect effects are stronger when director avoidance orientation is low. These findings underscore the importance of director social identification and learning goal orientation in inducing director monitoring in the Chinese context, as well as the worth of selecting directors who exhibit a low disposition to avoidance.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze if the composition and activity of the appointment and remuneration committee have a significant effect in the remunerations of the members of the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach - To achieve the paper's objective the authors proposed four hypotheses in order to analyze the repercussions of independent, institutional and executive directors in the Appointment and Retribution Committee (ARC) and its activity in the directors' remunerations. Findings - The results put into evidence that the composition (independent, institutional and executive members) of the ARC is not associated with the variation of the directors remuneration mean, while the activity of the ARC influences positively this remuneration mean, contrary to what was expected. Originality/value - The ARC in Spain is not effective in fixating the directors' remunerations. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The study examines if certain board of directors characteristics influence the CEO's Pay Slice (CPS), i.e. the CEO's share of the combined compensation received by the five top-paid executives of the firm. The results show that the CPS is positively affected by the percentage of independent directors and negatively linked to director stock ownership. We also examine if CPS increases company valuation by investors, as predicted by the tournament theory. Our results upheld this view, showing that there is a positive link between CPS and company market value as predicted by the tournament theory. Although the effect is significant at a threshold of 95%, CPS only explains a small percentage of the variance in company market value.

The aim of this paper is to shed light on the cognitive as well as the disciplinary role of one important governance mechanism that is the board of directors in a privatization context. Using a sample of privatized French companies, we examine the relationship between the size, component and structure of this mechanism to the performance and value creation on the post privatization period. Thus, the majority of our findings have support on the theory of cognitive governance, one aspect of governance that was ignored in previous research.

This study investigates the valuation effect of board characteristics in corporate Joint Venture (JV) investments. Despite the prevalence of a board's involvement in JV decisions in practice, extant literature is mute concerning how the board adds value to JV outcomes. Investigation into board contribution in JVs is insightful due to executives' self-serving behaviors that may underlie their JV pursuits and boards' resource provision that may mitigate critical JV challenges. The former (latter) sheds light on the board's monitoring (advisory) role in a firm's JV engagement. Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study investigates the value of representative board characteristics underscored by these two theoretical perspectives. Our results show that the two conventional board measures, board size and outside director ratio, do not have a significant explanatory power. In contrast, director experience associated with JV decisions and gained from within relevant industries are found to positively impact JV outcomes. Moreover, both board meeting frequency and director ownership have favorable moderating effects on the strength of the experience-value relationship. However, these two variables per se do not independently determine a JV's value. Our research results indicate the importance of taking an integrative view to the investigation of board effectiveness, a perspective which has long been neglected in board research. The findings of the present study contribute to the mixed findings of extant studies on board influence from an uninvestigated domain, JV. (c), 2014, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and strategic change of a firm in the Chinese context. In this study, strategic change is defined as strategic deviation relative to industry norms and strategic variation relative to historical experiences. The size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors are defined as the board characteristics. We then propose hypotheses on the effects of board characteristics on a firm's strategic change. This study takes strategic resource allocation profile as measure to calculate strategic deviation and strategic variation, and then empirically tests and verifies the hypotheses using data from Chinese publicly listed companies in the information technology industry from the year 2006 to 2010. We find that the size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors significantly affect both strategic deviation and strategic variation. Therefore, we conclude that board characteristic affects a firm's strategic change. The conclusion of the study indicates that moderate reductions in the size of the board, increasing the proportion of independent directors and separating the roles of chairman and chief executive officer can facilitate promoting the process of strategic change for a firm in a dynamic environment. Through this study we re-examine the role and significance of the board of directors in strategic decision-making for a firm, and provide useful suggestions on how to form a board that can meet the needs for strategic change for a firm in a dynamic business environment.

This article analyses how some internal factors inherent to family firms influence the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of small-and-medium (SME) family businesses, which are the most successful type of firms in maintaining jobs in a crisis like the present. In this sense, we predict that a family firm's image, its willingness to change, and the strategic involvement of its board of directors may positively influence its EO, which is one of the most used strategies among firms against crisis. We test these hypotheses by surveying the CEOs of 232 Spanish SMEs. The results of a structural equation model corroborate our hypotheses. (c) Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

We formulate theory on the effect of board of director gender diversity on the broad spectrum of securities fraud, and generate three key insights. First, based on ethicality, risk aversion, and diversity, we hypothesize that gender diversity on boards can operate as a significant moderator for the frequency of fraud. Second, we advance that the stock market response to fraud from a more gender-diverse board is significantly less pronounced. Third, we posit that women are more effective in male-dominated industries in reducing both the frequency and severity of fraud. Results of our novel empirical tests, based on data from a large sample of Chinese firms that committed securities fraud, are largely consistent with each of these hypotheses.

Ten countries have established quotas for female representation on publicly traded corporate and/or state-owned enterprise boards of directors, ranging from 33 to 50 %, with various sanctions. Fifteen other countries have introduced non-binding gender quotas in their corporate governance codes enforcing a "comply or explain" principle. Countless other countries' leaders and policy groups are in the process of debating, developing, and approving legislation around gender quotas in boards. Taken together, gender quota legislation significantly impacts the composition of boards of directors and thus the strategic direction of these publicly traded and state-owned enterprises. This article outlines an integrated model of three institutional factors that explain the establishment of board of directors gender quota legislation based on the premise that the country's institutional environment co-evolves with gender corporate policies. We argue that these three key institutional factors are female labor market and gendered welfare state provisions, left-leaning political government coalitions, and path-dependent policy initiatives for gender equality, both in the public realm as well as in the corporate domain. We discuss implications of our conceptual model and empirical findings for theory, practice, policy, and future research. These include the adoption and penalty design of board diversity practices into corporate practices, bottom-up approaches from firm to country-level gender board initiatives, hard versus soft regulation, the leading role of Norway and its isomorphic effects, the likelihood of engaging in decoupling, the role of business leaders, and the transnational and international reaction to board diversity initiatives.

Corporate governance (CG) research has largely focused on internal governance mechanisms (i.e. the board of directors, controlling owners, and managerial incentives). However, much of this work ignores the role that external CG practices play in preventing managers from engaging in activities detrimental to the welfare of shareholders, and the overall firm. In this essay, we first review and organize current research on external governance mechanisms and integrate this siloed body of work within the broader CG equation. We explicitly focus on six external governance mechanisms: the legal environment, the market for corporate control, external auditors, stakeholder activism, rating organizations, and the media. We discuss findings showing how external governance mechanisms act both as independent forces and in conjunction with internal CG mechanisms. We conclude the review by mapping an agenda for future research on CG that better integrates internal and external governance mechanisms. Our review suggests that studying different configurations of external and internal governance mechanisms will help us to better understand what factors and conditions lead to effective CG.

A growing body of work suggests that the presence of women and of independent directors on boards of directors is associated with higher corporate environmental performance. However, the mechanisms linking board composition to corporate environmental performance are not well understood. This study proposes and empirically tests the mediating role of sustainability-themed alliances in the relationship between board composition and corporate environmental performance. Using the population of public oil and gas firms in the United States as the sample, the study relies on renewable energy alliances to measure sustainability-themed alliances and longitudinally analyzes lagged data for independent and control variables. The study found that (1) the higher the representation of women on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances, and (2) the higher the representation of independent directors on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances. Such alliances, in turn, positively contribute to corporate environmental performance. This paper discusses the study's contributions to the board composition-social performance literature.

We distinguish between "family companies," involving multiple family members as owners and/or managers, and "lone-founder companies," involving only the founder and no other family members. We apply social identity theory and organizational identification to elucidate the differences between these two types of firms, and how their differing organizational identities reflect unique desires for control and influence. We then consider how these differences are reflected in a firm's board structure (i.e., directorship interlocks, director experiences, and director tenures). Specifically, we predict that family firms are more likely to interlock with other family firms, select directors with more experience in family firms, and keep directors on their boards longer. Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern. We also consider the consequences of family and lone-founder ownership and board structures on the investment behavior of three classes of institutional investors. We test our hypotheses with a sample of publicly traded corporations between 1991 and 2006, and report strong support for most of our predictions. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Organizational boards of directors are one of the most important subgroups within most modern organizations, performing critical advisory, monitoring and resource dependence roles. This paper investigates the crucial question of whether the stock market values ethnic and gender diversity within organizational boards. We find that board diversity is positively associated with market valuation. We distinctively demonstrate further that ethnic diversity is valued more highly by the stock market than gender diversity. By contrast, we do not find any evidence of a significant non-linear link between board diversity and market valuation. Our findings are robust across a number of econometric models that deal with different types of endogeneities and market valuation measures. Overall, our results are consistent with agency and resource dependence theoretical predictions. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

This paper highlights the importance of a firm's board with respect to sustainability issues by analysing the relationship between director interlocks, i.e. directors who simultaneously belong to the boards of directors of several companies, and a firm's environmental performance. The previous literature has focused on the influence of firm-level resources on corporate environmental performance. This study utilizes insights from a resource-based view and research on social capital to demonstrate that the environmental performance of a firm is also influenced by the difficult-to-imitate capabilities that are embedded in the network relationships of its directors. Our results support a contingency perspective of the social capital theory that finds that director interlocks are positively connected with the environmental performance of a firm in two specific situations: (1) when the firm is linked to a larger parent company and (2) in cases of low and high levels of interlock diversity.

Prior studies show that agency conflicts are important in explaining corporate financial policies and that the board of directors is central to corporate governance. In this study, we examine the role of this governing body in the accumulation of cash reserves. Using a sample of 597 French listed firms during 2001-2007, we find that firms with boards deemed to be effective in mitigating agency problems--that is, those appointing independent directors and splitting chief executive officer and chair positions--accumulate less cash reserves than those with less effective boards. Moreover, two-tier boards are more efficient in mitigating the agency costs of free cash flow, leading to less corporate cash hoarding. These findings support the idea that agency conflicts influence cash management policy and that effective boards of directors play an important disciplinary role in a concentrated ownership setting.

Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries--often labeled "lack of transparency"--between top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high.

Boards of directors are in a position to contribute vital knowledge resources to strategy-making. We propose that the relation between board functional background heterogeneity and exploration-focused versus exploitation-focused strategy is contingent on the extent to which the institutionally adopted board model enables or constrains inclusion of the board's knowledge resources in strategy-making. We empirically juxtapose the Anglo-Saxon ('one-tier') and Rhineland ('two-tier') board models in the U.K. and Germany, respectively, and find support for our assertion that the influence of board functional background heterogeneity on relative exploration orientation is more pronounced when the adopted board model accommodates inclusion of the board's knowledge resources into strategy-making. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2015 Strategic Management Society.

Research on corporate governance has attempted to investigate the added value of boards of directors through the lenses of both demographic and behavioral approaches. However, investigations into these two approaches, and the subsequent implications for firm performance, have thus far been mainly decoupled from one another. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to put both approaches to the test in the family business context. Using a sample of 567 Spanish family firms, we find that although both approaches can explain the performance of family firms, the behavioral approach explains a much higher proportion of the variation in the firm's performance. Furthermore, our findings support our hypotheses that the relationship between the proportion of outside directors and firm performance follows an inverted U-shape in private family firms, and that both business-oriented and family-oriented board role performance are positively related with firm performance.

Prior studies of IPO underpricing, mostly using agency theory and single-country samples, have generally fallen short. In this study, we employ the knowledge-based view (KBV) to explore underpricing across 17 countries. We find that agency indicators are insignificant predictors, board of director knowledge limits underpricing, and external knowledge both substitutes for and complements internal board knowledge. This third finding suggests that future KBV studies should consider how internal and external knowledge states interact with each other. Our study offers new insights into the antecedents of underpricing and extends our understanding of comparative governance and the KBV of the firm. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Employment discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals remains a persistent problem not addressed by federal and most state equal employment opportunity laws in the United States. Despite this lack of regulation, a growing number of organizations are voluntarily adding sexual orientation and gender identity to their nondiscrimination statements, providing domestic partner benefits, sponsoring affinity groups, and establishing other "LGBT-friendly" policies. This article incorporates institutional theory and organizational demography to explore the antecedents to these policies to understand why some organizations seek to be at the forefront of this trend while others do only the minimum to embrace this element of diversity. The analysis of a sample of Fortune 1000 firms reveals that state law dealing with gay rights in non-employment-related areas for the state where each company is headquartered, the number of women serving on each firm's board of directors, and whether other companies in the same industry have adopted progressive policies are all related to company policy toward its LGBT employees. Sexual orientation of employees by industry does not seem to influence company policy. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We study the relation between the chair of the board of directors and the CEO. We argue that substantial age dissimilarity between the two-giving rise to cognitive conflict-increases board monitoring and firm value for firms with greater monitoring needs. We find evidence for our hypothesis using data on German two-tier boards. German law mitigates endogeneity concerns as it prevents CEO duality and also restricts CEO power in other ways. Additional identification attempts include CEO-firm and chair-firm fixed effects, random effects, dynamic panel data estimations, and the use of the 2007 financial crisis as an exogenous shock to monitoring needs. We find that during the crisis, when fast decision making and managerial discretion were needed, the link between age dissimilarity and firm value changed. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss a research model that presents three metrics of corporate social performance (CSP): board interlocks, director's profile and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach - Based on social network theories, the authors argue the possible relationships between the three variables. The authors conduct the study on 255 directorships in the boards of 20 listed companies in France, which participate in Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 2010. Findings - The results show that director's background and nationality diversity in the board are the most relevant attributes to discerning firms with high CSR scores. However, the relationship between board interlocks and CSR is not consistent. Some explanations are reported and discussed. Research limitations/implications - The research contributes to recognize the most influential variables in board composition for firms with high CSR scores, although it is based on a conceptual development and an explorative analysis. It could constitute the basis for future research which integrates modeling and multivariate analysis. Practical implications - Diversity in the board could be an effective tool to guide management for more CSR decisions. Social implications - The paper highlights the importance of diversifying the recruitment base when integrating new board members. This implies opening board networks to new profiles, in order to better meet stakeholders' expectations regarding CSR. Originality/value - The paper contributes to board literature by highlighting the importance of combining individual attributes (director) with corporate ones (board of directors) to better assess the role of board of directors in the adoption of CSR' practices.

In this article, we develop theory regarding one set of mechanisms through which increases in the compensation of directors are transmitted throughout the director labor market. In a longitudinal study using director compensation data from 1996 to 2005, we test hypotheses about how directors' use of social comparison processes, and reciprocity between CEOs and the board, drive up the compensation level for boards of directors. Specifically, we argue and find that directors' home firms and interlocked boards serve as salient comparison groups for board members. (c) 2012, (c) The Author(s) 2012.

The attraction of blue-chip listings in emerging stock markets is a major policy initiative common across much of the developing world. In many cases however, local blue-chip firms are the result of foreign Multinational Enterprise (MNE) firms engaging with local indigenous partners to form an international joint venture (IJV). These are unique with bilateral governance structures underscoring co-ownership between partners of residual cash flows and assets of the IJV. Using a unique and comprehensive sample of 202 IPO firms from across the emerging African region evidence of both a pronounced internal as well as external role for IJV boards was found. Social and political legitimacy concerns dominate the external role of boards in particular. Increasing proportions of boards drawn from commercial and governmental social elites are associated with IJV IPO firms in high institutional quality while lower proportions of these elites are associated with civil code law jurisdictions rather than common law. Governmental elites are associated with country-level improvements in corruption control and political stability while commercial elites are only marginally associated with improvements in political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and democratic voice and accountability measures.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the importance of human capital and professional networks for women's and men's appointment to the boards of directors of public companies. The study provides an in-depth analysis of how human capital and professional networks contribute to women's as compared with men's odds of corporate board membership. Design/methodology/approach - The study analyzes the human capital and professional networks of 494 male and female corporate outside (non-executive) directors appointed between 2005 and 2010 to the boards of US public companies listed in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Human capital was measured as director age, education and professional experience (function and role). Professional network variables measured included composition of professional network, network centrality, constraint and cohesion. Findings - The study's findings reveal that the characteristics that impact the appointment of women as outside directors to public company boards differ from those of men. Relative to men, certain professions such as government relations and education improve the odds of appointment of women to corporate boards, while age lowers women's odds. The number of network ties and the degree of network cohesion were also significant in predicting the likelihood of female board appointment to public corporations relative to men's odds. The final model was able to predict female board membership correctly only in 28 per cent of the cases, while male board membership was predicted in 89 per cent of the cases, suggesting that factors other than human capital and professional networks (e.g. their gender) impact women's appointment to corporate boards. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively examine the professional network components of female and male directors along with their human capital in the analysis of their prospects for board appointment. The conceptualization of professional networks as well the depth of quantitative analysis of the network components of the study advance the extant literature on the composition of corporate boards.

This study brings together developments in corporate governance and organization studies to examine the work of the company secretary, a mandatory legal officer in UK listed corporations, typically positioned close to the board of directors, but hitherto largely ignored in governance and organizational research. Regulation continues to use distinctions between inside executive and outside independent non-executives on boards, opening up organizational space between what one director actually does vis-a-vis another. This study combines a socio-spatial perspective of organization with theories of board behaviour to identify the potential for company secretaries to engage in a vibrant role performance in and around the boardroom. Findings show the potential for company secretaries to act as boundary spanners, 'walking the lines and working the spaces' that connect executive and non-executive directors, so developing the governance space in ways that enable board effectiveness.

In recent years, shareholders, regulators, and academics have become increasingly interested in how multinational enterprises (MNEs) can ensure sound corporate governance throughout all entities within a firm. One important mechanism available to MNEs for improving their global governance is the subsidiary board of directors. However, to date scant academic research has focused on the roles of subsidiary boards and the factors that influence their involvement in different roles. Using survey data from a sample of MNE subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a subsidiary board performs four roles: control, strategy, coordination, and service. Further, a subsidiary board is more involved in control, strategy, and service roles if the subsidiary operates only in the local market, independently from the headquarters (the local implementer subsidiary). In particular, the board of the local implementer subsidiary is more involved in strategy and coordination roles when more directors are headquarters country nationals. Our findings collectively suggest that the subsidiary board facilitates a subsidiary's pursuit of its strategic objective and helps to manage the headquarters-subsidiary agency problem. Moreover, subsidiary directors' characteristics influence the subsidiary board's ability to perform its roles. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study explores the influence of board independence, board size, CEO duality, board diligence, board financial expertise and presence of audit committee as well as the type of sector on the timeliness of financial reports among selected Jordanian companies. The timeliness of the financial reports is measured by audit report lag (ARL) and management report lag (MRL). This study covers 112 firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange for the years 2011 and 2012. The results of the ARL model indicate that companies that have members of board who are independent from management take a significantly shorter time to prepare and issue their financial reports. The results indicate that companies with greater number of board of directors are related with a higher audit report lag. The results also show that companies that separated the CEO and chairman's roles are quicker in publishing financial reports than companies combining the roles of CEO and chairman. In addition, boards of directors with more meetings make the audit report lag shorter. The findings also support that argument that the existence of an audit committee could resolve the information asymmetry between management and external auditors that, in turn, would lead to reduced audit report lag and management report lag. However, the results of the MRL model show that management report lag is related positively to large board size and board diligence and negatively to the existence of audit committee. This study concludes that the good structures of corporate governance play a key role in improving the quality of timeliness of financial reports. (c) 2015 Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences.

This study examines how board ownership shapes board processes in family firms. The extant family firm research has extensively adopted an input-output approach to the study of boards, but results have been inconclusive, calling for further research on intervening processes. By examining board ownership, this study shows that board processes are shaped by the life cycles of family firms across generations, as reflected in ownership dispersion among family directors: Cognitive conflict is the highest and the use of knowledge and skills is the lowest when the levels of balance in a board's voting power are moderate, which occurs when the board mostly mirrors a sibling partnership. A discussion of this study's findings contributes to the literature on family firm boards, work groups, and corporate governance. (c) 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how an environmental threat (possible quotas for female supervisory directors) might change supervisory board gender composition in SBF120 French company boards between 2008 and 2010. Design/methodology/approach - From a census of supervisory board membership of SBF120 companies in France in January 2008 and December 2010, data were obtained to test hypotheses relating to changes in gender composition of boards and demographic differences between new and earlier director appointees. The authors drew on institutional theory to inform the discussion of this paper's findings. Findings - The authors reveal significant increases over 2008-2010 in SBF120 board female representation and significant cohort differences between recent and earlier appointees. Newer female appointees differed from male peers and from earlier appointed females and males, bringing youth and international experience. New females were more likely to gain CAC40 seats than their male peers. There was an increase in boards with multiple female directors. Research limitations/implications - Actual motivations for increase in female appointments are unknown, but institutional theory provides possible explanations, as suggestion of coercive forces loomed. Chairmen of larger firms may have made strategic choices to attract younger and English-speaking foreign women, before the rush. Limitations include the descriptive nature of the paper, but it sets a benchmark for later studies to monitor progress in depth. Practical implications - The talent pool for female directors has widened to include foreign English-speaking women, bringing a range of new insights and experience of international governance practice to traditional French boardrooms. However, this could be seen as further discriminatory practice that requires female appointees to bring more human and social capital than that required of their male peers. Originality/value - This is the first paper charting the changes in supervisory board composition during the three-year period of environmental unrest as quotas were proposed and legislated in France and comparing new and existing cohort French director demographics.

Purpose - Director selection is an important yet under-researched topic. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to extant literature by gaining a greater understanding into how and why new board members are recruited. Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory study uses in-depth interviews with Australian non-executive directors to identify what selection criteria are deemed most important when selecting new director candidates and how selection practices vary between organisations. Findings - The findings indicate that appointments to the board are based on two key attributes: first, the candidates' ability to contribute complementary skills and second, the candidates' ability to work well with the existing board. Despite commonality in these broad criteria, board selection approaches vary considerably between organisations. As a result, some boards do not adequately assess both criteria when appointing a new director hence increasing the chance of a mis-fit between the position and the appointed director. Research limitations/implications - The study highlights the importance of both individual technical capabilities and social compatibility in director selections. The authors introduce a new perspective through which future research may consider director selection: fit. Originality/value - The in-depth analysis of the director selection process highlights some less obvious and more nuanced issues surrounding directors' appointment to the board. Recurrent patterns indicate the need for both technical and social considerations. Hence the study is a first step in synthesising the current literature and illustrates the need for a multi-theoretical approach in future director selection research.

The CLO shapes and enforces corporate governance, but is faced with a dual-role paradox that requires her to act as both monitor of corporate governance and executive of the firm. We study the role of the CLO under environments that are most likely to impact governance and pressure the firm to either emphasize or marginalize the CLO's role as monitor or facilitator. Using the financial shock of a securities class action lawsuit on large corporations, we measure changes in CLO value through the metrics of total and relative compensation of the CLO and other C-suite members. After controlling for relevant variables such as growth and total assets, we find that when firms have more insiders on their board of directors, the CLO's compensation declines when the preceding year's Tobin's Q is high. CLO compensation increases under conditions of high opacity, but that compensation partially erodes in high Tobin's Q environments. We also find that a lawsuit increases CFO and CEO turnover but not the CLO's. Our results have implications for corporate governance, the dual and potentially conflicting role of CLO as gatekeeper and monitor, executive compensation, and agency costs. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We study how New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) firms adopted governance committees on their boards of directors. The drive to adopt started as a social movement but was facilitated greatly by the collapse of Enron Corporation and a subsequent mandate by the NYSE that all of its traded firms must have governance committees. Using institutional theory and a sample of NYSE firms, we develop and test hypotheses about the speed of governance committee adoption, the likelihood of committee adoption by the NYSE deadline, and the types of directors that were placed on the inaugural governance committee. Our study adds to theory about how organizations respond to external pressures when responding is contrary to the interests of executives. (c) 2013, (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between organizational characteristics and presence in a board-of-directors (BoD)-network, in the context of the biotechnology industry. Accessing and integrating external knowledge is key to an organization's success within innovative industries. This can occur through inter-organizational networks such as the BoD-network. Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply a network analysis method (Robins and Alexander, 2004) and a logistic regression to a proprietary database of Belgian biotechnology organizations. Findings - The authors conclude that some organizational characteristics influence the presence of a biotechnology organization in the regional BoD-network. Academic spin-offs, start-ups and small companies are more likely to be part of the regional biotechnology BoD-network. The authors also observe that organizations involved in innovative activities are prominently present in the BoD-network. Interestingly, key actors like universities or academic hospitals are less present in the network. Research limitations/implications - The authors show that studying full networks and heterogeneous groups of organization leads to a better understanding of the causal mechanisms and dynamics of inter-organizational networks. To better understand the network dynamics in a context as complex as the biotechnology industry, multiple networks need to be studied simultaneously. Practical implications - The findings in this study allow for the development of policies addressing knowledge transfer, diffusion of management and governance practices, and the initiation and management of collaborative projects through the BoD-network. The authors observe a self-reinforcing dependency between innovative activities and BoD-network membership. This implies that policies aimed at stimulating innovation should also aim at increasing the target organizations' presence in the BoD-network. Analyzing an organization's innovative activities and position in the BoD-network allows for identifying those organizations that contribute most to the region's knowledge transfer network and innovative capacity. Originality/value - The authors combine two different research streams and are the first to study the complete BoD-network of a biotechnology industry agglomeration.

In this article, we build on recent attempts to theorize about the evolution of boards of directors by juxtaposing firms' strategies to gain, maintain, and repair legitimacy onto their life cycle to examine how board characteristics change-both symbolically and substantively-to reflect their firm's evolving legitimating strategy. In doing so, we develop insights contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the evolving structure and composition of boards of directors. We suggest that boards fulfill an important role ingrained in the firm's legitimacy in addition to, and intertwined with, their substantive contribution to the firm's performance at each life cycle stage. We also address firms' real ability to effect change in their board as a function of the factors that pertain to each stage of life cycle. We conclude by expounding the implications of this novel framework for future research and managerial practice.

Board performance research conducted over the last 50 years has focused on individual directors' economically-motivated behaviors and outcomes, and has generated inconsistent and disappointing results. Most research does not consider the board as a team, despite recent calls for a focus on collective board processes and behaviors. A recent survey revealed that 90 per cent of directors rate their individual performance as very effective but only 30 per cent rate overall board performance at an equivalent level, exposing a gap that needs to be addressed. The discrepancy between individual and team performance effectiveness was the focus of this research, based on original data from 182 directors and their assessment of their board's dynamic, team task performance efficacy, team potency and the impact of their activities, as a board, on firm profitability. Our findings show that director experience, social network and cultural intelligence quotient, as well as their ability to achieve high levels of team interaction - thereby lowering information asymmetry - have a significant impact on corporate profitability. Our study demonstrates that the impact of board functioning as a team is an eight times greater predictor of corporate performance than individual director demographics. We found that this team dynamic as well as team potency has a positive impact on profitability, while the focus on compliance-oriented tasks has a significantly negative effect on profitability. The insights of this study should help boards and their advisors better focus their efforts to improve team dynamic, optimize board interactions and refocus their attention on value-creating activities. We also believe that improving board team dynamics will have an unintended consequence of bringing a level of individual and team satisfaction back to the boardroom.

Understanding the value the right chief executive officer selection and tenure choices can bring to an organisation is under researched in legal jurisdictions such as Australia where there is strong separation of the role of the chief executive officer and chairperson. The chief executive officer is the key organisation strategist and plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategy as well as keeping the board of directors informed of the work of the executive team. This paper reviews and synthesises the corporate governance literature to develop the argument that a chief executive officer's professional development background and work context will impact his or her ability to favourably influence organisation performance. A series of research propositions of interest to a range of stakeholders inside and outside the organisation are developed drawing on a number of corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory, stewardship theory). This conceptual paper develops a substantial future empirical research agenda. (c) 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

There is an increasing scholarly interest in how social enterprises manage their hybrid nature. As hybrid organizational forms, social enterprises combine mission-driven social goals and revenue generating activities in a variety of organizational constellations and in diverse institutional contexts. Acknowledging the potentially conflicting demands that institutional environments impose on social enterprises there is an increasing research interest in the existence and proliferation of these conflicting demands at the organizational level. Some researchers have pointed to the importance of particular management practices and governance characteristics - such as authority relations and internal representation - as mechanisms to deal with the conflicting demands at the organizational level. This paper adds to this stream of literature by taking into account the organizational level dynamics of internal representation and the proliferation of factional groups in the boards of directors of hybrid organizational forms and their impact on board performance, ultimately influencing the organizational performance.

Examining board of directors' decision making in case studies of CEOs and board members in four US companies, we found that an "inner board" of directors and CEOs linked by network ties outside of board meetings contained the most influential board members who also shared cognitions about problems. This informal network of ties was affected by the formal governance structure of the board. Strong ties in the informal network led to shared cognitions on the board, demonstrating a link between the formal and network positions of board members and their decision making.

Purpose-The purpose of this article is to examine if certain board characteristics have an impact on the total remuneration of top management and the ratio of stock-based remuneration to total top-management remuneration. Design/methodology/approach-The study draws on data from the largest public Canadian companies, the constituents of the TSX/60 index. The study controls for firm size and profitability. Findings-The authors concludes that total remuneration of top management is directly linked to board-member total remuneration and the board average number of director-tenure years. The study also shows that the ratio of stock-based to total top-management remuneration is positively affected by the percentage of independent directors, total remuneration of board directors, the ratio of stock-based remuneration of directors to their total remuneration and the average number of tenure years of the board of directors. Practical implications-If regulators are determined to curb the excesses in top-management remuneration by means of promoting boards with certain characteristics, they should implement measures facilitating the control of directors' remuneration and tenure, to discourage cronyistic behavior. Good corporate governance requires that the board act as a counterbalance to top management, ensuring that a substantial percentage of top-executive total compensation is variable, and not fixed. According to our findings, the boards that are the most likely to hold managerial avoidance of variable pay in check are those favoring director independence, variable director remuneration and longer director tenures. Social implications-The present article examines specifically the latter aspect, namely, the role of board characteristics (independence, size, compensation, board director ownership and tenure, etc.) in the determination of top-management compensation. This relationship is important because it allows us to further the analysis of corporate governance. If the above-mentioned traits of boards have a meaningful relationship with the compensation of the top management, one might conclude that certain practices in the composition of boards could influence good corporate governance practices. This is relevant for regulatory agencies, for investors and for corporations. Originality/value-The article adds to the extant literature in a number of ways. Firstly, it considers the role of the traits of the board in the determination of the compensation of the top-management teams, and not only of the chief executive officer, as is the focus of previous literature. Secondly, the article focuses on the power interplay between boards and managers, and, more particularly, on the ability of boards to be an effective mechanism of corporate governance. Finally, the article examines the potential impact of board traits in the determination of top-management compensation in the context of Canadian firms, a subject that has received less attention from academic research, which has mostly concentrated on analyzing the issue in the US context.

Using resource-based logic as well as stewardship and agency theories, we address a paradox when governing young firms-how to design governance structures to encourage top managers to generate rents while minimizing the threat of rent appropriation. Some corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) enhance empowerment and encourage managers to generate rents for the firm. But these CGMs may also allow managers to appropriate rents excessively. The solution appears to be combining CGMs that empower managers to generate rents with CGMs that either (a) motivate stewardship behavior or (b) reduce information asymmetry between management and other stakeholders. Our empirical analyses provide substantial support for our predictions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Taking the assumptions of the resource dependency theory as our starting point, the main objectiveof this investigation is to gain an understanding of how and in what way board members who serveon multiple boards (interlocks) can affect a firm's profitability, and whether it is useful to consider thederivation of these interlocks according to the type of board member (executive or non-executive) whopossesses them. Using dynamic panel data analysis (GMM) and a sample of 88 firms quoted on theSpanish Continuous Market for the period 2005-2008, our results confirm the existence of a curvilinear(inverted-U) relation between interlocks and firm performance. The results demonstrate that this relationis only significant if we include the total number of external ties rather than just the number of linksgenerated by non-executive directors. We can also confirm that the degree of familiarity and sharedknowledge between board members (measured by average board tenure) affects this relationship. (c) 2015 AEDEM.

PurposeFrom the resource-based view (RBV), the purpose of this paper is to argue that the board has the capability to participate in international strategic decisions and deal with the environmental complexities that internationalisation brings; and moreover, to achieve better performance than its competitors. Design/methodology/approachThis paper highlights the active participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010. FindingsThe results show that while the resources provided by the directors through their level of education and international experience, help them learn and process information, and they are a source of expertise representing "board potential";. A board that functions well through the directors' relationships allow the proper integration and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive advantages in an international context. Originality/valueFrom a RBV, this paper refines and extends the concept of "board capability"; as the combination of potential and internal relations that allow boards to undertake their roles competently over time. Additionally, the paper empirically examines the effect of board capability on firm internationalisation. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Biotech firms are faced with particularly complex decisions early in their development. Because of the specific nature of their products, their growth strategy rapidly entails the internationalisation of their activities, especially through alliances. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) wishing to develop and access complementary skills may use corporate boards and scientific advisory boards. The resource-based view provides a compelling rationale for efficiently using these external sources of knowledge in order to access the key resources SMEs need to improve their performance. This study investigates how corporate and scientific advisory boards are involved in the internationalisation of biotech firms through strategic alliances. Based on semi-structured interviews and secondary data from 22 biotechnology firms, we describe the characteristics of these external sources of strategic advice and explore their impact on the firms' internationalisation. A discussion of the results, along with their implications for future research and managerial practices are also presented. Copyright (c) 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Decades-long research on boards of directors based on the agency theoretic insider/outsider distinction (Fama & Jensen, 1983) has yielded limited results regarding the effectiveness of boards as monitors of senior management (Johnson, S., Schnatterly, & Hill, 2013) leading governance scholars to incorporate agency theory based distinctions with rich characterizations of the human capital of board composition. This study examines the human capital brought to the boards of directors by active CEOs.

Previous studies that have examined the impact of board diversity on firm financial performance have yielded conflicting results. One of the main challenges for studies looking at the impact of diverse directors stems from the fact that firm financial performance and board of director composition may be endogenously determined. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to the problem of endogeneity. By analyzing the reaction of the stock market when a diverse director's departure is announced, we can examine investors' perceptions of the importance of changes in board diversity. Our results show that investors value gender diversity among directors; however, we are unable to conclude that investors value ethnic diversity among directors.

This case study examines strategic management issues related to corporate governance and CEO-Chair duality, which have led to the use of power and family control of a very profitable and successful public holding company that dominated the insurance industry in Palestine for 20 years. It specifically describes the incidents that made Hayat Insurance Company (HIC) vulnerable and unable to choose the right strategies to cope with external threats, such as the rising competition and the developing regulations during the 1990s. With government interventions, the situation deteriorated, and HIC was dissolved. The selected solution, to liquidate HIC by selling its license to another insurance company, was thought to be for the best interest of the various stakeholder groups. The case is based on interviews with major stakeholders including insurance experts, shareholders, board of directors, former employees and managers, and government officials in various departments.

The strategic role of the board of directors can be a competitive advantage for family firms. In fact, in medium-sized family firms the more the board is involved in the firm strategy, the better performance it gets. However, this relationship is mediated by some variables that may enhance or inhibit this effect. In this chapter, the impact of the entrepreneurial orientation variable is analysed as a mediator between the strategic involvement of the board of directors (SIBD) and performance. We test these hypotheses by surveying the CEOs of 230 Spanish medium-sized family businesses. The results obtained through the Partial Least Square (PLS) technique show that the entrepreneurial orientation of the family firm has a positive effect on the relationship between SIBD and performance.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to better understand dependency issues between the CEO and the board as well as the between the board and CEO through Emerson's power dependency framework. Design/methodology/approach - A symbolic management approach is integrated with a board-CEO power dependency model to study the dependency issues. Findings - According to the symbolic management perspective, uncertainty increases the likelihood of symbolic actions. A high level of uncertainty in CEO dependency issues suggests a high likelihood that board power over the CEO is manifested on a symbolic level, whereas a low level of uncertainty in board dependency issues suggests otherwise for CEO power over the board. The core of board-dependency issues is information provision. Practical implications - A focus on improving board control over CEO performance, compensation and strategic proposals is likely to generate symbolic actions without an effective result. Originality/value - The paper advocates that an effective approach to enhance board power is through reducing board information dependency on the CEO. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Despite the growing interest in IJVs and their governance, systematic research is limited on the board of directors and their roles in international joint ventures in emerging markets. In this study, we draw from corporate governance research that suggests that the levels of control and collaboration by boards are influenced by organizational complexity. While joint ventures possess several similarities compared to unitary firms, they also have unique sources of complexity given the fact that two or more international partners collaborate within JVs under an incomplete contract. Based on a sample of 114 IJVs, we argue and show four separate conditions that influence the functions that boards undertake as well as how control and collaboration as two separate functions are interrelated. Our findings address calls for research to open the black box of what boards actually do as well as to bring corporate governance theory to new organizational forms such as joint ventures.

In this study, we investigate the impact women leaders have on the corporate environmental strategies of organizations. Using a dataset of all Fortune 500 CEOs and boards of directors for a ten-year period, we examine several aspects of gender in leadership on environmental strategy. Specifically, we test the impact of women CEOs, the proportion of women on the BOD, the number of interlinks women board members hold, and the interactive and cumulative effects of women CEOs and gender diverse boards. Findings suggest that firms characterized by gender diverse leadership teams are more effective than other firms at pursuing environmentally friendly strategies. This study contributes to research on corporate governance and environmental performance by showing how the gender composition of leaders affects corporate practice.

This paper demonstrates how meta-analysis can be combined with structural equation modeling (MASEM) to address new questions in strategic management research. We review this integration, describe its implementation, and compare findings from bivariate meta-analyses, a direct-effect structural equations model, and two mediating frameworks using data on the strategic leadership and performance relationship. Results drawn from 208 articles that collectively included data on 495,638 observations demonstrate the new insights available from MASEM while also suggesting a revision to conventional thinking on strategic leadership. Whereas some theories posit that boards of directors influence firm performance through monitoring and disciplining the top management team, MASEM provides more support for the view that boards mediate the top management teams' decisions. Implications for applying MASEM in strategic management are offered. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Resource dependence theorists argue that boards of directors with political capital can benefit focal firms by reducing uncertainty and providing preferential resources. Here, we develop theory regarding the downside of board political capital. The problem of principal-principal agency is evident in many parts of the world, and we argue that board political capital can further exacerbate it by enabling large blockholders to undertake more appropriation of firm wealth. Further, we explore how this enabling effect is moderated by ownership-, industry-, and environment-level contingencies. We find empirical support for our arguments using 32,174 directors in 1,046 Chinese listed firms over the period 2008-2011. Our study sheds light on new ways in which resource dependence and agency theories can be integrated to advance the extant research on board governance and corporate political strategy.

We ask whether and when shareholder-oriented foreign owners are likely to change corporate governance logics in a stakeholder-oriented setting by introducing shareholder-oriented governance practices. We focus on board monitoring and claim that because the bundle of practices used in a stakeholder context does not protect shareholder-oriented foreign owners' interests, they seek to introduce their own practices. Our results suggest that board monitoring is only activated when shareholder-oriented foreign ownership is high and that the influence of foreign ownership is especially strong in firms without large domestic owners, with high levels of risk and poor performance. Our findings uncover the possibility of the co-existence of different corporate governance logics within a given country, shaped by the nature and weight of foreign owners Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Excess CEO returns refer to CEO financial returns in excess of shareholder returns. How do boards rein in excess CEO returns? Introducing a social capital view of board monitoring, we suggest that boards face two competing normative pressures - corporate elite norms and monitoring norms. How boards conform to such normative pressures for controlling excess CEO returns is affected by their external and internal social capital. Further, we substantiate our arguments by showing that powerful CEOs and institutional investors may facilitate or constrain the normative pressures existing in the social network and alter the effects of board social capital on excess CEO returns. Data from a sample of U.S. corporations listed on the Standard and Poor's 1,500 index from 1999 to 2010 largely support our framework. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Reporting requirements, targets, and quotas have been implemented in several countries to increase female representation in leadership. In three studies, we analyze the effectiveness of these strategies from a goal-setting perspective. Study 1 evaluates the relationship between reporting requirements and female representation on boards of directors with data from Fortune 500 companies from 1996 to 2015. Study 2 analyzes the association of reporting requirements, targets, and quotas with the representation of women on boards of directors of public companies across 91 countries. Study 3 evaluates the impact of targets and quotas for women in parliaments across 190 nations. The board diversity reporting directive introduced in the US was followed by an acceleration in the increase of female representation on boards of directors of Fortune 500 companies. Higher goals for women on boards of directors were related to higher female representation. Similarly, higher gender goals and strong enforcement mechanisms in parliaments were related to higher female representation. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper explores the interaction between a prominent board of directors and the network of inter-firm relationships on new product development. Specifically, we posit a positive interaction effect between a prominent board and the inter-firmnetwork and structural holes positions on the number of newproducts developed by the firm. We test the theoretical framework on a sample of 1758 agreements among 1890 biopharmaceutical firms over the period 2006-2010.We find that by filtering, complementing and legitimizing information coming from the inter-firm network, a prominent interlocking directorate network can improve the inter-firm network's effects on new product development. We discuss important implications for how inter-personal networks (such as the board interlock directorate network) help to develop the effectiveness of inter-firm relationship networks in achieving new product development outcomes.

Agency theory-grounded research on boards of directors and firm legitimacy has historically viewed CEO power as de-legitimating, often taking this fact for granted in theorizing about external assessors' evaluations of a firm. With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be. Data from 151 U.S. semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms over a 10-year period generally support our predictions. (c) 2016 Academy of Management Journal.

How do a country's basic institutions enable or hinder women's rise to the boards of public companies? The study evaluates this question with reference to the five basic institutions that research suggests are common across all countries: family, education, economy, government, and religion. The study draws on a sample, which consists of 23 countries, and the study is framed in neo-institutional theory. In analyzing the role of these institutions, the article seeks to understand better the relationships between specific institutions and the share of board seats held by women. The results suggest that four of the five basic institutions are related to the share of board seats women hold. Family, education, economy, and government influence women's rise to the board; however, religion does not influence women's rise to the corporate board of directors.

Research summary: Many boards view their chairs as valuable resources. We predict that whether a board adopts such a view depends on the board chair's human and social capital. Data from S&P 500 firms suggest that while a board chair's human capital increases the probability that the board views him or her as a resource, social capital has no overall effect. In a post-hoc investigation, however, we find the board chair's independence to be an important boundary condition for the effect of social capital. With this exploratory research, we aim to spur research devoted specifically to board chairs. Such research will become increasingly important over time as firms continue to separate their CEO and board chair positions. Managerial summary: The purpose of this research was to determine the factors that lead a board of directors to view its chair as a valuable resource. We expected that board chairs with high human and social capital would be more likely to be viewed as a resource by their colleagues. Surprisingly, only human capital exhibited such an effect overall. Social capital increases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is independent, but actually decreases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is either the current or former CEO. These results suggest that boards generally value human capital in their chairs, but view social capital through a somewhat more complex lens. We explore the possible implications of these findings in the article. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Previous studies report inconsistent findings regarding how board monitoring influences firms' research and development (R&D) intensity. This study uses agency theory and resource dependence theory to argue that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between these two constructs. By using board capital theory, the present study also postulates that this curvilinear relationship varies depending on the firm- and industry-specific human capital of outside directors. 467 firm-year observations collected from a randomly selected sample of large public firms from high-tech industries between 2005 and 2010 largely provide empirical support for these arguments. The findings contribute to the corporate governance literature by refining the understanding of the costs and benefits associated with board monitoring. The curvilinear relationship reported herein may also help reconcile prior inconsistent findings. The results also contribute to board capital theory by emphasizing the role of outside directors' firm-specific human capital in the context of R&D investments. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: Board interlocks are a phenomenon of widespread prevalence and one of the most vibrant topics in corporate governance research. However, despite sustained academic interest in interlocks, there has not been a comprehensive review of the literature in nearly two decades. To address this need for an up-to-date review, this paper aims to conduct an assessment and integration of the empirical research on board interlocks. Design/methodology/approach: In reviewing the board interlocks literature, the "systematic review" approach, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, has been used. Using this method, 81 empirical papers that became the focus of this analysis have been identified. Findings: This review reveals that board interlocks research can be categorized based on the theoretical lens used, its focus on antecedents or outcomes of interlock activities and the perspective of the study (i.e. firm- or director-level). Moreover, a number of commonly examined themes have been identified. Several unexpected omissions in the literature have also been uncovered. For instance, it was found that scholars have neither examined the implications of engaging in interlocks in a global context nor have they explored the phenomenon of international interlocks (i.e. interlocks between firms located in different countries). Originality/value: In developing a deeper understanding of the board interlocks literature, this review identifies several topics and disciplines that, if pursued, could enrich the literature and open promising avenues for future research.

Chinese listed companies have a two-tier (dual) governance structure that comprises a supervisory board/committee (SB) and the board of directors (BoD). However, as there is no hierarchical relationship between them, the two boards are independent. This is different from the governance mechanism in Continental Europe in which the SB appoints the directors of the management board; in this sense, the Chinese two-tier governance structure is unique. We investigate the impact of governance characteristics and ownership structure on gender diversity of both the BoD and the SB for a sample of 892 Chinese Initial Public Offerings floated in both the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. We find that the average proportion of female directors and female SB members on the BoD and the SB are 10 and 22 %, respectively. Using both static and dynamic panel data methods, we find that there is no significant impact of board structure on gender diversity in China. However, we find a positive and significant relationship between SB size and gender diversity. We also find that the higher the state ownership, the lower the female representation on both boards. Finally, our findings show that there is a bi-directional relationship between financial performance and the proportion of female directors sitting on the BoD.

Research summary: We examine how board members' reactions following financial misconduct differ from those following other adverse organizational events, such as poor performance. We hypothesize that inside directors and directors appointed by the CEO may be particularly concerned about their reputation following deceptive financial practices. We demonstrate that directors more closely affiliated with the CEO are more likely to reduce their support for the CEO following financial misconduct, increasing the likelihood of CEO replacement. Enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act similarly alters governance dynamics by creating a greater expectation for sound corporate governance. We demonstrate our findings in U.S. public firms that restated their financial earnings during a 12-year period before and after the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley. Managerial summary: Given past concerns about lack of oversight by boards of directors leading to firm financial misconduct, we examine how the relationship between directors and CEOs may be altered in the face of such misconduct. We argue that directors most closely tied to the CEO (inside board members and board members appointed by the CEO), typically the most supportive of the CEO, may become most concerned about their own reputation following financial misconduct. We find that CEOs receive less support from these directors, a finding in contrast to past studies demonstrating that such board members tend to shield CEOs following poor performance. These findings are accentuated following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which places greater responsibility on the CEO for the accuracy of financial reports.

We advance the literature on the demographic factors that shape organizational outcomes by analyzing the impact of the gender composition of firm leadership on the likelihood that a firm will adopt lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)-friendly policies. Drawing on social role and token theory, we test the relative impact of CEO gender and the gender composition of the board of directors separately and together in order to identify the effects of gender diversity at the top of the organization. We rely on a unique data set that includes corporate policies (gender identity and sexual orientation non-discrimination policies, domestic-partner benefits, and overall corporate equality index scores) as well as the gender of the CEO and board of directors among Fortune 500 firms over a 10-year period. Our findings suggest that firms with gender-diverse boards are more likely than other firms to offer LGBT-friendly policies, whereas findings for firms with women CEOs offer mixed results.

This study examines how firms use benchmarking information about peers to determine the compensation that they offer to chief executive officers (CEOs). It jointly addresses two distinct perspectives: pay equity and managerial power. Pay inequity provides strong motivation for CEOs to restore equity, by promoting the logic of external fairness and urging boards of directors to implement peer benchmarking and adjust the focal CEO's compensation levels. Although pay inequity may motivate CEOs to restore equity, their reaction to inequity may be effective only when they have sufficient power over the board of directors to influence the pay-setting process. Results from a sample of 1,555 CEOs generally support predictions about the moderating effects of CEO power in the relationship between a focal CEO's pay and peer CEOs' pay. The compensation for underpaid CEOs with relatively greater power over the board is associated with their peers' compensation, suggesting that peer benchmarking is more aggressively used to adjust CEO compensation upward. For overpaid CEOs, the relationship between the focal CEO's pay and peer CEOs' pay is weaker when the CEOs have greater influence over the board, suggesting that such CEOs are able to avoid the use of benchmarking and downward adjustments of pay.

Research summary: We develop a theory to explain why new outside CEOs can better manage their relationship with the board if they previously served on boards that were more diverse than the focal board. We predict that a new outside CEO's prior experience with more diverse boards not only reduces the likelihood of post-succession CEO turnover and director turnover, but also improves firm performance. Results from an analysis of 188 outside CEOs in a sample of Fortune 500 companies provide support for our theory. This study contributes to upper echelon theory and research by identifying outside CEOs' prior experience with board diversity as an important aspect of their background that influences a range of major organizational outcomes, including CEO turnover, director turnover, and firm performance. Managerial summary: It is challenging to be a new CEO who comes from outside of the organization. Our study examines why some new outside CEOs fare better than others. We suggest that a positive relationship with the board of directors is a key factor in a new outside CEO's success. A new outside CEO can better manage the relationship with the board if he or she has prior experience working with other demographically diverse boards. In contrast, when the focal board is more diverse than the other boards on which the new CEO previously served, the new CEO tends to struggle in managing his or her relationship with the board, experiencing a higher likelihood of turnover and delivering worse financial performance.

Recent research on the actual behaviour of boards suggests that more attention should be given to group dynamics in boards of directors. Therefore, we investigate if faultlines are detrimental to the role performance of boards of directors in family firms. In contrast to previous studies that only focus on one attribute, we use a more encompassing measure of faultlines, which is based on three attributes simultaneously (family-membership, type of directorship, and gender). Furthermore, we investigate the moderating role of formal board evaluation. Findings suggest a negative relationship between faultlines and both board control and service role performance. Interestingly, our study indicates that in boards that use formal evaluations, the negative effect of faultlines on control role performance is reversed. We discuss implications for faultline theory and research on boards of directors. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Although corporate governance researchers have devoted considerable attention to the role of boards of directors in monitoring management and providing resources, less attention has been paid to whether and how they affect the strategic actions of firms in response to changing environments. Taking a process-based perspective, we examine how several prevalent board processes (i.e., board meetings, outside-board-meeting reviewws and information utilization) affect the involvement of boards in strategic decision-making and how such involvement shapes organizational performance. Moreover, we offer an initial attempt to compare the strategic role of boards in for-profit and non-profit organizations. An investigation of 217 for-profit and 156 non-profit organizations in Canada indicates that different processes lead boards to different levels of strategic involvement, and that such effects are contingent on the types of organizations concerned. Moreover, boards that are active in strategic decision-making enhance the performance of their organizations. Our findings have implications for board research and practice.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to define the contribution of intellectual capital (IC) of the board of directors (BDs) in generating IC of a company, to develop a definition of the IC of the BDs, as well as two of its major elements: human capital (knowledge, skills, and experience of board members, etc.), and social capital (relationships and networking opportunities of board members), and to clarify the relationship between these elements and financial performance indicators of companies based on a literature review on the topic. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review and analysis was applied as this study's research design. Findings: The authors suggest that IC is generated not only by company staff, but also by governing bodies, particularly the BDs, whose members are not always under contract with the company in the traditional sense. Members of the board use their knowledge, experience, and networking opportunities to build IC for effective monitoring, advising, and providing the company with resources. In this sense, the BDs serves as a source of IC for a company, being the main internal corporate governance mechanism that leads to value creation in a company, taking into consideration the interests of all stakeholders. Practical implications: The research indicates that the personal characteristics of board members may influence the performance of a company. Therefore, companies should be recommended to carefully select candidates for nomination to the board. Originality/value: This study contributes to further development of the concept of IC of the BDs by bringing together the theory in the field and the empirical results of studies on the various elements of board capital in a company's value creation.

New ventures often form a formal board of directors for the first time at the initial public offering (IPO). The tumult of external changes places a premium on rapid decision making within a resource-constrained venture. According to the social psychological theory, group consensus and decision alternatives serve as two key drivers for making rapid decisions. Therefore, based on signaling theory, the valuation from investors at the IPO depends on the observable signals that can imply the group consensus and decision alternatives in a board. We argue and test the hypothesis that, when group consensus and decision alternative signals are jointly considered, the relationship between the ratio of founders on the board and the IPO price premium will have an inversed U shape. In addition, we analyze how three contextual factors (original chief executive officer [CEO], founders' ownership, and venture capitalist [VC] on the board) can influence their signal consistency with founder directors on group consensus and decision alternatives, which ultimately changes the pattern of the inverted U shape. Based on a unique sample of 274 Chinese new venture IPOs over the period from 2004 to 2009, our results show that if the firm is managed by a nonoriginal CEO, the relationship between the founder-board ratio and the IPO price premium is an inverse U shape. Furthermore, if a VC sits on the board, the presence of founder directors has a linear positive effect on IPO premium; otherwise, the inverse U-shaped relationship still holds.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the influence of information and knowledge exchange and sharing between managers and non-executive directors is important in assessing the dynamic processes of accountability in boardrooms. By analysing information/knowledge at multiple levels, invoking the literature on implicit/tacit and explicit information/knowledge, the authors show that information asymmetry is a necessary condition for effective boards. The authors introduce a conceptual model of manager-non-executive director information asymmetry as an outcome of the interpretation of information/knowledge-sharing processes amongst board members. The model provides a more nuanced agenda of the management-board information asymmetry problem to enable a better understanding of the role of different types of information in practice. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation and the resultant conceptual model are based on the following elements: manager-non-executive director information/knowledge, management-board information/knowledge and board dynamics and reciprocal processes converting implicit/tacit into explicit information/knowledge. Findings - The paper provides new insights into the dynamics of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors (individual level)/between management and boards (group level). The authors characterise this as a two-way process, back-and-forth between managers/executive directors and non-executive directors. The importance of relative/experienced "ignorance" of non-executive directors is revealed, which the authors term the "information asymmetry paradox". Research limitations/implications - The authors set out key opportunities for developing a research agenda from the model based on prior research of knowledge conversion processes and how these may be applied in a boardroom setting. Practical implications - The model may assist directors in better understanding their roles and the division of labour between managers and non-executive directors from an information/knowledge perspective. Originality/value - The authors apply Ikujiro Nonaka's knowledge conversion framework to consider the transitioning from individual implicit personal to explicit shared information/knowledge, to understand the subtle processes at play in boardrooms influencing information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: How do conflicting institutional logics predict and explain the overstatement of corporate governance compliance in a developing country?. Research Findings/Insights: A unique opportunity to study overstatement of compliance is available through checklists published in annual reports by companies in Bangladesh. A data set contrasting with that available from checklists is collected by a confidential survey of company secretaries. Overstatement of compliance with the country's Corporate Governance Guideline issued in 2006 is measured by comparing the published compliance with that revealed by the survey. There is significant overstatement of compliance in annual reports, particularly with respect to the less directly observable provisions of the Guideline. The overstatement is positively associated with control by a sponsor family and is negatively associated with the presence of an institutional investor on the board of directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The logic associated with the regulative framework of an Anglo-American-based corporate governance model conflicts with the logic of a cultural-cognitive institutional framework in a developing country. The resulting contest of legitimacy motivates firms to overstate compliance with the Corporate Governance Guideline 2006 in annual reports. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study highlights the challenges of introducing an Anglo-American model of corporate governance in a developing country. National and international investors should seek to understand the reality of the corporate governance structure of firms in developing countries, rather than relying solely on compliance reported in annual reports. For researchers, there may be limitations in using the compliance reported in annual reports as a measure of corporate governance. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine in greater depth the concept of "board capital", which the authors consider to be a bundle of three types of capital, and believe to be a clear antecedent of the board's ability to perform its roles, which have positive consequences for the firm's performance. Design/methodology/approach: Through 83 firms listed on The Madrid Stock Exchange during the period 2005-2010, the authors test empirically the relationships between different dimensions of board capital and firm performance, and specially how internal social capital moderates the relationships between board human capital and external social capital with firm performance. Findings: The results show that certain characteristics of human capital (average board tenure) and external social capital (directors' interlocks) are positively related to the firm performance. The empirical findings also indicate that the internal social capital, measured by board density, is positively related to the firm performance and moderates these above relationships, increasing the potential of the resources contributed by the board members and influencing to a large extent on a firm's performance. Practical implications: The results of the investigation will help both executives and scholar in two ways. First, they will assist firms when they have to select board members, as they can now understand how the resources that board members bring with them can affect the firm performance. To be more effective, boards need to have members that have experience as firm's directors, external connections to other boards and many internal ties among them. Second, in this context, internal social capital is especially relevant, so the firms should look for possible ways of encouraging internal ties between directors. In this paper, the authors have opted for study the participation of directors in committees. Originality/value: The authors propose that these three types of capital (human, external and internal social capital) need to be synergistically combined to create a group of directors with access to a complete set of skills, knowledge and connections, but which can still work as a compact social group when making decisions.

This paper examines the firm-level antecedents of Six Sigma adoption in Korea. Our results indicate that firms with top executives and board members having work experience in the foreign country where the focal management practice originated and was popularized are more likely to adopt this practice. Furthermore, firms' exposure to foreign investors exerts a direct effect and also moderates the impact of foreign work experience on adoption. Prior work experience in the country of practice origin reduces the uncertainty inherent in cross-border adoption by providing executives and board members with greater insight into the presumed benefits of the focal practice.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether board-related characteristics matter for cost efficiency in banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of publicly traded US commercial banks and savings institutions to estimate a relationship between cost efficiency measured by stochastic frontier analysis and a set of board-related characteristics for the period 2007-2013. Findings: An inverted U-shape relation is found between board size and efficiency. Thus, there is a trade-off between costs and benefits of larger boards. Optimal board size is higher for banks with more complex operations. This study also observed an inverted U-shape relation between board independence and cost efficiency. The banks where the Chairman also executes the CEO responsibility show lower efficiency. However, a higher proportion of independent board members in banks with unitary leadership structure may mitigate the conflict of interest and lower efficiency stemming from CEO duality. Research limitations/implications: This study's evidence supports the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision emphasis on advising a board composition that provides for a sufficient degree of director independence. Practical Implications: The results are relevant for banks and their external and internal stakeholders. Banks may adjust their current board characteristics to increase the board effectiveness. Externally, potential investors can evaluate the quality of corporate governance of banks before making investment decisions. The empirical findings can also be useful for regulators imposing corporate governance codes in banking. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide empirical evidence on the impact of board characteristics on bank efficiency for a wide panel of US banks. Additionally, a comprehensive set of board-related variables is used. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study presents evidence of the influence of gender diversity on the pay system and the monitoring of executives in Spain. In this country/context, characterized by a few male dominant shareholders acting simultaneously as executives, there is an ongoing discussion regarding the enactment of laws to promote gender equality on the boards of directors of large listed companies. This paper presents several contributions. On the one hand, the scarce previous evidence on this topic is focused on US firms. On the other hand, this study includes the role of ownership structure as a factor that indirectly moderates the relationships between gender diversity on board and monitoring effectiveness in terms of executive directors' compensation. Furthermore, this paper makes an important effort to control endogeneity. The sample examined includes 120 companies listed on the Spanish stock market during the period 2004-2011. The results show a positive and highly significant effect of the presence of women independent directors on the proportion of variable pay in the compensation of executive directors. Our findings also point out the negative moderating effect of ownership concentration: the more concentrated is ownership in the hands of internal majority shareholder, the less is the link between board diversity and pay-for-performance systems.

In this study, we examine how board characteristics, such as the independent director ratio, board size, and the number of interlocks, influence the investment of slack resources into research and development (R&D) by a firm. Both the agency theory and resource dependence theory predict a positive influence of independent director ratio on the financial slack-R&D investment relationship. However in the case of board size and number of interlocks, resource dependence theory argues for a positive moderating effect, while agency theory predicts a negative effect. The hypotheses are tested on the seven-year panel data of 172 firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry, an emerging economy, high technology industry. We find broad support for the resource provisioning role of the board of directors, which is attributed to the emerging economy context of the Indian pharmaceutical industry, where firms face high levels of opportunity but lack resources to make use of them effectively.

This paper provides new evidence of innovation processes in family firms by investigating their attitude toward the protection of innovation outputs. More specifically, the main objective is to understand, through the SEW (Socioemotional Wealth) lens, whether innovative family firms tend to use patents as a tool for protecting intellectual property. Based on a sample of 229 Italian companies that make R&D investments, our analysis highlights that degree of alignment with the family business model is a significant predictor of a firm's attitude toward protecting innovation with patents, even though not all of the dimensions of a family business have the same effect. When disentangling the effect of three different indicators (i.e., family ownership, family governance and the presence of young successors), family involvement in the board of directors is a negative significant driver, the presence of young successors is a positive driver, and ownership has no effect.

Research summary: The formation of interorganizational ties is a consequential phenomenon examined in strategic management research. Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips (2004) is one of the first studies to comprehensively consider interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect both alliance and board interlock formation. They find that firm-specific uncertainty relates to broadening actions, whereas market-level uncertainty causes firms to reinforce current structures. Our replication considers whether these relationships operate similarly in a differing temporal context. Building from the framework of the original study, we suggest our findings offer intriguing new empirical evidence highlighting the importance of time as a boundary condition in understanding embedded firm actions. Managerial summary: The development of interorganizational relationships, such as alliances and ties between boards of directors, has an important impact on innovation, strategic actions, and firm performance. This study examines whether the dynamics of interorganizational relationship formation remain consistent over time. We replicate earlier work by Beckman and colleagues (2004), but with an expanded data set covering more than 20 years. Over this broader time horizon, we find a shift in behavior, with companies facing firm-specific uncertainty seeking to reinforce their current relationships and companies facing industry-wide uncertainty seeking to diversify their risk by expanding their network. Our results demonstrate the importance of replication studies in research and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding interorganizational relationships.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of cognitive diversity on strategic issue interpretation among the boards of directors making sense of sustainability management. The study also investigated the centrality of the corporate sustainability issues to identify common interpretative patterns in the shared cognitive maps among the companies. In addition, the aim was to advance quantitative methods for the analysis of decision-makers' cognition. Design/methodology/approach - The research was an exploratory study analyzing 43 individual cognitive maps collected through surveys from the boards of nine cleantech companies. For the elicitation of the cognitive maps, the study used the hybrid cognitive mapping technique. The diversity of the shared cognitive maps was analyzed using the distance ratio formula and the graph analysis method with eigenvector to measure the centrality of the strategic issue interpretation in the maps. Findings - This study provides evidence through the analysis of distance ratios on the existence of cognitive diversity among companies within the same industry. Surprisingly, despite the cognitive diversity, the study identified strong common patterns on strategic issue interpretations among the companies. In addition, the study shows that the sustainability management issues have gained minor attention from the boards of directors. Research limitations/implications - The initial industry sample provided relatively restricted perspectives on managerial cognition, and to confirm the findings regarding the effects of industry on the shared cognitive maps of top decision-makers, wider industry-level data are needed. Practical implications - This study provides an approach to facilitate the process of strategic decision-making for top decision-makers by identifying the shared beliefs of the selected strategic theme and to concentrate on the most central strategic issues in the company and industry. It reveals asymmetry between the significance of sustainability issues in an open agenda and the real position of sustainability concepts in the shared cognitive maps in the green industry. Also, the study advances cognitive mapping techniques for application in the board's decision-making. Originality/value - This paper contributes to brightening the black box of corporate governance by shedding light on the interaction of the concepts of corporate sustainability and other key strategic issues within the shared cognitive maps of the boards. It also provides new empirical knowledge on top decision-making processes and the effects of cognitive diversity on the strategic issue interpretations within the corporate boards of the green industry, and it further develops the methodology for the quantification of cognitive diversity and the content of cognitive maps.

The growing importance of board diversity among directors has been established as a result of global financial crisis in 2008. According to the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance 2012, nominating committee shall be responsible to select directors with diverse background that meet the needs of the company. This paper attempts to examine the impacts of having female directors in a nomination committee on gender diversity on board. For this purpose, 393 (50%) non-financial Malaysian listed companies were selected for the three year period of 2011 to 2013. Results indicated that having female directors in a nomination committee is significantly related to the level of gender diversity on board. The results also signify the importance to have female directors in nomination committee as it will influence gender diversity on board. (c) 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

The question of whether a "good" corporate board structure can optimize performance and minimize conflicts between managers and shareholders has been widely debated. Because mergers and acquisitions represent major managerial investment decisions that are subject to board scrutiny, the effectiveness of a board's structure is especially visible in the context of corporate acquisitions. With that in mind, in this paper, we examine the abundant literature in the fields of strategic management, economics, and finance in order to identify which board attributes contribute to the ability of corporate boards to create value through mergers and acquisitions. In particular, we discuss the impact of four board attributes: (1) board independence, (2) board size and director-specific attributes, (3) board ownership and compensation, (4) multiple directorships. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the impact of board attributes on shareholder wealth in mergers and acquisitions is specific to each firm. Therefore, board regulations that do not reflect a firm's specific needs may in fact hinder the creation of a board that is capable of responding effectively to the firm's unique needs and circumstances.

This paper examines the effects of board quality on the relationship between corporate bankruptcy and nomination committee effectiveness. We argue that the proportion of outside directors, a proxy of board quality, arguably captures the extent of board control and resources. Based on dataset from 1835 firm-year observations for 98 bankrupt and 269 non-bankrupt UK listed non-financial firms between 1994 and 2011 and using the agency and resource dependence theories, we predict and find that nomination committee effectiveness negatively affects corporate bankruptcy and that board quality mitigates the negative effects. The results lend support to the notion that firms benefit from board quality in terms of outside directors' ability to monitor CEO on behalf of shareholders and also provide advice, counsel and legitimacy to the firm. This study extends the present research on corporate bankruptcy by providing evidence on the impact of board quality and nomination committee effectiveness on UK corporate bankruptcy.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study whether and how owners' preferences for CEO characteristics changed due to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. The authors identify three fundamental success factors needed for companies to compete in the after-crisis environment, and the authors connect five CEO characteristics to such factors. Design/methodology/approach - The authors rely on a hand-collected database to build a panel data of European CEOs for the 2010-2012 period. Findings - The empirical results indicate that after 2009, CEOs of companies that were more severely hit by the crisis are significantly different compared to those of other companies. More specifically, they have a background in science or engineering; they have international experience; and they are remunerated to a higher extent through stock options. The results of this paper also indicate that only international experience had a positive and significant impact on financial performance. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the stream of literature on CEO characteristics and owners' identity, tackling the research theme from a dynamic rather than from a static perspective.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms of corporate governance in companies and to delineate their effect from the perspective of two variables: the financial performance of firms; and an examination of executive turnover. An analysis on theoretical grounds of these two variables is made with respect to non-financial companies specifically in the context of the country of Jordan. Also in the context of this study, a company represents a firm. A sample comprising 109 companies from the non-financial sector for the fiscal year 2011 was selected and analyzed. A cross sectional study tested all hypotheses of the study and used statistical software, SPSS 20, to analyze the data. The study has examined the structure of the board of directors and its effects on the financial performance (financial leverage) of the non-financial Jordanian companies. Evidence suggests that the corporate governance mechanisms such as increasing the board size has a positive effect on reducing the level of financial leverage, thus leading to enhanced levels of financial performance. On the other hand, board independence and the structure of non CEOduality have no effect on a company's financial performance. In addition, the findings revealed that executive turnover has been found to significantly moderate the relationship between some of the factors and that is the board size and financial leverage. Given the diversity of trends utilized to measure the financial performance of companies in the area of corporate governance and the associated performance relationship, empirical research has continued to undergo new financial performance indicators to prevent manipulation and to obtain a realistic picture of the financial performance of companies. Hence, this is the first study that internationally chooses financial leverage to represent the financial performance of companies in their relationship with corporate governance. Crucially, it is globally the first study to choose executive turnover as a moderating variable on such a relationship. Thus, choosing these two new variables uniquely contributes to the literature of both corporate governance and firm performance from the perspective of developed and developing countries. This is considered to extend and add new insights to prior research in this discipline. The study therefore provides empirical evidence to policy-makers, stakeholders, academia and other interested parties in the Middle East; specifically in Jordan.

Purpose - The chapter builds on the literature of Agency and Signalling Theories to analyse the corporate governance factors associated with the voluntary decision to prepare an Integrated Report according to the International Framework promoted by the IIRC. Methodology/approach - The chapter is based on the results of a probit regression run with regard to a sample of 35 companies that joined the Pilot Programme in 2011 and 137 similar companies that did not. Findings - The analysis of two samples of European companies reveals that adhesion to the IR Pilot Programme is positively related to the gender diversity and size of the board. Research limitations - Further research is required in order to study the differences between listed and non-listed companies in terms of variables affecting the adoption of the Framework and to increase the time range of our study. In addition, it would be interesting to include other variables capturing different aspects other than corporate governance, since the decision to join the Programme, as the results of our analysis have shown, may also be influenced by other factors, such as strategy decisions and communication policies. Originality/value - The chapter adds to the existing literature by showing the main governance characteristics that impact the decision to adhere to the IR Pilot Programme. It is also important to the existing literature regarding the role played by gender diversity in corporate governance mechanisms and CSR policies.

Initiation and support from boardrooms are factors that are important to a Taiwanese firm's ability to change its strategic orientation from manufacturing to branding. We examine whether board members' educational backgrounds contribute to firms' branding success. We find that firms are more likely to be successful in brand development when their board members have been educated at top-ranked universities, foreign universities, and top MBA programs. The results are more robust when branding is successful at a global rather than a domestic level. Our argument is further supported by the finding that the educational background of board members is more relevant for branding success in industries with more mature branding practices.

This study seeks to determine the impact of the implementation of good corporate governance practices on the family business Board of Directors, observing the impact on the family socioemotional wealth. Using four cases study from family businesses in Colombia-South America, the results show that the implementations of corporate governance practices in the Board of Directors have strong tendencies to preserve the family's socioemotional wealth. Furthermore, unity, honesty, transparency and amity are factors boosting both family and business success.

We examine the relationship between the board of directors and earnings persistence. We define the advisory role of board members as providing strategic counsel to top management. We argue that strategic counseling provided by the board helps create and sustain growth, which, in turn, translates into more persistent earnings. We find that for firms whose boards are dedicated to advising, earnings are more persistent and the association between earnings and future cash flows is higher, compared with firms whose boards are not focused on advising. We further find that advising by boards increases the persistence of both the cash flows component and the accruals component of current earnings. In additional analyses, we fail to find a consistently positive correlation between boards with intensive monitoring and more persistent earnings. Putting together, these results suggest that the relation between board structure and earnings persistence is more likely driven by the advisory role and less likely by the monitoring function of the board of directors.

Despite extensive research on the internationalization-performance relationship, our understanding of the role of board of directors in the internationalization of emerging-market firms remains relatively limited. In addition, research pertaining to the board's influence on firm performance has tended to focus more on board content than on its processes. In an attempt to address this research gap, we study the contingent role of the board's capabilities on the relationship between internationalization and performance, in emerging-market firms. We propose that board tenure will have a negative moderating effect, whereas board members' experience as CEO or general manager, industry-specific experience, international experience, and level of academic achievement will have positive moderating effects. We argue that, in the context of emerging market firms, board interactions are particularly important, and propose that moderate levels of board interaction will be most beneficial for the internationalizationperformance relationship.

Committees on a board of directors are now subject to recommendations by regulations in practically all jurisdictions. At the same time, scholarly work on the topic has escalated since the mid-1990s. In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

This study examines the degree to which senior executive members of a school's decision-making team (senior management team and board of directors) are aligned on fundamental principles of school strategy. Our study is based on a conceptual framework of strategic leadership as it applies in an Australian independent school context. We also examine the differences between the senior management team and board of directors based on top management team (TMT) tenure heterogeneity, and how these differences account for TMT associations with school strategy. Implications for research and practice complete the study. The terms top management team, senior management team, and senior leadership team are used interchangeably in this article.

The aim of this paper is to determine to what extent globalization pressures are changing interlocking directorate networks modeled on continental capitalism into Anglo-Saxon models. For this purpose we analyse the Spanish network of interlocks, comparing the present structure (2012) with that of 1993 and 2006. We show how, although Spanish corporative structure continues to display characteristics of the continental economies, some major banks are significantly reducing industrial activity. Nevertheless, the financial organizations continue to maintain a close relationship with sectors such as construction and services. The analysis of the network of directorates shows a retreat in activity of industrial banking in Spain. Two large Spanish financial institutions, BSCH and La Caixa, continue to undertake activities of industrial banking in 2006, but this activity is significantly reduced in 2012. According to the theories on the role of the interlocking directorates, the companies in these sectors assure their access to banking credit by incorporating advisors from financial organizations to their board of directors. We cannot conclude that the structure of the Spanish corporate network has become a new case of Anglo-Saxon structure, but we got indications that are becoming less hierarchic as banks seem to slowly abandon centrality positions. This is especially salient if we compare the networks of 2006 and 2012, which show a continuing decrease of the role of banks and insurance companies in the network.

The importance of the composition of the Board of Directors of an organization is an issue that has received special attention in recent years. Studies about the effect of the presence of independent managers, managers of different ethnic groups and different genders, seek to determine whether a diverse management will have different approaches and opinions that may enrich the process of decision making and improve the performance of the company. In the particular case of women participation, there are previous studies on this matter for developed economies. However, there are no studies about countries such as Peru, characterized by a dominance of male figures in the business world. The role that women have played during the past few years in the Peruvian business environment has gained special importance and serves as motivation for this study to determine if their presence on the Board has any effect on the performance of the company, especially on its financial dimension. Using a sample of 137 non-financial companies listed on the Lima Stock Exchange, the main results show that female participation in the Board does not significantly affect the financial performance of an organization.

The appointment of a new CEO is among the most pivotal and visible decisions made by the board of directors. Yet while much research explores how firm performance, governance structures, and types of succession affect the appointment decision, we have less understanding of the influence of contextual factors such as external constituents. This paper is the first to explore how one key constituent -investment analysts -may shape the appointment decision, specifically through serving as an information intermediary for the board. Because CEO succession creates uncertainty regarding the firm's future leadership and its strategic direction, I propose that investment analysts, as knowledgeable experts who provide research coverage on the firm, provide the board with information that is likely to influence their selection of a new CEO. In addition, I argue that because analysts are recognized as having expertise regarding the future performance of the firm, the board is likely to select a CEO in order to appease these critical stakeholders. Using panel data on S & P 500 companies for the 2000-2005 periods, I find evidence that analyst recommendations convey information about a firm's top management and the appropriateness of its strategy that is reflected in the appointment decision. Specifically, I find that more negative analyst ratings lead to a higher probability that the board will appoint an outsider CEO and also make the board more likely to appoint a high status CEO.

The previous literature suggests that firms may use the characteristics of the board members as a signal for building their own image. The objective of this paper is to analyze whether the number of appointments of directors influences corporate reputation. For that, we focus on a sample of US firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the period 2007-2010 and we examine a total of 30,813 directors. Our results indicate that there is a curvilinear relationship between the number of directorships of board members and corporate reputation. These findings shed some light on the value of boards of directors and also have implications for companies in the selection of board members. (c) 2016 Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

Following poorly performing acquisitions, the board of directors often redesigns the CEO's annual compensation package to include less risk-encouraging stock options and more risk-discouraging restricted stock. This study explores the emerging area of post-acquisition compensation management and proposes that CEOs can indirectly, but effectively, defend against compensation rebalancing. Specifically, we find that CEOs may counteract the effects of compensation rebalancing by delaying the exercise of existing stock option holdings. Fortunately, this insight also offers valuable implications including the ability of the board to limit the CEO's defense by adjusting stock option exercise windows.

The purpose of corporate governance mechanisms is to prevent opportunistic behaviour by managers, in order to align the interests of owners and managers. Following from this, our research topic is the analysis of ownership concentration as an internal mechanism to protect the interests of shareholders. In the study of the interdependence between ownership concentration and shareholder protection, particular importance needs to be given to the relationship between ownership structure, the role of the board, and strategic decision-making. Starting from this interdependence, our research aim is to examine the impact of ownership concentration on the protection of shareholders' interests and the board's responsibility for firm strategy. This paper presents the results of an empirical, pilot study in the Republic of Serbia. The research confirms the interdependence of corporate governance mechanisms and strategic decision-making. Our findings indicate that ownership concentration protects majority shareholder interests and leads to lower board responsibility for strategic decision-making.

Manuscript type: Empirical Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically determine whether the one-rule-fits-all approached adopted by the Nigerian Securities Exchange Commission in terms of the separation of board chairman form the CEO promotes firm performance irrespective of the firms' ownership structures, in Nigerian with strong dominance of family owned firms. Design/methodology/approach: The study is restricted to firms quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Pooled data for 18-years period 1994-2011 were collated from published annual reports and statement of accounts of 91 ownership dispersed firms and 72 ownership concentrated firms. Two equation system Ordinary Least Square multiple regressions were used to estimate the relationship between firm financial performance and CEO duality along ownership structures in Nigeria. Findings: The findings of the study showed that while board duality was negative in predicting the financial performance of ownership dispersed firms; same cannot be said of ownership concentrated firms (family owned firms) as duality was found to be positive in predicting financial performance. Research Limitations/Implications: Paucity of substantial local literature on institutional perspective of agency constitutes the major limitation of this study. Although, this study is meant to close this gap, the implication is that foreign theoretical and empirical literature standpoint constitutes the bulk of the review, which may not explain reasons for any identifiable local trends in Nigeria. Practical Implication: The study reveals the importance of taking into cognizance, institutional perspective of agency theory in solving the excess power assigned to the board of directors, especially for family owned firms, where the family members have strong incentive to monitor the managers. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the institutional perspective of agency theory from Nigerian institutional perspective. The study revealed the importance of accommodating individual country specificities in draft corporate governance laws. (c) 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

From the Agency Theory point of view, the role of the board of directors is critical for supervision as well as for the control performed over management, preventing opportunistic behavior by shareholders in general and particularly by controlling shareholders against minority shareholders. Some corporate scandals (Enron, WorldCom, Nortel Networks and AIG, among others) have led to a growing interest on the quality of corporate government because all of those failed firms showed failures in their corporate governance. The delimitation of board functions and the identification of new good practices that allow them to perform their role properly and efficiently is one of the main challenges for governments and regulators in order to ensure their control mechanism duties, whilst restoring the confidence of decision-makers (investors and creditors). In fact, scholarly literature on the subject has linked board performance to different issues (for instance: board structure, nomination practices, diversity, experience and training, internationalization, incentives, remuneration, or board committees). Below is a review of the principles, practices and proposals arisen at the international context to improve board of directors' practices. The purpose of this overview is to point out the main challenges for the future in this regard. (c) 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

Corporations are increasingly being pressured to manage their business risks including their social and environmental risks. The aim of this study is to examine the extent to which plantation companies in Malaysia address their social and environmental risks and the role of the board of directors in motivating the disclosure of risk management information. The agency theory was used to underpin arguments for the study. Content analyses of the annual and sustainability reports of forty (40) public-listed companies in the plantation industry for the year 2013 was undertaken to examine the quantity of risk management disclosure among these companies. The data for the multiple regressions was analyzed using the Structural Equation Modelling technique of Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS). The results of the study revealed that for social risks, Community Involvement issues were the most disclosed item while for environmental risks, the companies were concerned with Pollution Abatement/Environment awareness risk management issues. The findings from the study revealed that board professionalism was significant in inducing management to provide risk management information to stakeholders. However, board interlock and board size were not significant drivers motivating risk management disclosure. The findings from the study suggest that the professionalism of board members is critical to guide managements towards revealing risk management information. The findings from the study provide evidence that plantation companies in emerging economies such as Malaysia are becoming concerned about the social and environmental impacts of the palm oil plantation to the community and are taking steps to address these issues.

This paper examines the relationship between board structure and risk taking behavior of emerging market firms by looking at firms' growth strategies in foreign as well as domestic markets. More specifically, we study the individual and joint effects of board structure, network centrality through board interlocks and ownership structure on firm's growth strategies. With the help of longitudinal data on 2152 publicly listed Indian firms from 2002 to 2009, we find that boards that are structured keeping in view the resource dependence role are more helpful in pursuing growth strategies. We find that firms having more independent board members and CEO duality are more likely to pursue growth through new domestic ventures or new foreign investments. Moreover, firms that are more central in the network of other firms, based on director interlocks, are more likely to pursue growth in domestic as well as international markets. Further we find that board independence interacts with network centrality and family ownership in affecting a firm's growth strategies. (c) 2017

In the wake of the recent debt crisis in Europe, we investigate the influence of board diversity on financial fragility and performance of European banks. Corporate governance codes in Europe recommend unitary and dual-board systems; therefore, we believe that the influence of board diversity may vary across governance mechanisms and that no other studies have addressed these variations and their influence on financial fragility across European countries. The results show that a critical mass of female representation on both the supervisory board and the board of directors may reduce banks' vulnerability to financial crisis. However, interestingly, we find evidence that female directors on the management board are not risk averse. We argue that the degree of risk taking for female directors may vary based on their roles (non-executive or executive) and that female and male executive directors may have the same risk taking behaviour. Our empirical results provide guidelines to the regulators in Europe with respect to the recently approved proposal by the European Parliament on female representation. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Prior research on post-acquisition performance suggests positive, negative, or no wealth creation for the acquiring firms. Grounding our arguments on the extended resource-based view, the current article proposes that business group-affiliated firms leverage their affiliation advantages to attain superior long-term acquisition performance, relative to standalone firms, especially in emerging economies such as India. Additionally, we hypothesize that both within-group heterogeneity, manifested as prior group experience, group diversification, and intra-group variation in the form of horizontal ties through boards of directors, also affect the long-term post-acquisition performance of affiliated firms. The findings, obtained with a buy-and-hold abnormal returns method applied to a sample of 468 majority stake mergers and acquisitions, both domestic and cross-border, by Indian firms during 2005-2013, provide robust support for the theoretical arguments.

The concept of greed is one of the oldest social constructs; however, greed as a managerial attribute that affects firm outcomes has yet to attract scholarly attention in management. In this study, we examine the relationship of CEO greed to shareholder wealth. After anchoring greed to familiar constructs in organizational literature, we test our hypotheses on a sample of over 300 publicly traded firms from multiple industries. As predicted, greed has a negative relationship with shareholder return, but this relationship is moderated by the presence of a powerful, independent board, managerial discretion, and CEO tenure. The contributions of this study, which include refining our understanding of self-interest and opportunism, developing the greed construct, and illustrating its impact on shareholder wealth, are intended to open a new line of inquiry in the management literature.

Research summary: This study examines the relationship between an independent director's death and CEO acquisitiveness. Using a sample of large U.S. public firms, we find that CEOs who have experienced an independent director's death undertake fewer acquisitions in the post-director death period, in particular fewer large acquisitions. Our findings are consistent with the prediction of posttraumatic growth theory that mortality awareness can induce CEOs to reevaluate their life priorities and reduce the importance of extrinsic goals in their decision making. This study contributes to the strategic leadership literature by highlighting the influence of the death of CEOs' social peers on CEOs' strategic decisions. Managerial summary: Does the death of CEOs' social peers influence CEOs' strategic decisions? We find that CEOs who have experienced an independent director's death engage in fewer acquisitions in the post-director death period, in particular fewer large acquisitions. One likely explanation for our findings is that the death of an independent director may heighten CEOs' mortality awareness, lead the CEOs to pursue a quieter life, and weaken their propensities for undertaking decisions (i.e., acquisitions) that increase their compensation and social status.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board independence and gender diversity on the effectiveness of boards in monitoring CEO compensation in a continental European context, i.e. France. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to study the impact of board independence, gender diversity and their interaction, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors on the different components of CEO compensation (total, fixed and variable). Findings: The authors observe that both the proportions of independent directors and women sitting on the boards positively influence the various components of CEO compensation. However, the interaction of these factors, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors, is negatively associated with CEO compensation. These results suggest that independent women directors improve board effectiveness in monitoring CEO compensation, especially its fixed component. Originality/value: The results of this research help to elucidate the importance of women being appointed to boards as independent directors to properly monitor managerial pay. These results provide support to the approach of the French Cope-Zimmerman law of January 2011, which promotes female representation on boards as independent directors to enhance board decision-making. Thus, evidence presented and discussed in this paper should provide useful insights for academics, corporate managers and regulators. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research summary: Corporate scandals of the previous decade have heightened attention on board independence. Indeed, boards at many large firms are now so independent that the CEO is "home alone" as the lone inside member. We build upon "pro-insider" research within agency theory to explain how the growing trend toward lone-insider boards affects key outcomes and how external governance forces constrain their impact. We find evidence among S&P 1500 firms that having a lone-insider board is associated with (a) excess CEO pay and a larger CEO-top management team pay gap, (b) increased likelihood of financial misconduct, and (c) decreased firm performance, but that stock analysts and institutional investors reduce these negative effects. The findings raise important questions about the efficacy of leaving the CEO "home alone.". Managerial summary: Following concerns that insider-dominated boards failed to protect shareholders, there has been a push for greater board independence. This push has been so successful that the CEO is now the only insider on the boards of more than half of S&P 1500 firms. We examine whether lone-insider boards do in fact offer strong governance or whether they enable CEOs to benefit personally. We find that lone-insider boards pay CEOs excessively, pay CEOs a disproportionately large amount relative to other top managers, have more instances of financial misconduct, and have lower performance than boards with more than one insider. Thus, it appears that lone-insider boards do not function as intended and firms should reconsider whether the push towards lone-insider boards is actually in shareholders' best interests.

This paper studies how governance drives entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in small firms. We argue that founder status and ownership create powerful personal incentives for small firm CEOs to engage in behaviors that influence EO. Integrating stewardship theory and the principal-principal branch of agency theory, we test our hypotheses on a sample of 339 Swedish firms, and find that CEO founder status is significantly and positively associated with EO, while CEO stock ownership significantly but negatively predicts EO. We additionally test two boundary conditions that show that the founder-CEO's prior managerial experience in start-up firms positively moderates the founder-EO relationship, while contrary to expectations, CEO ownership diversification has no effect on the negative association between ownership and EO. Thus, our study adopts a corporate governance perspective to explain how variations in EO across small firms are driven by the goals and motivations of its leader. Our research also shows that in small, private firms the balance of power is tipped in favor of the CEO rather than the board of directors. Finally, we underline the importance of adopting alternative theoretical lens like stewardship and principal-principal agency, given that traditional principal-agent problems are largely mitigated in the small firm context.

We examine the relation between boards of directors' knowledge heterogeneity and organizational ambidexterity (OA) (i.e. simultaneous exploration and exploitation) in knowledge-intensive firms (KIFs). Although the literature on OA has started to emphasize its antecedents, the role of the board remains unaddressed. This is an important omission, as boards have become increasingly involved in strategy-making. In turn, studies on boards have looked at their influence on either exploration- or exploitation-type strategies. Yet, KIFs particularly need to balance both exploration and exploitation to renew their knowledge base. We draw on knowledge-based perspectives to disentangle the benefits and costs of board knowledge heterogeneity for driving OA in KIFs. Our empirical analysis based on a longitudinal panel of UK pharmaceutical firms provides support for our hypothesized U-shaped relation. Our findings suggest that the benefits of knowledge heterogeneity only outweigh the costs beyond a particular threshold. Overall, our theoretical approach and allied findings advance the literature by introducing boundary conditions to the resource provision role of boards in KIFs. We discuss contributions for organizational learning, strategic leadership, and human resource management. We conclude with implications for theory and practice, as well as key opportunities for future research. (c) 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

In this empirical study, we investigate the variation in firms' response to institutional pressure for gender-balanced boards, focusing specifically on the preservation of prevailing practices of director selection and its impact on the representation of women on the board of directors. Using 8 years of data from publicly listed Nordic corporations, we show societal pressure to be one of the determinants of female directorship. Moreover, in some corporations, the director selection process may work to maintain "a traditional type of board". In such boards, demographic diversity among male members appears to be associated with a lower share of female directors, although we cannot establish wether this reflects discrimination or a desire to maintain critical competencies. With this paper we add to the theoretical understanding of the factors underlying female board appointments by adopting an institutional theory lens to study female board representation. Viewing the demands for gender-balanced boards in terms of societal pressure for the de-institutionalization of the prevailing norms and practices, we highlight preferences for maintaining established practices as a potentially important barrier to institutional change. On these grounds, we conjecture on the relationship between the gender diversity of boards and other diversity dimensions. We suggest that a board room gender quota (if implemented) is supplemented by policies to ensure the transparency of board changes, in order to prevent the crowding out of other diversity dimensions.

Boards of directors represent a central factor for firm success by performing different tasks such as control, networking, or advice. Stemming from socioemotional wealth (SEW) literature, the aim of this article is to investigate the board tasks-financial performance relationship, showing their different contributions in family and non-family firms when firm survival is at stake. The main hypotheses are tested through moderated linear regression analyses. The findings suggest that while advisory tasks generally enhance financial performance in family firms, especially during turmoil, networking and control tasks have a detrimental effect when these firms suffer internal financial crises. Hence, we contribute to the SEW paradigm by underlining that family firms seem to accept performance hazards in order to protect family discretion and a positive public reputation even when they suffer severe hardship. In contrast, board advice supports utilizing family firms' unique social capital and significantly bolsters financial performance, without disturbing the family and its SEW preservation needs.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

Governance scholars debate the value of directors as an effective governance mechanism. We suggest that this value varies with director tenure. We study both how shareholder assessments of the value of individual directors vary with director tenure and whether director tenure actually makes a practical difference to governance effectiveness. Using data from abnormal stock price reactions to the sudden deaths of 274 outside directors, and integrating executive cognition and social capital perspectives applied to the dual roles of director monitoring and advising, our results confirm a curvilinear relationship between the assessed value of directors and tenure. We find that directors are more highly valued by investors over a tenure period between 7 and 18 years, moderated by director involvement on key committees. Further, in examining the S & P 1,500, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the percentage of outside directors in this prime tenure period strengthens the CEO pay-performance linkage by 2.5%, suggesting that directors in this tenure period are more effective in aligning CEO and shareholder interests. Our results demonstrate that individual director tenure makes a difference in governance effectiveness, and shareholders accurately assess this difference. Additionally, our findings provide important boundary conditions for when theories of executive cognition and social capital may be more/less applicable regarding director tenure. (c) 2017 INFORMS.

Taking a combination between agency theory and resource dependence theory, we point out that directors' capital may have an effect on R&D strategies. A sample of both high-tech and low-tech industries for the period 2007-2011 is used. The results indicate that, regardless of the type of industry and the specific expertise on R&D intensive companies, board members with multiple directorships influence R&D corporate strategies. The resources acquired by directors through their experience and connections positively influence R&D intensity, but only if directors can carry out their monitoring activity adequately. This evidence implies a step forward in the understanding of the role of board of directors in corporate strategy, thus having significant implications for academics, companies and regulators, which are both theoretical and practical.

Boards of directors must navigate between adopting standardized "best practices" for their CEOs' pay plans, on the one hand, and customizing their CEOs' pay to align their particular CEO's goals with those of shareholders, on the other. We build theory proposing that the incentive effects of different CEO compensation types vary consistently over CEO tenures and, therefore, that overstandardization of CEO pay plans actually can hurt shareholders. Our analysis of a sample of U.S. Standard & Poor's 500 firms from 1998 to 2005 shows declining benefits to shareholders from performance-based compensation (i.e., options and bonuses) as CEO tenure increases but an opposite effect for non-performance-based (i.e., salary) pay. These findings can be considered a preliminary warning that normative "best practices" should not become the exclusive approach to determining CEO pay packages; instead, boards should consider more holistic approaches that incorporate the fit between CEO characteristics and organizational goals.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between gender diversity in a firm's board of directors and financial performance of firms listed on Bursa Malaysia for the period between 2009 and 2013. Using unbalanced panel data analysis, we tested whether gender diversity in the boardroom may influence the firm's performance, as measured by Tobin's Q. We employed four different proxies for gender diversity (the dummy variable for women, the percentage of women on the board, the Blau index, and the Shannon index) to provide a more comprehensive measure of gender diversity. This study suggests that a higher degree of female representation on the board increases a firm's financial performance. Positive discrimination favouring female boardroom appointment is therefore likely to persist as a feature of the corporate governance landscape in Malaysia.

More and more boards are tapping interim CEOs to temporarily fill the corner office. Prior research indicates the negative performance implications of this decision; yet, little is known about the rationale behind this decision. Our aim is to fill this research gap. Drawing on agency and human capabilities frameworks, we examined the contextual elements that influence a board's decision to pursue temporary leadership. Within a sample of 375 successions occurring between 1998 and 2005, we found that boards of directors were more likely to select interim CEOs under certain succession conditions, namely, when the prior CEO was forced out and there was no heir apparent or when the prior CEO had served for a short tenure. Our results highlight the importance of context in succession selections and provide insights into why a board would pursue a decision with seemingly negative repercussions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

In this paper we address how director expertise impacts a director's social status and conformity within the board. Our results, derived from two unique multi-source datasets of peer ratings on director status and conformity of non-executive directors from Dutch organizations, indicate that industry-specific expertise and financial expertise differently impact directors' social status and influence within the board. We find that directors' individual performance orientation - the motivation to demonstrate expertise - acts as an important contingency for expertise to increase directors' status within the board. Additional analyses using archival data and interviews with non-executive directors substantiate our findings and provide additional insight into the dynamics operating within boards. This study extends existing research on boards of directors and provides unique micro-level insights into the boardroom dynamics that connect director expertise to director status and conformity within boards.

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

The board of directors is legally responsible for setting the strategic direction of the firm and for ensuring the firm's long-term performance in almost all governance environments. However, many boards delegate part or all of the task of creating and executing the firm's strategy to a group of full-time professional managers. This separation between ownership and control creates many challenges for the modern-day firm, and the board's role in the strategy formation process is arguably the seminal governance challenge confronting boards today. This study examines this seminal challenge by: (1) Introducing background information on this stream by defining key terms and discussing its importance to the wider corporate governance literature, describing three infamous case studies of firms based in the USA, Europe and Asia where the board was insufficiently involved, and noting situations where the board may become too involved; (2) Exploring previous reviews of this research stream on board strategic involvement, and discussing the evolution of this construct and related studies over time; (3) Analyzing previous research designs used in this research stream while identifying the frequency as well as costs and benefits associated with each; (4) Summarizing what we currently know about the multi-level antecedents of board involvement within single countries; (5) Specifying some of the national-level antecedents of board involvement identified in cross-national studies; (6) Identifying the subsequent multi-level effects of board involvement; and (7) Discussing the implications of this review and outlining future research directions.

The role of the nomination committee (NC) in the selection of members of various ethnic groups for board membership has increased significantly as a result of the global financial crisis of 2008. A company board that comprises directors who come from all the three major ethnic groups (Malay, Chinese and Indian Malaysians) increases the efficiency of the board in its monitoring and advising roles. According to the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG 2012), the NC shall be responsible for the appointment and recognition of candidates of diverse backgrounds into the board and committee. With that in mind, this paper examines the presence of Malay, Chinese and Indian directors in a nomination committee and its impact on the ethnic diversity of its board. This paper also examines the influence of the executive directors who are members in the nomination committee on the nomination process. For this purpose, 393 (50%) Malaysian listed companies were selected from the three year period of 2011 to 2013. Only non-financial companies were included because other companies such as finance have a different set of regulations in Malaysia. In this study, descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple regression were used for the purpose of revealing important significance of the variables used. In order to control possible endogeneity issues, the GMM estimator was also administered. The regression results of the ethnic diversity model are statistically significant, showing that, a higher proportion of Malay and Chinese directors in a nomination committee has negative relationships while a higher proportion of Indian directors in a nomination committee increases their representation on the board. However, the proportion of executive directors in the nomination committee was found to have a significant impact on the director nomination process of Malay, Chinese and Indian directors. In order to test the robustness of the model, several sets of measures were used. In conclusion, it is deduced that the results of this study support the social identity theory and power struggle, it shows the importance of diversity within the nominating committee of Malaysian companies. The result also reveals that unbiased and effective board mix enhances the strategic decision-making process of the board.

The language that signals conformity to a prevailing norm can contribute to the appearance of managerial competency and organizational legitimacy. We argue that top corporate managers' use of language that is congruent with a prevailing norm leads the boards of directors to evaluate the managers more favourably and to grant a higher level of compensation. We test this argument by analysing the letters to shareholders from 334 US firms and examine the CEOs' expression of the shareholder value principle, which is a prevailing model of corporate governance in the USA. We found that the use of shareholder-value language is significantly related to a higher level of CEO compensation and that the effect of shareholder-value language is greater when shareholder activism is stronger.

This study examines the impact of board characteristics on the amount of capital raised through an IPO for a sample of 220 Malaysian IPOs over the period of 2005-2015, applying both ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression (QR) techniques. The OLS results show that board with ethnic Malay directors has a significant and positive association with the amount of capital raised, while a weak significance is found for board size. However, the QR results reveal that other than board ethnicity, other board characteristics namely board size, board independence and CEO duality are significantly associated with the amount of capital raised. The additional results suggest that QR provides a more insightful and full picture into the association than does OLS. The overall empirical evidence lends support to the resource dependence role of the board of directors at the time of an IPO. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we introduce a justice perspective to examining the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards over the allocation of firm residuals that ultimately determines CEO compensation. Framing CEO pay as the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards focuses attention on the power of CEOs to increase their share of firm residuals in the form of increased compensation, and the diligence of boards of directors to constrain CEO opportunism. Framing this negotiation through a theory of justice offers an alternative perspective to the search for pay-performance sensitivity. We predict and find that as board diligence in controlling opportunism declines and CEO power increases, CEOs are increasingly able to capture a larger portion of firm residuals relative to shareholders. This finding supports critics who charge that CEO pay violates norms of distributive and procedural justice. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Purpose: Corporate accountability is a complex chain of reporting that reaches from external stakeholders into the organization's management structure. The transition from external to internal accountability mechanisms primarily occurs at the board of directors. Yet outside of incentive mechanisms, we know surprisingly little about how internal actors (management) are held to account by the representatives of external shareholders (the board). The purpose of this paper is to explore the process of accountability at this transition point by documenting the routines used by boards to hold the firm's management to account. In doing so, we develop the understanding of the important transition between internal and external firm accountability. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive, case-based approach identifies recurrent behaviour patterns in two matched boards over three video-taped meetings. Sequential analysis of coded group and individual behaviours provides insight into boards' accountability routines. Findings: The boards engaged in clear, recurrent accountability routines. Individuals on the boards play different roles in these routines depending on the issue before the board, allowing both directors and managers to hold each other to account. The outsiders (directors) both challenge and support the insiders (managers) during board discussions, switching their behaviours with different agenda items but maintaining a consistent group level of support and scepticism across the meeting. This allows for the simultaneous development of trust and verification at the group level, a necessary condition for effective accountability. Research limitations/implications: As board relationships and organisational context are highly variable, future research should concentrate on testing the generalizability of the results across different board and shareholder structures. Practical implications: The results call into question the current governance focus on the independence of the individual director, as the authors identify that all directors appear to act as agents at one time or another in a meeting. Accountability at the boardroom level requires an effective group process not usually addressed in governance recommendations or regulation. Originality/value: This study provides unique insights into board dynamics, documenting the accountability implications of group behaviours. By focussing on the group process, the authors highlight the potential mismatch of monotonic, individual-level approaches to governance and accountability prevalent in current agency approaches.

While the value of external audits was long considered to be minimal for private family firms, some exceptional studies indicate that external audits are demanded by these firms to reduce the agency conflicts between family and non-family members. Using a sample of Belgian private family firms, this study empirically shows that (high quality) auditors are also hired to mitigate agency conflicts among family members. Since these intrafamily agency conflicts are mainly based on emotions instead of economically rational behavior and are therefore difficult to grasp by compositional proxies, they are identified by the level of family cohesion. Moreover, this study shows that the monitoring effectiveness of the board of directors weakens the association between the level of intrafamily agency conflicts and audit (quality) demand, indicating that the audit demand effect of intrafamily agency conflicts decreases when family firms are able to reduce the related agency costs internally.

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the board composition on financial performance in the restaurant industry from a stewardship theory perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The composition of board was measured as the ratio of inside and outside directors. Firm performance was operationalized as return on assets (operational performance) and Tobin's q (market-based performance). Panel regression analysis tested the research hypotheses. Findings: Using data from 25 restaurant firms from 2007 to 2013, the study found an insignificant impact of board composition on operational performance. However, a higher proportion of inside board members increases market-based performance. A higher proportion of outside board members decreases market-based performance. Practical implications: Supporting the basic tenets of stewardship theory, restaurant companies may consider changing the current practice of having a super-majority of outside directors and increase the inside board members. Because inside board member have greater experience with the organization and the industry, they have a better understanding of the status quo and are better able to respond to opportunities and threats in the environment. Originality/value: Considering the scarcity of research on how the board composition affects firm performance in the hospitality context, the present study is a forerunner in its exploration of the impact of inside and outside directors on restaurant firms' performance.

Purpose: Presently, one of the major governance issues faced by management and shareholders of organizations is the gender composition of the boards of directors and audit committees. This study aims to examine the impact of gender diversity in audit committees on the accuracy of management earnings forecasts disclosure in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample comprises 190 Malaysian companies issuing IPOs that transformed into public companies during the period 2002-2012. Earnings forecasts accuracy (quality) is proxied by absolute forecast error and the study model is developed based on the frameworks of the signalling theory, the agency theory and the resource-dependence theory. Findings: The study proposes that female directors introduce a set of specific features in the boardroom that serve to improve investor protection and efficient monitoring of management. However, findings reveal an insignificantly positive relationship between gender diversity in audit committees and absolute forecast error, which shows that more female directors in audit committees could translate into more errors and less accuracy in earnings forecasts. Practical implications: Considering the recent regulatory developments that encourage the number of women on the board of directors, the findings obtained have significant implications for policymakers. The study findings can also be invaluable to investors, investment analysts, market players and researchers. Originality/value: The composition of the board of directors and audit committees in terms of gender plays a significant role in the promotion of effective corporate governance practices. This study is one of the pioneering studies that examines the advantages of gender diversity in the board of directors. It is also the first study to extend IPO literature by investigating the role of gender diversity in audit committees in the enhancement of accurate management earnings forecasts included in the IPO prospectuses.

Manuscript Type:: Review. Research Question/Issue:: Research on how boards govern individual top management team (TMT) members, i.e., senior executives aside from the CEO, is still scarce and fragmented. In this study, we review extant research on board monitoring of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) - an increasingly influential actor at the top of the firm - synthesize it, and propose an integrative future research agenda on board governing of the CFO. Research Findings/Insights:: Our review of the accounting, finance, and management literatures reveals that extant research emphasizes the board's need to monitor the CFO as a major strategic actor in the firm. However, studies have frequently focused on selective aspects of board monitoring activities, neglecting how central board attributes influence effective governance of the CFO. We therefore develop a comprehensive model of board monitoring and advising of the CFO that addresses the role of board attributes in governance activities. Theoretical/Academic Implications:: Our future research program on board governance of the CFO contributes to developing a better understanding of how board composition, structure, characteristics, and processes influence different board monitoring and advising activities. Practitioner/Policy Implications:: We offer a framework for boards of directors responsible for governing CFOs, highlighting the factors they have to take into consideration when selecting, dismissing, and compensating the CFO and when ratifying her decisions and rendering advice on her proposals. We also provide CFOs with insights into the factors that influence their dismissal, compensation, and collaboration with the board. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Leadership, governance and performance in family businesses are broadly studied, but results are contradictory. There is a need for deeper understanding of these relationships since emotional and behavioral aspects are complex in these types businesses. Questions on the how and the why of board functioning and ownership, and their influences on performance are scarce, given lack of data or a focus on quantitative data. To find a balance between qualitative and quantitative methods, we explore fuzzy sets logic as a methodology to expand knowledge in family businesses and present an application to build a representation of entrepreneurial performance results based on board of directors' composition and CEO's ownership, using case studies. Results indicate that the methodology offers alternative explanations to governance, leadership and performance dimensions in these businesses. Using fuzzy sets logic, we find that entrepreneurial performance is higher when outsiders' membership in boards of directors and CEO ownership are both high as well.

The purpose of this study is examine how agency theory and stewardship theory lead to different firm-level outcomes on an array of different outcomes. Based on these differences, we argue for the development of an agent-steward measurement scale, which will help researchers classify chief executive officers (CEOs) along an agent-steward continuum. This, in turn, will spur research to predict and test CEO behaviors and firm-level outcomes. Agency theory suggests CEOs take advantage of their powerful positions to maximize their personal economic utility, whereas stewardship theory suggests CEOs are motivated through intrinsic awards and will balance their interests with those of other stakeholders. We use these theories to examine possible differences in CEO behaviors. This is important because different CEO behaviors might lead to differing impacts on important firm-level outcomes. This paper reviews the relevant agency and stewardship literatures, then offers propositions regarding CEO behaviors from agent and steward perspectives.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an account of banking scandals in relation to corporate governance (CG) failures in an emerging economy, arguing that Anglo-American ideas of CG are misplaced in traditional settings. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders. Observations of annual general meetings (AGMs) and the personal working experience of one of the researchers, along with documentation, provided triangulating data on CG practices. Findings: The authors have found that both of the banks studied had adopted CG practices contrary to the expectations of the Sri Lankan CG codes. Key features of CG practices that emerged from their investigations of these two scandals are ineffectual central bank regulations, familial boards of directors, ceremonial board meetings, biased auditing practices and manipulative AGMs, relying on traditional structures of accountability centred around families, kin and social networks. Research limitations/implications: The authors argue, drawing on Weber (1958, 1961, 1968, 1978), that the traditionalist culture mediates the process of rationality in bank governance codes and regulatory frameworks Therefore, practices fall far short of expectations. Originality/value: The paper builds on the extended critique of shareholder-centric CG models and their transferability to alien contexts. It contributes to the CG studies calling for more appreciation of the need to move beyond the conventional view of CG problems as simply down to conflicts of interests. The authors complement and advance the decoupling debate in CG studies drawing on the Weberian notion of traditionalism. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the presence, expertise, independence, size and meetings of the audit committee (AC) have an effect on corporate insolvency. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 insolvent and 269 solvent UK-listed non-financial firms from 1994 to 2011. Findings: The authors find that corporate insolvency is negatively related to thenieetings and independence of the AC but not to AC's presence and size. The authors also observe that financial expertise on the AC is not related to corporate insolvency. These associations are robust to different specifications, while after controlling for board composition, board size, the number of board meetings, CEO duality, financial and firm characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The study's approach has two main limitations: neglect of small and medium private unquoted firms and more regulated corporate governance environment. Practical implications - The findings lend support to the continual use of the agency theory as an explanation in understanding the role of the analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of the AC in reducing the likelihood of insolvency. Social implications: The findings support continued efforts to strengthen boards' ACs in the wake of high profile insolvencies. The findings will assist regulators and firm management to design appropriate ACs (e.g. independence) and processes (e.g. number of meetings). Originality/value: The authors provide empirical evidence on the impact of the AC on firm insolvency in the UK context, an important but neglected area in research.

Manuscript Type: Article/Review. Research Question/Issue: This study presents the results of a longitudinal content analysis of governance articles published in both CGIR and other leading management outlets. Our aim with this review is to identify problematic areas, as well as opportunities to improve the methodological rigor of governance studies. Research Findings/Insights: We examine key design aspects of corporate governance articles. We identify and compare trends (1) over time and (2) across publishing outlets. Specifically examined are the geographic scope of samples, design characteristics (i.e., single- versus multi-year data, the use of archival, survey, experimental, and qualitative designs, data sources, and reliance on concurrent versus longitudinal data), survey response rates and the use of tests for non-response bias, the statistical analysis techniques used, reporting of results (number and proportion of hypotheses supported, non-significant, and counter-significant, use of statistical power analysis, reporting of descriptive statistics and correlations, use and significance of control variables, and endogeneity controls), and the sophistication of the models tests (i.e., mediation and moderation). Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the results of the review, recommendations for academic researchers are offered in the following areas: (1) designing theoretical tests which both incorporate and go beyond main effects; (2) evaluating a research design's analytical parameters on an a priori basis to maximize reliability, validity, and the potential for publication; (3) incorporating assessment of sensitivity and robustness checks into the analysis; and (4) comprehensive reporting of results including post hoc power analysis, complete and expanded correlation matrix(es), reporting and assessing counter-results, and avoiding HARKing.

This study investigates dividend initiation as the product of the imbalance of power between shareholders and management in U.S. firms from 2003 to 2012. We find that dividend initiation is associated with a stronger governance structure (strong shareholders' rights and board independence), in accordance with the outcome model. We do not identify a single motivation for dividend initiation. Dividend-initiating firms tend to rely on various forms of governance balanced by the interests and ownership of CEOs and directors. Firms with institutional owners are more likely to initiate dividends concurrent with the turnover of the CEO. Dual CEOs initiate dividends when they own more shares, and boards of directors initiate dividends with a higher personal ownership stake when shareholders' rights are weak. We also find that when initiation is due to stronger governance, it is significantly related to the firm's investment opportunities, while for weak governance firms, that relationship is not observed. We interpret this as evidence that, under weaker governance, the decision to initiate dividends is motivated by agency conflicts rather than investment or capital structure considerations. (c) 2017

This study examined the relationship between board effectiveness and innovation in service providing associations from the perspectives of agency, resource dependency, and resource-based theories. Results based on 349 respondent surveys showed that the the relationship between board effectiveness and innovation varied by the type of innovation (service, administrative, product, process, and capacity for innovation). Based on the results, practice implications are discussed, with a special focus on educating boards on the potential impact they might have on innovation through an effective performance of their tasks.

The participation of directors on more than one board is called "board interlocking". This phenomenon contributes to the spread of management and governance practices, through directors sharing their knowledge and experiences on other boards. Thus, directors could "carry" the earnings management practices present in one company into another in which they sit on the board. It is assumed that the greater directors' direct or indirect connections on boards, the greater the sharing of information, especially information that can be reflected in company earnings quality. In light of the above, the aim of this study is to verify the influence of board interlocking on earnings management in companies listed on the Sao Paulo Stock, Commodities, and Futures Exchange (BM&FBovespa). The study is characterized as descriptive, quantitative, and documentary, and uses a sample of companies listed on the BM&FBOVESPA between 2011 and 2013. For earnings management, the model from Kang and Sivaramakrishnan (1995) was used, while for interlocking, degree centrality measures were used for direct board member connections, and intermediation centrality for indirect connections. The results indicate that earnings management is influenced by the interlocking of board members. It is concluded that the greater the degree centrality, the greater positive earnings management is, and that variations in positive and negative accruals are influenced by board member intermediation. The results reinforce the idea that earnings management behavior can be transferred between companies by the directors that make up their boards.

The aim of the study is to examine the effect of diversity in the board of directors on the performance of the listed Italian financial institutions. The sample is a data set of 177 firm-year observations covering 2011 to 2014. The performance of the firm is measured by Tobin's Q while board diversity is analysed considering the percentage of female and foreign directors on the board (or their conjoint presence as a proxy of overall demographic diversity) and task-diversity is measured by board interlocking directorship and busy directors. Findings suggest that female directors have no effect on firm performance. Foreign directors and interlocking directorship have, instead, a positive statistically significant relationship with performance while we find a negative statistically significant relationship between busy directors and performance. When we consider the overall demographic diversity on the board we observe that it is positively and significantly related to the performance of the financial firm.

This study examines how behavioral processes among nominating committees, CEOs, and board chairs affect the comprehensiveness of non-executive director selection planning and evaluation. Building on a theory-building multiple-case study, our findings indicate that comprehensiveness is based on three key factors: (1) task-related mutual and collective interactions in nominating committees, (2) board chair leadership in structuring selection processes with high facilitation skills, and (3) the level and timing of information exchange between CEOs and board chairs. Furthermore, we highlight the interconnectedness and temporal embeddedness of these behavioral processes. Our study contributes to a more holistic understanding of non-executive director selections and provides new insights into the complex and interwoven social dynamics among nominating committees, CEOs, and board chairs.

While directors' task boundaries are usually ambiguous, some of their activities or behaviors clearly constitute their formal duties, whereas others are usually perceived as organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Applying identity theory, we present a theoretical model that demonstrates one of the key drivers for directors to engage in OCB with a focus on their role identity. We argue that an individual director's role identity is one of the key factors that motivate directors to engage in OCB. Furthermore, we propose that two board-level contingencies, board capital, and informal board hierarchy order, can moderate the effect of directors' role-identity salience on their OCB. That is, low levels of board capital and directors' higher positions in a board's informal hierarchy enhance directors' motivation to engage in OCB.

In this study, a cross-theoretical hybridization between diversity archetypes and the behavioural theory of corporate governance is proposed. Within an integrative theoretical framework, I discuss three variants of the board's social setting: diversity as variety; separation; and disparity. Their influence on the mechanisms of the socially-situated and socially-constituted agency, and in consequence the socially-constructed boardroom reality, is considered. The model stipulates what kind of impact individual agency perception, associated with each diversity archetype, can be expected to have on board task effectiveness (monitoring/control, resource-provision, and strategy-making/consulting). There are altogether six theoretical propositions made in this paper. The study represents an application of the behavioural theory of corporate governance in the theory-building paper. I utilise the notion of diversity and the theory of subgroups from existing group effectiveness literature. The proposed theoretical framework strongly benefits from recent taxonomically-systematizing efforts in the area of diversity research. The proposed model also allows for due consideration of behavioural patterns in the boardroom. This framework scores high on its generalisability to a wider population and realism of context, but low on its precision of measurement. A discussion of the model's limitations unfolds in the wider context of the challenges and paradoxes/conundrums with which the community of corporate governance scholars is invariably confronted. The model suffers from a limited translatability of findings into actionable managerial implications and recommendations of the regulator, as expressed in corporate governance codes.

Despite boards of directors' prominent involvement in strategic alliance (SA) decisions in practice and reports from news media, there is relatively little academic research exploring the board's value for a firm's technical SA investments involving a technical transfer or R&D, which are characterized by a high level of uncertainty, information asymmetry, and extreme complexity. Anchored in the resource dependence theory, this study aims to address this important issue by examining how board of directors contribute their human capital, in the form of relevant strategic experience, may mitigate the core challenges managers face when pursuing technical SAs and thereby influencing their outcomes. Our empirical results show that when outside directors hold more extensive alliance experience, they can better execute their consulting function and improve the firm's technical alliance performance. In addition, directors with experience specifically related to technical alliances also have a positive effect on performance. Last, we find that the impact of alliance experience on technical alliance performance is positively moderated by the size of directors' prior affiliated companies and their share ownership in the focal firm.

This study explores the structural relationship of director networks among boards of directors in publicly listed companies in Malaysia using social network analysis (SNA) techniques at both the director and company levels. This paper examines whether company corporate governance practices and institutional characteristics are associated with company network size and pattern. SNA performed using UCINET and NetDraw software shows that the directors and company in the networking are moderately connected. This suggests that there is a small group of directors or companies that are well-connected and well-positioned to exercise power, control, and influence over the network. This study also reveals the interconnectedness of board members and companies. The regression results also identify a group of the most well-connected and well-positioned directors and companies in Malaysia's corporate governance environment. The results suggest that board size, board meeting, and duality are the corporate governance practices, which most influence company network size and pattern. The presence of a Bumiputera or politically-connected director is an institutional characteristic, which especially determines the network of a company.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how information-processing mechanisms between nominating committees (NCs), incumbent executives, board chairs, and shareholders affect the comprehensiveness of executive succession processes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ an explanatory multiple-case study that comprises eight CEO and CFO succession cases in large German publicly traded firms. Findings: The findings reveal that comprehensiveness is determined by four key information-processing mechanisms: the effectiveness of NC's information sharing, absorbing disagreement, and integrating heterogeneous opinions; board chair leadership (i.e. an apprentice board leadership structure in association with the board chair's openness to ideas); the breadth and depth of information sharing between executives and NCs; and the extent and timing to which major shareholders influence succession processes. Research limitations/implications: The authors summarize the findings in a conceptual framework and develop a set of propositions to guide future research on the topic. Such studies may want to test the suggestions in a quantitative way, preferably in a multinational context. Originality/value: The authors' emerging conceptual framework contributes a set of information-processing variables by which NCs engage in comprehensive executive successions with incumbent executives, board chairs, and major shareholders and offers a multiechelon approach to study executive successions.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the impact that women who sit on boards of directors, as well as women that are part of an interlocking directorate, have on corporate performance. The investigation is placed within the literature on human capital theory and resource dependency as an argument for gender diversity and boards of directors. Design/methodology/approach: A director data set for over 32,000 firms based in the USA, composed of 6,218 women and 54,932 men, is utilized. From this, regression and network analysis were utilized. Findings: It is found that female directors' participation in interlocking directorates translates into greater corporate performance when compared to simply examining female representation on boards of directors. Additionally, women involved in interlocks translated into greater corporate performance when compared to men. These results support the resource dependency approach. Practical/implications: Results of this study suggest that when considering female directors, corporate performance is enhanced when female directors already sit on the boards of other firms. Originality/value: This study highlights external network connections to differentiate between human capital theory and resource dependency as an argument for gender diversity and boards of directors.

Purpose: This paper aims to show the importance of introducing an integration manager (i.e. an executive position used to channel the acquiring firm's course of action and strengthen the success of a post-acquisition integration process) within the acquiring firm's board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This is a theoretical paper that introduces the integration manager within the board of privately held firms going internationally via acquisitions and serving as an "out-insider" director able to balance the conflicting demands of the previously separated entities during their integration process. The authors present an explanatory case study that empirically contributes to the board of directors' design for internationalization. Findings: The authors posit that the integration manager serves as an "out-insider" director of the board for privately held firms, possessed by large-block shareholders, going internationally via acquisitions, providing the necessary expertise and knowledge of the target firm's products and industry. Originality/value: The provided study aims to show that international acquisitions, even though apparently less risky than greenfield investments, may require additional neutral information flow - both within the due-diligence process and the post-acquisition integration - that only outsiders possess. Such an outsider has been individuated in the integration manager whose crucial role focuses on smoothing the pre- and post-acquisition integration processes.

In this paper we develop a model for researching the influence that a board of directors can have on improving an organization's sustainability performance. Our model explores sources of cognitive flexibility of boards needed to recognize and respond to the need for improved sustainability performance. We first define concepts of sustainability, sustainability competence, and sustainability performance. We then analyze two forms of board capital (a board's human capital and its social capital) and three aspects of a board's information processing (its patterns of information search, discussion and debate, and information absorption) that we suggest affect a board's cognitive flexibility and thereby influence whether a board decides to adopt sustainability performance goals. Our model also suggests that an organization's strategic flexibility - as represented by its current endowments of resource flexibilities and coordination flexibilities - will moderate the relationship between a board's decision to adopt sustainability performance goals and an organization's subsequent achievement of those goals. We also suggest that our model is generally relevant to any research seeking to predict the influence of boards on strategic change in many forms, not just to research focused on sustainability issues.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between board dependence, antitakeover provisions and their influence on corporate entrepreneurship (CE). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses agency theory as a framework to expand on the board dependence-CE relationship by injecting the moderating role of antitakeover provisions to the model. Using data collected from 350 publicly traded firms, a panel regression analyses was conducted on both innovation and venturing components of CE. Findings: The findings of this study show a negative relationship between board dependence and CE. Further this study shows that such a negative relationship becomes weaker when higher levels of antitakeover provisions are injected into the model. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of large publicly traded firms within the information and manufacturing sectors, and so our findings may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other variables representing CE (e.g. new product introductions) may add to this line of research in the future. Practical implications: Understanding the role of board of directors within a firm may help foster CE throughout the organization. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by incorporating the influence of environmental factors (e.g. antitakeover provisions) and examining the relationship between corporate governance and CE using both measures of innovation and venturing.

Exploring director connectedness around S&P 500 Index revisions, this paper studies whether board connections contribute value to the firm. Even compared to firms of similar size, S&P 500 Index boards are more central in the network of directors. After inclusion to the Index, boards become more central in the director network, and newly added firms are more likely to get new directors from other S&P 500 Index boards. Those newly added firms with lower connectedness pre-inclusion accrue larger abnormal announcement returns stemming from the benefit of increasing director centrality after inclusion. In contrast, firms with more centralized boards suffer larger losses upon removal from the Index. Using the local supply of directors as an instrument, we demonstrate that well-connected directors as well as the percent of S&P 500 Index directors contribute to firm value. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The main aim of the present study is to determine the role of environmentally expert and experience leader on positive deviance behaviour in corporate environmental reporting practices. Based on the environmental reporting index develop based on the concept of positive environmental deviance, the study measured positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices of 209 Malaysian public listed companies based on 5 years panel data. It was found that environmental expert and experience board of directors have a positive significant relationship with positive deviance in environmental reporting practices. Nevertheless it have been found that there were no significant relationship between environmentally expert and experience CEO and its interaction effect with environmentally expert and experience board of directors on positive deviance behaviour in environmentally reporting practices. This study conceptualized positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices as the strategic behaviour of the corporations to improve the impact of environmental sustainability practices beyond the required regulations by disclosing set of information regarding to their proactive management practices and performance which: (1) exceed minimal norms; (2) deviate from others within the field; (3) go beyond what is required by regulation; and (4) associated broader scale changes.

Drawing on stewardship and resource dependence theories, we examine how the board of directors (BoD) influences the link between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and ambidextrous innovation in small and medium sized family firms (family SMEs). Our analysis of 230 Spanish family SMEs shows that family involvement in the BoD has a negative effect on their ability to turn EO into innovation. Moreover, we show that the BoD's strategic involvement in service and control tasks and the provision of knowledge and skills have positive effects, whereas the intensity of BoD activity has a surprisingly negative effect. These findings underscore that the effects of the BoD on the entrepreneurship-innovation link are more complex than previously thought, pointing to the important role of both BoD composition and BoD functioning for enabling innovation in family SMEs.

This study develops a combined agency-resource dependence perspective and applies it to the study of interlocking directorates. It suggests that interlocking directorates may exert either a positive or a negative effect on subsequent firm performance, depending on the firm's relative resources, power imbalance, ownership concentration, and CEO ownership. A test on a sample of 145 Italian companies provides support for hypothesized effects. This study suggests that integrating agency and resource dependence theories provides a higher-order explanation of firm performance and helps advance both agency and resource dependence theories.

Do women board directors change how companies do business? Firms face growing pressure to appoint more women to their boards of directors, yet little is known about the factors that enable female directors to impact their organizations. This study analyzes the representational thresholds that facilitate women's leadership in the area of corporate social responsibility. We test the predictions of token theory and critical mass theory to evaluate the ability of women to impact firm outcomes based on their numerical representation on the board of directors. Our analysis focuses on board composition and organizational outcomes in the Fortune 500 from 2001 to 2010. Our findings challenge the theoretical assumptions that solo and token women are unable to exert significant influence over their organizations, and underscore the importance of board diversity for today's firms.

This study examines the effects of board diversity on bank profitability and risk. Using a sample of 97 Chinese banks over a period from 2009 to 2013, we find that board age diversity is negatively associated with bank profitability. To further investigate why age-diverse boards influence bank performance, we decompose board age diversity into diversity of directors' personal values, utilizing the World Values Survey. Our findings suggest that the heterogeneity among directors' views on risk, prudence, and wealth is more likely to spark intragroup conflicts in the decision-making process. This prevents the board from functioning effectively and ultimately weakens bank profitability. Our results are robust with respect to alternative measures of diversity and bank performance.

Reflecting investor expectations, most prior corporate governance research attempt to find the effect duality Role of Chief Executive Officer, board structures and firm financial performance. Specifically, we refer to devote this paper on investigating the relationship between the Duality Role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the CEO tenure, board structures and gender diversity with tow measurement of performance in listed companies in CAC 40. We found evidence provide that board characteristics are positively correlated to the firm' performance. However, our results show a significant association between ROE, ROA and the board of directors' composition. We find significant negative association between financial information and equity-based management compensation. On the other hand, the presence of independent directors on the board seems to affect, positively, the level of financial performance CAC 40 firms. Likewise, the stewardship theory assumption, the CEO duality is very high and is significantly associated with a higher level of firm performance. Our results suggest a constant negative relation between firm performance and CEO's tenure. The results show that there is a significant relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance from our samples CAC 40 companies. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study focuses on CEO hubris and its detrimental effect on corporate financial performance along with an examination of critical corporate governance contingencies (CEO power and board vigilance) that may moderate the negative effect. From 654 observations of 164 Korean firms over the years 2001-2008, we found that CEO power exacerbated the negative effect of CEO hubris on corporate financial performance, whereas board vigilance mitigated it. This study provides empirical evidence that entrenchment problems arising from CEO hubris would be exacerbated as CEOs become more powerful, but weakened as board of directors become more vigilant. Theoretical contributions and practical implications will be discussed. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Scholars have expressed concern that marketing's influence at the strategic levels of the firm is waning. Consistent with this view, only 2.6% of firms' board members have marketing experience. The authors suggest that this is shortsighted and that including more marketing-experienced board members (MEBMs) will increase firm growth by (1) helping firms prioritize growth as a strategic objective and (2) contributing their expertise to improve the effectiveness of revenue growth strategies. Drawing on the behavioral model of corporate governance, the authors develop a theoretical framework explicating the situational, dispositional, and structural influence moderators that alter the impact ofMEBMs on firm growth. Using 64,086 director biographies from S&P 1500 firms, the authors find thatMEBMs positively affect firm-level revenue growth and that this relationship is strengthened or weakened by important contingencies that occur in the firm. The findings suggest that the common practice of not including experienced marketers on boards of directors puts firms at a competitive disadvantage. (c) 2018 American Marketing Association.

Firms' boards of directors affect many strategic outcomes. Yet the impact of boards on new products, a key organizational adaptation mechanism, has been overlooked. Addressing this gap, the authors consider the effect of the firm's board interlock centrality, the extent to which board members are connected to boards of other firms, on its new product introductions. They propose that board interlock centrality provides firms access to market intelligence, creating opportunities to introduce incremental new products. Applying the motivation-opportunity-ability theory, the authors propose that two aspects of board leadership moderate this relationship: internal (vs. external) leadership and marketing leadership. They test the hypotheses using a panel of publicly listed U.S. consumer packaged goods firms, in which most new products are incremental innovations. As hypothesized, board interlock centrality increases new product introductions. This effect is stronger when firms have high internal leadership, internal marketing leadership, and a marketing CEO; it is weaker with high intra-industry external leadership. The findings highlight the unexpected role of board interlocks on innovation outcomes and advance the literature on marketing leadership, board interlocks, and social networks.

We examine how friendly boards affect firm innovation. Using CEO-director social connections as a measure of board friendliness, we find that firms with friendly boards create more patents and citations. The positive relation between friendly boards and innovation are more pronounced when firms' advisory needs are higher or when firms operate in innovative industries. Friendly boards are also associated with higher firm value, especially when firms have higher advisory needs or when innovation is an important source of firm value. Our results support the positive view on a friendly board perspective that directors serve as valuable advisors to CEOs. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Various regulatory governance initiatives have strived for board diversity, as diversity stimulates creativity, encourages discussion, and enlarges the board's knowledge base. However, increased diversity results in superior decision-making only when the board is free from conflicts and acts as a cohesive group. In this paper, we extend existing corporate governance research by introducing faultline theory to the board of directors (Lau and Murnighan 1998). The idea is to show how a board's diversity structure can give rise to the formation of subgroups along faultlines. The resulting subgroup formation may, in turn, reduce board effectiveness. Using a sample of U.S.- listed firms between 2008 and 2012, results suggest that boards with strong faultlines are associated with lower firm performance, lower CEO turnover-performance sensitivity, and higher abnormal CEO compensation. Understanding potential unintended consequences of board diversity could be of interest to regulators and companies that plan to appoint new directors to the board.

Drawing from corporate governance research and social identity theory, the authors argue that the relationship between outside directors' time in office and outside director task involvement is more complex than generally anticipated. By using a unique multisource data set composed of peer ratings provided by fellow outside directors rating a focal director's task involvement, this study analyzes director task involvement at the individual director level of analysis. The authors propose and empirically demonstrate that outside director tenure has an inverted U-shaped relationship with outside director task involvement that is moderated by a director's social identification with the organization. As such, the authors demonstrate that social identification with the organization provides a critical contingency for the curvilinear relationship between outside director tenure and outside director task involvement. Findings suggest that outside directors who socially identify with the organization are more likely to grow "stale in the saddle" at lower levels of tenure. These findings provide support for the merit of analyzing outside directors at the individual level of analysis and suggest that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be most appropriate in assessing the effects of tenure on outside director functioning.

Despite substantive organizational ramifications, surprisingly little theory explains executive succession planning processes. A firm's board of directors has the fiduciary responsibility to select CEOs, but, historically, boards have failed to exercise this authority. Increasing focus on corporate governance has prompted directors to become more engaged in organizational management, but boards face significant barriers to gathering and processing information. However, there is a dearth of research examining how boards overcome informational barriers to enhance decision-making effectiveness. Accordingly, the current study integrates procedural rationality in decision-making with research on boards as information-processing groups to explore how and why boards conduct succession planning processes. Procedural rationality results in formalized processes designed to collect essential information about CEO succession candidates; these processes, in turn, lead to a greater quantity and quality of CEO succession candidates. We also illustrate how CEOs can influence the effectiveness of board information gathering and processing. The tests of the theoretically generated hypotheses rely on in-depth qualitative interviews, coupled with unique survey and archival data from 355 firm-year observations of 218 large organizations, collected over three years.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze, in the Colombian developing context, the relationship between the presence of women in corporate positions and the financial performance of the company and to know if there are differences between family and non-family firms. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the contingency theory of leadership, which emphasizes that leader's personality and the situation in which that leader operates influences corporate decision-making, the authors use panel data models on a sample of 54 Colombian public businesses for the period 2008-2015 to test the proposed hypotheses on the relationship between women's presence in corporate governance positions and financial performance, as well as the difference between family and non-family firms. Findings: The results support that women's presence in corporate governance positions is positively associated with firm performance. More concretely, the authors find a relationship between women at the top corporate governance structure (as part of the board of directors, top management team and chief executive officer) and firm profitability. Results also indicate that family business, as a type of organization, (negatively) moderates the positive relationship between female participation in top executive positions (board and top executive team) and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: First, this study is limited to women in corporate positions in large companies listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange, and thus, generalizability for smaller entities may be limited. Second, data limitations do not allow us to investigate ways in which women's presence in corporate governance structures contributes to improve firm goals. Practical implications: The authors provide support to the hypothesis that positively relates women's presence in corporate governance positions and firm performance for the case of Colombia. This serves as a guidance to Colombian regulators, corporate decision-makers and policy-makers to promote the inclusion of women in top hierarchical structures through either mandatory laws or recommendation. Originality/value: Few studies have addressed the women's presence in corporate governance positions and contribution to firm performance in developing economies. This study contributes to better understand how women impact performance in contexts where women are underrepresented in corporate governance structure and where there are no laws that pressure firms to appoint women in corporate governance positions.

Research summary: We examine the consequences of the formalization of the board leadership structure at IPO for board-level turnover. We introduce the concept of director undervaluation. It indicates the degree to which a director's qualifications based on normatively accepted criteria for board leadership are not duly reflected in his/her appointments to the board chair and committee chair positions. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board ("board undervaluation"), the greater the turnover levels of undervalued directors. This effect is stronger when board interaction frequency is higher. We contribute to the behavioral perspective on corporate governance by introducing justice-based legitimacy as a key normative institution, and by providing a novel predictor of aggregate turnover of directors (as well as the firm's CEO). Managerial summary: Why do outside directors exit the board? We offer a novel answer to this question in the context of newly public firms. We suggest that when directors are passed over for the board chair and committee chair positions despite having higher qualifications than their peers, they have been "undervalued," and a negative board climate is likely to develop. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board, the higher the turnover levels of these undervalued directors. More frequent board meetings exacerbate these turnover levels. Further, these turnover effects are not restricted to undervalued directors--even the CEO is more likely to exit. This study demonstrates the critical importance of developing a legitimate and fair board leadership structure. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards operate notionally in a liminal, nonhierarchical space, neither inside the company nor outside, creating ambiguity between service and control functions and fostering tolerance of it. With repeated corporate governance crises, however, new prescriptions institutionalized in law, regulation, and codes of conduct have added significance to the control side, marked by monitoring and compliance tasks. Taking a cue from the strategy process and strategy-as-practice literature, this study revisits the work of directors on the service side: their engagement in strategizing. Formalization of board processes has led to greater structure and reduced the liminality of the board. Using interviews with 20 directors from a range of organization types, this study finds that directors experiment respond to increased institutionalization of board practice by seeking out new liminal spaces and informal practices, with implications for theory of boards, board activities, and public policy.

While academic researchers continue to debate the effect of board independence in increasing performance, its efficacy could also be reflected in whether firm performance is made more stable. Board governance activities are a constellation of actions aimed at managing agency costs and ensuring the viability of a company over time. The efficacy of such actions would, therefore, be reflected in a distal outcome, specifically, in lower firm performance variability. Boards that can control agency costs and limit both underinvestment and overinvestment would reduce a firm's deviation from its mean performance trajectory. Using a longitudinal sample of publicly traded companies in the United States, we find that board stability, board resource provision, and CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability. Board independence is not associated with performance variability. With increasing board independence, greater board stability and greater CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability, however, greater board resource provision is not associated with performance variability.

To do so, the study employs a multiple regression model on data from Jordanian banks for the period from 2009 to 2016. The findings show that, contrary to the findings of many studies from developed countries, there is no statistically significant relation between the percentages of women on boards and top and medium-level executive managements of Jordanian banks and these banks' financial performance. However, due to the apparent advantages of the inclusion of women in such positions, as seen by the findings of many international studies, this study recommends that most Jordanian banks increase their currently small percentages of women on boards and top executive management positions in order to potentially achieve such advantages.

The study investigates demographic diversity, cognitive diversity and internal diversity within Islam among top-level management of firms and their impacts on the financial performance of Malaysian-listed companies. In addition, Muslim and non-Muslim women and Islamic religious diversity on corporate boards are investigated. Even though numerous organisations desire to be socially diverse, the significance of diversity for organisational performance remains uncertain. Are profitable companies inclined to improve board diversity or do other characteristics of the company contribute to firm performance? Does the participation of Muslim and non-Muslim women on corporate boards affect firm performance? Does internal diversity within Islam affect firm performance? Data from 330 Malaysian-listed companies in eleven full fledged sectors were used for the period from 2009 to 2013. This study employed econometrics methodology from panel data analysis to fill the research gap in the current management literature. This study used the interaction approach to examine empirically diverse corporate boards and their impacts on firm performance. This discussion included: (1) a combination of gender diversity and ethnic diversity and (2) a combination of gender diversity and foreign participation. The findings suggest that demographic, cognitive and internal diversity within Islam are significant predictors of a firm's financial performance. Ethnic women on boards have a significant and negative impact on firm performance. Hence, companies having high profits are more accountable for encouraging diversity among top-level management.

Two key groups central to improving firm performance are the top management team (TMT) and the board of directors. Executives undertake strategic actions, whereas board members fulfill their resource provision and monitoring roles. Drawing on tournament theory and equity theory, we propose that high pay dispersion among outside directors and the TMT is positively associated with strategic risk, whereas high (low) TMT pay dispersion and low (high) outside director pay dispersion are positively associated with firm performance. Our predictor is the unexplained component of horizontal pay dispersion, or the residual of pay dispersion resulting from regressing pay on observable firm, industry, period, and individual characteristics. Our results highlight the importance of unexplained pay dispersion for TMTs, but not for boards of directors, in improving firm performance. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Research Summary: Regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny question of whether to mandate a governance practice or allow for organic adoption. While mandates afford rapid diffusion, we theorize that they also result in ceremonial adoptions. Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment, we compare adoption outcomes for a governance practice--lead director adoption--that was mandated by the NYSE but not the NASDAQ. We find that NYSE firms are more likely than NASDAQ firms to have installed a lead director as a symbolic management tactic, so their lead directors are less effectual. We also find that transient institutional investors are deceived by this symbolic management, but dedicated institutional investors are not. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and analysts often desire to see companies introduce strict governance measures, such as proxy access and independent boards. Consequently, regulatory bodies often wrestle with the thorny issue of whether and when to mandate such practices for all companies. What they might not realize is that mandates may not work as well as they seem. Although more companies adopt reform under a mandate, they do so merely as a symbolic gesture. We look at one governance reform--appointing a lead director--finding that companies who introduce this reform as a result of a mandate appoint someone that is relatively toothless. We also find, though, that savvy investors are not actually fooled by this tactic and will trade out of firms that attempt such symbolic management. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

There is a significant debate on the real contribution of board diversity in corporate strategies. The objective of this study is to analyse the influence of board diversity on the disclosure process within a firm by focusing on risk reporting. The disclosure of this kind of information has become crucial in recent years in capital markets. Results show that gender and ethnic diversity in the boards positively influence the disclosure of information on risks. These findings contribute towards the debate about why diversity matters. Our study has important implications for the director-selection process since our results highlight the importance of considering the diverse background of board members. Regulators can also benefit from this evidence in order to issue recommendations and/or rules on the composition of boards of directors, as mechanisms to improve the disclosure practices of companies.

We propose and test a theory of board discretion in the context of the board's selection of a female CEO. We propose that boards also have discretion, an area that has typically focused exclusively on managers, and examine the conditions under which boards, facing high levels of uncertainty, have the latitude to make nontraditional choices, particularly when a negative equity market reaction to such a selection is likely. In the context of the nontraditional choice of a female CEO successor, we observe that the strong financial health of the firm and boardroom and situation-specific experience grant the board the discretion to select a female CEO. We test our model using all Standard & Poors (S&P) 1500 firms that experienced a CEO succession between 2000 and 2013. Implications for practice and research are discussed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

What role does the board of directors play in fostering organisational innovation? This study contributes to this conversation by exploring the relationship between board characteristics and business model innovation adoption. Drawing from resource dependence theory and using the smart home business model as our context, we examined the relationship among board size, CEO duality and proportion of outside directors on the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our analysis of 96 firms indicates that both board size and CEO duality significantly increase the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our findings highlight the important resource provision role boards play in promoting organisational innovation. (c) 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

In small and medium-sized organizations, boards of directors often spend most of their time providing advice to the management. As the content of advice provided has seldom been the focus of previous studies, we differentiate between functional and firm-specific advisory tasks. We examine antecedents of the two types to explain why this differentiation is important. Applying group effectiveness arguments, we study the effects board members' different knowledge bases and diversity have on the two advisory tasks, considering the mediating effects of board processes. Our results suggest that it is important to distinguish between different types of board members' knowledge and different board advisory tasks. Our findings have direct implications for research and practice. First, there is a need to go beyond the surface level understanding of what boards are doing. Second, our results emphasize the importance of organizational knowledge, and hence question the call for independent board members for advice provision. (c) 2017 European Academy of Management

Strategic decision-making processes influence firm-level outcomes. Using the theory of upper echelons, this study investigates how diversity in directors' skills, knowledge, and industry experience influence board decision-making processes that may impact overall strategic decision-making processes. Such diversity has been commonly accepted to be a 'double-edged sword'--enhancing comprehensiveness but hindering the speed of decision-making. On the contrary, we used an existing large survey database to show that directors' diverse educational background, functional background, and industry experience (job-related diversity) have a positive effect on comprehensiveness as well as the speed of board decision-making. In addition, our results indicate that board processes (directors' use of their knowledge and skills) play an important role by transmitting the positive effects of diversity. The study is in a tradition of exploring how boards may influence firms' strategic decision-making processes. Our findings provide additional arguments for adding job-related diversity to boards of directors. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the demographic diversity at top-level management and its impact on the performance of Malaysian-listed companies. In addition, Muslim diversity on corporate boards is examined. Design/methodology/approach: Although many organisations aspire to be socially diverse, diversity's consequences for organisational performance remain unclear. This study specifies the whole distinct mechanism and measures it independently, bridging as the demographic diversity among the board of directors (BODs) and bonding as the firm's financial performance. To maintain the homogeneity factor, the empirical analysis has been confined to 12 fully fledged sectors and 529 Malaysian listed firms out of 798 firms selected on the basis of judgmental sampling during the period of 2013. The paper applies the correlation matrix and linear regression model to justify this phenomenon. Findings: The empirical findings suggest that gender diversity (Muslim and Non-Muslim women) is positively significant with firm performance with regards to management, shareholders and market perspectives. It means that both Muslim and non-Muslim women are contributing to firm performance. Ethnic diversity (minority) and Muslim diversity (majority) have no impact on firm performance. On the other hand, interaction variables are positively significant with firm performance. It means that majority and minorities are essential for corporate boards to produce a greater performance. Research limitations/implications: Future research could include more variables such as director's age profile and foreign participation as well as other types of diversities, such as cognitive diversity and corporate diversity. In addition, another possible extension could be the investigation of diversity issues between small scale and large or high and low-profit firms. The findings provide insightful information to firms, as this study suggests that the diverse corporate boards can enhance firm performance. Originality/value: In recent years, diversity issues have been examined with regard to firm performance of the listed companies. Whilst extensive literature exists on diversity issues, this issue is still under debate and has had inconsistent results. The paper attempts to fill the gap in the existing literature, discuss the empirically diverse corporate boards with the interaction approach and impact on the firm performance.

Using data from China's listed privately owned enterprises (POEs) during the period from 2002 to 2014, we explore the effects of firm life cycle on board structure. We find that the board size of China's listed POEs declines over firm life cycle, and there is a trend of separation for board chair-CEO duality while board independence remains almost static. We further provide evidence that board size and independence are determined by the benefits of monitoring and advisory roles of the boards through all the stages of firms' life cycle with different drivers. The impact of CEO power on board chair-CEO duality is determined by the benefits and costs of separation of board chair, and CEOs are supported at all stages of firms' life cycle. This article sheds light on the dynamic board structure in an emerging economy where the external corporate governance is weaker than that of developed countries. Our findings suggest that the board structures of China's listed POEs are adjusted at various stages of firms' life cycle, and the adjustments are mostly based on the resources brought by the new board of directors.

The present research has been undertaken to study the role of ownership type and board mechanisms in moderating the executive pay-corporate performance linkage in the Indian context. A sample of 209 companies listed on the S&P BSE 500 Index has been studied over the period 2008-2009 to 2012-2013. Rigorous statistical analysis of the panel data highlights that some of the governance mechanisms are, in practice, instrumental in improving the relationship between pay and performance. Whereas efforts must, indeed, be channelled towards the better functioning of certain other internal control mechanisms. Specifically, of noteworthy consequence is the difference in the way the shareholders and the board of directors ameliorate the pay-performance relationship with respect to accounting vis-a-vis market-based corporate performance. Further, the weak monitoring role discharged by the institutional investors warrant immediate policy concern. The study brings forth important implications for practitioners and policy makers in designing corporate performance-based pay keeping in view the predominant influence exerted by the institutional environment of the emerging economy of India.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of corporate governance practices on firms' financial performance, as measured by comprehensive income (CI). Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 237 firms from the Standards & Poor (S&P) 500 index during the years 2004-2009, multivariate statistical analyses are conducted to confirm the authors' main hypothesis. Findings: The results indicate that having high levels of corporate governance culture has a positive impact on a measure of firms' financial performance, namely, CI. Furthermore, they indicate a positive correlation between a higher percentage of external directors and financial performance, and a negative relationship between number of board meetings and financial performance. Originality/value: The main contribution of this research is that good corporate governance strategies deliver superior financial performance for businesses in terms of CI. This serves as a method of value creation, which is the ultimate goal of a business. In addition to the use of CI as an indicator of financial performance, a unique measure of corporate governance level is tested. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Previous studies have been unable to establish a clear relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. We argue that this could be due to the failure of these studies to account for both the endogeneity problem and the possible nonlinearity of the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. We overcome these problems by studying the investor reaction at the announcement of a female director's departure. We find a negative market reaction only when this departure drops the gender diversity below a critical level of three women. In all other cases, a director's departure has no significant impact on shareholder wealth. This result is consistent with the assumption of value in diversity and critical mass theory.

Using a legitimacy lens, we theorize that changes in the firm's board of directors parallel the evolving stakeholder audience that accords legitimacy to the firm--a key resource to the firm's survival. Powerful new stakeholders post- initial public offering (IPO) such as the listing exchange and the securities regulators are anticipated to impact board gender diversity through their regulatory pressure, while pre-IPO investors such as venture capitalists are reducing their equity positions and thus providing opportunities for director turnover. At the same time, the firm is increasing in size and visibility, building additional sociocultural legitimacy pressures for increased gender diversity. While prior research centers on the effect of different types and intensity of legitimacy pressures on board characteristics, we explore how changes in the question of firms' legitimacy "to whom" affects board composition, that is, we examine the comparative effect of regulation and society on board composition. We test our hypotheses by analyzing panel data for all North American technology firms doing IPOs on the NASDAQ exchange during a 12-year time frame between 1997 and 2011. Our analysis shows that regulation, although not explicitly directive, can play a key role in accelerating board gender diversity. Implications for future research on corporate governance and managerial and policy takeaways complete this article. (c) 2018, (c) The Author(s) 2018.

This paper explores the role of board characteristics of Indian banks on their market performance. We conducted panel data analysis on a sample of 29 Indian banks that form part of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) 500 index (covering a period of 8 years from 2009-2016). While ten board characteristics were considered as independent variables, Tobin's Q was considered as the dependent variable (Tobin?s Q was assumed to be a proxy for market performance of banks). Findings suggest that only three out of ten board characteristics (average number of boards served, CEO duality and number of meetings conducted) positively affect market performance of Indian banks. Our sample included 29 Indian banks covering a period of 8 years. Also, other corporate governance mechanisms, such as characteristics of audit committee, stakeholder relations committee, nomination and remuneration committee and risk management committee were not considered for the study. Hence caution must be taken in generalizing the results of the study. (c) 2018 AESS Publications. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether a private firm's demand for a Big4 auditor is influenced by the auditor choice of its main supplier, customer and competitor. The authors rely on institutional theory to explain this stakeholders' influence. The authors also examine whether the extent to which the firm's board of directors engages in networking moderates this influence. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire data are combined with archival data of 210 Belgian private firms with a statutory audit requirement. Logistic regression analysis is applied to examine to what extent firms follow their main competitor, customer and supplier in hiring a Big4 auditor. Findings: The results reveal a positive association between the firm's choice of a Big4 auditor and its main supplier being audited by a Big4 auditor, supporting the conformance effect (isomorphism) toward suppliers as hypothesized by institutional theory. The extent of board networking, however, seems to weaken this effect. Toward competitors, a divergence effect instead of a conformance effect is found, which indicates the existence of competitive differentiation regarding auditor choice. Research limitations/implications: While prior studies mainly focus on the agency relationships between shareholders, debtholders and managers to explain auditor choice, this study also takes into account the firm's other main stakeholders by relying on institutional theory. Both the conformance effect toward suppliers as well as the divergence effect toward competitors provide interesting additional perspectives on why auditors are demanded, leading to interesting future research opportunities. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to consider additional theories in explaining audit outcomes. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Directors of firms are theorized to fulfil control, service and resource dependence roles. However, the ways in which directors' of Chinese MNCs govern their foreign subsidiaries, and perform these roles remains unclear. Building on the institutional logics perspective, this study explores the roles enacted by the boards of directors eight Chinese-controlled companies in Australia to gain an appreciation of their governance practices. In depth semi-structured interviews with insider and independent directors, consultants and market analysts were undertaken. A content analysis of company annual reports and web sites complimented primary sources of data on board functions. Findings reveal that control is the most dominant role played by these boards, rather than service or resource dependence. It also appears that the dominant logics of Chinese institutions influence the corporate governance of Chinese MNCs as they internationalize. These findings extend our understanding of corporate governance practices in China and abroad. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The study examined the linear and curvilinear relationships between the number of women on boards and corporate social responsibility (CSR) among medium- to large-sized publicly listed for-profit companies in Australia. The relationship was predicted as positive linear based on the resource dependence theory (RDT) and inverted U-shaped based on the integration of RDT and group structure theory. The results show a positive linear relationship between women on boards and CSR, whereas the curvilinear relationship was not significant. Our findings suggest that the presence of women on boards increases the organizations' focus towards the CSR activities. Future research might consider the impact of women on boards on CSR in different cultural contexts or by segmenting population based on industry type.

The paper examines the leading causes of abrupt and massive changes in the top management in a successful entity in an emerging economy - Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited. The paper is based on an extensive case study method. The study uses both primary and secondary sources of data. Primary data include direct conversation with various stakeholders of the bank using unstructured questionnaire. The data were collected before and after the changes in the top management. The study found the leading causes of reshuffle in top management including chairman, vice-chairman and chief executive officer are: pressure from government, involvement of a political party with the bank management - Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami an opposition to the present government, lack of transparency of corporate social responsibility expenditures, and pressure of foreign investors. However, no negative impacts were seen within the first month of the changes on stock prices of the bank in the country's two stock markets. Copyright (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether the theoretical relationship between the board composition and the cost of capital (CC) is mediated by risk disclosure (RD) practices. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares techniques are used, and a sample of all the companies belonging to manufacturing industry listed on Standard and Poor's 500 for the year 2009 is studied. In relation to board composition, several recommendations issued by US governance codes are considered: board independence, board size, CEO duality, gender diversity, ethnic diversity, and financial expertise. Content analysis techniques are employed to measure RDs. Findings: The results show that boards that follow governance codes recommendations lead to a reduction in the CC through the disclosure of information on risks. Research limitations/implications: These results provide encouraging opportunities for future research about the real role of the board of directors and suggest the need for the analysis of the participation of directors in firm strategy to better understand the effect of boards on the corporate outcome. Practical implications: This evidence must help regulators and owners to set up adequate corporate governance mechanisms regarding the composition of boards. This evidence also presents direct implications for managers, who can better understand the value-relevance of RDs. Originality/value: This paper provides new insight into the literature, which highlights that the effect of boards of directors on firm outcomes must be mediated by the involvement of boards in specific strategies.

Employing a synthesis model, this chapter examines the relationship between board structure and board processes within family firms. By reviewing the family firm governance literature from the past 20 years, we apply the Ilgen et al. (Annu Rev Psychol 56:517-543, 2005) input-mediator-output-input framework to identify heterogeneous family processes which ultimately impact the forming, functioning, and finishing stages of boards of directors in family firms. In doing so, we help to answer questions of why family firm boards are effective rather than what predicts board effectiveness, as well as provide guidance for future research.

In the board of directors is common to observe the interaction between companies from inserting the same counselor in different councils, which is called the Board Interlocking (BI), disseminating information and experience among advisers who seek to use them for decision making. The aim of the study is to assess the influence of Board Interlocking in audit firm selection in mandatory rotation in companies listed on the BM&FBovespa. This is a study, documentary and quantitative. We used a sample of 235 companies that had the exchange of the audit firm in 2012. The processing and analysis of data using descriptive statistics and logistic regression. The results indicate the existence of BI in the enterprises. The result of the regression indicates an improvement in the model assertiveness, but without statistical significance. It was concluded that the BI is practiced by Brazilian companies and does not influence the choice of audit firm on mandatory rotation.

This study empirically examines the relationship between wide-ranging board diversity and the quality of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure variables in Malaysia. We extend prior literature covering broader dimensions of board diversity (e.g., gender, education level, education background, age, tenure, nationality and ethnicity) and their impact on CSR after controlling for board and audit committee characteristics. Using 200 listed firms in Bursa Malaysia during 2009-2013 and applying both OLS and 2SLS instrumental variables (IV) approaches, we document significant positive effect of board education level and board tenure diversity on the quality of CSR disclosure. Further analysis using robust regression also shows positive association between gender diversity and CSR disclosure. Our findings also demonstrate that the quality of CSR disclosure is significantly negatively associated with board age and nationality diversity. These results remain consistent with using alternative measures for board diversity, and characteristics for board of director and audit committees as well as split samples between large and small firms. Additional tests exhibit complementary relationship of education level and nationality with gender, while substitutive relationship of age and tenure with gender in influencing CSR. These findings provide useful insights into the policy makers in setting regulations in respect of board diversity in Malaysia and other emerging economies in the Asian region. Our evidence is also useful for listed companies in setting the criteria to identify directors who can support their strategic decisions. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Purpose: Using a data set of listed firms domiciled in Taiwan, this paper aims to empirically assess the effects of ownership structure and board of directors on firm value. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of Taiwanese listed firms from 1997 to 2015, this study uses a panel estimation to exploit both the cross-section and time-series nature of the data. Furthermore, two stage least squares (2SLS) regression model is used as robustness test to mitigate the endogeneity issue. Findings: The main results show that the higher the proportion of independent directors, the smaller the board size, together with a two-tier board system and no chief executive officer duality, the stronger the firm's performance. With respect to ownership structure, block-holders' ownership, institutional ownership, foreign ownership and family ownership are all positively related to firm value. Research limitations/implications: Although the Taiwanese corporate governance reform concerning the independent director system which is mandatory only for newly-listed companies is successful, the regulatory authority should require all listed companies to appoint independent directors to further enhance the Taiwanese corporate governance. Originality/value: First, unlike most of the previous literature on Western developed countries, this study examines the effects of corporate governance mechanisms on firm performance in a newly industrialised country, Taiwan. Second, while a number of studies used a single indicator of firm performance, this study examines both accounting-based and market-based firm performance. Third, this study addresses the endogeneity issue between corporate governance factors and firm performance by using 2SLS estimation, and details the econometric tests for justifying the appropriateness of using 2SLS estimation.

Purpose: This study aims to reconcile some of the conflicting results in prior studies of the board structure-firm performance relationship and to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of agency theory in the specific context of Italian corporate governance practice. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a dynamic generalised method of moments on a sample of Italian listed companies over the period 2003-2015. Proxies for corporate governance mechanisms are the board size, the level of board independence, ownership structure, shareholder agreements and CEO-chairman leadership. Findings: While directors elected by minority shareholders are not able to impact performance, independent directors do have a non-linear effect on performance. Board size has a positive effect on firm performance for lower levels of board size. Ownership structure per se and shareholder agreements do not affect firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by reconciling some of the conflicting results inherent in the board structure-performance relationship. Firm performance is not necessarily improved by having a high number of independent directors on the board. Ownership structure and composition do not affect firm performance; therefore, greater monitoring provided by concentrated ownership does not necessarily lead to stronger firm performance. Practical implications: This paper suggests that Italian corporate governance law should improve the rules and effectiveness of minority directors by analysing whether they are able to impede the main shareholders to expropriate private benefits on the expenses of the minority. The legislator should not impose any restrictive regulations with regard to CEO duality, as the influence of CEO duality on performance may vary with respect to the unique characteristics of each company. Originality/value: The results enrich the understanding of the applicability of agency theory in listed companies, especially in Italy. Additionally, this paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of research evidence of agency theory studies. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Although increased board independence is a commonly offered solution to curbing corporate misconduct, scholars have expressed skepticism about its effectiveness, and empirical evidence is mixed. We argue that the relationship between board independence and corporate misconduct is likely nuanced--and may vary by the type of independence (e.g., independence on the whole board or on the audit committee) and by national context. We conducted a meta-analysis of 135 studies spanning more than 20 countries. We find that the board independence-corporate misconduct relationship (a) is generally negative, (b) varies based on the implementation form that independence takes on (i.e., independence of the whole board, on the audit committee, or between the roles of CEO and board chair), and (c) is more strongly negative in countries with less corruption. We advance corporate governance theory and research by demonstrating that the popular governance practice of increasing board independence must both account for the manner in which independence is implemented and consider the powerful influence of firms' broader societal context to clearly understand its effect. Further, based on our review of the literature, we uncover opportunities for the advancement of corporate governance and corporate misconduct research. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Going beyond the mere participation of female directors within boardrooms, we investigate which of the two major boards of directors' roles (advisory versus monitoring) is best played by female directors in order to make a difference to shareholders. More specifically, we investigate the impact that advisory and monitoring female directors have on managerial opportunism with a specific focus on earnings management. Using sample of US firms, we find evidence suggesting that female directors holding monitoring roles mitigate managerial opportunism, as measured by discretionary accruals. In contrast to the current argument that advisory directors in general are better able to sustain and improve earnings quality, we find no evidence that suggests that advisory female directors are significantly associated with lower managerial opportunism. Overall, the results remain robust after controlling for potential endogeneity problems, corporate governance, and external auditor quality. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We examine the resource provision role of the board of directors in ensuring substantive corporate sustainability practices. Specifically, we examine two channels of resource provision (i.e., the presence of non-executive directors with previous experience in environmental issues--EEDs--and network connections of EEDs) that can affect a firm's ethical and environmental behavior. Using greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data from FTSE 350 firms, as a measure of environmental performance, we show that the presence of EEDs on the board is associated with lower GHG emissions. Further, firms with better-networked EEDs have better environmental performance. A possible mechanism is that firms with EEDs invest more in environmental technology. These results suggest that, in addition to the traditional role of shareholder value maximization, the board of directors also caters to the interests of wider stakeholders of the firm by facilitating substantive ethical practices.

Research Summary: This study explores how external pressure for board gender diversity influences the increase of female directors. We propose that while external pressure has a positive effect on the increase of female directors on boards, it heightens the salience of gender in new director selection, making incumbent male directors more likely to treat the new female directors as outgroup members and consequently more likely to add them through addition of board seats rather than substitution of male directors. We further predict that new female directors added through additional board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through substitution of male directors. Results from a large sample of S&P 1,500 firms during 2004 to 2015 provide support our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Our study intends to enhance the understanding of how external pressure influences a firm's decision to increase the number of female directors on the board. We find that, although external pressure makes firms more likely to increase female directors, firms tend to do it through the addition of board seats rather than through the replacement of incumbent male directors to the extent that the increase is a response to the external pressure. Moreover, we find that new female directors added through addition of board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through replacement of male directors. These findings suggest that external pressure has a positive but limited effect on countering the gender bias on corporate boards toward female directors. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines the demand- and supply-side factors associated with audit partner selection and assignment in the United States. First, we examine whether audit partner gender and experience are associated with board and management gender and experience. Second, we investigate whether engagement audit quality varies with audit partner gender and experience, controlling for selection effects. The results indicate that companies with more gender-diverse boards of directors and top management teams are more likely to have a female lead audit partner. In addition, the experience of the client's board is positively associated with the experience of the lead audit partner. In terms of audit quality, we find that higher audit fees are positively associated with female and more experienced audit partners.

Coalitions are important in organizational decision making, but the question of how coalitions are built and make decisions in response to firm performance is still not sufficiently explored. In this study, we develop and test theory on how potential coalitions are built through shared experience and recruitment of allies. When organizations respond to performance relative to aspiration levels, either as problemistic search following low performance or opportunity exploration following high performance, members form coalitions to influence decisions. We develop theory of coalition formation that builds on upper echelons theory and the theory of dominant coalitions to predict how past experience of decision makers leads to preferred actions by each member and subsequent coalition formation. We use this theory to make new measures of potential coalitions and apply it to acquisitions made by firms in China. We find evidence that the experience of members of the key decision-making group--the board of directors--affects the potential coalition building, and hence the type of acquisition target, as predicted.

Research Summary: We employ an exploratory approach to understand what differentiates boards that retain limited, potentially tokenistic, gender diversity (i.e., a single female director), and boards that more genuinely diversify their composition by appointing additional female directors. Previous studies have speculated that strategic leaders responsible for board appointments may influence this occurrence. Using longitudinal data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee increase the likelihood of additional female director appointments. Boards and nominating committees with younger members amplify these effects, respectively. We use interviews with board members and professional corporate governance consultants to discuss the probable causal mechanisms that underpin these relationships, highlighting novel theoretical insights related to gatekeeping and social psychology. Managerial Summary: We explore what compels firms to appoint additional female directors after the first one, as only one female director could be considered a token. Using data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee make firms more likely to appoint additional female directors. These likelihoods are highest when younger directors make up the board at large and/or nominating committee. Chief executive officers can be change agents for gender diversity in their organizations by hiring female top managers and pushing for better representation of women on boards. Likewise, younger directors appear to enhance board gender diversity. These findings can inform the director selection process. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines the relationship between boards of directors' demographic diversity and firms' financial performance. In particular, we highlight how women and ethnic minorities can affect Middle Eastern SMEs' financial performance. Using an unbalanced panel of 1,855 firm-year observations of 371 boards of directors from nine Middle Eastern countries, our results support the positive impact of women and ethnic minority group members on Middle Eastern firms' performance. However, our evidence implies that when Western ethnic minority members increase, firms' performances tend to decrease, because these board members are appointed for regional and international board reputation legitimacy, personal business agendas, and links to the external corporate environment.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the literature on two lines of research, corporate governance and innovation, explaining how different internal corporate governance mechanisms may be determinants of business innovation. Design/methodology/approach: It explores the theoretical background and the empirical evidence regarding the influence of both ownership structure and the board of directors on company innovation. Then, conclusions are drawn and possible future research lines are presented. Findings: No consensus was observed regarding the relation between corporate governance and innovation, with both positive and negative arguments being found, and with empirical evidence not always pointing in the same direction. Thus, new studies trying to clarify this relationship are needed. Originality/value: Over recent years, interest has grown in the influence of governance mechanisms on innovation decisions taken by the management. Innovation efforts and results depend on factors that are influenced by corporate governance, such as ownership structure or the functioning of the board of directors. Thus, the paper shows an updated state of the art in this field proposing future lines for empirical research. (c) 2018, Diego Asensio-Lopez, Laura Cabeza-Garcia and Nuria Gonzalez-Alvarez.

Purpose: This paper aims to use the passage of the Italian Gender Diversity Law to help isolate the effects of board gender diversity on firm value by investigating conditions under which such diversity provides greater role-enhancing resources to the board. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a one-day event study to measure when gender diversity matters to investors. Abnormal returns from Italian firms were used to study investors' anticipated outcomes of the effect of gender diversity on firm value. Findings: Board gender diversity is financially beneficial especially for firms with a male dual CEO and board chair and with few or no women on board committees and firms that operate in industries with greater levels of competition. Addition of these moderators more than doubles the variance explained. Moreover, the effect of gender is isolated in this study, which examined investor reaction to the expectation of increases in the number of female board members, rather than to specific female appointees. Social implications: Determining the conditions when a gender diverse matters to firm value is important for shareholders, policymakers and advocates for gender equality. The findings illustrate precise conditions for stakeholders to make the case for board gender diversity as achieving financial reward, in addition to societal benefit. Originality/value: The value of a gender diverse board is contingent on the company's need for diverse resources (e.g. more competition, lack of gender diversity on committees or CEO duality). This paper provides insight as to why prior research linking board gender diversity to firm value finds seemingly contradictory results. Thus, this paper provides useful insights for researchers, boards and legislative bodies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The authors hypothesize that customer presence in the boardroom of business-to-business (B2B) firms brings customer orientation and customer knowledge to the board of directors and thereby enhances B2B firm performance. Using an objective measure of customer presence in the boardroom and a sample of 329 B2B firms over a nine-year period, the authors find support for this hypothesis. Moreover, relying on the resource-based view, they hypothesize that the performance benefit of customers in the boardroom is contingent on the value, rarity, inimitability, and organizational fit of customer resources. Specifically, they find that a customer on the board is more effective when demand uncertainty is high but is less effective when the firm is highly diversified. Moreover, a board member who is an independent director of the customer firm is less effective than a board member who is an executive at the customer firm. The authors also find that research and development intensity partially mediates the relationship between customer presence on the board and firm performance. (c) American Marketing Association 2018.

Research Summary: We explore the selection of new CEOs with international backgrounds as a key microfoundation of global strategy. Building on executive succession, upper echelons, and international business research, we argue that firms choose CEOs with international backgrounds to match their task demands. We further argue that depending on the CEO's origin from inside or outside the firm, different task demands matter. Specifically, we propose that the relationship between internal (firm-level) task demands and the new CEO's international background is more pronounced for inside successions, whereas the relationship between external (industry-level) task demands and the new CEO's international background is more pronounced for outside successions. An analysis of a sample of 363 CEO successions in S&P 500 firms supports our reasoning. Managerial Summary: Choosing a CEO with the "right" experience is a crucial concern for many large firms. While firms increasing seem to select new CEOs with international backgrounds, not all firms do so. In this article, we explore several factors that might influence this choice. Our results reveal that the predecessor's international background, the firm's level of internationalization, and the level of internationalization of the firm's industry influence whether a CEO with an international background is selected. Moreover, while for inside successions, the firm's level of internationalization is particularly important, for outside successions, the level of internationalization of the firm's industry is particularly important. Our findings inform those who search, select, and appoint new CEOs, including boards of directors and (executive search) consultants. Copyright (c) 2017 Strategic Management Society

Research Summary: A number of studies examine the extent to which boards compensate CEOs for their firm's performance (i.e., pay-for-performance), but these studies typically do not incorporate what CEOs actually do to bring about those performance outcomes. We suggest that directors will make stronger internal attributions about firm performance when the CEO engages in high levels of corporate strategic investment. CEOs that invest in firm growth essentially "place their bets," so the pay-for-performance relationship is stronger for them than it is for CEOs who do not invest as much in firm growth. We also theorize and find that directors make internal attributions about firm performance more for prestigious, but not less prestigious, CEOs and more when the directors collectively exhibit conservative, but not liberal, political ideologies. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and other stakeholders often demand that CEOs should be paid for performance. In other words, CEOs should be paid well when the company is performing well and paid less when the company is not performing well. We add an additional dimension: boards might also consider what CEOs actually do to bring about performance outcomes. Our findings suggest that when CEOs make heavy corporate investments, they essentially "place their bets." In this scenario, boards attribute performance to the CEO so that CEO compensation rises and falls with company performance. When CEOs make fewer corporate investments, their compensation is not as strongly associated with company performance. This primary relationship is particularly true when CEOs have high social recognition or when the directors are collectively conservative. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study examined whether the Board Characteristics have any impact on Earnings Management among the international Oil and Gas Corporation in the world. The Board Characteristics such as (board independence, board size, board diversity, and CEO duality). This study applied a quantitative research approach, secondary data, a sample of 71 corporations were selected from Top 250 corporations for one year (2016). The findings of this study indicated that the board independence has a significant impact on the reduction of earnings management. In contrast, the board size does not have any impact on the reduction of earnings management, due the larger the board size less efficient on monitoring of the board, when there are more members on the board it is more difficult for the board members to monitor the management, While gender diversity has a significant impact on the reduction of earnings management, Finally, The CEO Duality has a significant impact on the increase of earnings management, which means the separating the functions of CEO and Chair of the Board may enhance the Board of Directors' monitoring and control ability, and improve Directors' information processing capacities.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to use the dynamic capabilities framework to explain the effect of board networks, as a source of intellectual capital, on firm performance. The authors propose that the influence of board interlocks depends on their ability to contribute to strategic decision making. As a result, their effect is subject to the business context in which they occur and the different role of the interconnected directors involved. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use social network analysis to make board connections and to calculate centrality measures. The authors also identify busy boards to analyze whether their effect differs from centrality. The authors estimate the theoretical model using the Generalized Method of Moments in order to take advantage of the panel database. Findings: For a sample of Spanish firms from 1999 to 2015, the results show there is no direct significant effect of directors' networks on firm performance. However, the authors find a positive and significant influence of intra-industry board connections, particularly when they are established among outsiders. Research limitations/implications: The Spanish context of the study can limit the generalization of the papers' results. Practical implications: The results can be useful both for practitioners - since they can serve as a guide for companies to reformulate their boards in search of the optimal structure-, and when implementing good governance codes - establishing limits for director interlocking. Originality/value: This study helps to offer a better understanding of how directors' networks can add value to the firm depending on the kind of resources they provide (context) and the role of the director who is connected.

Purpose: As the primary decision makers, chief executive officers (CEOs) play pivotal roles in firm innovation. However, little is known regarding how CEOs influence the exploitation and exploration paradox. To advance theory and research, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the joint effects of CEO tenure and CEO-chair duality on a firm's shifting emphasis between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes the approach of a longitudinal sample of 81 US pharmaceutical firms. Findings: As CEOs' tenure advance, their firms' percentage of exploitative innovation increases. Furthermore, non-duality (separation of board chair and CEO) further strengthens the positive relationship between CEO tenure and the percentage of exploitative innovation. Research limitations/implications: This study integrates upper echelons theory and behavioral agency theory to juxtapose the effects of CEOs on technological innovation. This study extends knowledge of strategic leadership and innovation by showing that CEOs influence the balance between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Furthermore, this study also contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating that monitoring vigilance could inhibit capable CEOs from pursuing more exploratory innovation. Practical implications: Boards of directors should allow CEOs to have greater discretion over innovation, and vigilant monitoring and control may force CEOs to focus less on exploration. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies that explicitly investigate how CEO influences a firm's emphasis on exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation.

This article examines how the impact of Information technology (IT) governance by the board of directors on firms' financial performance can be mediated through IT operating capabilities, and how such board IT governance (B-ITG) can modulate the influence of IT operating capability on financial performance. Findings based on a survey of 89 corporate directors indicate that both B-ITG and IT operating capability increase financial performance. They further point to complex B-ITG effects on financial performance, including complementarity with and shaping IT operating capability. They show that high B-ITG suppresses the effect of IT operating capability on financial performance and that B-ITG effects on financial performance are partially mediated through IT operating capability.

Although personal attributes have gained recognition as an important area of effective corporate governance, scholarship has largely overlooked the value and implications of individual virtue in governance practice. We explore how authenticity--a personal and morally significant virtue--affects the primary monitoring and strategy functions of the board of directors as well as core processes concerning director selection, cultivation, and enactment by the board. While the predominant focus in corporate governance research has been on structural factors that influence firm financial outcomes, this paper shifts attention to the role of authenticity and its relationship to individual board member qualities and collective board activities. We explore how authenticity has the potential to influence board dynamics and decision making and to enhance transparency and accountability.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the influence of gender diversity on the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate governance (CG) and economic and financial performance of Brazilian publicly traded companies. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises 68 non-financial public companies comprising the IBX100 index of BM&FBOVESPA. For that, it was used panel data modeling, correlation and ranking by TOPSIS method. Findings: The results suggest a significant relationship between CG and economic-financial performance when mediated by gender diversity. This relationship was not observed between CSR and economic-financial performance. Thus, it can be concluded that in a diversified board of directors, in terms of gender, better monitoring of managers can occur because of the increase in their independence in decisions, as well as performance increase. These results diverge from the literature on the influence of women's participation in corporate boards in CSR. It is assumed that this result is because of the fact that the participation of women is recent in Brazil. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations are the number of companies analyzed, the choice of ISE index to verify the CSR variable and the metric used to verify the CG mechanisms. Originality/value: In general, this research contributes to the literature of the area, especially in Brazil, in confirming that the mediating variable gender diversity makes the relationship between CG and performance more significant.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an extension of the behavioral agency model (BAM) by focusing on the moderating role of CEO gender on the relationship between CEO stock options and risk "systematic vs idiosyncratic" and the performance consequences "positive vs negative" of these option incentives. Design/methodology/approach: Data on CEO's stock option portfolios are collected from the Standard & Poor's (S&P's) ExecuComp. This paper uses a panel data analysis for matched samples of CEOs in S&P's 1,500 listed firms over the period 2006-2013. Findings: The results indicate a more conservative, risk-averse posture in the case of female CEOs than for male CEOs when they are compensated with stock options for idiosyncratic (firm-specific) risk. The results also confirm that female CEOs in low systematic risk contexts, although more conservative, take more prudent risks that produce better long-term outcomes as compared to their male counterparts. Practical implications: Important implications for the design of optimal CEO's compensation packages emanate from this study. Findings provide useful tools for board of directors to design CEO's pay packages that take into account the different risk behavior of male and female CEOs with the aim of enhancing firm performance. Originality/value: This paper provides new evidence within the area of stock option-based compensation by focusing on the distinction between systematic and idiosyncratic risk when the effect of CEO stock option is analyzed and performance implications of awarding options to male and female CEOs.

Drawing on the identity fit perspective in organizational identity research, we investigate changes in new director selection patterns for family-influenced (i.e., family identity) and lone founder (i.e., entrepreneurial identity) firms experiencing growth. We collect over 7000 observations of new director placements from 2001 to 2014 and find that both family-influenced and lone founder firms tend to decrease the selection of new directors with similar firm-type board experience as firm size grows and firm performance deviates from that of similar firms. Lone founder firms also decrease the extent to which they hire new directors with previous board experience in lone founder firms following the appointment of a nonfounder CEO. We conclude that while family-influenced firms often use new director selection decisions to maintain the fit between family and firm identity, firm growth creates challenging conditions that threaten family-firm identity maintenance.

We examine the impact of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) on the compensation of powerful corporate leaders [i.e., boards of directors, including Chief Executives Officers (CEOs), Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), and Board Chairs] of acquiring firms. Using one of the largest datasets on M&As, directors' compensation, and governance to-date, consisting of a sample of UK financials (banks, insurance firms, private equity firms, and speciality finance firms) over a 13-year period, our results obtained by employing multivariate regression analyses show that acquisitions, on average, have a positive and significant impact on directors' compensation. This effect applies to both powerful corporate executives (CEOs, CFOs, and all other executive directors) and other non-executive directors. However, the positive acquisition effect on top executive compensation is much higher in larger and more complex acquisitions. We also find that much of the acquisition-related pay raises is equity-based rather than cash-based. Finally, we find CEOs to be the top beneficiaries from acquisitions. We interpret our findings within a multi-theoretical framework that draws insights from agency, executive power, managerial talent, and tournament theories of top executive compensation.

Purpose: This paper aims to draw on insights from team learning theory and stakeholder theory to examine the influence of board composition on firms' stakeholder management practices. The authors posit that board diversity is likely to enhance stakeholder management by shaping organizational goals by placing emphasis on the interests of a wide variety of stakeholders and providing firms with relevant knowledge to enhance their ability manage these interests. The authors further theorize on the moderating role of boards' learning environment, which they conceptualized as an important complementary governance-related factor, likely to further boards' ability to enhance stakeholder management. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test these predictions using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique on a panel of S&P 500 firms observed from 2001 to 2011. Findings: The findings provide evidence that more diverse boards in terms of gender, nationality and race/ethnicity are generally associated with more effective stakeholder management. Further, the findings also suggest that boards' co-working experience moderates the relationship between gender and national diversity and stakeholder management. Originality/value: While corporate governance research surveys many strategic implications of board composition, limited attention has been paid to the interplay of board characteristics with stakeholder management. This study is among the first to the authors' knowledge to explore the impact of board diversity on stakeholder management using team learning research, thus drawing attention to the role of boards' co-working experience in shaping their ability to impact firms' outcomes.

Considerable advances have been made in corporate governance research in recent years and opportunities exist to consider these developments within alliances. We extend the "scope of operations" hypothesis to the domain of joint ventures. This proposition suggests that the monitoring carried out by boards increases when organizations become more complex. The inherent characteristics of JVs generate unique sources of complexity that are currently unexplored in the corporate governance literature. First, we seek to determine their influence on monitoring by using primary data on JV board monitoring. Second, we adopt the size of JV boards as a proxy for monitoring in order to examine whether the determinants of board size and monitoring in fact coincide and to reveal if certain effects are masked by using board size as a simple proxy for monitoring. Doing so enables us to investigate the black-box of what boards actually do as well as extend governance research to other organizational forms. Our findings confirm that the unique characteristics of JVs influence the information needs by the boards resulting in more monitoring by JV directors. Our findings show there is value in bridging alliance theory and the literature on corporate governance research. We also advance practitioner's understanding by providing suggestions on how to structure JV boards in relation to their complexity. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

We study minority equity partnerships and the representation of investing firms on the boards of directors of their partners. In such alliances, an investor firm owns a minority position in the investee partner and may or may not secure a board seat. Prior alliance governance research has largely focused on the choice between equity and nonequity forms of alliances, and it has paid little attention to the particular administrative features of these organizational forms, notably their governing boards. We extend corporate governance research that has emphasized the monitoring and advisory roles of boards by examining how an investee's concerns about knowledge misappropriation can reduce the likelihood that an investor obtains board representation. We suggest that, although there exist opportunities for an investee to benefit from the investor's advice, the investor's ability to use an investee's knowledge by itself and indirectly with the help of its other partners negatively affects the likelihood of a board seat for the investor. We further argue that this negative effect is amplified when the investee has particularly valuable technologies at risk of appropriation by the investor. Our evidence from minority equity partnerships in the biopharmaceutical industry indicates why and when investors do not obtain board seats, despite the monitoring and advisory benefits that directors can bring to cooperative commercialization agreements.

Research Question/Issue: How does organizational context influence the impact of board control over managerial decisions on shareholder wealth?. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce a new theoretical concept--organizational discretion--to characterize the upper limit of managers' latitude of actions presented by their organizational context and propose that it moderates the impact of board control on shareholder wealth. Specifically, we first argue that strategic control by boards over managerial decisions reduces managers' latitude of actions and leads to trade-offs between the containment of managerial opportunism and the pursuit of strategic opportunities, which consequently influence the relationship between strategic control and shareholder wealth. We then suggest that the trade-offs incurred by strategic control over managerial decisions are more prominent in firms with high organizational discretion. Because of the trade-offs, we propose that boards are likely to decide whether to rely more on strategic control or financial control in internal corporate governance based on their firms' level of organizational discretion. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By introducing the concept of organizational discretion and highlighting the trade-offs caused by boards' strategic control over managerial decisions, we advance a contingency perspective to enhance the understanding about the impact of board control on shareholder wealth. It also bridges the strategic management and corporate governance research on managerial discretion that has largely evolved separately in the literature. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Boards should attend to the trade-offs between the containment of managerial opportunism and the pursuit of strategic opportunities when exercising strategic control over managerial decisions. Moreover, considering the trade-offs involved, boards should carefully design and implement internal corporate governance mechanisms based on their firms' level of organizational discretion.

In this article, I investigate the effect of multiple directorships on investment efficiency. Through the study of Korean firms, this article confirms that the existence and proportion of multiple directorships were negatively related to investment efficiency. The study also found that multiple directorships were strongly related to underinvestment. Accordingly, it concludes that multiple directorships are an obstacle to directors' fulfillment as it impedes effective investment opportunities and prevents them from playing leading roles in managerial decision-making. This, in turn, affects investment efficiency negatively. (c) 2019, People and Global Business Association. All rights reserved.

Risk in financial institutions is vitally important to regulators, policy makers, investors, and the stability of the financial system, yet some critical aspects of that risk remain poorly understood. In the case of U.S. startup banks, a critical choice that can influence risk-taking behavior is which of three regulators--with varying levels of stringency--to choose. The board of directors of the new bank makes this important decision, which may result in different risk implications, depending on board's structure. Here, we examine banks' risk behavior associated with the degree of board independence and the choice of regulator. We find that the regulatory environment and board independence jointly influence new bank risk. Our evidence suggests that the intensity of regulatory scrutiny is a partial substitute for board independence in achieving an optimal level of risk. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and policy. (c) 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to examine the relationship among the board of directors' characteristics, internal control mechanisms, and corporate sustainability performance. In particular, it aims to uncover how the board specific characteristics influence internal control, which, ultimately, would enhance the sustainability performance of public listed companies. The premise of the resource dependence theory is utilised to identify the board characteristics that may influence the sustainability performance; namely, size, composition, leadership, ownership, diversity, and expertise. Inspired by the institutional theory, the mediating role of internal control mechanisms, proxied by enterprise risk management (ERM) and management control systems (MCS) is also examined in this relationship. The majority of the previous studies concentrated on a few particular dimensions of sustainability like environmental and social aspects, whereas the governance and economic aspects remain unexplored in the literature. This paper fills this important research gap through holistically conceptualising sustainability performance. (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Structural sources of power have shifted dramatically in corporate America. Recently, the fracturing of the corporate interlock network threatens corporate managers' capacity to act as a unified group in support of their shared interests, potentially destroying managerialism and elevating shareholder power. Paradoxically, however, the fracturing of the corporate elite has not led to a widespread retreat of managerialism. Corporate managers have replaced their collective structural resources, embedded in their board interlock network, with organizational structural resources located within their firms. By adopting lone-insider board structures where the CEO is the only employee on the board of directors, CEOs establish brokerage positions within their focal firms, allowing them to preserve their autonomy even as the broader network withers. Firms nested in cohesive communities were the first to adopt lone-insider boards, supplementing and eventually replacing closure with brokerage as a structural resource. These alternative structural resources operated to preserve managerialism during different times. Network closure traditionally helped to preserve managerialism against shareholder pressure, but this effect disappeared as the network fragmented in the mid-2000s. In its absence, managers increasingly relied on organizational brokerage positions to maintain their autonomy. Consequently, managerialism remains surprisingly robust in the era of a fractured corporate board interlock network because top managers have become more focused on establishing positions of power within their own firms.

The central hypothesis of the managerial power approach (MPA) states that power is the main driver of executive compensation. The positive impact of power on compensation is allegedly demonstrated by a large number of empirical studies. We argue that the hypothesis of a positive impact of power on pay is not falsifiable empirically. The MPA is thus not testable. Empirical studies in this vein can only be interpreted as validation procedures for the empirical power measures employed. We suggest a new theoretical framework for research on the power-compensation relationship. This framework can be used to identify valid power measures empirically. The arguments presented in our paper allow for a reassessment of the role of power in the corporate governance debate. (c) 2018, The Author(s).

Extending the proposition that boards of directors influence firms' mergers and acquisitions (M&As), studies have investigated how board interlocks - network ties formed by directors -- may shape M&A processes and outcomes. While board interlocks and M&As are two streams of research, each underpinned by voluminous studies, their cross-fertilization has been relatively limited. In this chapter, the authors take stock of prior research investigating the relationship between board interlocks and M&As. Specifically, emphasizing the network features of board interlocks, the authors highlight a connection aspect and a structure aspect of board interlocks in appreciating their effects during pre-acquisition and post-acquisition phases. Based on this framework, the authors then lay out a research agenda that can further bridge board interlocks with M&As. Overall, this chapter endeavors to integrate and expand our knowledge on the acquisition implications of board interlocks. (c) 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Building on research within corporate governance and strategic management, this paper explores how managerial discretion stemming from managerial task environment influences the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision-making. Two sets of alternative hypotheses about the moderating effects of managerial discretion on the performance effects of board monitoring and CEO human capital were formulated. The results indicate partial support for governance-driven explanation showing that the association between board monitoring and market-based performance is strongest in environments characterized by high levels of managerial discretion. The findings also show that CEO human capital is positively associated with market-based performance in low-discretion environments, while in high-discretion environments this relationship turns negative. The central contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that managerial discretion is a useful tool to explain the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision making.

Corporate governance of entrepreneurial firms comprises mechanisms through which directors, shareholders, entrepreneurs, and top management teams are involved with start-ups. On the basis of a literature review, we identify three interrelated themes frequently discussed by previous empirical studies: (1) the role of key stakeholders (e.g. directors, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs), (2) governance process (e.g. social networking and strategic decision making), and (3) outcomes of corporate governance (innovation, growth, and internationalization). We augment previous studies' investigations of various stakeholders' roles in corporate governance, by examining the relationships and interactions among various stakeholders or groups of stakeholders, especially between boards and top management teams. We conclude by proposing how future research can explore the effect of interactions between board of directors and top management teams on organizational outcomes. (c) David B. Audretsch, Erik E.

Overwhelming evidence from prior research suggests a positive association between corporate board characteristics and carbon performance; however, very little is known about the mechanisms linking the two variables. This study attempts to fill this gap by developing and empirically testing a conceptual model that highlights the role of carbon strategy in the relationship between board environmental orientation (BEO) and carbon performance. We argue that BEO can directly and indirectly influence carbon performance through carbon strategy. Using structural equation modelling to analyse data consisting of 2,301 U.S. firm-year observations over the 2005-2015 period, we find that the greater the BEO is, the better its carbon performance (i.e., lower greenhouse gas emissions). The results also provide evidence of the mediating effect of carbon strategy on the relationship between BEO and carbon performance. Splitting the sample into high and low carbon-intensive industries shows a partial mediation effect in high carbon-intensive industries and a full mediation effect in low carbon-intensive industries. The findings of the study and its implications for scholars, policymakers, managers, investors, and environmentalists are discussed. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

We investigate the effect of politically connected boards (both supervisory boards [SBs] and boards of directors [BODs]) on cost of debt and equity capital of listed companies in Indonesia which has established a two-tier corporate governance system. The results, based on 250 firms, suggest that companies with politically connected SBs experience lower cost of debt and equity capital, whereas politically connected BODs have no association with cost of either debt or equity. Furthermore, we find that family firms and firms belonging to business groups with politically connected SBs enjoy lower cost of debt and equity capital. Our main results are robust to alternative measures and to tests for endogeneity. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate governance of Oman's financial sector companies. Intellectual capital has been found to successfully contribute to the economic wealth creation of firms in germane literature. Unfortunately, financial statements do not necessarily capture and reflect the contributions of intellectual capital, thereby leading to an information asymmetry between companies and users of financial statements. The research also investigates the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital efficiency across various financial subsectors. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports available on Muscat Securities Market for 31 listed financial sector companies for the period 2012 to 2016 and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Intellectual capital is measured using Pulic's efficiency measure of value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). Corporate governance individual components such as board characteristics, audit committee characteristics and ownership structure are presented as independent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that board size and frequency of audit committee meetings have a significant association with the intellectual capital efficiency of Oman's financial sector. VAIC and human capital efficiency of banks are also significantly influenced by most of the corporate governance mechanisms; however, other subsectors do not report such findings. Corporate governance of banks in comparison to other subsectors effectively engages in utilizing the potential of intellectual capital efficiency. Agency theory and resource dependency theory find limited support as a result of this study. The GMM results are not robust to the alternative instruments. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small as the study is limited to the listed financial sector of Oman. Future studies can be extended to include all of Oman's or GCC's listed companies. Additionally, the intellectual capital is measured using the construct of VAIC which suffers some limitations and can be overcome using other tools such as content analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that Oman's regulators can create an awareness strategy on highlighting the importance of intellectual capital for companies (board of directors and managers), investors, debtors and creditors. Further, Oman's Capital Market Authority and Muscat Securities Market need to strengthen the regulations related to intellectual capital. Originality/value: This study extends intellectual capital and corporate governance literature by presenting the research outcome for Oman's financial sector. It is useful for Oman's financial sector companies to direct corporate governance measures for driving value creation of firms through the management of intellectual capital efficiency.

Research Question/Issue: We review the literature on the relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the theoretical lenses that researchers apply when studying strategic leadership and innovation, most notably agency theory and upper echelons theory. We review the innovation constructs and measures that scholars employ, and we survey the links among strategic leaders' characteristics and technological innovation. Ultimately, we organize the literature into an integrative framework that provides a concise overview of the extant knowledge, and we outline an agenda for future research. Theoretical/Academic Implications: First, we offer scholars a discipline-spanning overview of the extant knowledge on the topic. Second, by integrating important aspects of corporate governance, such as the role of the board of directors, incentives for the chief executive officer or the top management team, and firm ownership, into the context of technological innovation, we highlight the vital role it plays in the realm of technological innovation. Third, we provide a useful guide for scholars and direct their work towards fruitful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer insights for practitioners interested in better understanding the bidirectional relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. In particular, our framework and our detailed analysis of the impact of strategic leaders on technological innovation can guide shareholders and board members in matters related to board composition as well as top executive selection and compensation.

Purpose: This study aims to draw on the resource dependence theory to synthesize the conflicting arguments as well as commonalities of the agency and stewardship perspectives on the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 212 large-scale publicly listed companies representing 20 sectors in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings: The research results based on all of 212 publicly listed companies in Sri Lanka show, in support of the agency theory, that CEO duality exerts a negative effect on firm performance when the CEO is equipped with additional informal power. Conversely, CEO duality exhibits a positive effect on firm performance when board involvements are high, a finding that supports the commonalities of the agency and stewardship theoretical perspectives. Practical implications: By examining the governance practices and concepts in an Asian developing economy, this study provides insight into the power dynamics between the CEO and the board of directors in managerial contexts that are largely different from those in western countries. Originality/value: This study expands the theoretical underpinning of corporate governance research by identifying the performance implications of CEO duality within the broad context of the resource provision of the board of directors and the informal power of CEOs.

To better understand how executives impact resource allocation, we investigate the three underpinnings of dynamic managerial capabilities (DMCs) as antecedents of related business diversification (RBD) and how they interact with firm resources to influence RBD. Taking football as the research subject, we analyze the joint impact of managerial human capital, managerial social capital, and managerial cognition within the board of directors of English Premier League clubs. We rely on a unique 15-year panel dataset and show that more specific managerial human capital and a long-term orientation among the board of directors increase RBD while additional general managerial human capital and managerial social capital diminish RBD. In addition, our findings reveal that DMCs moderate the relationships of physical and financial resources with RBD in different directions. Our study is amongst the first to analyze all three underpinnings of DMCs and to endorse the practical relevance of DMCs for RBD. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the relationship between corporate governance mechanism and firm performance among Shariah-compliant firms using an integrated theoretical framework. This study is carried out on the top 200 Shariah-compliant firms listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2017. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the researchers employ generalized least squares and random effect with robust and clustering standard error models to estimate the impact of ownership structure, board independence, board competence, firms' characteristics, and debt structure on firm performance as measured by the firm's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The findings show that ownership concentration has a statistically positive effect on firm performance. Having an external Chair and independent board members with an educational level beyond a bachelor's degree also have a positive effect on firm performance while CEO duality has a statistically negative impact instead. Insider representation has a positive impact on firm performance but when these inside board members are also the owners, the impact turns negative. Furthermore, the statistical significance of holding a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and other type of qualifications imply the need for board members to have greater knowledge in order to positively influence ROA and ROE. This is the first study to examine the influence of corporate governance mechanism on firm performance using a multi-theoretical approach in the context of Shariah-compliant firms. The interaction terms of elements in agency theory, stakeholder/resource-based theory, and stewardship theory are used as pre-conditions to the direct effect of these regressors on firm performance.

Research Summary: Boards of directors make high-stake decisions that involve hiring, compensating, and dismissing CEOs. Building on theory about choice-supportive bias and escalation of commitment, we theorize that "hiring directors" (directors who were present during a CEO's hiring) will display choice-supportive bias and escalate commitment to poorly performing CEOs. Primary data from 73 directors indicate that directors are indeed biased toward CEOs they help hire. Archival data from S&P 1500 firms reveal that, following poor performance, the number of hiring directors is positively related to the increase in CEO pay and lower likelihood of CEO dismissal. Building on theory about board experience, we also predict and find that more experienced boards reduce the tendency to escalate. Thus, bias among hiring directors can be mitigated via experience. Managerial Summary: Making a choice such as casting a vote or selecting a restaurant leads people to view their selection favorably even if evidence emerges suggesting it was a bad choice. We examine whether corporate directors fall prey to this choice-supportive bias when involved in CEO hiring. We found that directors who are part of the hiring process tend to have an overly rosy view of the person selected. Moreover, if the firm is performing poorly, a board with more directors who helped hire the current CEO will tend to increase the CEO's pay more and are less likely to fire the CEO than a board with fewer such directors. This problem is reduced if the board has highly experienced directors among its ranks. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

During recent years, there has been a growing interest in CEO narcissism across disciplines. Various scholars document that CEO narcissism is an important factor that should not be overlooked when analyzing various organizational outcomes and strategies. Research on CEO narcissism has focused on its negative implications on organization outcomes. However, little attention has been paid to its effect on corporate social responsibility (CSR). This study explores the relationship between CEO narcissism and two distinct facets of CSR (stakeholder management and social issue participation), while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. Using a sample of publicly traded U.S restaurants, the results document that an outside board of directors plays a moderating role on the relationship between CEO narcissism and the two distinct facets of CSR.

Corporate governance research suggests that boards of directors play key roles in governing company strategy. Although qualitative research has examined board-management relationships to describe board involvement in strategy, we lack detailed insights into how directors engage with organizational members for governing a complex and long-term issue such as product innovation. Our multiple-case study of four listed pharmaceutical firms reveals a sequential process of board involvement: Directors with deep expertise govern scientific innovation, followed by the full board's involvement in its strategic aspects. The nature of director involvement varies across board levels in terms of the direction (proactive or reactive), timing (regular or spontaneous), and the extent of formality of exchanges between directors and organizational members. Our study contributes to corporate governance research by introducing the concept of board behavioral diversity and by theorizing about the multilevel, structural, and temporal dimensions of board behavior and its relational characteristics.

Purpose: Despite agreement on the importance of adopting governance structures for developing competitive advantage, we still know little about why or how governance mechanisms are adopted in the first place. We also acknowledge that family businesses with formal governance mechanisms in place still resort to informal means to make decisions, and we lack knowledge about why certain governance mechanisms are sometimes, but not always, effective and functional. Given these research gaps, and drawing on institutional theory, we aim to explore: How are governance structures adopted and developed in family firms? Once adopted, how do family businesses perceive these governance structures? Design/methodology/approach: Using Mokken Scale Analysis, a method suitable to uncover patterns/sequences of adoption/acquisition over time, we analyze a dataset of 1,488 Spanish family firms to explore if there is a specific pattern in the implementation of governance structures. We complement the analysis with descriptive data about perceived usefulness of such structures. Findings: Our findings highlight two important issues. Family businesses follow a specific process implementing first business governance (board of directors, then executive committee), followed by family governance (family council then family constitution). We suggest they do so in response to institutional pressures, given the exposure they have to business practices, and their need to appear legitimate. Despite formal adoption of governance structures, family businesses do not necessarily consider them useful. We suggest that their perception about the usefulness of the implemented governance structures may lead to their ceremonial adoption, resulting in a gap between the implementation and functionality of such structures. Research limitations/implications: Our article contributes to the family business literature by bringing novel insights about implementation of governance structures. We take a step back to explain why these governance mechanisms were adopted in the first place. Using institutional theory we enrich governance and family business literatures, by offering a lens that explains why family businesses follow a specific process in adopting governance structures. We also offer a plausible explanation as to why governance structures are ineffective in achieving their theorized role in the context of family businesses, based on the family's perception of the unusefulness of such structures, and the concept of ceremonial adoption. Practical implications: There is no single recipe that can serve the multiple needs of different family businesses. This indicates that family businesses may need diverse levels of development and order when setting up their governance structures. Accordingly, this study constitutes an important point of demarcation for practitioners interested in examining the effectiveness of governance structures in family firms. We show that an important pre-requisite for examining the effectiveness of governance structures is to start by investigating whether these structures are actually being used or are only adopted ceremonially. Originality/value: Our paper expands current knowledge on governance in family firms by taking a step back hinting at why are governance structures adopted in the first place. Focusing on how governance is implemented in terms of sequence is novel and relevant for researcher and practitioners to understand how this process unfolds. Our study uses institutional theory, which is a strong theory to support the results. Our paper also uses a novel method to study governance structures in family firms.

The purpose of this study is to understand the dynamic relationships between managerial human capital, dynamic managerial capabilities and strategic change within boards of directors. Building on the dynamic managerial capabilities perspective and upper echelons theory, we theorize and investigate the impact of managerial human capital on strategic change as well as the mediating role of boards' sensing, seizing and reconfiguring abilities, defined as dynamic managerial capabilities. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 606 Norwegian firms. The main findings suggest that while managerial human capital positively impacts strategic change, boards' sensing and seizing abilities (not reconfiguring) positively mediate the relationship between human capital and strategic change. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This study explores how board leadership may influence the board dynamic managerial capabilities. We draw on the dynamic capabilities perspective to examine the effect of board chairs on the dynamic managerial capabilities of the board of directors. Using survey data from a sample of 410 Norwegian firms, our results reveal that board chair human capital is positively related to the board's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities. Moreover, we find the positive effects of board chair human capital on board sensing and seizing capabilities to be stronger under higher environmental dynamism. Our study suggests that board chairs can play an important leadership role in developing dynamic managerial capabilities at the board level, particularly in more dynamic environments.

Evidence suggests that focusing on the needs of the marketplace to create customer value and firm advantage, an outside-in (OI) approach to strategy, yields superior firm performance. However, despite the acknowledged advantage of an OI approach to strategy, it has not yet achieved widespread adoption by industry practitioners. Absent formal insight regarding how a firm-wide OI approach to strategy emerges, we introduce the premise that a firm-wide practice requires influence from those at the top of firm hierarchy, i.e., its Board of Directors. We posit that if the OI construct is both: (1) strategic rather than tactical in nature, and (2) enterprise-wide rather than function specific (e.g., marketing), then firm-wide adoption requires BOD acceptance, if not advocacy and leadership. We present 10 research propositions that describe how the board influences a firm-wide OI approach to strategy and provide specific implications for scholars from marketing and corporate governance as well as boards and chief marketing officers.

Managerial oversight is strengthened and firms' strategic performance improved when boards are gender-diverse. Yet the rate of women's appointment to corporate boards is decelerating. This study proposes an explanation for the unexpected attenuation rooted in social movement dynamics, particularly cross-movement influences originating from the contemporary governance reform movement. Seeking to alleviate managerialist tendencies, the governance reform movement has compelled major changes to board structure, composition, and activity, as well as the broader logic surrounding corporate boards. By definition, social movements' cognitive and structural advances manifest "spillover" effects - unintentional impacts affecting the opportunity structure, and ultimately progress, of neighboring campaigns. Drawing on social movement theory, a conceptual model is outlined explicating the mechanisms by which governance reform's broad enactments have incidentally impeded board gender diversity's advance. Theoretically-grounded strategies for reversing those effects are also outlined and the study closes with a discussion of implications for research, practice, and policy. (c) 2020

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess whether the gender composition of the board of directors affects the sensitivity to gender issues in defining university strategies and therefore strategic plans. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an ordinary least square regression to test the relationship between gender sensitivity approach and board composition in Italian state universities (ISUs). The authors measured the gender sensitivity approach of each university by an index (gender sensitivity approach index) determined based on content analysis. Gender board composition is, instead, analyzed by heterogeneity (homogeneity) index (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) of the board. Findings: The finding suggests that, if the board has a certain level of heterogeneity, then university strategic plan (USP) is a more gender-sensitive approach. Research limitations/implications: The study analyses only the 2018 USPs of ISUs and considers the presence of women within the board, and not their actual role and their position in the university hierarchy. Practical implications: The practical implication of this study is that if universities want to guarantee gender equality, they should open their boards more widely to women. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that analyzes the relationships between board composition and sensitivity to gender issues within the USPs. The paper therefore contributes to the literature on governance in the public sector, particularly in universities. Moreover, it stimulates the accounting debate on gender issue and highlights that gender issues cannot be taken up by decision-making bodies that are not heterogeneous enough.

Research Summary: Board scholarship has generally taken the perspective that when it comes to board expertise, more is better. This study, in contrast, explores contingencies that may stretch board experience beyond the limits of its usefulness. We integrate insights from extant research in board leadership and international strategy to identify and test internal and external contextual factors that can limit the effectiveness of boards' international experience. Exploring this in the context of cross-border M&As, we find evidence that the positive effects of boards' international experience are attenuated when the CEO lacks such knowledge, and when the institutional distance between the home and target countries is high. Overall, our findings suggest the need to exercise caution in viewing board expertise as a "panacea" of board effectiveness. Managerial Summary: Boards are generally viewed as experts that CEOs can look to for advice when formulating corporate strategy. Accordingly, the predominant view has been that the more relevant expertise on the board, the better the strategic advice they can offer. The results of our study, however, suggest that is not always the case. As it pertains to cross-border M&As, in order to get the maximum benefit from boards' international experience, CEOs must have enough international experience of their own, and the institutional environment of the target firm's country must not be too dissimilar from the acquiring firm's home country. Otherwise, it is possible that the boards' international experience will be stretched beyond its strategic usefulness. (c) 2020 Strategic Management Society

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to show that social relations in a corporate governance platform between members of supervisory boards and between members of supervisory and executive board tiers can serve as an alternative viewpoint for understanding mechanisms of social selection in corporate governance networks. The study shows that through the lenses of social network analysis, it is possible to identify and understand how the process of corporate governance member selection unfolds within companies and how that selection process may have been potentially influenced by the cross-board relations, such as interlocking directorships. Design/methodology/approach: To estimate network parameters and attribute effects of network tie emergence, this study has used exponential random graph models (ERGMs) on corporate governance data of Danish publicly listed companies. Econometric models are applied to estimate parameter statistics which serve further to explain tendencies of tie emergence. Findings: The results of this study reveal that the process of selection of both supervisory boards and executive directors is interdependent. Also, the study showed that board members are more likely to select popular supervisory board members and top managers who have their expertise gained through multiple companies affiliated with multiple industries. However, these conditions for CEO selection apply only to the extent to which they have their experience gained from multiple companies but not multiple industries. Originality/value: On one hand, this study demonstrates that being a dynamic practitioner who is exposed to diverse corporate environments by being affiliated with different companies belonging to different industries generally increases practitioners visibility in the corporate governance network, and therefore their attractiveness to boards of directors. On the other hand, the results show that the research on board assemblage, nowadays, should be rather observed through the methodology of social network analysis as the method gives an opportunity to understand structures through relations, from which the executive tier should not be exempted as well.

This article reviews the existing academic research on the determinants and consequences of board tenure. Primarily, this article focuses specifically on international empirical studies. We find that different corporate governance characteristics determine board tenure. In addition, our review summarizes the influence of board tenure on corporate outcomes, such as accounting performance, financial reporting quality, and business strategy. This review contributes to an understanding of the implications, benefits, and limitations of board tenure. In the absence of any specific guidelines on current corporate governance best practice codes in different jurisdictions, this article would benefit regulators and professionals wishing to understand the importance and consequences of board tenure. We also suggest future research needed to fill the gaps in the existing board tenure literature. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

This paper explores the development and articulation of the agency and stakeholder theories of the firm and their corresponding logics of shareholder wealth maximisation and stakeholder interest optimisation. We note how these two perspectives have been viewed as diametrically opposite normative, instrumental and descriptive theories, despite efforts by some authors to find common ground. Each has served as a basis for firm governance. We explore the relationship of the agency and stakeholder theories to the conceptualisations of the roles of boards of directors, and how both theories hold value in understanding two board functions/roles: control/monitoring roles and service roles (which covers both resources and strategy).

Governance and leadership failings have been a common feature of Scottish football (McLeod, 2016). In response, many Scottish football clubs have adopted the approach of an 'ethical strategist' - meaning stakeholder engagement has become central to their strategies (Noland and Phillips, 2010). Such strategies are argued to necessitate sustainability (Mason and Simmons, 2012), but little is known about how they can be implemented effectively. The purpose of this paper is to address that gap and examine how social capital influences the effectiveness of stakeholder engagement-focused strategies in Scottish football. Using a multiple-case study approach, we make two contributions to the literature. First, we add to existing knowledge of how ethical strategists can utilise social capital to achieve strategic success. Second, we make a theoretical contribution to Nahapiet and Ghoshal's (1998) three-dimensional model of social capital by showing how contextual factors influence the interaction process between dimensions.

While boards of directors play a critical role in the formulation of strategic actions of family firms, up-to-date research examining the antecedents of boards' influence on strategic decisions remains limited. This study examines whether and how boards' task conflict impacts boards' control and advisory tasks, as well as to what extent these relationships vary with different degrees of boards' openness. Our main hypotheses are tested on a sample of 94 family firms from Norway. Our main findings confirm the complex and context-sensitive nature of conflicts in the context of family firms' boards of directors. In particular, we advance the debate by suggesting that task conflict benefits both boards' control and advisory tasks only when boards function in an atmosphere of openness. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

The governance of non-profit organisations is complex, as these organisations are not only intended to create value for third parties but also dependent on their donors. When the donor is a for-profit firm, it may be challenging to align and balance the firm's for-profit interests and the non-profit organisation's social aims. The board of directors has the main responsibility for supporting and monitoring managers' decisions so that all perspectives are considered, but doing so requires appropriate information about stakeholders' expectations. Adopting the agency theory perspective, this study focuses on corporate governance in corporate foundations (CFs), a type of non-profit organisation with a private firm as its founder and main donor. We hypothesise that bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between CFs and their founder firms, which are the main donors and consequently the main stakeholders, can increase the involvement of the board of directors, thereby leading to higher organisational effectiveness. We argue that the implementation of bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm can strengthen corporate governance and provide the board of directors with the information needed to be more involved; such implementation fosters organisational effectiveness because it aligns the profit-oriented objectives of the founder firm and the social-oriented objectives of the CF. By analysing data from interviews of 188 CFs from six European countries, we aim to contribute to the debate on the role of corporate governance in non-profit organisations under the agency theory perspective. We provide evidence that the implementation of coordination and bureaucratic control mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm gives the board more information and leads to higher board involvement, thereby minimising agency issues and fostering organisational effectiveness.

Despite the association between the board of directors and firm performance having been examined extensively in the literature, empirical evidence on whether and how boards contribute to firms' long-term success is scarce. Using 14-year panel data of all Australian listed firms, this study examines the effects of board potential and board dynamics, the key factors of board effectiveness, on firms' investment efficiency. We find strong evidence that both board potential and board dynamics are positively associated with firm investment efficiency. The findings support the view that both firms' resources and internal processes that enable boards to mobilize those resources to resolve complex tasks are critical for a firm's long-term success.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether foreign directors' influence on opportunistic behavior among managers varies between Islamic banks (IBs) and conventional banks (CBs). It also examines how religious ethics and morals guide foreign directors to be better monitors. Design/methodology/approach: A panel fixed effects regression is used to analyze the effect of foreign directors on opportunistic behavior among managers in IBs and CBs. The authors use different proxies such as loss avoidance, discretionary loan loss provision and expense preference behavior to measure management opportunistic behavior. Findings: Based on sample of 3,758 bank-year observations for 164 banks over the period 1993-2015, the authors show that the presence of foreign directors in IBs increases boards' effectiveness in impeding management opportunistic behavior, whereas the presence of foreign directors in CBs reduces boards' effectiveness in curbing management's unethical acts. The authors also document that IBs (CBs) with foreign directors demonstrate less (more) earnings management and expense-preference behavior among managers. In addition, the authors' evidence indicates that the existence of the Shari'ah supervisory boards helps foreign directors be more effective monitors. Research limitations/implications: The current study focuses on banks only which makes its results subject to sample bias; there are many other forms of financial institutions (e.g. investments, real-estates and mutual funds) complying to the Shari'ah law. Second, owing to the lack of foreign board directors characteristics, the authors cannot investigate the intensity of the specific characteristics that could have specific directions in affecting managerial behavior. Practical implications: The findings in this paper may help standards-setters, auditors, investors and regulators take appropriate measures and create better policies that reduce managers' discretion. This could in turn improve information transparency decision-making, monitoring, advising and accounting quality. Originality/value: The authors' theoretical framework combines the agency, contingency, resource-dependence, stewardship and stakeholders' theories and applies them to Shari'ah as an alternative ethical and internal governance mechanism. The authors find that the impact of foreign directors on management opportunistic behavior depends on the corporate religious norms within boards of directors, in particular, suggesting that religious values affect how foreign directors influence bank managers' behavior.

Purpose: This paper attempts to examine the activity and involvement of board of directors in internationalization activities of firms in emerging markets, by evaluating the resource provisioning roles of interlocks provided by board of directors, and the frequency of board meetings. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of board involvement is contingent upon the levels of family ownership in firms since family ownership could impact the firm's ability to utilize the presence of different types of board members. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test our hypotheses on a sample of listed Indian companies, extracted from the Prowess database published by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a database of the financial performance of Indian companies. On a panel of 3,133 firm years of 605 unique Indian firms with foreign investments, over a time period of 2006-2017, the authors apply different estimation techniques. Findings: The results demonstrate that both board meeting frequency and director interlocks are instrumental in supporting internationalization activities in emerging market firms. However, family ownership moderates the role of insider and independent interlocks on internationalization investments in different ways; the authors find that interlocks provided by independent directors support internationalization activities in family firms, whereas those provided by insider directors do not. Further, the study also finds that board meetings are less effective in internationalization of family firms. Practical implications: The authors conclude that family firms aiming at international diversification require to develop more connected and networked independent directors to enable internationalization in firms. While independent director interlocks enhance the international investments, it is also useful to know that board meetings are ineffective in utilizing the resources in family firms. This points to the possibility that family firms should device mechanisms to integrate family meetings with board meetings so that they can utilize the within-family processes to aid in their internationalization decisions. Originality/value: The study contributes to resource dependence theory by understanding its limiting role in family firms. Theoretically, it helps delineate the limiting resource provision role of the insider directors vis-a-vis independent directors. The authors argue that the resource provision role of insider director interlocks does not effectively help in internationalization in comparison to independent director interlocks in family-dominated firms. Consequently, the study shows the limiting role of resource provision and utilization by family-owned firms in comparison to non-family-owned firms. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Based on the resource dependency theory, this article investigates the relationships among board gender diversity, innovation, and firm performance. Specifically, this article examines the mediating role of innovation, which may explain how board gender diversity is related to firm performance. Using a sample of 120 SBF companies from 2009 to 2012, the results indicate a negative effect of board gender diversity on innovation. In addition, we do not find evidence of a mediating role of innovation within the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

From a corporate governance point of view, this paper addresses the question of how corporate ownership and board characteristics influence firm value for a sample of Ibero-American companies. Specifically, we analyse indexed non-financial companies from Chile and Spain for the period 2007-2016, using the GMM panel data technique. Our research is novel in considering a two-country approach, with one emerging and one developed country, and in analysing how corporate ownership and board characteristics, in addition to contextual variables, determine firm value. Our results assess the efficiency of corporate governance mechanisms. Although findings are intriguing regarding ownership concentration, they confirm the benefits of a good board of directors. This type of board is characterised by a large size, sufficiently independent directors, and a balance in terms of gender diversity. We provide several policy recommendations from our main findings.

Establishing a corporate governance strategy that promotes the efficient use of organisational resources is instrumental in the economic growth of a country, as well as the successful management of firms. This book reviews existing literature and identifies board structural features as key variables of an effective corporate governance system, establishing a multi-theoretical model that links Board structural characteristics with firm performance. It then, using a comprehensive empirical study of 265 companies listed on the Karachi Stock exchange, tests this conceptual model. This research serves as a significant milestone, reflecting the socio-economic setting of emerging economies, and highlighting the need for the corporate sector in emerging markets to move away from a 'tick-box' culture. It argues that the sector needs to implement corporate governance as a tool to mitigate business risks; appoint and empower non-executive directors to achieve an effective monitoring of management; and establish their own ethical and governance principles, applicable to the Board of Directors. Based on an extensive data base, collected painstakingly over five years, this book offers new insights and conceptual framework for further research in this area. Given the breadth and width of the research, it is a useful source of future reference for students, researchers and policy makers.

This book takes the central issues facing board members today and applies the giving voice to values framework while also providing insights from practicing board members who have faced these issues. It covers such topics as strategic planning and monitoring, director independence, privacy and cyber risk, executive compensation and CEO succession planning. With this book, readers will also grapple with the conflicts of interest that might arise in the director selection process, role of the nominating committee and the compensation committee in order to cultivate more optimal board dynamics. The principles of giving voice to values start by asking a deceptively simple question: 'What if you were going to act on your values-what would you say and do?' The book then provides an overview of the current landscape of corporate governance along with the major rules and director duties applicable to the board of directors. The book's latter chapters contain a series of five scenarios common to the board of directors that are presented as a set of "Board Challenges" involving the tensions often found in board work. In Giving Voice to Values in the Boardroom, the author, Cynthia E. Clark, provides practical strategies for board members and other constituents of corporate governance to deal with these challenges. These cases are designed to help users of the book implement prescripting and action planning. Each case will also have discussion questions about the stakes and stakeholders, common reasons and rationalizations and examples of how firms and governance professionals have handled similar board challenges.

The international literature has deepened the importance of analysing the composition of BoDs in order to understand their effectiveness and efficiency. Along this path of research, this chapter aims to investigate the board diversity reviewing the main contributes developed on this topic. Specifically, the chapter illustrates the different sources in terms of diversity in the boardrooms, putting in evidence the role of regulations and institutional investors at promoting the growth of this diversity. The analysis is proposed through a cost-benefit approach, to illustrate the potential advantages and the relative risks connected to the diversity in BoDs. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

This chapter aims to set the ground, providing a brief definition of the corporate governance according to worldwide practices and focusing on the role and the functions of the board of directors. To reach this goal, a punctual review of the different theoretical frameworks coping with this topic is provided, putting in evidence the main differences as well as the principal points in common. Specifically, the agency theory, the stakeholder theory, the stewardship theory, the resource dependence theory, and the institutional theory are analysed. Moreover, the role of BoDs is analysed together with the features and the overview of "good" corporate governance practices according to existing literature and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

This research explores the interfirm interlock networks that currently exist among publicly traded media conglomerates operating in the United States of America. Directorship information was gathered from annual reports and definitive proxy reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for 68 media conglomerates across seven media sectors for year ending 2018. This investigation applies social resource theory to assess the social networks formed by interfirm interlocks among media conglomerates and how such network structures address environmental uncertainty. Results indicate that not all alliances are mutually beneficial and those that are more resource-dependent endure negative cooptation effects. Moreover, today's financial interlocks look very different than they did at the turn of the century. This research discusses how these changes in interfirm interlocks have resulted in directorship wars. Practical implications are discussed.

This study examines the relationship between board attributes and firm performance. In accordance with agency theory, effective board of directors plays a key role in establishing good corporate governance and enhancing firm performance by mitigating earnings management. Based on panel data set drawn from Tunisian listed firms over the period 2011 - 2017 and while using dynamic panel GMM estimator to alleviate endogeneity problems, a U-shaped relationship was found between board size, board independence and firm performance. Indeed, results show that a higher firm performance is confirmed if the board size is composed of at least 6 members and 15% of independent board members. For a robustness check, this study measures a composite score of the effectiveness of board of directors to capture the aggregate impact of board's effectiveness on firm performance. The findings of regression analysis find a significant positive relationship between the board effectiveness score and firm performance. Indeed, there is a synergy between mechanisms that act together to enhance firm performance in the Tunisian context. Copyright (c) 2020. Mejda DAKHLAOUI And Imen FREDJ.

Corporate governance has long been the subject of interest for researchers in business administration. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices decided by boards of directors are now a key issue in the decision-making process of companies. The relationship between the governance structure and CSR policies is crucial to defining the companies' strategic view. In this paper, we identify how the characteristics of corporate governance impact CSR disclosure. Our findings show that a large board of directors reduces the probability of adhering to practices that involve stakeholders more closely in company activity, while companies with more independent directors have a higher level of stakeholder protection almost by definition. Thus, there is a need for additional ways of involving stakeholders in company activity. Our results also reveal that an overlap between the roles of the CEO and the board chairman is an undesirable influence on a CSR report. (c) 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Growing evidence suggests that gender diversity on boards of directors is important for corporate governance and overall organizational effectiveness. Yet, progress in increasing female board representation has been slow. Prior studies have focused primarily on either the role of organizational characteristics in board gender composition or the role of national institutions as predictors of female board representation across countries. In this study, we integrate psychological theory related to implicit biases and agency theory, with institutional theory, to propose that the national context for gender equality moderates the extent to which characteristics of organizational leadership relate to female board representation. We conduct a meta-analysis of 158 samples encompassing 60,648 organizations across 36 countries to test our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the importance of the national context for gender equality as a boundary condition for understanding the relationship between organizational leadership characteristics and female board representation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for increasing the representation of female directors across countries. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to understand the circumstances under which board behavior is affected by gender diversity. The "reasoned action approach" is used as a lens through which to assess the extent that the behavior of the board varies with its gender diversity. Research Findings/Insights: The study uses archival data from a panel sample of 80,395 directorships observed between 1998 and 2012. Boardroom gender diversity is significantly related to director personal responsibility (board attendance), CEO accountability, and risk taking. Our findings highlight the key importance of the exposure of male directors to women directors on boards beyond the focal board. This suggests a positive externality or a spillover effect. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The empirical findings of this study highlight the importance of allowing for the operation of social norms when studying boardroom decision making. Experience gained by male directors of working with women directors on other boards, beyond the focal board, is shown to enable women directors to contribute more effectively. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers encouragement to policy makers' intent on increasing the presence of women on corporate boards. These results point to a spillover effect: there is an observed impact of women on boards that acts not only directly on the board on which they sit but also through the network of boards on which their male counterparts sit.

Does the appointment of more women and ethnic minority directors on corporate boards help combat discriminatory work environments? This empirical study addresses this question by exploring the occurrence of large-scale discrimination lawsuits. Drawing from social identity theory and empathy-based perspectives, we propose that a greater presence of female and minority directors on boards reduces the likelihood of large-scale discrimination lawsuits given their propensity to advocate for underrepresented groups in the workplace. Our analysis of data from 452 US firms from 2010-2015 indicates that a higher proportion of female and minority directors on boards is associated with a lower likelihood of such lawsuits. Specifically, the likelihood of such lawsuits is lower where there are three or more (a critical mass) female and minority directors. "Token" appointments (one or two female or minority directors) do not reduce the occurrence of these lawsuits. Further, the joint presence of minority and female directors on boards significantly reduces the likelihood of such lawsuits. Finally, we found that female CEOs help in reducing the occurrence of such lawsuits when the board has two or more female directors. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of greater gender and ethnic diversity on boards in combating workplace discrimination. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

We theorize that female candidates considering CEO roles will perceive greater termination vulnerability in such roles than their male counterparts. We further theorize that indicators of recent organizational distress will exacerbate female CEO candidates' perceptions of termination vulnerability, while the presence of female leaders will mitigate these concerns. To test our arguments, we examine the initial values of newly appointed female and male CEOs' severance agreements from 2007 to 2014. Results support our arguments and begin to shed light on the factors that influence female executives' concerns about CEO roles and ultimately firms' ability to appoint female CEOs.

Research and development (R&D) is a key contributor to organizations' pursuit of innovation. In turn, CEOs can influence important decisions related to changes in R&D spending--the kind of spending with the potential to lead to innovation. We seek to understand the motivation and conditions under which CEOs may influence R&D spending changes. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, this study investigates how CEO motivation affects changes in firm R&D spending. We explore the effect of CEO promotion and prevention foci on yearly R&D increase. We use a panel dataset of 688 S&P 1500 firms to test our hypotheses. Our findings suggest a negative relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase, while CEO promotion focus produces no meaningful effect. We further test CEO compensation as a moderating mechanism, testing both incentive and fixed CEO compensation. We find that incentive compensation negatively moderates the relationship between CEO promotion focus and R&D increase, and positively moderates the relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase. Additionally, CEO fixed income negatively moderates the relationship between CEO prevention focus and R&D increase. Based on these results we discuss theoretical implications of our findings, including differing effects of CEO regulatory focus on firm risk-taking behavior and how compensation packages may alter those effects. We further discuss the practical necessity for boards of directors to understand both the R&D goals of an organization and the individual motivational orientation of CEOs when crafting compensation packages.

Purpose: It has been over 20 years since the landmark publication of Mizruchi (1996) and his examination of "what do interlocks do?". Since then, the nature of interlocks and subsequent research on the subject has evolved. This paper aims to revisit the literature on interlocking directorates through a quantitative bibliometric analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This study undertakes a bibliometric analysis of literature citing the Mizruchi (1996) to examine the state of research following up on "what do interlocks do". This study examines 718 publications using keyword and co-word analysis, along with a thematic analysis to revisit the research that has followed Mizruchi's topic of what do interlocks do. Findings: This study finds that the topics of the corporate elite, capitalist economy and corporate governance have remained prominent themes in the field. Research areas that are emerging in the field of interlocking directorates include gender diversity, globalisation and advancing theoretical frameworks. Originality/value: This paper provides a quantitative bibliometric analysis to revisit the extant literature on "what do interlocks do", examining a high number of articles to identify areas which could be developed to advance research in the field.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how banks' climate strategies affect environmental performance. To extend this line of research, the carbon disclosure of worldwide banks is examined. In particular, we focus on specific governance strategies: board of director monitoring and managerial incentives. Panel data are employed on a sample taken from 330 bank-year observations in the period after the financial crisis. The results show an increase in environmental performance through the implementation of managerial incentives related to climate change, associated with the highest level of responsibility of the board of directors. Overall, the present study contributes to both the academic literature and corporate governance, highlighting the importance of banks' business strategy on climate change risks and opportunities with respect to environmental performance goals.

This study contributes simultaneously to research on women board members and competitive dynamics by investigating two unresolved research questions: What is the effect of female directors on the firm's competitive repertoire? Under what conditions is this effect more pronounced? Leveraging the "Awareness-Motivation-Capability" (AMC) framework, we predict that having women on the board of directors should impact the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of the firm's competitive moves. Relying upon a sample of U.S. pharmaceutical firms for the years 2000 to 2017, we find that adding female directors on the board positively affects the complexity and volume of a firm's competitive moves, but negatively impacts the heterogeneity of competitive actions. In addition, the presence of a female CEO moderates these effects, leading to more complex competitive actions and increased volume. Thus, our study lends a greater understanding of how female board members influence competitive dynamics and shape the strategic direction of the firm. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This paper examines the effect of Board of Directors' (BD') roles and composition on exploratory, exploitative and ambidextrous innovations. A quantitative research was operated on Tunisian listed companies. Semistructured interviews were also realised with directors of these firms to discuss the findings. Results of the multiple regression analysis conducted indicate that BD' service role positively influences exploratory, exploitative and ambidextrous innovations. These types of innovation are negatively linked to BD' control role and not significantly associated with BD' strategy role, board independence and gender diversity. This paper sheds light on an innovative and unexplored topic in the literature, as prior studies focused on the effect of BD on innovation rather than on innovation types or even on ambidextrous innovation. This study provides interesting insights for firms that seek to improve their corporate governance. It highlights the BD' key attributes that firms must focus on to innovate.

Business-as-usual is likely to drive us to an unsustainable world. To solve the problems human industrial activity has created, such as climate change, species extinction, and biodiversity loss, business leaders (CEOs, top managers, and boards of directors) must be central to the solution for corporate sustainability. In particular, "heroic" leaders are needed to transform their companies into business beyond usual. In this essay, we briefly outline what researchers already know about microfoundational or socio-cognitive and motivational underpinnings of leaders that affect corporate sustainability. However, gaps remain in our understanding of affective drivers and values of leaders. We question whether microfoundations research has the potential to understand true business transformation for positive deviance and suggest that positive organizational scholarship and research on sustainability change agents can provide insights. We next highlight how empirical and research design shortcomings might be addressed. Finally, we discuss how to identify, develop, and empower leaders with transformational potential so that we can proactively create heroic leaders rather than wait for them to magically appear.

Research Summary: Director retention is a common practice during acquisitions, whereby the acquiring firm adds at least one director from the target onto its board. Despite the regularity of the phenomenon, little is understood about the post-acquisition financial implications of director retention. In this exploratory study, we investigate the financial impact (via long-term investor value appropriation) of director retention in a sample of acquisitions among publicly traded firms. Our empirical analyses consistently illustrate negative financial ramifications of director retention for the acquiring firm across multiple analytic models, time horizons of performance, and samples. We delineate implications for research on boards of directors and acquisitions, and we offer preliminary theoretical logic and empirical analyses for future scholarship to elucidate the mechanisms driving antecedents and outcomes of director retention. Managerial Summary: Despite the prevalence of director retention--a practice where an acquirer adds at least one director from the target onto the board of the ongoing firm--research on the topic is equivocal about the financial implications of this practice. We argue this is a crucial oversight because new directors can have an incredible influence on the trajectory of the firm and its subsequent performance, a fact that is particularly true in the turbulent post-acquisition period. In our study, we empirically examine the impact of director retention on post-acquisition performance. Across multiple analyses and time intervals of performance, we consistently find that director retention is negatively associated with the performance of the acquiring firm. Accordingly, our findings suggest that acquirers should generally approach direction retention with caution. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Building on the argument that corporate boards are responsible for the creation and leveraging of a firm's intellectual capital (IC), this study empirically examines the relation between boardroom characteristics--namely board size, director independence, leadership structure and gender diversity--and IC efficiency. Additionally, we propose that the family firm (FF) status is a specific condition that moderates the effect of board features on IC efficiency. We test the above propositions using data on 113 nonfinancial firms continuously listed on the Italian stock exchange over the period 2011-2016. The empirical results indicate that (1) IC efficiency is significantly lower in FFs, which challenges previous research claiming that FFs have some performance advantages over non-FFs and (2) that board size and director independence have an opposite effect in FFs and non-FFs (positive and negative, respectively), suggesting that the role of individual board mechanisms as drivers of (or brakes on) IC efficiency is contingent on firm characteristics. This paper extends the empirical literature supporting the link between board composition and IC efficiency, which has been scant and inconclusive. Furthermore, the literature has seldom considered the firm contingencies potentially affecting this relation. Regarding practical implications, our findings indicate that there is no one best way of structuring corporate boards that can fit all firm conditions; specifically, the results call into question conventional 'best practices' of board composition that emphasise director independence, suggesting that this governance mechanism may not have a consistent effect on organisational outcomes such as IC efficiency.

Financial corruption has an extensive adverse impact on corporate stakeholders. Over the last two decades, numerous prescriptions have been offered to improve the governance of US public firms, yet financial corruption is still prevalent. Board of directors' audit committees are typically charged with the responsibility of assuring that the corporation's financial reports satisfy the criterion of accuracy. We propose that a quad-qualified audit committee director can serve as an exemplar corporate overseer of financial reporting and minimize the likelihood of corruption. We predict that by having the qualifications of independence, directorship experience and financial expertise, bandwidth, and stock ownership, the effectiveness of monitoring financial reporting by such a director will be considerably enhanced, thus complementing the benefits of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) enacted in 2002. To test our predictions, we employed a time-lagged, matched-pairs sample of 328 large US corporations (164 financially corrupt firms plus a comparison group of 164 compliant firms). Controlling for covariates, we found that the presence of a quad-qualified audit committee director reduced the likelihood of financial corruption in a public firm by 72%. Combined with the benefits from SOX, having at least one quad-qualified audit committee director decreased the probability of financial corruption by 92%. Our results also show that having just one quad-qualified audit committee director is more effective than the combination of the individual qualifications dispersed among the committee members.

In their pursuit to garner resources and support for their IPO, the issuing firms prepare well on all fronts. Corporate governance, specifically board structures, is a critical issue that affects the decision quality and also influences the investors' psyche. Building on theories of agency, resource dependency and signaling, this article attempts to study the effects of presence of foreign directors on firm-specific and board-related characteristics of IPO issuing firms. Adding to the scant literature on national diversity, this study concludes that foreign directors do signal a firm's intent of internationalization and contribute to strengthening corporate governance but national diversity does not translate into IPO returns. Exploring a sample of Indian IPOs issued from April 2001 to March 2017, this study finds that presence of foreign directors on the boards brings about differences in governance mechanisms wherein internationalized boards were found to be stronger on governance front. Larger boards, more committees, less number of related directors, better board interlocking were the benefits that manifested from presence of foreign board members. Issue size and issue price of shares at the time of IPO are found to be significantly higher for firms with foreign directors on their boards reflecting better acceptance among the investors.

Research Summary: Boards are unlikely to be effective if they do not have sufficient collective expertise to understand, monitor, and address future risks. This begs the question, does the board, in fact, have this expertise? If not, can they reconfigure their expertise to address those risks? Building on agency theory, we analyze the alignment between the board's expertise and the firm's future risks, with the expectation that board composition will change over time to reflect the firm's future risks--strategic reconfiguration. Our results show that misalignment has negative implications for firm performance, misalignment also motivates appropriate board reconfiguration, and that this reconfiguration positively effects firm performance. Managerial Summary: Our study illustrates the need for board expertise to be aligned with firm risks. While there has been increasing pressure for firms to assess their directors' expertise (i.e., skill matrices), simply identifying expertise which is present or absent does not speak to whether that expertise is actually needed (or not) by the firm given the risks faced. We analyze boards' collective expertise, compare that with the risks that firms are facing, and identify the gaps which may detrimentally impact the monitoring ability of the board and cause firm performance to suffer. Consequently, understanding the degree of (mis)alignment is of paramount importance for boards to be effective monitors and positively influence firm performance. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Ownership concentration remains a salient institutional feature among public listed firms in emerging and transitional economies. This study examines how a listed firm's ownership concentration interacts with its governance mechanisms in shaping corporate R&D investments. By analyzing panel data of Chinese listed firms between 2010 and 2012, I have three core findings. First, ownership concentration by the largest controlling shareholder negatively affects a firm's R&D intensity, but a small team of shareholders' ownership concentration plays a positive role. Second, a firm's monitoring mechanisms (measured by its sizes of the board and independent directors) and CEO stockholding positively affect the firm's R&D input. Third, CEO stockholding's positive role in promoting firm R&D is stronger in the firms with a more dispersed ownership structure. This study discloses the ways ownership concentration influences corporate governance and, in turn, affects corporate innovation. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Studies on demand side mechanisms related to experience goods argue that demand is driven by recommendation and reputation. In an auditing context, research showed that both of these mechanisms play an important role in determining partner selection, however, only when the mechanisms are observed in isolation. On this basis, this study raises a concern about whether the mechanisms are mutually exclusive, and if not, how does recommendation and reputation in auditor selection context create an interplay in the process of auditor selection. We test our hypotheses on network data of Danish public companies. Findings from the social network study indicate that auditor selection is a sensitive and complex task for boards of directors, as it is not only driven by either of the mechanisms. Rather, partner selection is driven by the combination of both recommendation and reputation, which creates the interplay and, thus, indicates that the demand mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and should not be observed in isolation of one another.

The continuous escalation in cybersecurity risk and the frequency of operational IT failures have drawn attention to the importance of the board of directors' monitoring function and responsibility for maximizing IT value-protection. In response, boards have sought to enhance their IT competence levels. We assert that, while higher board IT competence has positive implications in IT value-creation, it could have a negative implication in the IT value-protection context. When firms have a more IT competent board, equity investors' ex-ante expectations of superior oversight of IT by the board are baked into those firms' equity prices. When such firms experience operational IT failures, investors would view their boards as relatively ineffective in IT oversight and adjust more sharply the ex-ante expectations built into equity prices. Using agency-theoretic arguments, we develop this reasoning into a hypothesis that board IT competence is negatively associated with firm market performance post operational IT failures. Our analysis of 107 operational IT failures in public U.S. firms provides support for this hypothesis, even after we address the potential endogeneity of board IT competence. (c) 2021

Scholars endorsing the embeddedness outlook call for directors' greater engagement in the strategic management process. In contrast, scholars endorsing the control outlook argue that directors should focus on fulfilling their fiduciary duty of supervising top executives. Based on the behavioral-agency theory, this paper outlines a conduct outlook on boards. Recognizing the benefits of directors' participation in the strategic management process, we hypothesize that it may boost directors' satisfaction with firm's performance, strategic planning, and strategy. This could lead to cognitive entrenchment and spur inertial tendencies. Structural equations modeling analysis of the data from a survey of 367 Canadian directors supports the hypotheses. These findings add knowledge to latest research on the advantages vs. disadvantages of activist boards. (c) 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Every year, companies spend billions of dollars in board time and headhunter fees on CEO searches. In fact, by many accounts, the selection of the next CEO is the single most important task of the board of directors. Yet, despite the huge amount of time, money, and attention given to the task, many CEO changes fail, with disastrous consequences for all concerned.With so much at stake, it is natural to ask what companies and their boards can do to increase the odds of success. Illustrated with an abundance of real-life examples from interviews with CEOs, C-suite members, members of the boards, and headhunters supporting CEO searches, The Next CEO explains how boards can improve the odds of success with CEO succession by identifying clear CEO mandates and associated CEO profiles and by selecting CEOs that are fi t for purpose. It further explains how the CEOs of leading corporations effectively take charge and create results, providing a roadmap for incoming CEOs. These ideas are brought to life with case studies and interviews with well-known corporations such as ABB, Alibaba, Freudenberg, GE, Google, HNA, HP, Microsoft, Nestle, Nike, Nokia, Novartis, Roche, Sony, Tata, and Zurich Insurance.

Purpose: Several empirical attempts have investigated boardroom processes and their impact on the governing team decision-making. Such attempts, however, have derived in inchoate results opening new methodological debates and leaving the underlying patterns of board processes obscure. This paper aims to shed light on these patterns by empirically examining the interrelation among the three central constructs involved in board decision-making: know-how, demographic diversity and directors' social interactions. Design/methodology/approach: A framework of interrelation among know-how, demographic diversity and social interactions was conceptually built and empirically validated with partial least squares structural equation modelling applied to archival data from a sample of 87 boards of directors of Spanish, German and UK listed companies. Findings: Results unmask the intricacies of behavioural processes involved in know-how-demography relation: demographic diversity contribution to know-how is totally and positively mediated by directors' social interactions. This reveals the power of directors' socialization frequency in determining processes and predicting know-how. Practical implications: The paper offers a new pathway to manage board know-how and to make board diversity effective. It also opens a door to an innovative empirical methodology to make board processes emerge, one that overcomes methodological limitations of previous efforts. Originality/value: This is so far the only study that examines and measures holistically the structural interrelation among the three central constructs determining board decisions and performance: know-how, diversity and social interactions.

Integrating theoretical perspectives on tokenism and perceived preferential selection, we explore whether the relationship between chief executive officers' (CEOs') external board memberships and CEO compensation is gendered. Based on recent pressures to diversify corporate boards, we theorize that female CEOs' memberships on external boards will result in less monetary compensation relative to male CEOs due to concerns of organizational decision-makers that female CEOs generally inhabit token or "symbolic" positions of limited value. Additionally, we present competing hypotheses (i.e., mitigation vs. exacerbation) regarding how this devaluation will be affected by female representation on the board of directors and compensation committee, respectively. Using a panel sample of 12,464 firm-year observations comprising of 1,805 unique firms and 2,782 unique CEOs, the relationship between CEO external board memberships and compensation is indeed weaker for female compared to male CEOs. Furthermore, this devaluation primarily occurred in organizations where there was stronger (vs. weaker) female representation on the board of directors or compensation committee. However, supplemental analyses revealed that this differential devaluation was mitigated when female executives on the board held greater power (i.e., chaired important committees), highlighting the importance of moving beyond mere representation to ensuring influence on boards for female directors.

This study investigates how firm structure, chief executive officer (CEO) power, and federal legislation influence hiring of corporate directors from a diverse background. Combining the value-in-diversity hypothesis and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the impact of economically rational (i.e., business need) and social preference (i.e., similar-to-me bias) drivers of board diversity post-the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms from an eight-year period spanning SOX, we find that SOX is positively correlated with board diversity. Although SOX was not intended to increase board diversity, the changes it put in place have subsequently facilitated more board diversity. Results show that the economically rational predictor (firm operational complexity) had a positive and statistically significant effect on board diversity pre-SOX but that effect disappeared post-SOX. Meanwhile, CEO power, a social preference inhibitor of board diversity, had a negative and statistically significant relationship with board diversity pre-SOX which also disappeared post-SOX. It appears that SOX has mitigated both economically rational drivers to want more diversity as well as social preference drivers to want less diversity. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The goal of corporate spin-offs, as a corporate restructuring technique, is to create better value for both the divesting firm and its subsidiary/division. These corporate transactions lead to the creation of independent, publicly traded entities, which are called spun-off subsidiaries. In this study, we examine the effect of board independence and directors' industry experience on the market performance of spun-off subsidiaries by setting two main hypotheses. Our sample includes 123 completed U.S.-based spin-off events during a 14-year long time frame. According to our empirical analysis, we find support for both hypotheses, which appear to be significant and positive. In addition, our moderation analysis shows that the interaction effect of directors' industry experience and board ownership is positive and significant. Based on the arguments of agency and resource dependence theories, this study contributes to the governance literature by proving the significant importance of board of directors (namely, their independence and industry experience) on the market performance of spun-off subsidiaries after being separated from their corporate parents. From the managerial contributions aspect, this study tells us that if the board is independent and includes directors with the same industry experience, these spun-off subsidiaries will experience positive change in their market performance. Our interaction effect also shows that if board members are offered more shares on the top of their industry experience, the change in market performance will be stronger.

The social entrepreneurship literature increasingly acknowledges that the board of directors is of major importance in dealing with the multiple goal pursuit of social enterprises. Using a team production perspective, we study the relationship between stakeholder knowledge in the board and the engagement of the board in counseling and decision-making (i.e., board service performance) and subsequent organizational performance. The results of our study, using a sample of Flemish social enterprises, reveal that board stakeholder knowledge is positively related to board service performance. This relationship is moderated by board behavioral integration, which is strengthening the relationship in case of high stakeholder knowledge. Finally, while board service performance is positively related to social performance and, specifically, the social goal of hiring disadvantaged people, it is not significantly related to financial performance.

We attempt to bring clarity to the concept of strategic leadership and guide its development by reviewing and synthesizing the existing management literature on how top managers and board directors influence organizations. We propose a new definition of strategic leadership and offer a framework organized around the essential questions of what strategic leadership is, what strategic leaders do, why they do it, and how they do it. To answer these questions, we organize our review around the eight functions strategic leaders serve, the key attributes of strategic leaders, the theories scholars have used to relate these functions and attributes to outcomes, contextual factors, and the organizational outcomes that strategic leaders affect. We identify how strategic leadership research is concentrated in five streams that rarely interact with each other, and offer suggestions for connecting these streams. Our review provides a big picture of what is known about individuals at the top levels of organizations and highlights the key areas where future investigation is essential. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We examine how gender diversity on boards of directors affects investment in research and development (R&D), thereby providing the platform for future ambidexterity of the organization. Using quantitative data from 44 countries, that are exemplified by qualitative data, our findings show that gender diverse boards result in more complex organizational outcomes in regard to R&D investment than assumed originally. Our findings show that gender diverse boards encourage ambidexterity. On the one hand, increased gender diversity has a negative direct effect on R&D. However by positively affecting equity based remuneration, these diversified boards actually encourage indirectly higher R&D investments that are better correlated with the organization goals. Gender diversity on boards, therefore, encourages organizational behavior that increases the chances for higher ambidexterity over time by encouraging exploitative behavior as well as explorative behavior.

Given the mixed evidence that having both women and men in the top management team (TMT) or in the board of directors (BOD) has a significant influence on organizational innovation, we resolve this issue by conceptualizing TMT-BOD gender diversity as part of a multiteam system, that has joint effects which impact organizational innovation. Evidence from the study of both Chinese firms and UK firms confirm our conceptualization by showing an interaction effect between TMT gender diversity and BOD gender diversity such that innovation is greatest when both are high. The positive TMT-BOD gender diversity interaction effect on innovation improves subsequent firm performance particularly in dynamic environments. The findings refine current thinking by going beyond research that tests intra-team TMT or BOD diversity independently and instead considers inter-team diversity across both leadership teams within the strategic leadership upper echelons. In sum, findings show that high levels of TMT and BOD gender diversity result in more organizational innovation, which ultimately improves firm performance. We offer implications for women's inclusion in leadership as well as for research on the upper echelons. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Female representation on boards is perhaps one of the most studied topics in board-governance research. At the same time, much is unknown about female directors' task engagement within boards. Drawing from psychological theory on societal gender beliefs, our study tests whether the impact of director gender on supervisory task engagement hinges on status dynamics in two relational interfaces: the director-board interface and the director-CEO interface. According to this perspective, female directors show less task engagement because gender is a diffuse status cue that creates status differentiation within the director-board interface. Multi-source board survey data (n = 61 boards, n = 315 directors) confirms that, within the confines of the boardroom, female directors do, indeed, receive lower-status ratings than male directors. This effect is weaker when boards have a female chair. Furthermore, lower status explains perceived lower task engagement of female directors, but this link critically hinges on the CEO-director interface. The impact of status differences is more pronounced when directors intersect with a relatively dominant CEO. All in all, the results demonstrate that relational interfaces play a key role for female directors' task engagement in their board duties. (c) 2021 The Author(s)

The behavioral theory of corporate governance is employed to investigate the relationship between managerial entrenchment and corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement. Effective corporate governance is argued to reduce managerial entrenchment, thereby increasing CSR engagement. The role of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) is investigated as a moderating variable in this relationship, such that high levels of EPU will increase the impact of entrenchment on CSR engagement. These arguments are supported using a panel of 386 US firms from 2011 to 2018 representing 3,088 firm-year observations in a variety of industries. In supplementary analysis, the CSR measure is disaggregated in order to provide further insight regarding these relationships as they pertain to the individual CSR dimensions under study. Findings inform research regarding the entrenchment-CSR link in particular environmental contexts. Practical implications include potential governance guidelines for boards of directors; stakeholder management given the policy environment; and the impact of government decisions as they affect policy uncertainty, firm actions, and CSR engagement.

We examine the relationship between board of director committees tasked with risk management and environmental performance, based on a sample of 1466 firm-year observations from 2007 to 2015. We find that the presence of board committees dedicated only to risk management is associated with better environmental performance. The human capital of risk committees (measured by board tenure, committee tenure, experience, and qualifications) is also positively related to environmental performance. Our findings suggest that the benefits of risk management committees extend to non-financial matters, such as environmental performance. Our findings further suggest that environmental performance is now managed through the regular governance mechanisms within firms. This supports the notion that environmental performance is managed for economic reasons and for the benefit of investors, rather than for the aggrandisement of individual managers. Our findings should be of interest to boards, CEOs, and CFOs who are interested in risk management, as well as to investors, lenders, and auditors who are interested in assessing risk.

This study extends research on the board nationality and gender diversity to a new, unchartered, methodological territory of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). QCA is based on Boolean algebra and facilitates the application of set-theoretic reasoning to the data analysis. This work adds to the repository of academic studies, which put forward a 'business case' for the board nationality and gender diversity in terms of their positive impact on the board outcomes. Based on the upper echelons theory and the 'value-in-diversity' proposition, we assess the influence of board nationality and gender diversity on board commitment, which is measured with two proxies: the annual number of board meetings and board evaluation. The findings indicate that both board nationality and gender diversity are part of the intermediate solutions for the outcome variable. The impact of both variables on board commitment is typically detected in large firms that are internationalised but not product-diversified, the boards of which tend to be small. These results confirm that the increasing emphasis on ensuring significant board nationality/ethnic and gender diversity in board composition within the regulatory documents on corporate governance represents a step in the right direction.

This paper is an attempt to empirically examine the influence of corporate governance on zombie theory. Recent data indicates that the problem affects more than 10% of all firms and is worth close to a billion Euros in the European Union. It is thus an important problem worth analysing in European countries, and Spain is one of the worst affected. The sample studied here thus consists of Spanish companies with negative equity over the five business years from 2013 to 2017. The analysis focuses on establishing how corporate government aspects-board size, dedication to board meetings, concentration of ownership, owners and gender of the CEO-, affect the severity of extreme zombie firms. It uses the amount and temporality dimensions of EZIndex. The results confirm that internal dimensions such as corporate governance are important aspects to be introduced into zombie analysis. To control zombiness our results suggest structuring boards of directors with more than one member, CEOs with non-exclusive dedication, non-concentrated ownership and female CEOs. We also find that all these factors affect both amount and temporality, so factors do not affect zombie companies partially but totally. The contributions of the paper are twofold: first it includes corporate governance factors as a relevant approach for understanding zombie theory; and second, it encourages companies to manage risk-taking decisions efficiently so as to avoid the proliferation of zombies.

The social construction of gender has led to differences in beliefs, knowledge, experiences, or networks between women and men. Some argue that mixed gender teams can show perform better. However, empirical research at the firm level has provided mixed evidence. Moreover, these studies mainly focus on the board of directors or top management teams. Few have examined how middle management and staff levels affect firm performance. These levels form the operational layers that execute the business strategy and run daily operations. Using a unique dataset of 159 large French firms, we find that gender diversity at the two organisational levels positively impacts a firm's economic performance and contributes to its competitiveness. Gender diversity at these levels is a strategic resource that provides a sustainable competitive advantage by creating value and cannot be easily imitated by competitors quickly. We also find a nonlinear relationship due to a threshold effect related to a critical mass condition, and a hat-shaped relationship (two flat borders around the top) between gender diversity and firm performance. Specifically, firms with balanced diversity (between 40 and 60% women as employees) at the middle management and staff levels tend to be more profitable. Finally, predominantly male firms have similar performance to predominantly female firms, and that balanced-gender diversity is the real contributing factor to firm performance.

This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of existing international accounting and finance research on the structure, characteristics, and diversity of corporate boards (SCDBs), as well as their effects on the corresponding corporate outcomes. Emphasis is particularly placed on synthesising and expanding current knowledge from both theoretical (i.e., economic and governance, regulatory, resource-oriented, and psychological/sociological) and empirical (i.e., multi-level antecedents of SCDBs and various themes of SCDB-related corporate outcomes) perspectives. Adopting the SLR method, we review 511 articles from 69 journals between the years 1973 and 2020. Our main findings are as follows. First, the majority of the papers in our SLR are descriptive in nature and/or use a single traditional theory (e.g., agency theory), rather than adopting an integrated multi-theoretical approach. Second, studies on the determinants or antecedents of SCDBs are scarce and have tended to focus on firm- and board-level issues rather than on institutional- and individual-level issues. Third, given the absence of cross-country, mixed-methods, and qualitative investigations, current articles in our SLR suffer from methodological constraints, such as inconsistent definition and measurement, insufficient variables, and repetitive quantitative research methods. Finally, opportunities and a future research agenda are explored and outlined. (c) 2022 The Authors

We examine the minutes of Indian banks' board meetings and offer insights into the issues tabled and discussed in bank boards. We find that risk issues account for only 10% of the issues tabled with regulation and compliance accounting for the most (41%), followed by business strategy (31%). Majority of the issues are not deliberated in detail. We interpret the evidence as suggestive of under-investment in risk and over-investment in regulation and compliance by bank boards. (c) 2022

Corporate governance has received substantial scholarly attention for decades, although the focus of this research has by and large been on publicly traded for-profit organizations. However, agency problems are increasingly recognized in nonprofits. As such, we examine the application of corporate governance logic in the context of nonprofits. Our study relies on nearly a decade of data spanning 6853 US-based charities and comprising nearly US$346 billion in total revenue. Our results show that common corporate governance practices--such as independent boards, chief executive officer oversight, and transparency--enhance the degree to which donor contributions are allocated toward a charity's mission. Overall, we assess the broader applicability and benefits of corporate governance and build on literature highlighting links between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In doing so, we demonstrate the usefulness of governance in this economically and socially consequential context. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential influence of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms on audit risk in Tunisian companies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of Tunisian non-financial firms listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange (TSE) over the periods 2005 to 2010 (pre- 2011 revolution) and 2011 to 2017 (post -2011 revolution), consisting of 371 observations for the whole period, the authors apply the generalized least square (GLS) to test the research hypotheses and model. Findings: The results are consistent with the agency theory suggesting that efficient corporate governance is able to control and reduce a company's agency problem. Evidence reveals that the effectiveness of the director's board/ownership structure and audit quality have the most influence on audit risk before than after the 2011 revolution, although governance mechanisms should play a more active role in encouraging companies to be more transparent in the post-revolution period. Moreover these findings are confirmed when identifying a composite measure of corporate governance. Practical implications: Significant implications are provided for analysts, investors, regulators and academics. First, findings can help Tunisian regulators determine corporate governance disclosure requirements. Second, this research will make investors and stakeholders aware of the fact that minimizing auditor risk will be effective in reducing agency problems in emerging markets like Tunisia. Then, this work can help researchers better understand and realize the corporate governance role in the quality of audit process and financial statements and encourage them to deeply and broadly investigate this issue on other emerging markets. Originality/value: This study stands for an extension of the existing research on corporate governance and audit risk. It fills a research gap in the local context. In fact, the considered data are those of the pre- and post-revolution Tunisian market, mainly in periods of instability. Although emerging markets make up the vast majority of economic activity around the world, they have received limited attention in academic research. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines whether board attributes determine firms' exchange rate risk by influencing their hedging activities. Prior literature demonstrates that strong corporate governance encourages value-enhancing hedging, but the effects of firm-level governance such as board structure on the level of firms' risk exposure have rarely been investigated. By analyzing a sample of firms in 10 emerging markets during 2011-2019, I investigate the effects of board attributes--such as size, leadership, independence, and gender diversity--on firms' exchange rate risk. This study provides the first evidence that firms with larger boards and higher board independence face lower exchange rate risk due to more efficient hedging. Moreover, firms with gender-diverse boards become more effective in hedging and face lower exposure when board independence is higher. The findings signify that better monitoring by the board of directors over managers makes hedging more effective, resulting in lower exchange rate risk. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Research on the outcomes of shareholder activism has gained momentum among management scholars in recent years. However, studies focusing on the way shareholder activists affect top managers' cognition are still in its infancy. Thus, this study examines the relationship between shareholder activism and chief executive officers' (CEOs') future focus on the basis of signaling theory. By applying a contingency view and considering various characteristics of proposals by activists as pivotal moderators, it intends to reveal the conditions under which activists stimulate CEOs' future focus. Empirical analyses not only confirm that shareholder activism shapes CEOs' future focus but also reveal that this effect is stronger when shareholder proposals are written in an analytical and powerful tone, contain more adverbs and verbs, and trigger CEOs' cognition by highlighting negativity. Conversely, more self-related proposals reduce activists' positive impact. Supplemental analyses indicate that the relationship between shareholder activism and CEOs' future focus may vary under the different characteristics of the boards of directors. Generally, the study provides an innovative and more 'humanized' perspective on the literature being among the first to examine the impact of shareholder activism on CEOs' future focus based on signaling theory. By exploring communication characteristics, the study also applies a relatively novel lens in management research. Moreover, it offers valuable practical implications for shareholders (proposals as effective means to increase interest alignment between shareholders and top-level executives), CEOs (proposals as an impetus to become more aware of future events), and boards of directors (proposals as an important governance tool).

The boards of directors of state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea is the subject of this research. These boards have not received significant attention in previous studies, despite their distinctive features and control role. The focus is on gender diversity with reference to task-related variables such as insider/outsider, tenure, and occupation. The extent of the board's monitoring was measured following the rates of revision and rejection of management plans in the board's minutes. The idea is to assess decision-making as a measure of the effectiveness of the boards. Based on longitudinal data on state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea, gender diversity was positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. Understanding of the positive impact of gender diversity was enhanced with the inclusion of task-related diversity variables in the model. Tenure and occupation diversity were positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. It is proposed that the various diversity factors specific to organizational context be examined to improve understanding of diversity. (c) 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Drawing on institutional theory and homophily network theory, we argue theoretically and support empirically that higher economic freedom reduces the board of director diversity. Using a large U.S. sample of 26,142 firm-year pairs for 1996-2015, we find that firms located in the states with higher economic freedom are less likely to foster gender or ethnic diversity on their boards. The results are robust to a battery of variables that capture differences in economic freedom, gender, and ethnic diversity. The results are also robust to various empirical tests, including endogeneity analyses, such as propensity score matching and the instrumental variable approach. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

With the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in company activities, discussions on how to use AI in company management have emerged. Although AI is not legally recognised as a director in company law, there are examples of robot directors such as Vital, which have managed to get a seat in the corporate boardroom. Today, AI is on the verge of playing an important role in corporate governance. However, whether it has a seat on the board of directors or an important role in decision making is still a hot topic. Another critical discussion in the field of corporate governance in recent years is board diversity, which aims to improve the corporate decision-making process and create efficiency. This article attempts to anticipate the potential impact of AI on corporate board diversity policies and regulations. Therefore, this article seeks to examine the effects of the inevitable use of AI in the corporate decision-making process on corporate board gender diversity discussions and regulations under three possibilities: AI as a board member, AI as an enabler to assist a decision maker or AI being used to help decision making such as selecting board members.

In this article we investigate the effect of the presence of women on the board of directors and in executive positions on the risk and profitability of75 banks in ten ASEAN countries during the period of 2002-2018.We find that banks with more women in executive positions show higher capital risk, i.e., Z-score and capital ratio. However, the women-led banks have higher market to book ratios and they are more profitable in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Furthermore, our findings shed light on the relationship between gender diversity and financial decision-making in the company by highlighting that the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) banks with more executives' women are more risky and have higher profits than the men-led banks. We also find that the proportion of women on the board standing as a director or a chair reduces performance in ROA and ROE. Bank performance measured by market-to-book (PB), is the lowest when there are females on the board. This highlights the gender differences in investment behavior and the women's needs in banks at Asian region. Given that bank performance has a direct effect on the stability of the financial system as well as on economic growth in the country, it is essential for the regulatory authorities to assess variety of sources which can improve performance and governance in (ASEAN) banks.

This study examines the effect of CEO-connected directors on firm value. Empirical analyses are conducted on US firms between 1999 and 2016 using a local supply of directors as an instrumental variable. CEO-connected directors contribute to the firm by resolving information asymmetry. I find that firms with more CEO-connected directors produce more innovative outputs than those with fewer CEO-connected directors. However, such directors exacerbate managerial entrenchment. Hence, it is necessary to establish rules for the board of directors that reflect firm-specific characteristics, such as information transparency.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the potential influence of multiple directorships (MDs) on the firm value of listed firms in Jordan. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 1,067 firm-year observations of Jordanian listed companies from 2010 to 2020, this study applies a pooled ordinary least squares regression model to examine the above-stated relationship. This technique was supported by conducting a generalized method of moments estimation to address the possible occurrence of endogeneity concerns. Findings: The results show a significant negative relationship between MDs and firm performance, thereby supporting the "Busyness Hypothesis", which suggests that directors with MDs are expected to be over-committed, too busy and less vigilant. Thus, their ability to effectively monitor the company management on behalf of the shareholders is quite limited. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study in Jordan, and one of the very rare studies in the Middle Eastern and North African region, to examine the relationship between MDs and firm performance. This study provides important policy and practitioner implications in the field of corporate governance by highlighting the necessity of imposing stricter limits on the number of directorships allowed for board directors. Crucially, the empirical evidence implies that limited directorships ensure that directors are able to fulfil their board responsibilities appropriately, which is significantly associated with the firm value.

This article studies, over the period 2006 to 2019, both the structure and the evolution of corporate networks built on shared board directors between the largest listed firms of three European countries: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. It offers a longitudinal and up-to-date analysis of the state of links between companies through examining interlocking directorates. Contrary to previous studies which have emphasized a decline of interlocks when analyzed at the board director level, we observe relative stability of these networks at the corporate level with a number of connected firms remaining quite stable despite a decline of board ties. As a result, the most central companies remain mainly the same at the national and international level over the considered period. Our findings provide evidence for the resource perspective: access to key resources seemingly pushes firms to continue their network participation despite strengthened national regulations on directors with multiple board seats. This evolution echoes the concept of weak ties of Granovetter (Am J Sociol 78: 360-1380, 1973). Lastly, it is worth noting that it cannot be affirmed that there has been an emergence of a cross-national network which operates to substitute national board ties.

Board director independence is critical to achieving and maintaining control to address the agency theory-based issue of interest misalignment between the principal (the organization) and the executives (agent). However, theoretical and empirical research and strategic risk considerations have brought into question the role or relevance that director independence plays in these control task and agency theory domains. We ask, using a quantitative survey method, whether board activity-based applications of independence may be associated with the service task of the board, namely its resource dependence mission. Our findings suggest that the resource dependence duty of the board may be positively associated with some autonomous activities, and yet other activities might be driven primarily by normative practices. Based on this, we suggest that a theoretical scope beyond and greater than agency theory may be needed when reassessing the role of director independence.

Purpose: This study aims to examine whether the age and tenure of the chair of the board of directors are related to research and development (R&D) investment in China. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses A-share manufacturing firms that traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange between 2009 and 2018. This study uses OLS regressions, controls for self-selection bias, and uses an instrumental variable to alleviate the concern of endogeneity. Findings: This study finds that chair tenure has a negative relationship with R&D investment. This study does not find a significant relationship between chair age and R&D investment. Originality/value: This study contributes to corporate governance and strategic management literature by highlighting chair tenure as a new factor affecting R&D investments. It also adds a significant contribution to the limited literature on the chair's role in strategic decisions. Moreover, companies that are eager to strengthen corporate governance and maintain sustained innovation may reconsider the chair tenure. Given that many proposals for board governance reform explicitly stress the importance of limiting board tenure, this study contributes to policymakers by providing evidence in support of these proposals.

Recently, regulators and investors have shown an increasing interest in the promotion of diversity in the corporate boards of directors. In this paper, we employ data from the Australian bank boards to provide new insights on the diversity-risk nexus, based on a dataset of the Australian banks for the period of 2004 to 2019. We examine board gender diversity from two perspectives across the board and among board leaders. Our results support the context-dependent impact of gender diversity on the board of directors and highlight the beneficial impact on the risk of banks when considering gender diversity and the presence of a dominant gender group in the boardroom.

Research Summary: We investigate the relationship between outside board members (OBMs) and short- versus long-term strategic orientation of new ventures in the startup phase. Owing to their smallness and newness, a short-term orientation may be more desirable. Using a dataset of 170 Belgian new ventures in the startup phase, we find a positive association between the proportion of OBMs and a short- rather than long-term strategic orientation, attributed by our interviewees to concern for firm survival. This association is stronger in new ventures operating in highly competitive environments, and where the founding team performed few pre-startup activities. Greater focus on the short-term may be beneficial in the long run, as a positive association is found between a high relative short-term orientation and ventures' growth. Managerial Summary: New ventures in the startup phase should primarily focus on short-term issues: get a better understanding of who are the customers and try to validate the business model. This article reveals that the board of directors plays a pivotal role in influencing the extent to which startups have a short-term strategic orientation. Specifically, it explains how OBMs provide advice, monitor the startup's progress, and guide entrepreneurs on key short-term priorities. This strategic role of OBMs is more pronounced in new ventures where the entrepreneurial team is less prepared at founding and in firms operating in highly competitive environments. Importantly, our paper provides evidence that a short-term orientation in the startup phase does not jeopardize future venture growth in the scale-up phase. (c) 2022 Strategic Management Society.

This study investigates the relationship between various attributes of boards of directors on bank performance in light of Saudi corporate governance regulations. The data set of this study is extracted from the annual reports of all 12 banks listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) over a period of 10 years from 2009 to 2018. To test the study hypotheses, check the robustness of the results, and address potential endogeneity issues, this study applies different statistical methods, including FGLS, OLS, RE, PLCSE, and 2SLS, using STATA version 17. The results of multivariate analysis show that board size has a significant positive influence only on operational bank performance (ROA). For board composition, the results show that while board independence has a significant negative impact on accounting-based performance (ROA and ROE), it affects positively and significantly the market-based performance (Tobin's Q). Regarding board education, the results indicate that board members with at least a Bachelor's degree have a significant negative impact on ROA and ROE. In contrast, PhD holders on the board have a significant positive impact on ROA and ROE, while Master's holders affect positively and significantly all measures of bank performance. With respect to board diversity, only the CEO nationality has a significant positive effect on ROA and ROE. Board IT experience is found to be significantly and positively associated with ROA and ROE, while board meeting attendance has a significant positive influence only on ROE. These findings have important implications, especially for Saudi regulatory authorities to assess the current practice and compliance with the Saudi corporate governance regulations (SCGRs) and the principles of corporate governance for banks operating in Saudi Arabia (PCGB) regarding board characteristics and provide insights to improve board effectiveness and corporate governance practice in general.

Our study investigates the effects of board acquisition experience on value creation in cross-border acquisitions and the dependence of this relationship on acquirer and target country institutions. We draw on cross-border acquisition research and institution-based corporate governance research to argue that the effect of board acquisition experience depends on the institutional characteristics of the acquirer and target countries and on cultural differences between these two countries. Based on 1775 cross-border acquisitions of U.S. and European acquirers, we show a positive effect of board acquisition experience on the announcement returns of cross-border acquisitions, which is even stronger when the target country's takeover regulations are less friendly and when the target and acquirer countries are culturally more distant.

The objective of this case-based study is to understand how the dyadic interaction between the key governance actors can influence the decision-making aimed at directing and controlling a family firm. The study provides evidence that dyadic interaction at the back stage of the formal governance process can offer a privileged position for the family firm owners who serve on the board, and the non-family member Chair of the Board, to influence decision-making before, after and between board meetings. The cases studied suggest that dyadic interactions can serve as preparation for formal board processes and complement and clarify them, yet they also have the potential to conflict with them. Dyadic interaction is also shown to offer important relational and emotional benefits that may not necessarily be achieved through larger group interaction. The findings suggest that although the actors can self-regulate their behaviour through informal rules, the rules may imperfectly address one risk of dyadic interaction--the reduced cognitive conflict among the board.

Purpose: The relationship between interlocking directorates and firm performance has been increasingly debated, with a focus on whether firm's centrality in interlock networks is associated with performance. The purpose of this study is to examine not only how a firm's position in this network is associated with performance but also how the performance of network partners can impact a firm's performance. This study examines how firms effectively utilise the interlock network to achieve the goal of higher market capitalisation - termed market capitalisation rank (MCR). Design/methodology/approach: The premise of the study is the UK FTSE 350 firms from 2014 to 2018. The paper makes use of a temporal network autocorrelation model to examine how firm characteristics, the structural position in the interlock network and the performance of network partners affect MCR over time. Findings: The analysis indicates that firms with ties (via the interlock network) to firms with high market capitalisation are more likely to enhance their own MCR, highlighting network partners have the opportunity to play a critical role in a firm's dominance strategy to optimise firm value. Originality/value: The value of this research is that it does not only look at the impact of a firm's position in the network on performance, but the impact of the performance of network partners on a firm's market performance as well.

Following its 40th anniversary and more than three decades after its introduction to the strategic management literature, agency theory remains the predominant theory of corporate governance. In this paper, we examine affect, an underexplored dimension in principal-agent relationships. Using the CEO-board of directors relationship as a context, we develop a theoretical lens that explains how interpersonal affect underlying relationships between CEOs and directors of boards shapes behavior in ways that deviate from traditional agency theory predictions. We discuss how the incorporation of an affective perspective advances principal-agent research by revising agency theory's assumptions concerning human nature and behavior and suggesting new research directions. By acknowledging a central role of affect, we connect existing behavioral approaches to organizational agency and advance our understanding of socioemotional foundations of principal-agent tensions, problems, and agency costs.

Research Question/Issue: We contrast the predictions of gender socialization theory and "fem-power washing" (deceptively positioning as a firm promoting female empowerment without any tangible actions) to investigate whether promoting female directors on the board of directors associates with a reduction in the prevalence of firm-level workplace sexual harassment (SH). Research Findings/Insights: We estimate the incidence rate of SH through textual analysis of US employees' job reviews published online during the period 2011-2021. We find that an increase of one female director is associated with a 21.81% decrease in workplace SH and that firms with high board gender diversity synchronize the reduction in SH with improved social policies (e.g., policies to better employee relations, health and safety, or diversity challenges). Our results do not support the fem-power washing theory but rather imply that nominating female directors may have a profound impact on the firm's ethical culture. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study validates the ethical dimension of corporate governance: Nominating female directors impacts a firm harassment culture and, by extension, a firm's ethical and corporate culture. This study adds to the governance literature that debates the merits of board gender diversity by highlighting an oft-ignored channel through which board diversity affects firm value: ethics and corporate culture. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For boards of directors, having more female directors can curb workplace SH, a behavior that is associated with a severe and lasting negative effect on firm value. For practitioners, regulators, and the business community, this study reinforces the merits of aiming towards more gender-balanced boards. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Priorliterature does not provide a clear prediction of how executive confidence affects the degree to which a firm engages in "myopic marketing management," the tendency to decrease current marketing spending to mitigate any potential earnings shortfall. We propose that highly confident CEOs are more likely to cut marketing spending to raise current earnings numbers because they believe in their ability to generate high future firm earnings that can cover the long-term losses arising from their current short-term actions. The effect is heightened when the board of directors is more independent and monitors more, but attenuated if CMOs are more confident and thus are better able to convince their CEOs and boards of directors to support continued investments in marketing. The moderating impact of CMO confidence is proposed to be stronger as the CMO becomes more powerful. Using secondary data from a broad cross-section of firms, we provide robust empirical support for our model. Our results highlight situations in which CMOs need to be wary of cuts to their marketing budget, and also provide a potential mechanism through which marketers can protect their budget in the presence of highly confident CEOs--through their own confidence levels.

This study examines whether and when, in a stigmatized industry, firms' negative publicity can lead to the appointment of their CEOs to the boards of directors of other firms within that sector. Building on research on ingroup identification and on stigma, we propose that within a stigmatized industry, when a firm receives negative publicity, its CEO is more likely to join the board of other firms in the industry, possibly because these other firms interpret the negative publicity as a sign of the social identification of the CEO with the stigmatized industry. We also suggest that this relationship is more likely when the negative publicity reveals information otherwise not available about the CEO. We test our hypotheses using a novel, hand-collected dataset of 408 CEOs in 205 firms in the global arms industry, between 1998 and 2017, and find that within this stigmatized industry, when a firm receives negative publicity, its CEO is more likely to join the board of other firms in the industry, and that lower levels of CEOs' reputational capital and visibility magnify this effect. Our findings advance the conversations in stigma research about upper echelons, highlighting the importance of internal and external actors and of the type of stigma, when investigating the consequences of stigma for upper echelons' careers.

Research question/issue: Corporate governance codes of practice require non-executive directors (NEDs) to challenge and question managers. Prior literature and best practice guidance remain silent on the precise meaning of, and on how directors might execute, "challenge", and how management might respond. We explore the ways in which NEDs challenge, question, and dissent during board meetings, and how managers respond. We observe, audio-record, and video-record three boards during nine board meetings. Our boards are unique in holding part of their meetings in public and part in private. Research findings/insights: Our dataset comprises 418 questions and 510 answers. We develop a typology of NEDs' challenge/questions comprising six categories/48 subcategories and managers' responses/answers comprising eight categories/69 subcategories. Our findings support the assertion that NEDs may be reluctant to offer moderate (i.e., constructive) challenge in public. We find significant differences between the level of dissent and the types of answers offered in public versus in private. We find an association between the type of question asked and the type of answer provided. Who asks and answers questions varies significantly in public versus in private, as do the questions and answers by each board. Theoretical/academic implications: Our empirical findings suggest board behavior varies in the presence of an audience of stakeholders. In public, boards go through the motions by engaging in the performativity of governance, while more substantive governance occurs in private. Practitioner/policy implications: We show that regulatory calls for robust challenge by NEDs have not been met, at least judging by the three boards in our study. There is a lack of guidance and advice on how NEDs should exercise challenge and how managers might respond. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Boards of directors play a central role in governing corporate strategic change. We systematically review corporate governance research on strategic change published over the past 40 years, differentiating between strategic change types and board characteristics. We identify three developments: a focus on specific strategic change types, board composition and structure, and North American listed firms as a dominant study context. Yet, our analysis of the literature shows that research on board governance of interrelated strategic changes, on different board roles and behaviour, and on the governance of strategic changes across different contexts remains underdeveloped. To address these research gaps, we suggest three future research avenues: (1) examining how boards govern interrelated changes in a strategic change portfolio and its evolution over time; (2) studying the mediating relationship between board governance (particularly different board roles and behaviour), strategic changes, and corresponding outcomes; and (3) gaining a better understanding of the role of context in board governance of interrelated strategic changes. We contribute to corporate governance research by developing a framework that synthesizes extant research on the relationships between different board governance variables and strategic change types, highlights important research gaps, and outlines several future research directions to address these gaps. Our framework and literature overview serve as analytical tools to examine whether boards are well-designed and prepared to govern multiple and interrelated strategic changes. (c) 2022 The Authors.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every boardroom in the world. However, neither the extant leadership literature nor the corporate governance literature offers succinct guidance on what constitutes effective board leadership during such a calamity. To address this theoretical and practical need, we develop a moderated mediation model, in which directive leadership from the board chair promotes competitive simplification at the onset of the crisis, which in turn promotes firm financial performance during the crisis. Using survey responses from 120 directors of U.S. public firms in Spring of 2020, combined with firm-level archival data from multiple sources and time periods, we find support for this mediated relationship--but only if the chair is not CEO. If the chair is CEO, we find no evidence of a positive relationship between directive leadership and either competitive simplification or firm financial performance; rather, we find some evidence of a negative relationship. We explore the implications of these findings for the theory and practice of corporate governance and crisis management. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of managerial myopia on information technology (IT) investment. Specifically, it aims to investigate the influence of chief information officer (CIO) compensation on IT investment and the moderating role of the board monitoring strength on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The study examines a sample of 194 firms listed on US stock exchanges with a CIO position in 2019. The authors employ hierarchical regression analysis to test the hypothesis. Findings: The results show that CIO compensation negatively influences IT investment. Further, even though vigilant board monitoring does not necessarily reduce such opportunistic behaviors, weak board monitoring creates an environment for such actions. Research limitations/implications: First, the cross-sectional data can limit the results' generalizability. Second, the sampling frame is not perfectly random as it consists of firms that have CIO compensation information in the ExecuComp for 2019. Third, we include only two measures of board monitoring strength. Practical implications: Board of directors should wisely select compensation packages' components since equity incentives potentially exacerbate managerial myopia. Moreover, firms may regulate CIOs' investment behaviors through board-level IT governance. Originality/value: This study is one of the few studies that utilize CIO sensitivity to measure CIO compensation. Moreover, by examining the factors affecting IT investment behavior, this study sheds light on CIO incentives' impact on IT investment behaviors. Finally, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate board monitoring's role in the relationship between CIO sensitivity and IT investment intensity.

This study investigates the effect of the Chair-CEO chronological age gap on the performance of commercial banks listed on the London Stock Exchange. We examine either the Chair-CEO generational gap (a minimum age gap of 20 years) or the Chair-CEO age difference (+/- or absolute). We find significant evidence for the hypothesis that the Chair-CEO age dissimilarity is likely to increase bank performance. Additional identification attempts include the use of the 2007-2009 financial crisis as an exogenous shock to monitoring needs. We find that during the crisis, the positive linkage between age difference and bank performance was more intensified. Copyright (c) 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Debates around sound corporate governance in the corporate world have a legal obligation to work on shareholders' dividend and cost-efficiency. The purpose of this study is to investigate the board size with interaction effect of boards' ancestry on shareholders' dividend. Furthermore, the study explores the interaction effect of educational diversity with board size on cost-efficiency. Data analysed in the current study were obtained from the financial reports of 77 firms listed in Karachi stock exchange from 2012 to 2019. A panel regression model based on fixed and random effects was employed on gathered data. Moreover, the moderating effect of board's ancestry and directors' education is investigated through hierarchical regression. Our findings contribute to the previous literature by investigating the impact of corporate governance on shareholder's wealth and cost-efficiency. In addition, the moderating effect of directors' ancestry and education is also examined. The results show that board size has a significant impact on the investor's wealth and cost-efficiency. The interaction effect supports the idea that directors' ancestry in board size enhances shareholders' dividend. Moreover, the board of directors' education also moderates cost-efficiency of firms. The results suggest that the corporate sector of Pakistan must promote the directors' ancestry in developing shareholders' interest. The policymakers must focus on the directors' education to enhance cost-efficiency of a firm to take care of the ultimate consumer. (c) 2022 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

Innovation is a key factor for firms' competitive advantage in the long-term and for their financial success. Scholars highlight the underinvestment problem with respect of R&D investment. This chapter focuses on two relevant variables of corporate governance that influence firms' innovation performance: firm ownership and board of directors. In the first section, the effect of ownership structure on R&D investment is analyzed. More specifically, the chapter will illustrate the effects of family ownership and institutional ownership on innovation investments. The second section explores the main theoretical perspectives investigating the functions of board of directors and the main board tasks. Lastly, three attributes of board structure and their effect on R&D investments are explored. (c) 2022 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

This chapter provides readers some theoretical connections between board busyness and stability of banks. As such, some knowledge about the busyness of the board of directors in the dual banking system (i.e., Islamic versus Conventional banks) will be discussed. This will be followed by the theoretical linkage between Shari'ah governance busyness and banking outcomes. Next, researchers and students will be introduced to some empirical evidence in this field, so that they can better visualise how the theoretical link between board busyness and bank outcomes was empirically examined in academics. Interestingly, this chapter provides researchers and students some good directions for endogeneity problems existing in corporate governance and board busyness research and some suggested methodology that could address such issues.

On the basis of the view that the board's evaluation of the CEO is determined by the board decision-making as a group, we adopt the faultline approach to analyze group dynamics in the board. Faultlines can split a board based on the alignment of multiple attributes of individual directors and potentially create subgroups within the board. In this study, we argue that different types of faultlines have distinct effects on board decision-making. Specifically, we predict that demographic faultlines can increase conflicts among directors, hampering the board's ability to decide on CEO dismissal when firm performance is below the aspiration level. On the other hand, information-based faultlines can facilitate exchange of diverse knowledge and elaboration of alternative perspectives, which can improve the board's ability to dismiss a CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level. Our analysis of S&P 500 boards supports our prediction that board faultlines based on demographic attributes of directors significantly reduce the board's ability to fire the CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level, whereas faultlines based on information-related attributes magnify the board's ability to dismiss a poor-performing CEO. By demonstrating different effects of faultlines based on heterogenous types of director attributes, this study contributes to the board faultline literature. We also contribute to CEO dismissal research by showing how group dynamics of boards moderates the relationship between firm performance and CEO dismissal. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

We analyze the impact of board of directors (BoD) tenure and audit committee (AC) tenure on environmental performance (EP) to test whether BoD and AC members' rotation generates higher environmental performance. Data were collected from the Refinitiv Eikon database, structuring a sample of European Union (EU) listed companies belonging to the "old" country members in the period from 2018 to 2020. We found that longer board tenure and longer audit committee tenure each enhance environmental performance, demonstrating that firms could view the tenure rate as a proxy of the quality of the board monitoring. On the contrary, the interaction term (BoD and AC tenure) is negatively related to environmental performance, showing that when two boards have a low rotation, companies may achieve lower environmental performance. These findings help understand the dynamic and complex nature of tenure in corporate governance mechanisms. (c) 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The present study examines the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance using a panel data sample of the top 73 EU nonfinancial sustainable firms across 13 countries from 2016 to 2020 based on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). We specifically examine the impact of structural (board independence) and demographical (age, gender, education, tenure and industry experience) board diversity on firm performance. Drawing on the agency and resource base perspective, the results indicate that firms with a diverse board of directors (structural and demographic) perform significantly better with firm performance. Additionally, when viewed through the lens of stakeholder theory, the findings indicate that environmental, social and governance disclosure (ESG) moderates and partially mediates the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance. We also performed robust checks to validate our results. Diversity contributes to a firm's understanding of its market and, as a result, its overall performance. The current study demonstrates a considerable gap between the theoretical and empirical support for various board indicators (structural and demographic), their relationship to performance, and how ESG acts as an intervening element in increasing firm financial performance.

We explore the extent to which board political connections shape the firm's disclosure behavior. We focus on the disclosure of non-GAAP earnings measures and argue that board political connections reduce the firm's propensity to report non-GAAP earnings through two mechanisms: the reduction in capital market pressure (insulating effect) and the concerns about public scrutiny (constraining effect). Our theory is tested and supported by an analysis of U.S.-listed firms in the period 2003-2019. We further exploit the variation in firms' media exposure to identify the primary mechanism underlying this disclosure strategy and find that the constraining effect plays a more important role than the insulating effect in driving the financial reporting behavior of politically connected firms.

Meta-analytic results show that board gender diversity is modestly associated with firm performance, but there is notable heterogeneity among findings. Board gender diversity allows access to women's perspectives, potentially helping boards, but diversity can also trigger biases that exclude women directors, such that boards do not integrate meaningful perspectives. Addressing this problem, we leverage the categorization-elaboration model, contact theory, and critical mass theory to build new theory as to how men directors can serve as allies to women directors to better leverage diverse perspectives. We empirically test how considerations that reduce out-group categorization and bias against women moderate the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. Our results show that gender diverse boards perform better with more formal contact among men and women director colleagues, and that gender diverse boards with more men directors who only have prior experience working with token-women, perform worse. Our work helps explain how and why board gender diversity can improve or detract from firm performance. This extends the literature by illustrating the important consequences that occur when firms do (or do not) have men directors who are likely to be allies of gender diversity.

For several decades, the boards of directors have been relatively homogeneous groups consisting of white old men (the so-called 'good-old boys'). This static and apparently immutable feature has been changed recently, as social movements and the evolution of corporate law and good governance codes promoted an increasing diversity in the boardroom. In parallel with the diffusion of more diverse boards, leadership and governance scholars have started to analyze the consequences of board diversity. Based on the idea that members' diversity increases group experiences and viewpoints, most scholars argued that higher board diversity positively affects board decisions and firm outcomes. However, despite the soundness of this perspective and the number of previous studies, the empirical evidence provides only partial, mixed and inconclusive findings. Building on these premises, we did a systematic and interdisciplinary literature review aimed at taking stock of our understanding of board diversity's antecedents and consequences. Our analysis and critical assessment of 184 studies synthesizes major results, identifies main gaps, and highlights important avenues for further research. Finally, we outline several ways to overcome current (theoretical and methodological) barriers and further advance research on board diversity. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Endowed with significant firm-specific knowledge, inside directors can contribute to the decision-making processes of the boardroom. However, regulatory changes, focusing primarily on the monitoring function of the boards, have driven inside directors out of the boardroom. This article argues that suppliers with firm- and industry-specific knowledge are uniquely positioned to fill a critical void in boardrooms. It also suggests that the value of having a supplier on the board (SOTB) is influenced by environmental contingencies faced by a firm: operational efficiency, diversification, and demand uncertainty. Using an objective measure of supplier presence in the boardroom, the authors find that a supplier's presence enhances firm performance. They also find that the value of an SOTB in enhancing performance is greater in firms with lower operational efficiency and higher demand uncertainty and, is lower in firms with higher diversification. These results are robust to potential endogeneity issues, alternative estimation methods, and measures of moderator and outcome variables. (c) 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.

This study examines boardroom connections that form when corporate executives sit on mutual fund boards. These connections have the potential to facilitate information flow that informs fund investment decisions. I find that fund trades in the executive's firm anticipate future earnings news and stock returns during the period that the fund and firm are connected. The evidence is consistent with a broad scope of information being transferred through the connections, implying the potential for these connections to have an economically significant impact. For example, trades in the executive's firm predict returns both inside and outside of the earnings announcement period, and trades in stocks in the same sector as the executive's firm also predict returns. This study highlights the potential for the role of fund directors to extend beyond their formal monitoring responsibilities and act as conduits of information.

Purpose: This study intends to test the relationship between banks' board diversity, detected with age and gender characteristics, and banks' social performance. The resource dependence theory posits that board diversity is a strategic tool able to enrich the board of directors by expanding skills and the number of links with stakeholders, which have a strategic role in achieving a competitive advantage and sustainable goals, especially in the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are tested using a sample of 46 European banks observed from 2009 to 2017. The gender and age diversity data of bank board members are hand-collected from banks' social reports. Findings: The empirical results show that bank social performance is positively influenced by board gender and age diversity. Thus, the human capital determined by a higher bank's board diversity constitutes an essential resource for adopting more sustainable business models. Originality/value: This paper analyses the association between board diversity and social performance, providing empirical evidence for the European banking sector in the period after the 2008 global financial crisis. The banking literature provides scarce evidence on the topic; however, the empirical results claim the strategic importance of the appointment of directors to the banks' boards to balance corporate strategy with social and environmental issues generating a positive impact on sustainable growth.

Recently, many firms that have caused direct pollution to the environment have begun to think about the necessity of environmental management. As buildings have played an important role in environmental issues, the real estate industry can no longer ignore demands for environmental management. Research on environmental management has mainly focused on its financial implications. However, there has been no consensus in the literature about the relationship between environmental management and firm performance. By comparing portfolios of environmentally certified properties of 19 lodging Real Estate Investment Trusts, this study explores the relationship between environmental management and firm performance, while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. The relationship between environmental management and firm performance appeared to have mixed results, but this study found a positive moderating effect of outside board of directors. This study provides new insights into the hospitality and the real estate literature from a corporate governance perspective. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between chair-chief executive officer (CEO) demographic dissimilarities and firm internationalization. Design/methodology/approach: The pooled ordinary least squares regression is used on a sample of listed firms in Malaysia from 2013 to 2017. This study considers three demographic dissimilarities between the chair and CEO, i.e. differences in age, educational background and nationality. Findings: The results reveal that demographic dissimilarities between the chair and CEO, notably differences in nationality, may result in conflicting cognitive styles, which in turn may impede the firms' ability to expand internationally, as compared to differences in age and educational background. The findings demonstrate the deleterious effects of demographic dissimilarity between these two individuals in the highest echelons on the firms' internationalization strategy due to poor communication and lack of ability to cooperate when dissatisfaction and conflicts intensify between these corporate elites. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this paper makes the first attempt to examine the influence of chair-CEO demographic dissimilarities on firm internationalization. Previous studies examining firms' internationalization strategy, for the most part, restricted their scope to either the board members or top management team characteristics, but had largely overlooked the nexus between nonexecutive and executive directors through the chair and CEO. A focus on the demographic dissimilarities between the co-leaders of the firm is essential to improve the understanding of the collaboration and rivalry between them, which may affect board effectiveness and firm internationalization.

Purpose: This study elaborates on the process through which gender-diverse boards of directors increase representation of females in management positions. This study draws on the gender spillover effect to examine whether gender diversity on boards of directors significantly influences the number of women promoted to managerial positions. The authors also employ implicit quota theory to examine the interaction effects of female board directors and their related strategies to target female customers as a source of female talent on the promotion numbers of female managers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw from female manager panel data surveyed and gathered by the Korean Women Development Institute (KWDI), a Korean government-sponsored research institution, for the period 2008-2014. The total sample, comprising 5 biannual waves, includes 906 Korean companies across four wage rates. The authors apply zero-inflated negative binomial regression analyses to examine the effects of gender diversity on board director positions and its interactions with strategies targeting female markets on the number of female managerial promotions. Findings: The authors find that gender diversity on boards of directors is positively related to the number of female managers promoted. Furthermore, in corporations where gender is not relevant to firms' strategy and decision-making, broader gender diversity increases the number of female managers promoted at lower- but not higher-level positions. Originality/value: The current study demonstrates the complex role of gender diversity in board director positions in initiating and promoting the career development of female managers. On the one hand, gender diversity in board director positions has spillover effects on women's representation in management positions. On the other hand, female board directors impede the career progress of senior female managers to maintain their status in quotas when the female market is not critical to firms' competitiveness. Therefore, it is crucial to integrate two different concepts about gender diversity--the gender spillover effect and implicit quota theory--that elaborate on the effects of gender diversity in board director positions on female manager promotion numbers.

Despite increasing attention to gender diversity on corporate boards, we have only limited understanding of what occurs within the boardroom when women are present. Prior empirical research has used various theories to infer how board gender diversity may influence firm outcomes, but without identifying the theoretical mechanisms underlying women directors' influence on the board. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with women and men who have collectively served as directors with over 200 publicly listed companies in the United States and Europe. While prior research has suggested that the diverse cognitive perspectives women directors bring influence board decision-making, our study reveals novel insights as to the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we contribute to the board gender diversity literature with the finding that women behave in ways contrary to existing board norms. By coming to board meetings highly prepared, being willing to acknowledge that they do not know something, asking questions, and getting things on the table, women impact the dialogue and interactions in the boardroom. Thus, our study sheds light on how the presence of women influences board dynamics, which has implications for corporate governance. Our findings also challenge prevailing gender theories as to how women are likely to behave, in that we do not find that women conform to gender stereotypes. Yet, we also find impediments to women directors' ability to gain influence, in that men directors may not always acknowledge them or afford them respect as equal board members.

SOX requires that the audit of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) is "integrated" with the audit of the financial reports, which means the same audit firm conducts these two audits. Prior studies found that audit costs and quality were lower for non-integrated audits in the Chinese context (Gunn et al. in Account Rev, 2021). This paper reports the association between firms' internal corporate governance mechanisms and the decision between integrated and non-integrated audits in Chinese companies. The empirical results demonstrate that firms with a larger proportion of controlling owners or those in which the same person is the BOD chairman and CEO, or those that are state-owned or have a smaller proportion of independent directors, are more likely to choose non-integrated audits than integrated audits. Our study implies that firms with weak internal corporate governance mechanisms choose non-integrated audits or switch to non-integrated ones if integrated audits are not mandatory. Our conclusions provided evidence that helps regulators understand the consequence of the regulation enforcement on public companies with different corporate governance models if these regulation compliance options are available.

Purpose: One of the most active areas of study in the field of corporate governance, board interlocks is a phenomenon that is both pervasive and perplexing. This paper aims to examine and integrate the empirical research on board interlocks to fill the void left by the lack of a recent review. Design/methodology/approach: The bibliometric analysis methodology, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, was used to analyze the board interlocks literature. Eighty publications published since 2000 were chosen as the subject of this research because they reveal the key contributions to the field of board interlocks. Additionally, their clustering pattern is also identified. Findings: The authors classify various studies conducted on board interlocks into three clusters: "Social Capitalization", "Antecedents and Outcomes" and "Corporate Governance". Originality/value: This literature review helps better comprehend the board interlocks literature by pointing out several areas of study that, if pursued, would add to the existing body of knowledge and open future research directions.

Purpose: This study aims to test whether the introduction of a gender quota impacts functioning of boards of directors and internal committees thanks to female capacity in effort norms, cognitive conflicts and use of skills. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a difference-in-differences method to trace the staggered mandatory adoption of gender quotas on boards on Italian listed firms, representing the regulative institution pillar of institutional theory. Findings: This paper find that mandatory adopter firms have more frequent internal committee meetings and less frequent board of directors' meetings after the introduction of the law. This confirms that the regulation re-prioritizes work in internal committees, thanks to women effort, capacity to resolution and use of skills. Originality/value: This research provides empirical evidence on female contribution and on the impact that a specific mandatory regulation, as regulative institutional pillar, can have on board organization, showing how gender characteristics influence board functioning in terms of meetings.

Research summary: Drawing on research about power and faultlines, we identify the subgroup of directors in the board who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup) and develop a concept of CEO subgroup power. We examine how CEO subgroup power affects the board's decision to dismiss the CEO, particularly when the firm experiences a performance decline. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we find that powerful CEO subgroups reduce the risk of CEO dismissal and that the negative effect of CEO subgroup power on CEO dismissal is magnified when the firm experiences a decline in performance. Managerial summary: Why do some boards fire the CEO when the firm is performing well, while others retain the CEO despite poor performance? We believe that looking into power dynamics among directors may help answer this question. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we investigate how the risk of CEO dismissal varies by the power of the subgroup within the board that consists of directors who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup). The results reveal that a powerful CEO subgroup can reduce the CEO dismissal risk and that this effect becomes stronger when the firm goes through a performance decline.

The board of directors' behavioral dynamics can strongly influence an entrepreneurial firm's success. Drawing on the behavioral theory of corporate governance, this study identifies and tests factors that facilitate behavioral integration in boards of high technology start-ups. We unpack the black box of board behavior with primary data collected from a survey-based sample of 149 CEOs of Norwegian high-tech start-ups supplemented by quantitative archival information. We find that intra-board behavioral integration (i.e., board members' propensity to clearly understand one another's issues and needs, actively solve, and share relevant information and resources) is positively affected by greater levels of informal communication between CEOs and board members. Next, we find that inter-board trust (i.e., board members interact with absolute integrity, tell the truth at meetings, trust one another, and keep mutual promises) mediates this relationship such that higher levels of inter-board trust result in greater concordance between information communication frequency and inter-board behavioral integration. We then examine the role of an efficacious board chair who motivates and uses each board member's competence, formulates proposals for decisions and summarizes conclusions after board negotiation, and chairs board discussions without promoting their agenda, finding that efficacious board chair leadership moderates the relationship between informal communication frequency and intra-board trust. We discuss the implications of these findings for the theory and practice. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

The goal of this study is to see how gender diversity on bank boards affects the value and profitability of the company. Financial institutions, both public and private, are examined in the study. Data from 28 Indian banks have been analysed for this study. Panel data analysis has been applied to data collected from 2012 to 2020. Private sector banks' stock values suffer when they have more than one woman on their board of directors; public sector banks' stock values benefit when this occurs. Our research demonstrates that ROA has a negative correlation with the gender diversity of boardrooms. We believe this is the first comparative study of its kind in the banking industry to focus on paper. It is recommended that policymakers increase the number of female board members so that they can serve as effective decision makers to improve the firm's performance.

How private firms can overcome their unique governance challenges remains an important but understudied topic. Using novel data on more than 28,000 private firms in India from 1988 to 2017, we examine whether private firms can improve their survival prospects by having board interlocks with public firms and, specifically, interlocks whereby a public firm director subsequently joins the private firm's board. In our data, we found a U-shaped relationship between the number of incoming board interlocks and the probability of private firm exit. We also found that board interlocks formed by public firm directors of public firms audited by Big Four companies improve private firms' survival more than other interlocks, consistent with the notion that such interlocks improve monitoring at private firms. Overall, our study points toward the importance of considering the role of incoming board interlocks when explaining private firm survival. (c) The Author(s) 2023.

Purpose: This study aims to contribute to the academic disciplines of entrepreneurship and management by developing a new theory that explains Founder-CEOs' succession in family and non-family firms. Many scholars failed to generate a specific theory to describe the succession of Founder-CEOs. Family firms remain complex enterprises comprising interconnectedness of cultural interests in which corporate governance occurs by families, Founder-CEOs and sometimes a board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This study's design/methodology/approach reflects post-modernist epistemological and ontological perspectives for conducting systematic literature reviews. To identify relevant studies in the review, the several databases (Australian Business Dean's Council Journal Quality List; EBSCO Database, including PsycINFO and Psych studies; Web of Science) and a mix of ranked journals from entrepreneurship, management and psychology were used. Findings: The findings and results in this paper reflect the purpose, methodology and literature analysis culminating in 1,582 peer-reviewed studies. A total of 182 peer-reviewed studies met the criterion for review. Throughout the research process, a systematic literature review uncovered management literature gaps overlooked for decades during the theory-building process. Hence, developing a theory of Founder-CEOs succession used a combination of systematic, inductive, comparative and interactive approaches. Originality/value: A Theory of Founder-CEOs Succession explains the strategic process of replacing a founder systematically. The promotion of, and incentives for, internal executives have been topics of great interest and deliberation among scholars and practitioners for a long time. This study contributes research implications for theory building in the academic disciplines of entrepreneurship and management by offering scholars and practitioners a theory that does not exist to describe Founder-CEOs' succession encompassing both strategic successes and failures. By incorporating successes and failures, this study provides realistic reflections of Founder-CEOs. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the thematic content of research addressing the relation between board of directors (BoD) and business transformation (BT) to obtain better understanding of status and to derive future areas of study. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews literature through a bibliometric analysis based on co-occurrence of articles published in Web of Science Core Collection (tm) (WoS) between 1990 and 2022, identifying key concepts, setting network of relations and identifying the strategic importance of clusters of concepts. Findings and implications are discussed, future lines of research are presented and limitations are noted. Findings: Thematic research on boards addressing transformation shifted from the analysis of individuals' traits to an organizational approach with majority of research centered on the role of boards under different theories and the consequences of strategic changes on firm's performance. Further research is around gender diversity, sustainability and the moderating role of ownership structure and business culture. Research limitations/implications: Some limitations are also noted. This analysis considered articles indexed by WoS for Q1+Q2 publications as source of literature, while including others such as Scopus would increase knowledge base. Also, to identify main streams of research, the authors considered keywords with cumulative occurrence spanning from 30% to 40% while increasing this percentage would add terms that might improve precision to the connections among keywords. Other techniques could have been used such as co-citation or bibliographic coupling, although the authors find these as better suited to investigate the basic structure behind the foundational knowledge of the topic while the authors' intention was to understand the positioning of study fields regarding the degree of research progress. Practical implications: This paper presents some practical implications for future researchers. Those who wish to leverage previous evidence to address new research questions might look into principal themes covering BoD dynamics and composition to exert CG, and the relation between strategic decisions and performance measured by different variables. Those who wish to position their research as new findings to shed light on dilemmas, might find opportunities in the fields of climate change-sustainability, R&D for growth and innovation under the perspective of intangible assets. Originality/value: This paper, is the first to the best of the authors' knowledge, to identify research clusters for the intersection of boards and transformation and to determine their stage of development.

Purpose: Based on the agency and resource dependence theories, this study aims to investigate whether nomination committee (NC) characteristics could serve as key attributes for reducing environmental, social and governance (ESG) disputes and whether NC composition affects the appointment of ESG-friendly directors to the board. Design/methodology/approach: This study focuses on a sample of 30 global systemically important banks from 2015 to 2021. The authors estimate panel data models with fixed effects, clustering heteroskedastic standard errors at the bank level to account for the serial correlation of the dependent variables for each bank. Findings: Banks' exposure to ESG controversies can be reduced when NC members have specific skills, in particular when at least one member of this committee also belongs to the sustainability committee and is a foreign director. Moreover, banks' ESG disputes decrease when the NC members are younger, while the share of independent NC members has a negative impact. Finally, a positive influence of NC composition and its members' features as well as the appointment of ESG-friendly directors on the board is found. Originality/value: The findings are particularly useful during periods such as the current one, when there is growing attention to both banks' corporate governance, the subcommittees' role and functioning and social and environmental issues. This study shows that the NC is important in reducing the likelihood of banks incurring ESG disputes and in appointing more ESG-friendly directors. NC effective functioning and its members' qualities serve as a key attribute for fulfilling objective assessment and improving board effectiveness.

This study investigated the diversity of the BOD and explored its impact on corporate governance through quantitative empirical analysis. This study uniquely adopted Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporate Governance 100 Index (TWSE CG 100 Index) as the measurement of corporate governance performance. Five highly related indicators, i.e. gender, independence, education, legal, finance or accounting profession, and seniority to measure board diversity, which could be efficient variables on predicting the firms' likelihood being listed in the TWSE CG 100 Index, were used as independent variables. The results showed that board independence and the seniority of directors have a positive impact on corporate governance. This study made several important contributions. First, this study shed light on the conflicting evidence on the relationship between board diversity and firm corporate governance performance for the Taiwan economy. Second, this paper uniquely adopted TWSE CG 100 Index, and the findings can contribute to giving investors predictions about the quality of corporate governance and can serve as an incentive for corporates to enhance superior corporate governance. Furthermore, this study can contribute to practice by providing optimization suggestions for BOD composition and nomination. At last, this paper demonstrated policy justifications and implications for Taiwan government. (c) 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Research Question/Issue: Information processing, agency, and resource dependence perspectives provide diverging predictions regarding the relationship between board interlocks and firm performance, which are rooted in different perspectives on the roles of boards of directors. This study argues that these various approaches are reconcilable when considering the nature of board committees to which the interlocked directors are assigned. Research Findings/Insights: We test our hypotheses on a sample of 5133 firm-year observations in India. Our analyses support our hypotheses. The results show that interlocks between audit committees, whose primary function relates to providing financial oversight and ensuring compliance, are negatively related to firm performance. In contrast, interlocks between nomination and remuneration committees of Indian firms, which provide them with access to resources such as human capital and information on appropriate incentive structures, are positively related to performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study clarifies the relationship between board committee interlocks and firm performance by taking a multi-theoretical perspective. Our analysis suggests that information processing, agency, and resource dependence theories complement one another in explaining the effect of interlocks on firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that it is not board interlocks per se that are detrimental to firm performance; in fact, appointing well-connected directors with experience in serving on other boards might be beneficial for firms. However, firms should not assign specific monitoring-intensive tasks such as auditing to directors who also serve on other firms' audit committees. Our findings suggest that these directors should have greater independence and focus. (c) 2023 The Authors. Corporate Governance: An International Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose: Are board ties among competitors harmful to customers? The prevalent assumption on board ties among competitors is that they harm customer benefits. This study examines the mechanism by which board ties with competitors result in an outcome conducive to customers. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 79 savings banks in South Korea, we investigate the extent of banks' board ties with other banks and their engagement in a project financing (PF) consortium from 2014 to 2020. The generalised least square was adopted to test the hypotheses. We also performed several supplemental analyses to further support our results. Findings/results: Savings banks with greater board ties with rivals provided more financial opportunities to their customers by forming PF consortia more actively with other banks. Furthermore, the positive impact of board ties on banks' participation in a PF consortium increases, especially when the proportion of external shareholders is smaller or when savings banks are family firms. Practical implications: Outside directors can not only play the role of monitoring the management but also serve as assistants who can help banks provide financial services (or products) that banks could not provide individually. Originality/value: While prior studies have clearly recognised the negative impacts on customers of board-friendship ties among rivals, little attention has been paid to the potential mechanism by which board ties among competing firms can benefit customers. This study challenges the dominant assumption by demonstrating that savings banks with greater board ties with other banks provide more financial opportunities to their economically weak customers. Contribution: Finally, this study contributes to the family business literature by providing insight into how the unique characteristics of family firms in strategic choices make outside directors contribute as assistants than supervisors.

Purpose: Considering corporate governance (CG hereinafter) practices' variety across Anglo-American and European countries, this study relies on contingency and complexity theories to investigate the effect of environmental sustainability performance (ESP hereinafter) on shareholder value under various configurations of board of directors (BoD hereinafter), firm and country characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The author used the Thomson Reuters Environment Pillar Score (ASSET4) and the Total Shareholder Return to assess ESP and shareholder value respectively. The author applied a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA hereinafter) to an unbalanced panel of 2,284 observations from 486 European and Anglo-American non-financial listed firms over the period 2016-2020. Findings: The author found a positive association between ESP and shareholder value and he displayed notable differences between Anglo-American and European economies regarding causal predictors of this positive association. Within European firms operating under civil law code where investor protection is low and family ownership is widespread, ESP creates shareholder value under configurations of causal predictors that significantly differ from those of their Anglo-American peers. The author's findings are robust to different identification strategies. Practical implications: This study assists researchers, practitioners, shareholders and policymakers the significant roles that BoD diversity, organisational and institutional traits are jointly playing as determinants of the ESP-shareholder value relationship. Originality/value: The author's study offers a more encompassing, complete and theoretically richer picture of the key drivers and outcomes of ESP. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research Question/Issue: We approach the ongoing debate in the literature on when and why a female leadership advantage exists in the context of China. In particular, we examine whether female CEOs outperform male CEOs in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Research Findings/Insights: We show that a female leadership advantage exists in SOEs. We find that the female leadership increased performance is attributed to improved profitability, capital structure, and operating efficiency. The magnitude of this gender effect is bigger in central state-owned enterprises (CSOEs) than that in local state-owned enterprises (LSOEs). The results are robust to additional tests that mitigate the sample selection and other endogeneity concerns. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We use the role congruity theory to motivate and develop the hypotheses drawing insights upon the literature in psychology and leadership. Female CEOs are perceived as less congruent with their leadership roles given the gender role stereotypes. Thus, they face more challenges and difficulties than male CEOs. These obstacles take at least two forms which are significant in SOEs: shareholder activism and sex discrimination. Female CEOs have to outperform their male counterparts to alleviate the pressure from shareholder activism and showcase their managerial skills and abilities. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For the state shareholders, the extra scrutiny in selecting female CEOs should be lifted given this outperformance. The evidence is also relevant for CEOs to choose their career paths among different types of firms, for boards of directors on their strategic decisions on CEO hiring, and for policy makers to promote the female leadership advantage.

This paper contributes empirically to the debate on who should nominate new directors: shareholders or the board? While nomination committees composed of incumbent board members are common around the world, the use of nomination committees composed of shareholders (SNBs) is recommended in several Nordic countries. We use the unique case of Finland as a quasi-experiment to examine the relation between the type of nomination procedure and board turnover. We find that firms with SNBs have boards with shorter average tenure, and fewer long-serving directors. We also find evidence suggesting a higher turnover performance sensitivity in the case of SNB firms: the average board tenure is more strongly related to firm performance in the case of SNB firms, and the relation between board tenure and the presence of experienced directors is more related to performance in SNB firms. In all, our results support the claim that SNBs might be useful tools to turn around board structures and tie individual director's performance to company performance.
