Agency theory is employed to formalize the intuitive rationale for the widespread practice of setting up captive finance subsidiaries: reduced agency costs of debt increase the firm's consolidated debt capacity. Of the two Canadian industries tested, firms forming captives had significantly higher use of debt in manufacturing but failed to show any significant difference for merchandising. In light of confounding influences from tax-clientele effects, size difference, and support in tests on U.S. firms, the mixed finding should encourage further testing. The outcome of these tests suggests that it is potentially useful to think of captive finance subsidiaries in light of agency theory.

Agency theory rests on a well-defined relationship between shareholders and managers. That relationship is examined and found to be a poorly denned state-contingent contract. The implications of that finding, and the existence of only a weak market for managers, lead to the conclusion that the traditional assumptions about the rights of shareholders no longer apply and that common stock (ordinary share capital) is obsolete.

Tender offers provide an ideal setting for the analysis of agency relationships since the best interests of the principal (target firm shareholders) and agent (target firm managers) are often in conflict. Moreover, the actions and stated rationale of target managers in resisting or not resisting tender offers are readily observable, and the size of the possible agency costs is great. This research provides direct empirical evidence on the relationship between managerial welfare and takeover bid resistance. Tests on a sample of cash tender offers provide support for the managerial welfare hypothesis. The existence or absence of bid resistance is found to be directly related to the personal wealth changes of the target firm's managers-The relationships between managerial actions and bid premium size, bidder nationality' conglomerate offers, and "ex post settling up" are also examined.

This paper has examined the structure of incentive schemes for divisional managers in a broad agency theory framework. The objective of any incentive scheme must be to reduce principal-agent 'friction'. More specifically, in the divisional case, it should seek to mitigate the divergence of the manager's interest from that of the centre. Such divergence may derive from differences in risk attitudes, and from limited or costly observability of the manager's skill and effort. Incentive schemes also need to take account of the managerial labour market, which has an essentially constraining role on the behaviour of the manager and the centre. The paper has implicitly subscribed to the premise on which all incentive arguments rest: that, in the absence of appropriate pecuniary inducements, managers will not pursue the firm's objective per se, whether it is one of profit maximisation, as assumed in this paper, or other dimensions. This premise has enabled the paper to concentrate on an explanation of many of the variables that enter the utility functions of divisional managers, whilst at the same time being aware that many other variables exist. A fuller specification of these variables provides a natural direction for research. This should lead to a unification of economic and behavioural input to this subject.

Signalling and agency theories appear in the accounting literature to be competing theories. This article demonstrates that they are actually consistent theories, in that one set of sufficient conditions of signalling theory is at least consistent with one set of sufficient conditions of agency theory. Indeed, a considerable overlap exists between the two theories: rational behaviour is common to both; information asymmetry in signalling theory is implied by positive monitoring costs in agency theory; 'quality' in signalling theory can be defined in terms of agency theory variables; and signalling costs are implicit in some bonding devices of agency theory. Examples are given where both theories' predictions about lobbying, accounting choices, and voluntary auditor selection are added together. (c) 1987, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

This paper employs recent developments in agency theory to study the impact that compensation contracts have on portfolio management investment decisions in a restricted mean-variance world. Two types of incentive contracts for mutual fund managers are analyzed and compared. The results show that the "symmetric" contract, while not necessarily eliminating agency costs, dominates the "bonus" contract in aligning the manager's interests with those of the investor.

This is a descriptive study examining the determinants of disclosure for Not-for-Profit Organisations (NFPOs). The hypothesised determinants were identified by a review of the determinants identified in other studies and by reference to agency theory. These were analysed for significance using as dependent variables accounting policies and items of financial disclosure which have been suggested for adoption or disclosure by NFPOs. It was found that six of the hypothesised determinants (gross income, number of members, the presence of a professional administrator, geographic dispersion of members, and auditing of the financial statements) were significant factors influencing disclosure. Nature of the organisation, accounting experience of the person preparing the financial statements, and use of outside credit facilities were found not to be significant determinants.

Financial agency theory's intellectual roots are shown to be located in the liberal tradition which espouses the instrumental nature of property and property rights. The paper also argues that financial theorists should recognize that, historically, economic efficiency was not a value or end in itself but merely a means by which more fundamental social goals might be achieved.

This article discusses two leading theoretical approaches to understanding how firms operate in markets and the functioning of their internal organizations. Game theory is a microanalytic approach that offers a useful framework for organizing thinking about the factors that influence firm strategic conduct vis-a-vis its competitors. Agency theory is mainly concerned with market mechanisms, such as an executive labor market or market for corporate control, that may discipline firm management in the absence of ownership control. Both approaches can yield useful hypotheses for empirical testing of factors affecting industry and firm performance. Copyright (c) 1988 Wiley-Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

The extent to which directors of target companies act in their own interests, and not shareholder interests, when a takeover bid is received is examined using data from 400 takeover bids for Australian listed companies. A series of hypotheses is developed from theoretical inquiry into the motives of target company directors. Using univariate and multivariate analysis to test these hypotheses, it is found that directors' accept/reject recommendations to shareholders are associated with target leverage, bid premium, bidder's initial shareholding, ownership concentration (univariate only) and directors' shareholding in the target (univariate only). It is concluded that, overall, directors have acted in a manner consistent with shareholder interests, even though personal wealth effects are greatest for directors of bid-accept targets.

Both agency theory and organization theory have considered the problem of employee misconduct -employee decisions to pursue selfinterest at the expense of their principal or employer Integrating these two theoretical perspectives, this article describes the empirical results of a study that examines the effects of inducements and enforcements on individuals' estimates that employee misconduct would occur The effects of these factors were considered within a context where the expected value of engaging in misconduct was positive. Although inducements and enforcements were both significantly related to estimates of misconduct, the rationales providedfor instances of employee misconduct suggest that otherfactors, such as ethical, cost, or risk considerations, may also affect estimates that employees will engage in misconduct.

This paper examines the role of the straight-commissioned salesperson in the context of agency theory and asserts that because the agent acts to benefit two principals, potential conflicts of interest arise. Temporal differences in receipt of rewards create a major conflict, while the firm's exhibition of both espoused and actual behaviors and information asymmetries intensify this conflict. Finally, in light of these inconsistencies, the ethical implications of the straight-commission compensation system are examined. (c) 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This paper examines some accounting and legal aspects of the excessus balance in mediaeval manorial accounts. Earlier findings that such a balance may represent unpaid creditors are supported here with evidence from the Crowland Abbey estates, but it is also suggested that such a balance may possibly be explained as the outcome of an incentive arrangement in an agency relationship between the lord and the reeve. An attempt is made to apply the agency concepts of incentives, bonding and monitoring to this relationship. There is a discussion of whether manorial accounts and audit can be explained in terms of agency theory or whether the existence of the action of account implies a preexisting legal obligation to account and submit to audit. The paper concludes with a consideration of the excessus balance in relation to the action of account. (c) 1991 Taylor & Francis Group All right reserved.

Equity financing is the optimal strategy for innovating firms, which can use their financial structure as a signalling device to attract outside investors. This situation is likely to arise when the firm undertakes a specific purpose R&D project aimed at developing a certain product innovation. Typically, innovations of this kind draw on the firm's cumulative, idiosyncratic knowledge base and, accordingly, the innovation process involves an high degree of asset specificity. Under such circumstances, the terms of debt financing will be adjusted adversely, and equity financing will represent the most economically efficient solution. These arguments are developed in standard static principal-agent models dealing with New Technology Based Firms and publicly held large firms undertaking an aggressive R&D strategy. In the case of NTBFs, two kinds of optimal venture capital contracts are considered, which render the sharing rules independent (a) of the agent's action and (b) of both the agent's action and the specific assets involved in the transaction. Regarding innovating large firms, it is argued that in this case, too, equity represents the optimal financing strategy, and that top executives use their equity share to signal the firm's expected return stream and value to outside investors.

The literature applying agency theory to management has focused on the performance advantages to be gained when ownership and control of the firm are aligned. This article investigates that premise by comparing family-owned and -managed and professionally managed firms. The article presents the results of a field survey that examined the extent to which family-owned and -managed firms differ across structural, process, and performance dimensions from their professionally managed counterparts. Significant differences exist between these two groups on both structural and process dimensions, and there is evidence that family-owned and -managed firms exhibit performance advantages as a result of the unification of ownership and control.

Vertical integration is a fundamental corporate strategy of interest to the fields of strategic management and organizational economics. This paper synthesizes theoretical arguments and empirical findings from this literature to identify the underlying advantages and disadvantages of choosing vertical financial ownership relative to vertical contracts. It then suggests that in the absence of agency and transaction costs, vertical financial ownership and vertical contracting are equivalent governance structures for achieving corporate objectives. However, given a world of positive agency and transaction costs, the key theoretic question then becomes predicting when market mechanisms are sufficient, when intermediate forms of vertical contracting become necessary, and when vertical financial ownership becomes the preferred governance structure. The concluding section of the paper provides a framework for making this analysis based on a synthesis of agency and transaction costs perspectives. Copyright (c) 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Agency theory recognizes that the interests of managers and shareholders may conflict and that, left on their own, managers may make major financial policy decisions, such as the choice of a capital structure, that are suboptimal from the shareholders' standpoint. The theory also suggests, however, that compensation contracts, managerial equity investment, and monitoring by the board of directors and major shareholders can reduce conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders. This research investigates the relationship between the firm's capital structure and 1) executive incentive plans, 2) managerial equity investment, and 3) monitoring by the board of directors and major shareholders. This paper finds a positive relationship between the firm's leverage ratio and 1) percentage of executives' total compensation in incentive plans, 2) percentage of equity owned by managers, 3) percentage of investment bankers on the board of directors, and 4) percentage of equity owned by large individual investors. These findings are consistent with the predictions of agency theory, suggesting, in turn, that capital structure models that ignore agency costs are incomplete. (c) 1992, Cambridge University Press.

Many small firms in Sweden are characterized by a lack of equity capital. For several years measures to increase the equity capital have been discussed. In this discussion the private investors' market has received virtually no attention. This study presents some preliminary results of the private investors in Sweden. The research in small firms financing is characterized by a lack of theoretical framework. One basic assumption in the study is that agency theory can provide an essential framework to explain the interaction between the private investor and entrepreneur. Twenty-five hypotheses generated from agency theory are formulated and tested on 62 small unlisted firms in Sweden. Multiple regression analysis is used for the causal analyses. The empirical results in the study show inter alia that the geographic distance and the private investor's knowledge about the portfolio firm's transformation process seem to be the most influential factors for determining the private investor's involvement in the portfolio firms. It is also interesting to notice that none of the variables, frequency of contacts and the private investor's operational work in the portfolio firm affect the performance of the firm. Contrary to conventional wisdom, private investors do not add value to their portfolio firms through their interaction with the entrepreneurs. The theoretical conclusion is that agency theory does not provide any satisfactory framework to explain the private investor -entrepreneur relationship. Some of the basic assumptions in agency theory seem to be invalid. A model for the relationship between private investors and entrepreneurs is developed in which four interaction strategies are identified. The model gives implications on two levels: the portfolio level and the individual case level. (c) 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This study examines, from a cultural perspective, owner-managers'and other stakeholders'interpretations of the partial fusion of ownership and control through high leverage in eight UK management buy-outs (MBOs). Owner-control and debt-control are interpreted as having positive effects on managerial motivation, organizational decision-making processes and implementation of cost reduction strategies and negative ones on fundamental changes in strategy and acquisition. These interpretations accord broadly with agency theory propositions but show that owner-managers place less emphasis on wealth incentive effects and more emphasis on the enabling and facilitating roles of collective ownership and the freedom it gives from inappropriate corporate control.

Recently, economists have directed attention to the phenomenon of organization. An important difference between the newly developed economic theories of organization, such as for example agency theory, and sociological theories of organization is the fact that economists explicitly employ an individual utility maximization assumption. In this paper, it is reasoned that this assumption, if used as in agency theory, entails logical inconsistencies if we try to explain the existence of the kind of agreements that purportedly form the basis of organiza tions. However, if the condition of uncertainty to which agency theorists merely pay lip service is taken seriously, the observed inconsistencies can be reconciled. A classificatory scheme of four 'sources of obligation' is proposed for the analysis of the basis of agreements. Taking all four sources into consideration in the analysis of organizational agreements can help to avoid one-sided attention to, for example, formal, legally enforceable agreements. The findings of empirical research suggest that two basic dimensions lie at the root of the proposed classifi catory scheme. Further research is needed to check this supposition and its implications.

Agency research has concluded that executive compensation through fixed salary promotes managerial opportunism, whereas equity ownership promotes managers' compliance with stockholders' interests. Using an experimental design, this study examined the extent to which these motivational effects of compensation are conditioned by the level of board control and conditions in the managerial labor market. Participants' opportunistic behavior was negatively affected by the level of board control. This effect was reinforced by high fixed salary compensation and favorable conditions in the managerial labor market. (c) 1992, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

Board of director involvement in restructuring reveals whether restructuring is brought on as an action by the board in its central oversight role or whether managers are purusing positive strategic action or correction. Therefore, based on an integration of organization economics (agency theory and market for corporate control) and strategic management theory (internal control and strategic leadership contingencies), this research examines board involvement in restructuring. Board involvement is hypothesized to be contingent on the governance mechanisms used by the board to monitor top management, control emphasis used by managers to process strategic information and board and managerial characteristics. The basic premise of the paper is that, due to their oversight role, board members (especially outside directors) become involved in restructuring only when managerial strategy implementation appears to be deficient. Top management team equity stakes are found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring, while outside director ownership is found to be positively related. Emphasis on strategic controls by managers was found to be negatively related to board involvement in restructuring. Top management team tenure and top management organizational tenure are negatively related to board involvement. Outsider representation on the board is positively related to board involvement in restructuring, while board tenure was found to be unrelated. Results imply that incentives to monitor (ownership) and emphasis on strategic controls reinforced by higher top management team tenure result in less board involvement in restructuring. However, restructuring may be initiated by outsiders on the board when other governance and control mechanisms fail. This implies a substitution process between governance tactics (ownership vs. board monitoring) and internal controls (managerial vigilance). Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study seeks to estimate the relative importance of free cash flow, corporate governance, and takeover threat in determining financial and portfolio restructuring. The free cash flow hypothesis and agency theory prescriptions are used as the basis for developing a model of restructuring. A simple analysis of variance method is used to decompose restructuring transactions and outcomes into the three effects. The results support the hypothesis that financial and portfolio restructuring are motivated, in part, by agency costs. Decomposition of variances indicates that restructuring is equally explained by free cash flow and interaction of governance and takeover threat with free cash flow.

From an agency theory perspective, recent conversion activity of savings and loan associations (S&Ls) from mutual to stock organizations should improve the overall performance of the thrift industry. We employ a two-step approach to examine this issue using a sample of 559 S&Ls in the Atlanta Federal Home Loan Bank District in 1988. In the first step, we estimate inefficiency scores for individual S&Ls using a stochastic cost frontier methodology. In a second step Tobit model we use these inefficiency scores to examine the relationship between firm inefficiency and organizational form. We find three important results: (1) that the mutual and stock S&Ls in our sample have similar cost structures, allowing the pooling of S&L data; (2) that S&Ls have a wide range of inefficiency scores, with a mean score of 16 percent indicating that the average S&L could produce its output with only 84 percent of the inputs actually used; and (3) that operating inefficiency was not significantly related to form of ownership.

This paper tests competing theoretical explanations for the passage of corporate charter antitakeover amendments. The managerial entrenchment hypothesis suggests that antitakeover amendments are adopted by incumbent management to obtain job security at stockholders' expense. An alternative hypothesis is that antitakeover amendments are proposed in order to enable the management of the target firm to extract a higher price from the bidding firm and thereby benefit stockholders. Our event study from a sample of 409 firms that adopted antitakeover amendments in the 1974-88 period indicates a strongly negative effect on stockholder wealth, in support of the managerial entrenchment hypothesis that antitakeover amendments are adopted by managers at the expense of stockholders.

This paper contributes to the literature on organizational form and performance (the performance-conduct paradigm) by examining the impact of two sets of variables that have not been examined previously: measures of environmental uncertainty and alternative forms of controlling separation of ownership from control. The paper first examines the extent to which contextual variables such as perceived environmental uncertainty and age of the organizational form moderate the relationship between organizational form and corporate performance. Next, the paper extends the analysis by examining the possible effects of ownership and control structures on performance. Measures suggested by agency theory, such as conventional ownership proxies (i.e. proportion of shares held by identifiable, homogenous groups), the proportion of non-executive board members and Fama and Jensen's concept of separation of decision management from decision control are used in the analysis. The results indicate that these measures have direct impact on corporate performance in their own right, though the main impact is indirect through interactions with organizational form variables.

The utility of the contract model is illustrated empirically using a large data set on organizations and their employees in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing industries.

The objective of this study is to examine the effects of control system characteristics and perceived environmental uncertainty on the relative use of performance-contingent compensation. The results, based on a survey of division managers, indicate that monitoring ability is negatively associated with the use of performance-contingent compensation. In addition, monitoring is found to moderate the relationship between uncertainty and compensation system design. Whereas in non-monitoring firms, higher levels of uncertainty are associated with increased use of performance-contingent compensation, in monitoring firms, higher levels of uncertainty are associated with decreased use of performance-contingent compensation. These results support agency theory arguments that compensation structure is determined at least in part by concerns for economic efficiency. (c) 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In the search for more realistic models of managerial behaviour, the principal-agent model has been credited with valuable insights into management accounting problems. However the highly simplified model of organizational conflict and the contrasting complexity of the mathematics required to provide solutions to the agency problem have been frequently cited as limitations to agency theory. The particular purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the agency model's simplistic conceptualization of the conflict of interest inherent in employer-employee relations, and its inadequacy to cope with the complexities and contradictions surrounding the uses of accounting information encountered in evaluating and controlling employee performance. The analysis is illustrated by considering recent evidence on employee profit sharing schemes in the UK which highlights some of the dysfunctional aspects of accounting-based incentive schemes.

Starting from the traditional Lintner model, an asymmetric model of dividend behaviour is derived. It allows both the speed of adjustment and the desired pay-out structural parameters to vary according to firm- and time-specific economic conditions. The model is then tested on a sample of large Italian quoted and non-quoted firms. The main result of the econometric testing is that managers adjust more quickly when they have to reduce dividends than when they have to increase them. This finding is not consistent with the traditional view that firms are more reluctant to reduce than to increase dividends because of signalling problems. It is, however, consistent with the existence of a financial hierarchy. If internal sources of funds are cheaper managers will rationally adjust relatively quickly when they have to reduce dividends in order not to cut investment and will adjust relatively slowly when they have to increase them in order to build financial slack. One further interesting result observed is that quoted firms are found to fix a higher pay-out ratio than non-quoted firms. Copyright (c) 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The board of directors has been identified as a key internal control mechanism for setting CEO compensation. Theory suggests that CEOs will attempt to circumvent board control in an effort to maximize salary. This hypothesis was tested using a sample of 193 firms in a cross-section of industries. Corporate governance literature was reviewed to develop a multiple indicator measure of board control. Although, as hypothesized, CEO salaries were greater in firms with lower levels of control, CEO compensation was not significantly related to firm size or profitability.

Recent research and public discourse on executive compensation and corporate governance suggests a growing consensus that firms can and should increase their control over top managers by increasing the use of managerial incentives and monitoring by boards of directors. This study departs from this consensus by offering an alternative perspective that considers not only the benefits, but also the costs of both incentives and monitoring in large corporations. The study develops and tests a contingency cost/benefit perspective on governance decisions as resource allocation decisions, proposing how and why the observed levels of managerial incentives and monitoring may vary across organizations and across time. Specifically, the study suggests that: (1) firms that are more risky face greater costs when using incentive compensation contracts for top managers, thus reducing the expected level of incentive compensation use for such firms; (2) firms facing this problem of low incentive compensation use can realize greater benefits from higher levels of board monitoring, and thus are likely to rely more on board monitoring; and (3) firms with more complex comporate strategies face higher costs in using board monitoring, and are thus likely to rely less on board monitoring as a source of controlling top management behavior. The study also proposes that within this contingency perspective there may be diminishing 'behavioral returns' to increases in monitoring and incentives. These hypotheses are tested using extensive longitudinal data from over 400 of the largest U.S. corporations. The supportive findings suggest that maximal levels of incentives and monitoring are not necessarily optimal, and that a firm's strategy may not only have significant product/market implications, but also corporate governance implications.

This paper evaluates agency theory as a theory of performance outcome. Agency theory attributes uncertainty in performance outcomes to moral hazard, adverse selection and the state of nature. This paper argues that by overlooking two critical sources of outcome uncertainty in organizations -- incomplete knowledge about the effort-outcome relationship and lack of agreement about effort and outcome -- the generalizability of the theory is strictly limited. Even in such settings where it is generalizable, principal-agent approaches to contract design are unrealistic to the extent that they presume that performance in organizations results exclusively from individual-contributor jobs, exagger ate the degree to which individuals are work-averse, and emphasize the quant ity of effort at the expense of the quality and type of effort. As a theory of performance, principal-agent approaches overstate the importance of opera tional effort and ignore the importance of facilitative effort such as team work. (c) 1994, Sage Publications.

Patterns of corporate governance and control differ significantly across countries because of national differences in structures of ownership and composition of boards of directors. Based on agency theory, we examine the relationship between ownership structure and the composition of the board of directors of 390 large manufacturing firms based in Japan, Western Europe and the United States. In particular, we examine how ownership concentration, bank control and state ownership affect the percentage of outside directors on the corporate boards. The results show that, consistent with predictions of agency theory, ownership structure has significant effects on board composition. Copyright (c) 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The author introduces constructs based on neo-classical and socio-economic assumptions, and argues that board-management relations should be characterized by both "independence" and "interdependence". Interdependence is especially important in small firms. The article presents a model of directorates from research about directorates based on agency theory assumptions. This model is supplemented with constructs from the theory of contractual relations. Whilst traditional literature tends to focus upon "independence" from an agency theory perspective, this article argues that it is necessary to use more than one dimension of attributes regarding the board-management relations in order to understand the board's contribution to company performance, and that trust and solidarity is especially important in small firms. Board-management relations described by simultaneous "independence" and "interdependence" are proposed to give the highest contribution to company performance. The theoretical propositions are exemplified and supported by results of a field survey of directorates in small firms. (c) 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Using data from 192 firms in 12 industries, both the direction and magnitude of the duality-performance relationship was found to vary systematically across Dess and Beard's (1984) environmental dimensions. These results provide partial support for both agency and stewardship perspectives. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, since a variety of mechanisms are used to achieve alignment of the interests of shareholders and managers, we propose that the level of a particular mechanism should be influenced by the levels of other mechanisms which simultaneously operate in the firm. We examine the substitution effects between alternative internal governance mechanisms for a sample of 81 bank holding companies in the postderegulation period. Specifically, we consider the relationship between monitoring by outside directors and the following mechanisms: monitoring by large outside shareholders, mutual monitoring by inside directors, and incentive effects of shareholdings by managers. Our results provide evidence consistent with the substitution hypothesis. We examine the implications of our findings for future research in the area of corporate governance.

In this paper we argue that unobservable constructs lie at the core of a number of influential theories used in the strategic management literature--including agency theory, transaction cost theory, and the resource-based view of the firm. The debate over how best to deal with the problem of unobservables has raged in the philosophy of science literature for the best part of the current century. On the one hand, there are the positivists, who believe that theories containing unobservable constructs are only useful as tools for making predictions. According to positivists, such theories do not inform us about the deep structure of reality. On the other hand, there are the realists, who believe that our theories can give us knowledge about unobservables. Herein we review this debate, we argue for adopting a realist position, and we draw out the implications for strategic management research. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

New Zealand is currently experiencing a liberal and competitive economic environment which has led to a greater investment interest in corporate securities. Likewise, New Zealand firms are also developing strategies to attract investors, for example, through voluntary disclosure of information. Therefore, the level of information voluntarily disclosed by New Zealand companies is of interest to prospective investors. The purpose of this study is to examine empirically the relationship between five firm-specific characteristics and the general level of accounting information voluntarily disclosed by companies listed on New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZSE). In this study the a priori expectations are based on agency theory. The five firm-specific characteristics examined are: firm size, leverage, assets-in-place, type of auditor, and foreign listing status. The results obtained from cross-sectional regression show that firm size, foreign listing status and leverage are significantly related to the extent of voluntary disclosure. In contrast assets-in-place and type of auditor are not significant explanatory variables. A study of this type would be of particular relevance to accounting policy makers because, inter alia, it helps them in (a) understanding corporate disclosure behaviour, (b) explaining why firms adopt certain disclosure strategies, and (c) developing a coherent and acceptable set of mandatory disclosure requirements.

This study examines the interrelation between board composition and variables that capture various agency and financial dimensions of the firm. The agency literature suggests that outside directors on the board provide important monitoring functions in an attempt to resolve, or at least mitigate, agency conflicts between management and shareholders. The agency literature indicates that other mechanisms such as managerial equity ownership, dividend payments, and debt leverage also serve as important devices in reducing agency conflicts in firms. This study argues and documents that an inverse relationship exists between the proportion of external members on the board and managerial stock ownership, dividend payout, and debt leverage. This is consistent with the hypothesis that individual firms choose an optimal board composition depending upon alternative mechanisms employed by the firm to control agency conflicts. Board composition is also found to be systematically related to a number of other variables including institutional holdings, growth, volatility, and CEO tenure.

We examine how ownership configuration affects the determination of CEO pay raises. Based on a sample of 188 firms over a 5-year period, it was found that pay raises were based on distinctly different factors, depending on the ownership profile of the firm. In management-controlled firms--where no single major owner exists--results suggest an overarching pay philosophy: maximize CEO pay, subject to demonstration of face legitimacy of that pay. In externally-controlled firms--where a major (nonmanager) owner exists--results suggest a very different philosophy: minimize CEO pay, subject to the ability to attract/retain a satisfactory CEO.

This study tests the effects of ownership concentration, outside director equity holdings, and corporate strategy on, and the Performance implications of, the size and relatedness of units sold by parent firms. The study is based on a model that integrates agency and resource-based theories, and a sample of sell-offs by 112 Fortune 500 firms. Ownership concentration is found to be associated positively with the sale of unrelated and small units. This relationship is strengthened when outside director equity is high. In addition, the effects of corporate strategy types on the characteristics of units sold depend on ownership concentration and outside director equity. Finally, post'sell-off performance of the parent firm is associated negatively with the relatedness of the unit sold. These results suggest that the type of unit sold depends on the type of economic benefit sought by the parent firm. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this research, the authors present a model that demonstrates that motivating managers to change unpopular or irresponsible corporate behavior may be required when the stakeholders desire such a change. Using agency theory, they then test part of the model and demonstrate why it may be necessary for an organized protest to impact on share prices before managers choose to change the behavior. Investors' reactions to announcements of product boycotts and stock divestitures made over the 23-year period 1969-1991 were examined. Announcements about boycotts were associated with significant negative market reactions, whereas divestiture announcements resulted in no significant market responses. From a pure stock market perspective, boycotts appear to be a more effective tool in influencing managers to change a company's behavior. (c) 1995, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

Couched in positive agency theory, it is shown that the straight-commission compensation system (SCCS) creates a conflict of interest between the agent's and the client's self-interests. Based on this, it is hypothesized that the SCCS will encourage agents to intend to act unethically towards their clients. Two hundred and forty five insurance agents in the U.S. were surveyed, with 59% responding. The results suggest that the SCCS does not significantly affect agents' ethical intentions, positively or negatively. This lack of empirical evidence may be due to the unique nature of the sample. Indeed, the company which enabled this sample appears to have found a practical solution to temper the potential negative effects of the SCCS in its commitment to selective hiring and marketing products which benefit both the client and the agent.

As Australia becomes an increasingly important equity market, the level of information disclosed by Australian listed companies is likely to be of interest to a growing audience of prospective investors. This study tests the relation between five firm-specific variables drawn from agency theory and the general level of financial information voluntarily disclosed by companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. The five variables are foreign listing status, firm size; leverage, assets-in-place and type of audit firm. The empirical evidence suggests that foreign listing status, firm size, and type of audit firm are significantly related to the level of information voluntarily disclosed by listed companies.

This study extends agency theory to explain the design of compensation strategy in foreign subsidiaries competing within global industries. Results from 100 subsidiaries in five countries indicate that compensation strategy is influenced by the agency problem, defined by the subsidiary's cultural distance from its headquarters market, lateral centralization, and senior management's commitment to the parent. In addition, the association between the overall design of the compensation strategy and perceived subsidiary effectiveness was examined. An incentive structure aligned to the agency state was positively related to subsidiary effectiveness.

This paper examines the influence of competitive strategy on the relationship between suppliers and their distribution networks. Drawing on agency theory, hypotheses are developed specifying the appropriate match between manufacturer strategies and systems of control within distribution channels. Cluster analysis is used to show distinct differences in channel management and structure for the three generic strategies of cost leadership, differentiation and focus. Results suggest that variation in control relationships may be explained by the demands posed by manufacturers' competitive strategies. This study therefore extends the applicability of Porter's typology to the specific structure of distribution channels and shows that agency theory can provide insights into the economic basis of interorganizational relationships.

The study of capital structure has increasingly gained importance in strategic management research. Paradigms derived from organizational economics have also gained popularity in explaining firm actions. Agency theory and transaction cost economics represent two such paradigms that rely on the notion of market imperfections. Notwithstanding the similarities between them, these two offer different explanations of the role of debt and equity in a firm. The governance abilities of the financing structures and the nature of assets of the firm provide two key sources of differences. Viewing capital structure from transaction cost economics gives rise to predictions that are contradictory to those presented by agency theory. It is argued that the extant evidence mainly supports the transaction cost viewpoint. Two organizational phenomena - leveraged buyouts and product diversification - are used to highlight the comparison.

For innovators and entrepreneurs in service businesses, franchising is frequently suggested as a way to succeed and grow. Academic research has provided little guidance for potential franchisors, however. This article provides a model to guide that choice of organizational form using results from agency theory. Analytically, franchising is a way to allocate decisions within the franchise system between the franchisor and the franchisee in order to promote efficiency and provide incentives. Franchisees make decisions regarding local operations, such as hours, prices, and locations, because they have the knowledge about local trading conditions. Franchisors make decisions regarding the product, its production, and associated marketing efforts that together create the standardization that the trademark signals. The revenue of franchise systems is divided to provide incentives to each party to support the allocation of decisions. Franchisors receive a percentage of gross sales, typically 5%, to compensate them for use of the trademark and associated services. Franchisees keep the unit's profits after paying royalties. These profits motivate the franchisee to make the good decisions that operate the unit efficiently. But franchising has limitations as well. First, by making franchisees invest in a unit in a specific geographic area, the franchise system exposes the franchisees to business risk; it consists of local economic conditions beyond franchisees' control that could reduce or eliminate their capital. That risk could be eliminated by owning a geographically diversified portfolio of shares of units in different places, but then incentives are weakened. Second, the requirements of standardization under the common trademark constrain franchisees from the full use of their human capital, including their knowledge of local conditions. Some adaptations to the local market are prohibited by the requirement of standardization. So high levels of either business risk or human capital in an industry make franchising a less desirable choice of organizational form. These ideas are tested with interindustry data using an econometric discrete choice model on the share of sales through franchise systems (termed organizational form share). The methodology is identical to market share models used in economics and marketing. Business risk, as measured by percent of units that have failed in the industry in the last 3 years, and human capital required in the industry, as measured by average wages paid, both negatively influence the share of sales through franchise systems. The model can be applied by entrepreneurs considering franchising, especially in industries not traditionally associated with franchising. Using public data sources identified in the study, a prospective franchisor can research the industry to determine if industry conditions support franchising as the optimal choice of organizational form. The empirical tests also suggest a second managerially relevant conclusion: the decision of "should we franchise?" can be and should be separated from the decision of "how do we implement franchising?" Factors previously shown to influence the implementation of franchising, the degree of ownership of units within the system, do not influence organizational form share, thus suggesting that the strategic decision of whether to franchise is distinct from the operating decision of how to implement franchising.

Empirical studies of information systems planning practices in organizations indicate that wide variations exist. We propose and test a model based on agency theory and transaction-costs economics to account for these variations. As senior management's uncertainty with respect to the information systems function increases, we argue they will delegate more decision rights to the information systems manager. As a result of increased agency costs, senior management will demand more information systems planning to provide the basis for monitoring and bonding of the manager. In addition, because information systems plans may be used to resolve the distribution of gains and losses between senior management and the information systems manager in the event of unforeseen circumstances, both senior management and the information systems manager will seek to exercise control over the planning process and the form of the final plan. We argue that the relative specialization of human capital of senior management versus the information systems manager will dictate whose views dominate in the preparation of and form of the information systems plan. Our empirical results show moderate support for our model.

Executive compensation has recently become the subject of extensive scrutiny by the popular press. However, compensation for corporate directors is one area which has only received little attention or research. The present study combined resource dependence and agency theories with previous research on executive salaries to develop an explanatory model of director compensation. Data were collected from US firms at two points in time to assess the stability of these predictors. Four variables were found to have a significant relationship with director compensation: firm size, firm profitability, equity ownership by directors, and resource richness of the board. However, the explanatory power of these variables appear to decline over time. Practical implications of these results are discussed.

This paper contends that a major breakthrough has occurred in economics, that this breakthrough is related to the matching of economics and organization theory, and that this breakthrough is already remodeling our understanding of how economic systems work. Section I comes back to the problem of the existence of organizations and to its generalization through the concept of "governance" structures. Section II develops the explanation provided by transaction cost economics of the trade-off among these structures. Section III compares recent contributions of agency theory and of transaction cost economics to the analysis of the structuring mechanism of formal organizations. Section IV explores some properties of the government of organizations. Section V argues that what precedes may have major consequences on public policies and regulations.

In this paper we challenge the Public Choice-Agency Theory approach, which characterizes economic transactions as a series of discrete, unique events. We argue that the policy implications flowing from this view of the world are flawed, as they ignore the role of trust in contract formation and execution. Evidence is drawn from health, local authority, and water service sectors of the economy to illustrate the way in which the efficiency-enhancing properties of contract-based provision may be attenuated if trust is distorted by institutional change.

Agency theory suggests that many of the costs incurred by the taxpayer during the 1980s thrift crisis were the result of conflicts between principals and their agents. This study models the costs associated with three distinct types of agency conflicts involved in closing an insolvent thrift - conflicts between creditors and owners, between owners and managers, and between taxpayers and government officials. Using a model that controls for sample-selection bias, the study presents strong evidence that thrift owners effected wealth transfers from creditors by undertaking high-risk investments, and that government officials pursued policies that increased losses to the thrift deposit insurance fund which ultimately were funded by the taxpayer. The results do not show that managers effected wealth transfers from owners through expense-preference behavior, but rather that inefficient management increased the losses of the deposit insurance fund.

A comparison of the essential characteristics of public and private enterprise against the background of agency theory shows that archetypal public enterprise is not an enterprise in the generally accepted legal and economic senses of that expression. If it is to be efficient, therefore, archetypal public enterprise must not be left dependent upon governance and monitoring systems appropriate to private enterprise but must, by means of an intimate and cooperative (and not an 'arm's length') relationship between the principal (government) and the agent (management), be provided with precisely defined and quantified objectives that lead to an agreed measure of overall performance. The essay's conclusions are important because, inter alia, they shift the efficiency debate from property to governance. (c) 1996 CIRIEC.

This paper considers the relationship between Dutch accounting legislation and changes of organizational form. Empirical evidence is provided on the effects of a 1970 accounting law for the public company form and on the effects of a 1982 accounting law for the private company form. Much of the agency theory literature assumes that accounting regulation limits firms' opportunities to minimize agency costs and, thus, reduces firms' abilities to survive. Hence, a company subjected to new accounting requirements may have an incentive to change to an organizational form without accounting requirements (e.g., a partnership form). However, it may be expected that in deciding whether to change organizational form, a firm will take switching costs, like taxes, into account. This paper uses the following data: 1) the number of firms switching between organizational forms, and 2) changes in the total number of firms in various categories of organizational forms. The results suggest that the first accounting law negatively affected the number of public companies, and the second negatively affected the number of private companies. However, the results also indicate that the effects of the 1970 accounting law were much stronger than those of the 1983 accounting law. Differences in switching cost are suggested as an explanation for this difference.

Among the various stakeholders of a firm, senior managers are the most likely targets for private and public political pressures. Other stakeholder groups are less visible and may be perceived as less influential in corporate strategy formulation and implementation. In some situations, consequently, senior executives may adopt corporate strategies in response to political pressures even if these strategies may be costly to shareholders. In this study, a special case is examined: the effect of divestment of South African business units on firm value. Using data from 1984 through 1990, we examine the impact that announcements of divestments have upon the stock return behavior of publicly traded firms. Our results indicate that significant and negative excess returns accrue to shares of companies announcing divestments of South African operations. These results are supportive of the premise that noneconomic pressures may influence managerial strategies rather than value-enhancement goals.

In this article I examine those business exchanges in which firms hire professional service organizations and give them limited decisionmaking authority to perform knowledge-intensive tasks. I frame such exchanges within agency theory perspective and invoke the extant literature on professions to delineate several attributes that make principal-professional exchanges intrinsically distinct from others, such as owner-manager agency. In doing so, I question and complement some key assumptions in agency theory and also discuss explicitly how the study of principal-professional exchanges helps highlight important considerations not addressed in the mainstream theory. I then present an expanded framework that integrates agency theory and the literature on the professions and present several propositions to outline four types of restraints on potential opportunistic behavior of professional agents: (1) self-control, (2) community control, (3) bureaucratic control, and (4) client control. The article ends with theoretical and empirical implications.

In recent years, agency theory has substantially influenced research on corporate governance. Organizational sociologists have critiqued the agency theory model of boards as limited and have studied how the functioning of boards is shaped by structural, political, and cognitive contexts. Building on their work, this paper empirically studies the cultural embeddedness of boards in a nonprofit organization called Medlay. It shows how organizational identity - the members' shared beliefs about the central, enduring, and distinctive characteristics of the organization - influences the construction and enactment of the director's role and shapes interactions among board members and managers. The findings demonstrate that the role of the director is shaped by Medlay's Janus-faced identity, as both a volunteer-driven organization and a family of friends; directors see themselves as vigilant monitors and as friendly, supportive colleagues. The findings also portray how some board members' scrutiny of the budget, including "lavish" travel expenditures, surfaces the contradictions in Medlay's identity, and creates conflicts for directors. Should board members take managers to task and thereby exercise vigilance and uphold the ideal of volunteer control, or should they safeguard the principle of friendship and avoid all conflict? An influential subset of directors and top managers resolved the budget issue and preserved Medlay's identity by using different "face-saving" strategies to make directors feel that they had been vigilant, and to affirm sentiments of cooperation. More generally, this study extends the literature on corporate governance by showing how organizational identity influences the construction and enactment of the director's role. It introduces the idea of "conflicts of commitment," a form of intra-role conflict that arises when directors are besieged by conflicting aspects of the organization's identity. When actions occur that breach the expected role performance of board members, latent contradictions in the organizational identity emerge, and directors are faced with the conflict of upholding one dimension of identity while undermining the other. The study also contributes to research on organizational identity by proposing a model of how organizational and individual identities shape the board role through the processes of identification and action, and how a hybrid identity generates the potential for intra-role conflict.

Previous empirical studies of top managers tend to draw from either positive agency theory or strategic leadership theory. This manuscript reviews and critiques these two approaches, outlining their advantages and inherent limitations. Because each is inherently limited, we suggest that developments in personality theory, transformational leadership theory, and visionary leadership theory can contribute to a more realistic view of top managers. Consequently, we contrast these three alternative perspectives with the two more dominant approaches in this manuscript. As a result, we identify future research directions for scholars interested in studying strategic leadership. (c) 1997 JAI Press Inc. All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

Downsizing and layoffs are an important mechanism for U.S. firms to cope with their strategic and economic environment. In contrast, the Japanese tradition of lifetime employment limits the ability affirms to employ layoffs as a strategic measure, relegating its use to conditions of financial distress. This paper provides the first comparison of layoffs in Japan and the United States and examines stock price reactions to layoff announcements in each country from 1990 to 1994. Agency theory and Aoki's cooperative game theory are employed to discuss differences in the governance structures of U.S. and Japanese firms and their implication for stock price reactions. Results show that layoff announcements trigger negative returns for both U.S. and Japanese firms. Specifically, layoff announcements of U.S. firms are associated with a negative 1.78 percent abnormal return, while layoff announcements for Japanese firms are associated with a negative 0.56 percent abnormal return. To better understand the impact of layoffs, this study examines the relationships between stock price reactions and various layoff characteristics (such as whether the layoff is proactive or reactive or whether the layoff is the first in the industry). Implications of the findings are discussed. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Specifically, this study simultaneously models competing theoretical explanations for risk using three distinct realized operational risks managed by savings and loan (S&L) firms. It then examines the effects of these risks on performance. Implications of this study argue for a mesotheoretic approach to the modeling of risk and for its disaggregation into distinct risk choices.

Recent studies have examined the determinants of international joint venture (IJV) formations and stock market reactions to such investments. Less is known, however, about the evolution of IJVs and the attendant performance implications for parent firms. This paper examines one specific type of IJV evolution, IJV internalization, whereby one firm acquires the IJV by buying out its partners). Standard agency theory variables are hypothesized to influence parent firm valuation effects. The results indicate that parent firm valuation effects are positively related to the parent firm equity owned by insiders and the interaction of debt financing and free cash flow.

This paper discusses a model that combines internal and external control mechanisms in a firm in which assets can have alternative uses that are in some states more profitable than the current one. However, restructuring a firm in order to realize the gains from alternative uses affects managers adversely since they invest in firm-specific human capital. Managers can be motivated to restructure the firm through their compensation scheme. Alternatively, investors can acquire costly information on the firm and interfere with managers' decisions. The main focus is on independent directors, who review and monitor contracts and managers' compensation. If information is not too costly, directors are the optimal institution to check managerial discretion and the degree of managerial entrenchment depends on the compensation of independent directors. However, if directors fail to exercise control over management properly, takeovers or creditor control become second-best solutions. If information is costly to transfer, unchecked managerial control may be optimal.

This article uses the insights of agency theory to analyze ownership structures in the life-health insurance industry. We examine operational, financial, and institutional determinants of ownership structure. We simultaneously test hypotheses regarding the owner-manager incentive conflict and the owner-policyholder incentive conflict. Our results demonstrate systematic differences between the activity choices of stock life insurers and mutual life insurers, consistent with the managerial discretion hypothesis. We also find that mutuals are more likely to be licensed in New York, stock firms are more likely to be organized as groups, mutuals are more likely to have high A. M. Best ratings, and older insurers are more likely to be mutuals.

This paper's empirical results indicate that the average effect of antitakeover provisions on subsequent long-term investment is negative. The interpretation of these results depends on whether one thinks that there was too much, too little, or just the right amount of long-term investment prior to the antitakeover provision adoption. We use agency theory to devise more refined empirical tests of the effects of antitakeover provision adoption by managers in firms with different incentive and monitoring structures. Governance variables (e.g. percentage of outsiders on corporate boards, and separate CEO/chairperson positions) have an insignificant impact on subsequent long-term investment behavior. However, consistent with agency theory predictions, managers in firms with better economic incentives (higher insider ownership) tend to cut subsequent long-term investment less than managers in firms with less incentive alignment. Furthermore, managers in firms with greater external monitoring (due to higher institutional ownership) also tend to cut subsequent long-term investment less than managers in firms with less external monitoring. Thus, the decrease in subsequent long-term investment is significantly less for firms where the managers have greater incentives to act in shareholders' interests. Finally, there are interesting effects of the control variables. First, high book equity/market equity firms cut total long-term investment more. Second, firms that were takeover targets or rumored to be takeover targets cut long-term investment more. These results suggest that inefficient firms cut long-term investment more when an antitakeover provision is adopted. (c) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The American corporate sector saw major reform movements during the 1980s. Despite frequent admixture in practice, two key movements can be singled out as analytically distinct: financial restructuring (generally debt-financed, often involving mergers), and total quality management (a particular approach to productive restructuring). Unfortunately the precepts and practices of these movements often clashed. This paper examines these tensions and explores them by reference to economic theories of the firm associated with each movement. While financial restructuring has been interpreted through the lens of neoclassical agency theory, total quality management has strong links with alternative approaches that can be grouped under the heading 'capabilities theory'.

The best opportunity for growth is often overseas, even for smaller entrepreneurial firms. However, resource-constrained smaller firms do not have as many available entry strategies as larger multinational corporations (MNCs). Smaller firms frequently must ally themselves with partners in order to make international expansion feasible (i.e., employing an export agent, licensing, joint venture, or strategic alliance). The alliance of two distinct parties central to these entry strategies lends itself to an agency theory perspective. Agency theory illuminates the underpinnings of these relationships, in particular highlighting the problems and risks that the entrepreneur faces when entering into the partnership. These problems arise from information asymmetry (each party is privy to knowledge that the other isn't). This article develops these problems within the entrepreneur/ export agent realm and suggests that government assistance can reduce these problems. Specifically, government assistance reduces verification and monitoring costs. The article proposes that those firms that take advantage of governmental information and assistance will more likely enter foreign countries successfully. (c) 1997 Taylor & Francis.

Total quality management (TQM) has received considerable attention as a way to increase both the effectiveness and the efficiency of corporations (Bounds et. al., 1994; Grant, Shani and Krisnan 1994; Olian and Rynes 1991; Powell 1995; Ross 1993). Concerned primarily with the delivery of customer satisfaction, the proponents of quality and/or TQM (Deming 1986; Juran 1992; and Crosby 1979) have developed principles and procedures for achieving total quality and meeting multiple corporate goals. Empirical evidence regarding outcomes is mixed; success and failure case studies abound, statistical methodologies are questioned, and more rigorous empirical studies present some positive findings (Powell 1995). Some maintain that the reasons for the failure of TQM systems is incompatibility between existing Western management thought which is grounded in economic models, and the TQM paradigm, which evolved from statistical theory, and has its own set of assumptions (Grant, Shani and Krisnan 1994). Despite such mixed empirical results, TQM continues to be promoted and implemented. This is the beginning point for our examination of TQM. The TQ management paradigm is practiced in economically and culturally diverse environments, including those which embrace an economic perspective, complete with maximisation of shareholder wealth, self-interest, rational decision makers, separation of ownership, and agency costs (Grant, Shani and Krishnan 1994).

Firms' boundary choices have undergone careful examination in recent years, particularly in information services. While transaction cost economics provides a widely tested explanation for boundary choice, more recent theoretical work advances competing knowledge-based and measurement cost explanations. Similar to transaction cost economics, these theories examine the impact of exchange attributes on the performance of markets and hierarchies as institutions of governance. These theories, however, offer alternative attributes to those suggested by transaction cost economics or offer alternative mechanisms through which similar attributes influence make-buy choices. Traditional empirical specifications of make-buy models are unable to comparatively test among these alternative theories. By developing and testing a model of comparative institutional performance rather than institutional choice, we examine the degree of support for these competing explanations of boundary choice. Hypotheses are tested using data on the governance of nine information services at 152 companies. Our results suggest that a theory of the firm and a theory of boundary choice is likely to be complex, requiring integration of transaction cost, knowledge-based, and measurement reasoning.

Extant research examining the relationship between a firm's board and its CEO's compensation has focused primarily on the composition of the board-at-large. However, it may be the nature of the compensation committee, not the board as a whole, that is at issue. This study was a longitudinal assessment of the relationship between the composition of a firm's compensation committee and multiple measurements of CEO compensation. We found no evidence that "captured" directors led to greater levels of, or changes in, CEO compensation. These findings may suggest the consideration of theories other than agency theory as explanations for the continued focus on board independence.

Amihud and Lev (1981) are widely cited as providing evidence that managers, unless closely monitored by large block shareholders, will attempt to reduce their employment risk through unrelated mergers and diversification. These corporate strategies, however, may not be in shareholders' interests. Reconsidering the agency assumptions underlying Amihud and Lev's study and the methodology they used, we develop hypotheses regarding the association between ownership structure, board vigilance, corporate strategy, and corporate performance from management theory and test them using Amihud and Lev's data from the 1960s and new data from the 1980s. Neither study supports the conclusions of Amihud and Lev, nor the agency theory belief that monitoring efforts by principals affect the strategic behaviors of agents or the performance of firms that they manage.

This paper examines the link between a firm's resources and its efficient organization form with a focus on entrepreneurial resources. Entrepreneurial resources are defined as the propensity of an individual to behave creatively, act with foresight, use intuition, and be alert to new opportunities. This paper assumes that these entrepreneurial resources can be distributed in two ways throughout the firm: they can be held by one or a few individuals-"individual entrepreneurial resources" - or they can be dispersed among a team of individuals - "team entrepreneurial resources." Agency theory is used to consider how various organizational characteristics - such as the assignment of decision responsibilities, incentives and risk bearing, the number of hierarchical levels, horizontal linking structures, mutual monitoring and bonding devices, and information systems - will differ in the individual and team entrepreneurial forms. Generally, the individual entrepreneurial form resembles the "classic entrepreneurial firm" (Fama and Jensen 1983) in which various decision making roles and risk bearing are performed by a single entrepreneur. The team entrepreneurial form is similar to what Bartlett and Ghoshal (1993) call "beyond the m-form." Responsibility for steps in the decision process is dispersed in the team form, and monitoring the decision process will occur at the organization's apex. The CEO will not make operational or strategic decisions; instead, he manages the internal market for managers and develops an organization's cultural context and information systems. Below the CEO level, team entrepreneurs are responsible for ratifying innovative decisions, and below this team entrepreneurs are responsible for initiating innovative decisions. After presenting these two entrepreneurial forms, this paper relates them to extant research on corporate entrepreneurship and organizational forms.

This paper considers some developments within Russian privatized industrial firms 1992-94 through the lens of Stakeholder-Agency Theory (SAT). Although it has its own shortcomings and weaknesses, SAT, unlike the traditional financial version of Agency Theory, at least contemplates the possibility of a transitional period during which enterprise governance structures can evolve. It is by now widely recognised that in the middle of deep economic crisis, the Russian economy is too volatile for longitudinal studies of formally structured samples of firms over a period of time. In any case, SAT is at a stage of development that has not yet yielded detailed predictions for scientific testing. Yet surveys of recently privatized firms in Russia do provide empirical data away from the origins of SAT, and it is argued that this fresh data suggests new research propositions that can hopefully lead to more theoretical refinement and ultimately testing. At the very least, SAT can be used as a heuristic device, capable of providing a way of looking at complex Russian developments in a structured way. A process of Russian privatization through management - employee buy-outs involving giveaway distributions of shares has secured the compliance of the two main groups of enterprise stakeholders who could have prevented the withdrawal of the State from the governance of industrial enterprises, but has not yet produced a form of corporate governance structure that is likely to survive in the long term without State protection. In the longer term, international competitiveness can only be secured in Russia through investment in new products and processes, and the inadequacies of managers and other employees as sources of investable funds mean that incumbents must generate a more welcoming climate for outside investors. Even after such a short period since privatization and in the middle of a deep economic crisis, some enterprises are already favouring more efficient governance structures in a way consistent with SAT.

This paper examines variations in executive pay as a function of CEO power. We assume that CEOs optimize their pay conditional upon their ability to shape decisions that favour their interests. Power is inferred from overt manifestations such as share holdings, but also from covert sources such as a CEOs' social capital. Two components of compensation are considered: base pay and bonus. While financial performance, firm size, and other factors are held constant, the results show overt power as measured by CEO, and CEO-family equity holdings, to have a curvilinear relationship with executive compensation. Proxies of covert power include tenure, being (one of) the founder(s), and firm diversification. These variables magnify or moderate the effect of equity holdings on compensation. The power effects are most pronounced for the size of CEO bonus.

This research examines the lending decisions made by microenterprise credit support pro-grammes in Jamaica, focusing on what types of owners of firms successfully obtain loans. Utilizing agency theory, human capital and social capital theories, the study examines what types of borrowers successfully navigate the credit market nurtured by non-governmental orga-nizations (NGOs). It is based on field research comparing five organizations, evaluating the loan process and characteristics of each lender, with a study of their market, utilizing interviews conducted with entrepreneurs of 254 informal sector firms. The study first describes and exam-ines the organizational character of the loan agencies, to discern their effect on the loan granting process. Subsequent analysis examines the characteristics of those individuals who received loans, and compares them with those who did not. The research shows that the behaviour of NGO microenterprise credit institutions in Jamaica conform closely to predictions based on agency theory, behaving very differently from banks, credit unions, informal lending associations and families. Although the bureaucratic mechan-isms and organizational goals and objectives were found to be quite similar among the five different NGO credit agencies studied, each lender varied considerably in their tacit selection criteria of their clientele. The research underscores the importance of social capital and human capital on the lending process. (c) 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We investigate the influence of the composition of the board of directors and stock ownership patterns on the decision to enter markets in Central and Eastern Europe. Our findings suggest that board composition alone does not influence the entry decision while firms with less concentrated stock ownership were more likely to enter these developing markets. We also found that while better performing firms were attracted to opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe, firms with poor prior performance and outside dominated boards were also more likely to enter these markets.

This article aims at provinding an extensive survey of theories an stylized facts of one of the most important elements of financial structure, namely credit to the private sector (firms and households). Section 2 analyses financial structure from the perspective of financial intermediaries (theory of financial intermediation). Section 3 takes the distinction between regulators and regulatees as a starting point (theory of regulation). In section 4 the capital structure of firms is described (theory of capital structure). Section 5 documents the agency relationships between equityholders and managers and between equityholders and debtholders (agency theory). In section 6 one of the key characteristics of a credit contract, its maturity, is examined (theory of debt maturity). In all of these sections the theoretical issues involved are complemented by a summary of relevant stylized facts of financial structure. Futhermore, a cross-country comparison is made. Finally, section 7 provides a synthesis and summary of the findings of the former sections.

The development of the field of strategic management within the last two decades has been dramatic. While its roots have been in a more applied area, often referred to as business policy, the current field of strategic management is strongly theory based, with substantial empirical research, and is eclectic in nature. This review of the development of the field and its current position examines the field's early development and the primary theoretical and methodological bases through its history. Early developments include Chandler's (1962) Strategy and Structure and Ansoff's (1965) Corporate Strategy. These early works took on a contingency perspective (fit between strategy and structure) and a resource-based framework emphasizing internal strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps, one of the more significant contributions to the development of strategic management came from industrial organization (IO) economics, specifically the work of Michael Porter. The structure-conduct-performance framework and the notion of strategic groups, as well as providing a foundation for research on competitive dynamics, are flourishing currently. The IO paradigm also brought econometric tools to the research on strategic management. Building on the IO economics framework, the organizational economics perspective contributed transaction costs economics and agency theory to strategic management. More recent theoretical contributions focus on the resource-based view of the firm. While it has its roots in Edith Penrose's work in the late 1950s, the resource-based view was largely introduced to the field of strategic management in the 1980s and became a dominant framework in the 1990s. Based on the resource-based view or developing concurrently were research on strategic leadership, strategic decision theory (process research) and knowledge-based view of the firm. The research methodologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated and now frequently combine both quantitative and qualitative approaches and unique and new statistical tools. Finally, this review examines the future directions, both in terms of theory and methodologies, as the study of strategic management evolves. (c) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

We offer a rationale for a link between capital scarcity and franchising. Predictions respectively based on agency theory and the capital scarcity hypothesis were tested among 91 restaurant chains. Our specific focus was on whether or not variables based on capital scarcity could explain variance in firms' franchising decisions beyond what was explained by agency variables. The latter were significant predictors of franchising, and the capital scarcity variables explained additional variance, indicating that capital is among the resources related to franchising.

Using both agency theory and comparative national culture frameworks, this study investigated factors determining the degree and type of control used by American and Japanese MNCs on their Korean subsidiaries. Two characteristics of MNCs affected the control they exerted - the degree of MNCs' ownership, which affected the amount of control, and the nationality of the MNC's headquarters, which affected the type of control exerted. As predicted, the size of the subsidiary relative to the MNC, moderated the relationship between the degree of ownership and amount of output control the MNC exerted. Overall, the study supported the usefulness of agency theory in explaining the degree of management control exerted, while national culture accounted for the type of control exerted.

International retailers are increasingly using franchising as a means of entering foreign markets. However, international retail franchising lacks a conceptual basis from which an explanation of the major elements of this activity can be generated. Agency theory and its major premises of information asymmetry, monitoring costs, moral hazard and opportunism, are introduced in an attempt to provide an initial effort at bridging this conceptual gap. The paper reviews international retailing and franchise research before explaining agency theory. A discussion follows on how agency theory can explain major elements of international franchise activity of retail firms such as the international retail franchise process and the operationalisation of the international retail franchise system.

Research on the internationalization of retailing has focused on descriptive and empirical studies centring on issues such as motivations for retail internationalization and individual company experiences of the internationalization process. One particular aspect of the retail internationalization process that has remained relatively underresearched, and consequently under theorized, is market entry mode strategy. Furthermore, with a few notable exceptions, potentially interesting research from the economics of international production and corporate finance literatures has been virtually ignored in the international retailing domain. This paper represents an initial step in rectifying these deficiencies by exploring some of the issues associated with the economics-based internalization and agency theories, in the context of international retailers' market entry mode strategy. By combining market transaction costs (associated with internalization theory), together with information and monitoring costs (associated with agency theory), and thus highlighting the interlinking issue of information asymmetry, a more coherent basis is established for analysing international retailers' entry mode choice decision.

Recent empirical studies support self-interest as the sole basis for economic decisions (as predicted by agency theory). However, cognitive moral development (CMD) theory suggests that decision makers will allow ethical/moral considerations to constrain their economic behaviour. The purpose of this study is to resolve the essential conflict between the tenets of agency theory and CMD theory. The results of a laboratory experiment suggest that both moral reasoning level and adverse-selection conditions (self-interest) can have a significant effect on managers' project evaluation decisions. Specifically, managers are likely to continue a project that is expected to be unprofitable only when adverse selection conditions are present and moral reasoning level is low. Thus, agency theory may not be generalizable to accounting-based economic performance.

In their response to our paper, Amihud and Lev (1999) and Denis, Denis, and Sarin (1999) claim that disciplinary differences don't matter and that methods and evidence should speak for themselves. In contrast, we argue that important differences exist between financial economics and strategic management, leading to differing beliefs, norms, methods, and interpretations of empirical results. Using a strategic management perspective to review the evidence presented by Amihud and Lev in their earlier study (1981) and in their and Denis et al.'s critiques of our work (1999), we find no reason to revise our original conclusion: there is little theoretical or empirical basis for believing that monitoring by a firm's principals influences its diversification strategy and acquisition decisions.

Two widely adopted views of firm efficiency are agency theorists' residual claims and organization theorists' routines. The agency view holds that ownership structures (and their proxies) are the primary source of efficiency differences between firms. The organization theory view holds that organizational routines are the primary source of efficiency differences between firms. We conduct an empirical test that compares the relative value of residual claims and routines in generating firm efficiency, while controlling other factors. We find support for both views, but more importantly find that the average value of routines is roughly an order of magnitude higher than residual claims. (c) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We reexamine signaling and agency theories and argue that the free-cash-flow hypothesis implies a stronger information effect for both over-and underinvesting firms than for value-maximizing firms. Our results indicate that dividend and capital structure policies interact to provide significant predictive information about future cash flow. We also find a U-shaped relation between the amount of information and Tobin's q. The minimum of this relation occurs near a q value of one. This outcome implies a stronger information effect for both over-and underinvesting firms than for value-maximizing firms.

Agency theory is used to develop hypotheses regarding the effects of ownership proliferation on firm performance. The authors examine the effects of chief executive officer (CEO) ownership, executive team ownership, and all employee ownership in addition to the moderating effect of risk on firm survival and stock price. Firms with low CEO ownership outperform those with high levels of CEO ownership across all levels of risk, hut the effect is most pronounced for low-risk firms Executive team ownership is negatively related to firm performance, whereas ownership for all employees is positively associated with firm performance, particularly for higher risk firms.

A substantial body of research employs agency theory and transaction costs analysis to explain ownership decisions in distribution channels. Agency theory identifies factors that prompt firms to favor behavior-based contracting over outcome-based agreements. Transaction cost economics is a complementary framework which maintains that the organizational form in a location should be the one that economizes on production and transaction costs. Prior research illustrates that independent variables (e.g. proximity to highways, dedicated assets) outlined in these theories provide a partial explanation for ownership decisions. Nevertheless, scant research has analyzed whether factors outlined in agency theory and transaction cost analysis are employed by executives when making ownership decisions. The purpose of this study is to investigate managerial rationales underlying plural contractual networks. (c) 1999, MCB UP Limited.

Industrial foundations are self-governing, non-profit institutions that own business companies. This ownership structure is found in a fair number of Northern European companies, some of them successful world-class competitors. Standard agency theory would predict foundation-owned companies to be relatively inefficient since they lack monitoring by residual claimants and access to equity finance from the stock market. Nevertheless, empirical research (Thomsen 1996) has found that Danish foundation-owned companies do no worse in terms of profitability and growth than companies with dispersed ownership or family ownership. The paper considers and tests alternative explanations of this paradox. Explanations based on tax incentives, alternative control mechanisms and product-market advantages are rejected, but some support is found for performance advantages related to family control and long-term business commitment.

Finance, ownership and control issues have received a great deal of attention in recent years as centres of interest in the 'new institutional economics'. Much of the debate has been fuelled by the inability of neoclassical economics to explain the continued existence, and increasing importance, of small enterprises. Developments in agency theory, information asymmetry and signalling theory, and transaction cost economics are identified as contributing to a new approach. The concepts distilled from a review of these developments are then used in the analyses of well-known phenomena involving small enterprises. These include capital structure and access to capital markets featuring the finance gap, the underpricing of new issues and the small firm effect. In addition, going private, by means of management buy-outs, and franchising are examined. It is seen that the economic literature on finance, ownership and control helps to explain both the advantages and disadvantages of small enterprises. Their continued existence is seen as being due to a trade-off of various costs and benefits.

This study uses a large, micro data set to present evidence which suggests that owners of regulated electric utilities have little incentive to structure CEO compensation packages in an effort to curb potential expense preference behavior. Because such potential behavior occurs, or would occur, at no cost to the firm (or the firm's owners), little incentive exists to structure compensation schemes in a way that would curb such behavior (e.g. by compensating them with incentive bonus plans and stock options). The results presented here augment those which examine other industries (e.g. banking) in an effort to point out the relationships between ownership organization, political involvement and expense preference behavior.

This study investigated the tenability of agency theory in explaining the structure of compensation for salespeople in the Singapore context. Results based on personal visits to 90 small retail clothing stores located at shopping centers throughout Singapore, with responses from 180 salespersons, store owners, and supervisors, showed that agency theory was robust in explaining the extent of outcome-based compensation used in rewarding salespeople. Risk sharing factors (e.g., the principal's risk aversion and average purchase size) were more prominent than monitoring factors (e.g., number of stores owned by the principal) in explaining the structure of compensation for salespeople in the industry.

This research investigates the relationship between reputation and two types of agency costs, namely those associated with auditing and those associated with value-reducing activities of management resulting from their capitalizing on asymmetric information by misreporting income. A competitive-market model is used as a basis for developing and empirically testing hypotheses using an experimental-markets approach. This model includes (1) contracting between risk- neutral owners and risk-averse managers that allows risk sharing, (2) information asymmetry favoring managers over owners, (3) public financial reporting by managers, (4) the presence of endogenously-priced costly auditing that can be demanded by either management or owners, and (5) opportunities for managers to engage in value-reducing activities that are not directly observable by the owners. Two main hypotheses are set forth, both of which are found to be supported by formal statistical tests based on the data from the experimental markets as conducted in this study: (1) reputation effects reduce total agency costs. Further, these results show that agency cost reductions from reputation effects include both an increased rate of honest reporting by managers and a reduction in the demand for auditing by owners; and (2) the market rewards honesty and penalizes dishonesty in reporting.

In this study, two different theoretical perspectives are used to develop sets of hypotheses regarding the mechanisms used to manage foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations. First, agency theory serves as the basis for a model that predicts the use of monitoring mechanisms and incentive compensation. Then, it is argued that these mechanisms are insufficient for managing subsidiaries characterized by high levels of intra-firm international interdependence, the management of which is critical to many of today's complex global firms. A second set of hypotheses is argued, linking international interdependence to several social control mechanisms. Primary and secondary data from U.S. based multinational corporations were used to test both sets of hypotheses. The results indicate that agency theory, although a useful foundation for studies of control within MNCs, is limited in its ability to explain fully the phenomenon of foreign subsidiary control, however, the model based on intra-firm interdependence had much greater predictive ability.

The ineffectiveness of several privatized firms within emerging economies underscores the importance of agency theory issues and their impact on the privatization-performance relationship. We argue that weak governance and limited protection of minority shareholders intensify traditional principal-agent problems (perquisite consumption and entrenchment) and create unique agency problems (expropriation). We suggest that postprivatization performance can be enhanced by using appropriate ownership, management, and corporate structures that mitigate agency problems in the context of weak governance, and we highlight avenues for research.

The paper investigates the agency argument that sales growth in firms with free cash flow (and without strong governance) is less profitable than sales growth for firms without free cash flow. It also tests whether strong governance conditions improve the performance of firms with free cash flow and/or limit the investments in unprofitable sales growth. Consistent with agency theory, firms with free cash flow gain less from sales growth than firms without free cash flow. But different governance conditions affect sales growth and performance in different ways. Having substantial management stock ownership mitigates the influence of free cash flow on performance, despite allowing higher sales growth. In contrast, outside blocks held by mutual funds reduce sales growth substantially, but does not increase performance from sales growth. Copyright (c) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to relate the extent of disclosure in the annual reports of French listed companies to some economic determinants. The sample includes the 1995 annual reports of 102 randomly selected industrial and commercial firms. The extent of disclosure is measured by an index based on financial and non-financial discretionary information. The model of hypothesis explaining voluntary disclosure is defined as the interplay of contradictory forces: inducements deriving principally from agency theory and limitations imposed by information costs. The results reveal that voluntary disclosure is significantly related to size, foreign activity and to a proxy for proprietary costs. (c) 2000, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Outsourcing affects thousands of companies and employees every year. Recent studies indicate that 85 per cent of all companies outsource at least one function generating billions of dollars in outsourcing contracts (ElmutiElute, KathwalaKithara & Monippallil, 1995). Transportation is one of outsourcing's biggest players. Many outsourcing attempts have proved unsuccessful and recent articles blame these failures on failed outsourcing relationships. This paper addresses these failed relationships and suggests two possible solutions to the problem. The first solution is to diagnose the relationship from both sides of the contract. The second suggestion is to engage agency theory to help design the types of contracts and relationships necessary to provide and support an environment of trust. (c) 2000, MCB UP Limited

Franchising is fast becoming one of the most popular entry mode strategies for international retail companies when moving into international markets. Academic research, however, has only recently begun to examine international franchising within the context of retailer internationalization. A major gap in the literature is the nature of the international retail franchise relationship and, in particular, the mechanisms used to control and co-ordinate the international franchise network. This paper reports the findings from an in-depth, ethnographic study of the internationalization activity of one retail franchise company and examines the extent to which the marketing channels and agency theory literatures can, in practice, explain power and control in international retail franchising.

Research into accounting risk-return relations largely relied on reference-based models of managerial choice. This focus ignores other explanations that may contribute to our understanding. Our study extends prior research by incorporating agency theory and implicit contracts theory into models based on the behavioral theory of the firm. We test our hypotheses in a large sample of US manufacturing firms in two different economic environments. Our results show some support for each theory, suggesting that multiple frameworks may better explain risk-return relations. Further, differences in results between the two economic environments imply that macroeconomic conditions may be important. (c) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper builds a model of the effects of agency risk and procedural justice in the boards of directors of venture capital-backed firms. Such boards are unique in that they consist of managers and outside owners with significant power and incentive to be highly involved in venture governance. The authors integrate agency theory and procedural justice perspectives to develop propositions regarding the effects of agency risk and board processes on the responses to poor performance and conflicts of interest. This integrated perspective suggests that factors that increase perceived agency risks will increase outsiders' tendency to focus efforts on monitoring and controlling board decisions and their propensity to resort to formal means to resolve conflicts. However, the authors suggest that through their effects on trust and positive attributions, fair procedures and interactions will reduce these tendencies. A discussion of the practical and theoretical implications of the proposed model concludes the paper. (c) 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Using both agency and institutional theories, we examined factors associated with the board's adoption of a formal process for evaluating the performance of the corporation's chief executive officer (CEO). Our sample was drawn from the hospital industry. Results show that an independent board chairperson, the level of market competition and the degree of managed care penetration were significant predictors of whether or not the board had adopted a formal CEO evaluation process. These findings imply that initiatives to improve governance effectiveness based on agency theory should take into account the institutional environment of corporate boards.

Because shark repellents decrease the vulnerability of firms (and their incumbent managers) to the market for corporate control, the decision to adopt these devices represents an excellent test of agency theory. In this empirical study, we examined the relationships between the adoption of shark repellents and several mechanisms that, according to agency theory, should align the interests of corporate board members and shareholders and/or make directors more effective monitors of management behaviour. Of the variables included, only board stock ownership (especially by employee directors) was linked to a reduced propensity to adopt shark repellents in the predicted manner. Two variables not immediately associated with agency theory - the proportion of inside directors appointed by the incumbent chief executive officer (CEO) and a lower ratio of CEO compensation to the compensation of other top executives - were linked to higher rates of shark repellent adoption. Given that agency theory explains relatively little of the variance in shark repellent adoption, we advocate serious consideration of other theoretical formulations for corporate governance, including two approaches -stewardship theory and agent morality - that take the moral ('other regarding') obligations of directors seriously.

Audit committees have become more important and prevalent in recent years but there is a relative paucity of empirical research concerning their value. This paper contributes to this research by reporting an analysis of the relationship between the size of the audit fee and the existence of an audit committee. The analysis builds on previous research in this area in several ways. First, it uses more recent data than previous research which may have been influenced by transitional problems. The data in this paper were collected from financial reports for the years ending in 1994 and 1995. Second, it investigates the effect on audit fees of audit committee adherence to the Cadbury Committee Report recommendations of 1992. Finally, the analysis is set within a theoretical framework developed from agency theory. The results suggest that audit committees have been through a transitional phase comprising changes to the general audit environment and a learning phase for the establishment and operation of committees. By 1995 there is no evidence that audit committees, whether adhering to the Cadbury Code or not, have any overall effect on audit fees. The only effect found was a reduction in fees due to improved internal controls in the presence of auditee complexity. There was evidence that size was the main determinant of the presence of an audit committee. (c) 2000, MCB UP Limited

The separation of ownership and control can lead to managerial entrenchment and a convergence of decision making and decision control. Decision-making refers to management's authority to make strategic and operating decisions while decision control refers to the ratification and monitoring of management decisions. Managers that possess decision control may behave in a risk-reducing manner relative to the behavior of owner managers because of management's desire to maximize job security (Amihud and Lev 1981; McEachern 1975). For example, the managers of such firms may choose to diversify the firm into a wide variety of industries in an attempt to smooth revenues and earnings and avoid a series of peaks and valleys in the company's financial performance. These managers may believe that stable earnings will be viewed positively by shareholders and should help lessen the risk of stockholder action to replace upper-level management. Managers that possess both decision-making and decision-control capabilities may pursue a variety of risk-reducing strategies in addition to broad diversification. The existence of large outside investors has been shown to result in management becoming less risk-averse; management is more willing to adopt a wide range of strategies that present greater risk, but offer greater returns to shareholders. Hill and Snell (1988) found a significant, positive correlation between stock concentration and R&D intensity, indicating that large outside beneficial owners or dominant stockholders can influence management to pursue higher risk-higher return strategies. R&D intensity is used as a proxy for innovation and is generally operationalized as a firm's industry-adjusted R&D expenditures as a percentage of its sales. Findings of other studies also suggest that large investors are associated with decreased risk aversion by management. When controlling for the effects of time, previous R&D spending, liquidity, market share, diversification, market concentration, industry, and leverage, Hansen and Hill (1992) found a mild positive correlation between institutional stock concentration and R&D spending. This paper examines management's ability to utilize employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) to facilitate managerial decision control or the capability to ratify and monitor decisions and subsequently adopt greater risk-reducing behavior. It is possible that management may adopt an ESOP to enhance entrenchment by placing a large block of the company's shares under the control of company managers and employees that are under the supervision of management. As a result, some ESOPs may not be effective alignment mechanisms since participants may find it difficult to organize a vote against management proposals or generate adequate enthusiasm and momentum to replace top-level managers. The paper anticipates that a positive relationship exists between the degree of ESOP stock concentration and the reduced risk-taking behavior of management. Specifically, the study argues that as ESOP stock concentration increases, management will likely behave in a risk-reducing manner and decrease its commitment to innovation, as measured by R&D intensity. Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) are qualified retirement plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and are treated similarly under the Act to other qualified pension plans with the exception of portfolio diversification. Employee stock ownership plans consist only of shares of the employer's stock and the performance of an ESOP-based retirement fund hinges with the market performance of that single stock. An agency theory framework would suggest that ESOPs that control large blocks of outstanding shares have an effect on management similar to that of other large investors and act to encourage management to craft and implement strategies that will yield superior financial and market performance. As ESOP stock concentration increases, agency theory proposes that ESOP participants would readily act to protect their interests and the interests of other shareholders. However, some previous research suggests that large ESOPs are not alignment mechanisms, but further entrench current management into their positions. Gordon and Pound (1990) found that management can use large ESOPs to increase effective insider ownership to protect against unwanted changes in corporate control. The authors suggested that ESOPs were less effective than other types of large investors at monitoring management decisions since ESOPs are unilaterally undertaken by management, ESOP shares are held only by incumbent managerial and non-managerial employees, and ESOP trustees are frequently appointed by management. The market has been shown to view an ESOP as a management entrenchment mechanism when the ESOP was adopted as a possible takeover defense (Chang 1990; Dhillon and Ramirez 1994). The market reacts more favorably to an ESOP adoption when other large outside shareholders are present who have the capability to offset the influence of inefficient managers who might choose to use the ESOP to further entrench themselves into their positions (Park and Song 1995). The results of this study find that after the implementation of an ESOP, R&D intensity decreases as ESOP stock concentration increases. A significant negative relationship exists between ESOP stock concentration and change in industry-adjusted R&D intensity at the 0.05 level when controlling for firm size and change in profitability. The sample included firms where ESOP stock concentration represented as little as 3% of the employer's outstanding shares and as much as 67% of all outstanding employer stock. The sampled firms with the greatest ESOP stock concentration were associated with the greatest decreases in industry-adjusted R&D intensity after the implementation of the ESOP. The results suggest that management of high ESOP stock concentration firms became more risk-averse in regard to commitment to innovation after implementation of the ESOP. Agency theory adequately explains the effect of large outside stockholders on management's choice of strategy. Hill and Snell (1988) and Hansen and Hill (1992) have found that as stock concentration increases, incentive alignment becomes increasingly likely. The independent nature of large outside blockholders contributes to a separation of decision making from decision control, a reduction in agency costs, and a minimization of managerial risk-reducing behavior. As highly independent blockholder size decreases, decision making and decision control converge, and management entrenchment is more probable. Agency theory fails to adequately explain the effect of employee stock ownership on managerial risk-reducing behavior. Employee stock ownership does have the capability to align shareholder and employee interests under the proper conditions. However, ESOPs lack independence from managerial influence and are much less likely than outside institutional investors to monitor management decision-making and pressure management to adopt strategies that incorporate greater risk and an opportunity for greater returns. The study found that increased ESOP stock concentration was associated with greater managerial risk-reducing behavior. The results suggest that agency effects are more likely in firms with modest ESOP stock concentration since the ESOP does provide incentives for an alignment of interests, but does not provide management with a mechanism to block the actions of other large blockholders. ESOPs with higher levels of stock concentration are likely to facilitate management entrenchment by preventing some large percentage of shares from aligning with other large shareholders to challenge management decision-making. If other investors lack the capability to put full pressure on management, the monitoring and ratification of management decisions has been yielded to management. Therefore, a managerial entrenchment hypothesis is better suited than agency theory in explaining the effect of large ESOPs on management's risk-reducing behavior. (c) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

This study extends the work of Kesner (1988) and Bilimoria and Piderit (1994) in examining the determinants of compensation committee composition. Consistent with their findings, my results suggest that the likelihood of compensation committee membership is significantly related to director type (i.e., outside vs. inside), length of board tenure, and the number of other directorships held. In addition, my results suggest that committee membership also depends on director age, and the number of other committee memberships served. Importantly, in contrast to the predictions of agency theory, I find that committee membership is only marginally related to director affiliation, and unrelated to outside director stock ownership. Together, these results provide mixed, somewhat weak evidence that firms staff their compensation committees with directors that are likely to protect shareholder interests.

This paper assesses the effects of Berle and Means' study of the separation of corporate ownership from control on corporate financial reporting theory, research and policy. Their focus on shareholders and managers provided a starting point for the subsequent development of agency theory such that this relationship has come to dominate capital markets research and policy, to the virtual exclusion of parallel issues involving other parties. Berle and Means' omission of the role of investment funds led them to conclude that the separation of ownership from control problems was located between shareholders and company managers. We document the inaccuracy of this conclusion using historical and contemporary US evidence and contemporary evidence for Germany, Japan, South Africa, and Canada. In contrast to Berle and Means, we find that investment fund influence and control over companies is pervasive and probably a common characteristic of modern capital markets. Our analysis shows how viewing the capital markets setting from a richer, two-tier perspective involving investors, investment managers, and company managers results in quite different and better perspectives on financial reporting issues, particularly in terms of company reporting to funds, and fund reporting to investors. Consequently, we suggest that our understanding of capital markets may be improved by studying and portraying more diverse types of parties and their relationships than just managers and owners. This perspective subsumes the single-tier principal-agent model and allows multiple relationships to be portrayed and studied. (c) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Increasingly, the equity investments of individual investors are being channeled through financial institutions. This article posits that the role of institutional owners as financial intermediaries, and the resulting complexity that institutions bring to ownership, distinguish institutional ownership from individual ownership. I develop a model of institutional ownership, referred to as the nexus agency model (NAM), which reflects this complexity. The model provides a framework for identifying the potential additional agency costs to beneficial owners that are associated with owning via financial institutions. The degree to which owning via institutions benefits individual owners depends on the adequacy of the legal and regulatory environment and governance mechanisms in protecting individual owners' interests. The applicability of the nexus model to different institutional owner types is then demonstrated in a discussion of U.S. public and private pension plans and mutual funds, leading to the generation of a NAM-based research agenda for each type and across the types. The article ends with discussion of the model's applicability to non-U.S. institutional environments. (c) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Agency theory emphasizes the role of ownership, control and incentives in encouraging managers to improve efficiency. Owners often tie managers to contracts that reduce conflict of interest between owners and managers. The differences between alternative business ownership structures have been investigated. According to theory, we expect managers with an outcome-dependent dealer contract to be more efficient than managers with a more integrated and less performance based employee dealer contract. We also analyse how competitive pressure might reduce the moral hazard problem and therefore affect contract design. Berle and Means (The Modern Corporation and Private Property, Macmillan, New York, 1932) long ago stated that the market mechanism could constrain the agency problem. Even so, this problem has scarcely been investigated empirically. This paper also considers the contractual effect of potential monitoring costs, education and relationship age in a model tested on data from 175 dealer contracts in a multinational oil company.

An important aspect of current governance practice is the utilisation of non-executive directors to monitor the behaviour of senior management. The purpose of this paper is to provide an initial insight on the determinants of non-executive representation on the boards of large UK companies. The study adopts an agency theory perspective, focusing specifically on the impact of company size and ownership on non-executive representation. I find that larger companies, where monitoring via ownership is expected to be less efficient, utilise higher levels of non-executive representation. I also find that non-executive representation is positively associated with the ownership of external blockholders. The presence of CEO/chairman duality has a negative impact on non-executive representation. Overall, the findings suggest that companies utilise boards with stronger monitoring potential when size and ownership characteristics suggest that alternative governance mechanisms may be unable to ensure managers pursue shareholders' interests.

Unlike two big European tobacco monopolies ---the French monopoly and the Italian one---, which almost always were managed by the State, the management of Spanish tobacco monopoly was leased out for over a century to two companies very related: the Compania Arrendataria de Tabacos (1887-1945) and Tabacalera (1945-1998). This paper provides an explanation of this situation analising the kind of companies they were from the standpoint of State regulation, ownership structure and management control and also using some principles of the Agency's Theory and the Economic Regulation's Theory.

The purpose of this research is to examine determinants of royalty rates in restaurant franchising from a monitoring costs perspective utilizing agency theory. The primary hypothesis of the study is that agency costs associated with monitoring franchisees are inversely related to royalty rates levied by the franchisor. Agency problems specifically related to monitoring costs of franchise contracts are identified. An empirical model for monitoring costs in relation to royalty rates is developed to test a series of hypotheses. Empirical evidence largely supports the primary hypothesis that when the franchisor perceives monitoring activities are difficult and/or costly, the franchisor tends to lower royalty rates to induce the franchisee's efforts.

Does owner management necessarily eliminate the agency costs of ownership? Drawing on agency literature and on the economic theory of the household, we argue that private ownership and owner management expose privately held, owner-managed firms to agency threats ignored by Jensen's and Meckling's (1976) agency model. Private ownership and owner management not only reduce the effectiveness of external control mechanisms, they also expose firms to a "self-control" problem created by incentives that cause owners to take actions which "harm themselves as well as those around them" (Jensen 1994, p. 43). Thus, shareholders have incentive to invest resources in curbing both managerial and owner opportunism. We extend this thesis to the domain of the family firm. After developing hypotheses which describe how family dynamics and, specifically, altruism, exacerbate agency problems experienced by these privately held, owner-managed firms, we use data obtained from a large-scale survey of family businesses to field test our hypotheses and find evidence which suggests support for our proposed theory. Finally, we discuss the implications of our theory for research on family and other types of privately held, owner-managed firms.

An agency theory framework is used to test the effects of founding family control on firm performance, capital structure, and value. Both the finance and management literatures regarding the relationship between firm control and firm value are explored. Controlling for size, industry, and managerial ownership, the results suggest that firms controlled by the founding family have greater value, are operated more efficiently, and carry less debt than other firms.

This paper analyzes the link between economics and the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm. Although, historically there has been a strong link between the disciplines of strategy and economics, explicit citations of key RBV works has been disappointingly low in mainstream economics journals. However, there are substantial bodies of works that build implicitly on the ideas of the RBV, in particular the consequences of path dependency on firm behavior, to explain a number of different economic issues. The issues we review in the paper are all influenced by path dependency and include: (1) diversification and market entry, (2) corporate refocusing, and market exit, (3) explaining innovative activity among firms, (4) diversification and performance and (5) industry evolution with rapidly changing products. Furthermore, we identify a number of reasons that may have limited the explicit use of the RBV in economics, which include the problems of causal ambiguity, tautology and firm heterogeneity. Finally, potential areas for future research are identified, which include the interaction of the RBV and Agency Theory, the RBV as a dynamic theory, using the RBV to explain radical change and the application of the RBV to issues of antitrust.

Co-operative firms have been the subject of criticism by many economists, who base their arguments on property rights and agency theory: members do not control management, investments are short term, accumulated investments are below the economic optimum, etc. Nevertheless, many co-operative organisations do function well for their members. An analysis of the assumptions underlying the criticism reveals that this is not generally justified. As it focuses mainly on the functioning of capital markets, it disregards the vertically integrated character of the co-operatives, i.e. that their purpose is to counteract market failures on product markets. For many co-operatives, however, the critique is valid. Individual ownership in the form of tradable residual rights is thus motivated in many co-operatives. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The corporatization reform in Chinese SOEs has been largely influenced by the Anglo-American corporate governance model, but at issues is whether or not this model suits China's current institutional and cultural contexts. Agency theory and stewardship theory are two corporate governance theories that provide conflicting assumptions about human behavior and different prescriptions about governance mechanisms. In this study we drew upon both theories and developed competing hypotheses about the relationships between board composition, leadership structure, and organizational performance in Chinese shareholding companies. We gave special attention to China's unique institutional context and its influence on board attributes. The hypotheses were tested with a sample of Chinese listed companies. Overall, the stewardship hypotheses received stronger empirical support. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

In this paper, we discuss agency theory in the context of the individual principal and agent, and also in the context of the organization and its groups. Agency theory is examined in the context of goal orientation, obligation and reciprocity, risk, and self-interest. We offer propositions given agency theory's assumptions. We also extend agency theory and offer alternative propositions based on a relaxing of agency theory's assumptions. In relaxing the assumptions of agency theory, insights from outside the agency literature, specifically from behavioral theories are used. Implications of agency theory and the extension of this theory are also discussed in relation to outcomes associated with economic exchanges. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

We challenge the implicit assumption that entrepreneurs are the sole owners of their young firms and we suggest that because cutting-edge innovation projects are complex, they create substantial information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and their investors. Linking previous research on governance, entrepreneurship, and innovation, we ask what forms of governance and incentive systems are conducive to spur and implement innovation among young entrepreneurial firms. Using agency theory and building on the rich literature on governance, we make eight practical suggestions regarding the governance of young entrepreneurial firms. We suggest that early and effective governance systems may help entrepreneurs and investors work in alignment with each other's best interests. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

In Asia, the recent catastrophic decline in regional stock markets, continuing currency crisis and failures of major financial institutions and industrial corporations have increased domestic and international interest in corporate governance. Nowhere is this greater than in Japan where financial institution reform has catapulted this to the fore. In this paper, we use agency theory and institutional theory, together with comparative case examples, to derive some propositions on the dynamics of changing corporate governance systems in Japanese firms. We argue for the co-existence of stakeholder and shareholder-centered corporate governance systems in Japan. This argument has an important implication for corporate governance research and agency theory. Namely, changes in ownership structure and institutional expectations would force firms to focus on maximizing shareholder value even where the interests of stakeholders are more emphasized. It suggests an environmental selection mechanism to ensure the emergence of appropriate corporate governance mechanisms to solve the agency problem. Further, the loss of competitiveness and the prolonged poor performance of firms can change the institutional norms to emphasize asset efficiency and transparency rather than stability and business ties.

In this study it is argued that positive agency theory is a relevant theoretical perspective in studies of the balanced scorecard in business management because agency theory addresses implementation and organizational control issues. If the balanced scorecard is to be applied also in public management, then positive agency theory should be complemented with political economy to incorporate possible implementation and organizational control issues related to political uncertainty, common agency and implementation ambiguity. It is argued that uncritical application of the balanced scorecard in public management could result in dysfunctions common in Soviet-type, central planning. However, such dysfunctions could be reduced with certain modifications of the balanced scorecard in order to facilitate political competition to a relatively larger extent. (c) 2001, MCB UP Limited

Adapting well-established organization theories to international joint ventures (IJVs), this paper develops an overarching theoretical model of the determinants and effects of parent control of IJVs from an interpartner bargaining power perspective. Drawing upon power dependence, transaction costs, and agency theories, we argue that the relative bargaining power between IJV partners serves as the key determinant of control structure, and that control exerts a direct effect on the venture's performance. In addition, government influence and interpartner working relationship are critical factors that complicate the linkage between control and performance but may help to explain past conflicting results. Propositions regarding these relationships are formed for future empirical test, and implications and directions for future research are provided. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

This paper examines the cross-sectional relation between ownership structure and corporate performance of a sample of 434 manufacturing firms listed on the Chinese stock exchange. Following the agency theory and taking other influential factors into account, such as firm size, leverage ratio, variance of sales, growth of sale and firm age, the results suggest that there is a strong relation between ownership concentration and corporate performance, measured by Tobin's Q. A further classification of owners reveals that while shares held by state play a negative role in corporate governance, domestic institutional and managerial shareholdings improve the firms' performance.

This study is among the first to systematically evaluate the role of foreign ownership (volume of ownership and board representation) on self-interested strategizing behavior of organizational managers. Building on agency theory, strategic management and organization theory literatures, it argues that the volume of foreign ownership is unlikely to have any bearing on the extent of unrelated diversification that managers pursue. However, the level of foreign representation on the board of directors is likely to dampen such strategies. Results from the empirical examination set in India provide support for this line of reasoning. Contributions, implications and future extensions are explored. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Despite Stock Option Plans' (SOPs) widespread use, evidence regarding their use and their effectiveness is relatively sparse and typically relies on an agency theory perspective that emphasizes the principal's interests in a market context. This study focuses on the agent as an individual who is involved in SOP management. Eighteen interviews with senior executives were conducted. Their responses indicate that SOPs are used to (a) initially align managemerit's incentives, (b) attract and retain key personnel, and (c) facilitate the payment of high levels of executive compensation. SOPs are successful when they are paid to employees whose actions influence stock prices. Our analysis suggests that no single theory provides a comprehensive explanation of SOP management. A critical assessment of agency theory as the dominant paradigm in executive compensation research and practice is presented, and the need for an integrated theoretical perspective for understanding SOPs is discussed.

Relying on neo-classical economics, agency theory, transaction cost economics and institutional approaches to organization, writers on the chaebol tried to highlight or elide certain organizational variables in their expositions of the growth and change of the chaebol organization. In this contribution, theoretical problems are discussed in these perspectives in explaining the chaebol, by focusing on four organizational variables: ownership and control structures, state regulation structures, inter-firm relations and technological uncertainties. These four organizational variables, despite their strengths, are found to miss some important points that are pertinent to understanding the rise of, and the current reform actions taken by, the chaebol.

Agency theory suggests that to motivate a firm's managers to act in the best interests of the firm's shareholders, managerial compensation should be directly tied to firm performance. In this study, the measure of firm performance used to test this theory is the decision by a firm to omit its common stock dividend. A dividend omission is taken to indicate that the firm's management and board of directors believe that the current and future earnings prospects (performance) of the firm are poor. In a sample of firms that omitted their dividend sometime during the years 1987 through 1992, we find that, on average, the CEOs (Chief Executive Officers) of these firms experienced significant decreases in total compensation (wealth) around the time of the dividend omission. Not surprisingly, the CEOs who experienced the greatest compensation loss were the 61.4% of CEOs who lost their jobs. The probability that a CEO would be replaced around the time of the dividend omission was found to be directly related to the CEO's age and inversely related to the firm's performance and CEO share ownership.

Deregulation during the 1980s allowed savings and loan associations to undertake many of the same activities as mutual savings banks, so that competition among thrifts increased, and they became more homogeneous in nature. At the same time, according to agency theory, mutual institutions should experience less efficient operations than stock institutions due to differences in monitoring and compensation of management. The purpose of this study, then, is two-fold: first, to determine whether mutual savings banks exhibit the same cost behaviour as savings and loans; and second, to determine whether mutual institutions are less cost-efficient than stock institutions. To compare cost structures and cost efficiencies, a three-input, three-output, translog cost frontier is estimated for mutual savings banks, mutual S and Ls, and stock S and Ls. Approximately 1500 observations, restricted to the states in which mutual savings banks are chartered, are extracted from the 1990 OTS data to be used in the estimation. Each type of institution is found to have a unique cost function. The data are then used in a second regression to determine which characteristics are correlated with the inefficiency scores. It appears that mutual savings banks do have a different cost structure than savings and loans. As well, the comparison of stock versus mutual savings and loans reveals that mutuals exhibit cost efficiency, a result that contradicts agency theory.

There has been growing recognition in recent years of the importance of corporate governance in ensuring sound financial reporting and deterring fraud. The audit serves as a monitoring device and is thus part of the corporate governance mosaic. The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of various corporate governance factors, such as the board of directors and the audit committee, on the audit process. Importantly, there is little professional guidance on how auditors should consider such factors when formulating an appropriate audit strategy, and there has been only one prior study on this issue (Cohen and Hanno 2000). Because there are no current specific auditing standards that relate to the effect of corporate governance on the audit process, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 36 auditors on current audit practices in considering corporate governance in the audit process. Reflecting on client experiences, auditors indicate a range of views with regard to the elements included in the rubric of "corporate governance". Most significantly, auditors view management as the primary driver of corporate governance. The inclusion of top management in the "corporate governance mosaic" is inconsistent with agency theory's prescription of the board and other mechanisms serving as a means to independently oversee management's actions to protect stakeholders. Auditors consider corporate governance factors to be especially important in the client acceptance phase and in an international context. Further, despite the attention placed on the audit committee in the academic literature, in the business community, and by regulators in different countries (e.g., Canada, United States, Australia), several respondents indicated that their experiences with their clients suggest that audit committees are typically ineffective and lack sufficient power to be a strong governance mechanism. Implications for research and practice are presented.

Governance of family firms differs from mainstream corporate governance in an important respect: Important owners, i.e., family members, may have multiple roles in the business. In this paper, we develop and test a model of family firm governance that incorporates both formal control and social control aspects of governance. Governance based on the formal control draws on agency theory, whereas the social control aspects draw on social theories of governance, addressing social capital embedded in relationships. Drawing on these theories, we examine the influence of different governance mechanisms on the quality of strategic decision making. The Family Business Governance Model is tested using survey data from 192 family firms in Finland. We use structural equation modeling in testing the empirical validity of the model. The empirical analysis largely supports our hypotheses on formal control and social control as well as their influences on the decision-making quality. (c) 2002, SAGE Publications.

In this article an extension of agency theory based on problems that arise in agency relationships, even when agents are assumed to be honest and dutiful, is put forward. With one exception, these assumptions lead to essentially the same predictions as in standard agency theory, suggesting that effects commonly attributed to self-seeking may be better understood as more fundamental effects of the agency relationship itself. This analysis raises a number of previously unexplored research questions concerning the nature of managerial agency relationships.

We examined the effects of unsystematic and systematic firm risk on CEO compensation risk bearing and total pay. Both the proportion of variable pay in CEO pay packages and their magnitude are curvilinearly related to unsystematic firm risk - that is, they are highest under conditions of moderate firm-specific risk. Our results are consistent with agency theory predictions that both performance-contingent pay and the greater earnings potential associated with that form of pay are highest when an agent has greater control over performance outcomes.

In this study, we examine in an agency-theoretic context the influence of executive equity stakes upon corporate strategy and firm value. We argue that beneficial, risk-increasing corporate strategies may initially be emphasized but non-value-maximizing, risk-reducing strategies may subsequently be emphasized as managers expand their stock ownership. We alternatively contend that stock options may have a consistently positive impact on firm risk taking and acquisition returns. The empirical findings are supportive of our expectations.

Some scholars have argued that CEOs may have excessive influence on their foundation's trustees to give away a portion of company profits to charitable causes in order to gain access to elite circles or support the CEO's personal causes. This may result in charitable contributions that ultimately serve the personal interests of the CEOs without regard to corporate interests or social needs. We examine the extent that CEOs appear to direct charitable giving to be compatible with their own personal interests, and if CEO participation on the foundation board affects the relationship between CEO personal interests and charitable giving. Using a sample of 160 corporate foundations, our results showed that CEOs' interests, as measured by membership in different non-profit organizations, was associated with foundation charitable giving. This association decreased, but was not eliminated, when CEOs were absent from the foundation board. Implications of these findings for researchers and managers are discussed in regards to both agency theory and stewardship theory.

This article focuses on the role of the family business shareholder. Based on Agency Theory, it examines the elements that influence the conflict of interests and objectives between nonemployed shareholders and the top management team and its impact on commitment to the family firm. Data were empirically obtained from a field study of 156 shareholders and executives of 10 Spanish family firms. Combining quantitative and qualitative data, investigation results show that the degree of commitment to the family business is negatively correlated with the number of family members on the board of directors. Nevertheless, the most robust and statistically significant correlation (positive) was found between the number of external board members and the commitment level of the nonemployed shareholders. Regarding the mechanisms and processes implemented, results depended on the attention that the family business paid to the institutional overlap of the three subsystems: ownership, family, and business.

Most empirical investigations on the disassociation between executive compensation and firm performance have been done using agency theory. Agency theory alludes to a power imbalance favorable to the executives, allowing them to pursue their self-interest in the form of large pay packages. However, because of its roots in the economic discipline, agency theory has led researchers to test financial rather than behavioral hypotheses. Over 70 years of research has been conducted on the pay-form-performance relationship, but only a few significant relationships have been found. This paper attempts to incorporate behavioral conjectures of power into the agency theory framework to provide a comprehensive approach to testing executive pay. Agency theory is combined with the resource dependency theory and with specific measures of power developed by Finkelstein (1992) for a more complete executive pay model.

Leveraged buyouts are an accepted method of restructuring, but a substantial percentage of these privately held buyouts eventually return to public trading, thus defining a public-private-public cycle of ownership. Arguments supporting buyouts have pointed to positive performance changes that occur while the firm is privately held. Such improvements, according to agency theory, are the result of changes in ownership when the firm is bought out. Since ownership patterns change substantially over the buyout cycle, performance implications of the complete cycle of changes must be considered before the true value of the buyout phenomenon can be assessed. With agency theory as a foundation for hypothesis development, we examined the performance and restructuring of 39 firms over the complete buyout cycle and found that agency theory explanations of performance are generally valid throughout the buyout cycle; i.e., increased managerial ownership leads to better firm performance. Moreover, when firms reversed buyouts and returned to public trading, we again found support for agency theory explanations. Qualitative content analysis also supported the agency theory's prediction of restructuring emphases associated with a buyout. Overall, these results suggest that agency theory is an appropriate theoretical base for explaining managerial choices during the buyout cycle. Unexpectedly, however, agency costs that were eliminated or minimized during the private buyout period did not reappear immediately following a reverse buyout. It took several years for the predicted performance declines associated with the agency costs of public ownership to reemerge. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper advances the Hunt-Vitell General Theory of Marketing Ethics as a framework for enriching current understanding of both long-term marketing relationships in general, and principal-agent associations specifically. Under economic models of agency theory, manufacturer-distributor relationships are conceptualized as principal-agent associations where both parties are assumed be motivated exclusively by short-term financial self-interest within the logical constraints of zero-sum game conditions. As a general model of ethical decision making and behavior in marketing, the Hunt-Vitell theory illustrates how ethical decisions are predicated not only upon estimations of potential benefits or outcomes (using teleological criteria), but also deontological evaluations which invoke norms and values. Furthermore, the recent ideas advanced in "relationship marketing" perspectives suggest that distribution channel associations premised upon non-zero-sum or symbiotic assumptions may be more effective and more jointly profitable. Based upon the Hunt-Vitell model, propositions are formulated that complement the understanding of agency theory within the context of marketing channel relationships, and thus, may represent a basis for more effective agency selection and interaction in marketing practice.

This study investigates variation in managers' responses to motivations to use accruals opportunistically. Agency theory suggests accounting-based contractual and governance mechanisms are imposed to limit the discretionary behavior of managers to reduce agency costs. Accordingly, managers are motivated to opportunistically use the discretion in accounting to relax constraints imposed by contractual mechanisms. This implies their accounting choices are determined, at least in part, by these contractual motivations. Existing research, however, implicitly assumes all managers respond equally to contractual motivations. This study relaxes this constraint to investigate whether managers' accounting choices conditional on contractual motivations vary with their external reputations for 'wise use of corporate assets'. All managers are unlikely to exhibit identical opportunistic behavior, and agency theory suggests organizational attributes like the manager's propensity for opportunism, are ex ante priced. Since contracting and governance mechanisms are imperfect and costly, not all variation in opportunistic tendencies from that expected in a fully efficient organization is priced away. This study exploits these predictions to document that managers with high reputations for stewardship over corporate assets are less responsive to the contractual motivations to use accruals opportunistically than are managers with lesser reputations. In other words, the results shown in this study are consistent with the hypothesis that managers' responses to contractual motivations to use accounting accruals vary with their external reputations for stewardship over corporate assets.

Developed by Stewart Myers (1984), the pecking order theory has turned out to be a spotlight in the recent trend of shifting from the traditional static trade-off optimal model to other theories as an effort to look for an explanation of corporate capital structure behaviour. This article proposes a rational justification to the pecking order hypothesis through the establishment of its relationship to the paradox Modigliana-Miller proposition I. In the process of reasoning to support our justification, we have resorted to various existing theoretical hypothesis including tax-shelter theory, bankruptcy costs theory, agency theory, signalling theory, and managerial risk aversion theory. Some implications of this rational justification to the pecking order hypothesis are also briefly discussed. (c) 2002, MCB UP Limited

This paper examines changes to the accounting system of the Spanish tobacco monopoly in 1887, following the decision by the state to lease the publicly owned and state-run monopoly to a privatesector company. The switch to private-sector management generated a fundamental change in the demands made of the accounting system. As a result, double-entry bookkeeping and a new method of calculating costs were implemented. The paper discusses the motives behind the design of the new accounting system and its consequences using the framework provided by agency theory. It highlights the need to consider the role of the capital structure of the firm and the state as explanatory factors for both the parameters and uses of cost accounting information.

The "atemporal" character of Kirzner's notion of alertness and discovery, and his insistence that entrepreneurship is independent of factor ownership have attracted many criticisms from within the Austrian camp. However, it is precisely these elements of his theory of entrepreneurship that offer important insights for the analysis of the relation between shareholders and management in the modern corporation. First of all, the Kirznerian perspective allows us to view both groups as entrepreneurial. Secondly, and contrary to modern agency theory and the Rothbardian strand of Austrian economics, it highlights the entrepreneurial role of management in introducing innovation. Finally, we argue that the Kirznerian perspective on the division of the entrepreneurial roles in the corporate firm shares some important ideas with the "resource based view" of the firm.

Current international relations theory struggles to explain both the autonomy and transformation of international organizations (IOs). Previous theories either fail to account for any IO behavior that deviates from the interests of member states, or neglect the role of member states in reforming IO institutions and behavior. We propose an agency theory of IOs that can fill these gaps while also addressing two persistent problems in the study of IOs: common agency and long delegation chains. Our model explains slippage between member states' interests and IO behavior, but also suggests institutional mechanisms - staff selection, monitoring, procedural checks, and contracts - through which states can rein in errant IOs. We evaluate this argument by examining multiple institutional reforms and lending patterns at the World Bank from 1980 to 2000.

This article consists of two parts. The first part reports findings from a survey of the issues facing top executives in 272 Canadian family firms. Results show that succession is their No. 1 concern, thus supporting the predominant focus of family business researchers on succession issues. Results also show that concern about relationships with nonfamily managers is a close second in importance. The second part of the article uses Agency Theory to explain why relationships with nonfamily managers are so important. Empirical results show that both the extent and the criticality of a firm's dependence on nonfamily managers are statistically significant determinants of the importance. This study implies that relationships with nonfamily managers is a neglected research topic and points to a new direction for research in family business management. (c) 2003, SAGE Publications.

The principal-agent theory asserts that public firms' performance is driven by efficient capital and labor markets but is silent about non-listed private companies, which are less permeable to market forces (both capital and labor) than are public companies. We propose and test a 2 x 2 framework distinguishing owner-controlled vs. agent-led firms from firms with a flat vs. multilayer organization. Our findings provide highly contrasted results and raise important issues for further study of private firms.

Executives confront potentially conflicting pressures-maximizing shareholder wealth in the long term and appeasing shareholders in the near term. Because they must address near-term pressures to preserve tenure and to realize the benefits of long-term strategies, executives are increasingly likely to seek to mollify shareholders. We develop a behavioral-agency theoretical framework for studying how stock repurchase programs are used to help top managers appease shareholders. Analysis of 250 large U.S. firms suggested that stock repurchase programs are variously a function of information asymmetry, risky stock-based incentives, and performance expectations.

Two theories have emerged in the managerial control literature as to the best way for organizations to ensure that managers are acting in the firm's best interest: agency theory, which stresses controlling decision-makers through monitoring and incentives aligned with organizational goals, and stewardship theory, which stresses that decision-makers will act in the organization's best interest even in the absence of controls. Much of the research investigating the utility of these two positions is based on archival data where actual decision-making can only be inferred. In this study, we utilize a laboratory methodology in order to determine if decision-makers actually make different decisions when under the types of control (or lack thereof) suggested in these two theories. The results of this study show that individuals under agency controls invest more in alternatives that maximize profits of an organization than individuals under stewardship controls.

Hostile takeover attempts oftentimes signal that a target firm has an over-diversified and ineffective corporate strategy. What does this signal mean when takeover attempts fail? Drawing from agency theory, we argue that target firms managed by independent directory boards are likely to ignore the takeover attempt and not refocus their firms' strategy. Conversely, target firms managed by nonindependent boards are more likely to view the failed takeover attempt as a 'wake-up call' and will refocus their firms' strategy so as to preserve the firm's survival. These arguments are tested using a sample of 76 firms that were targets of failed hostile takeover attempts. Logistic regression analyses confirm the predictions. This study suggests that in the aftermath of a failed takeover attempt board of director characteristics can help predict changes in corporate strategies.

This review evaluates the four major theories of corporate financing: (1) the Modigliani-Miller theory of capital-structure irrelevance, in which firm values and real investment decisions are unaffected by financing; (2) the trade-off theory, in which firms balance the tax advantages of borrowing against the costs of financial distress; (3) agency theories, in which financing responds to managers' personal incentives; and (4) the pecking-order theory, in which financing adapts to mitigate problems created by differences in information. These theories are conditional, not general. It is easy to find examples of each theory at work, but otherwise difficult to distinguish the theories empirically. Large, safe firms with mostly tangible assets tend to borrow more. Firms with high profitability and valuable growth opportunities tend to borrow less. Each of these tendencies is consistent with two or more of the major theories of financing. It may be possible to devise sharper tests by exporting the theories to developing economies, where agency and information problems are more severe. Further progress in understanding corporate financing decisions will require a deeper understanding of agency issues when value-maximizing operating and investment decisions cannot be observed or verified. But managers are not just temporary agents motivated by immediate pecuniary compensation or perquisites. Managers specialize their human capital to the firm. Some recent research suggests how financing can support the co-investment of human and financial capital. (c) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Agency theory implies that asset ownership and decision authority are complements. Using 1998 data from Texas commercial banks, we test whether the likelihood of local ownership of bank offices increases with the importance of granting local managers greater decision authority (for example, due to location or customer base). Our empirical evidence is consistent with this hypothesis. It suggests that complementarities between strategy and organizational structure can foster differentiation among firms in terms of location, customers, and products. It also supports the growing view that small locally-owned banks have a comparative advantage over large banks within specific environments. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This article examines the franchisor-franchisee relationship from two theoretical perspectives - agency theory and exchange theory. Taking the case of the fast-food industry in Israel, the research focuses on control and autonomy in a domestic hamburger chain - Burger Ranch - and two international chains - McDonald's and Burger King. The findings led to the design of a model that illustrates several aspects, such as the concept of franchising, the size and age of the chain, and the range of the contract, that relate to control and autonomy. The combination of agency theory and exchange theory enables us to focus on control and autonomy as multidimensional concepts, and to present various possibilities for judiciously balancing them. The case indicates that in some respects (e.g. master franchisee), the two global chains are more similar to each other than to the domestic chain. However, in other respects (e.g. size, growth rate), the domestic and one of the two global chains show more similarities than differences. The findings indicate different forms of integration of control and autonomy in the three chains. (c) 2003, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

Researchers use various definitions to describe the family firm. The characteristics of family firms that are stressed in each of these definitions are somehow related to family control. All characteristics together reflect a spectrum of family firm types along one core dimension: family involvement in the firm. However, it is more helpful to distinguish among family firms by using their precise type. Each particular family firm type is characterised by a set of agency relations within and between the family system, ownership system and the business system. This paper is a first attempt to apply the insights from agency theory on a highly simplified (reference) family firm situation where the father is full owner and the daughter manager of the family firm. Agency theory establishes the foundation for the optimal contract conditions between father and daughter. While real life is often characterised by bounded rationality and incomplete information, future research should help identify the "optimal contract" between the family/shareholders and management in various family firm types under these circumstances.

This article examines the implications of the escalation in institutional inves power and heterogeneity for two dominant theories of corporate governanceagency theory and stakeholder theory. From this analysis, a new view of the agency relationship between institutional investors and their portfolio firms emerges, which recognizes the institutions' market power, complex role as financial intermediaries, and possible involvement in simultaneous and opposing agency contracts. We also conclude that stakeholder theorists should reconsider these newly empowered shareholders'moral standing in relation to their portfolio firms, and they should reexamine the identities and goals of these modern investors. To that end, we demonstrate that a novel, intragroup application of Mitchell, Agle, and Wood's stakeholder framework to heterogeneous institutional investors illuminates their varying levels of stakeholder salience.

This paper explores the performance impact of recent changes in foreign shareholdings and boardroom reforms in Japan. Empirical research on the impact of reform on the Japanese corporate governance system could provide useful lessons for their European counterparts who are themselves facing similar pressures to reform. We found that although participation of outside directors in strategic decision-making was associated with positive stock returns, the increase in the ratio of outside directors, the separation of the board members and executive officers, and the reduction of board size were not related to firm performance.

In this paper we present empirical evidence on the attitudes of Taiwanese company directors on the role and function of the board of directors in Taiwanese corporate governance. Our findings arise from a questionnaire survey distributed to the directors of a sample of companies listed on the Taiwanese Securities Exchange (TSE). Our findings provide a picture of the current state of corporate governance in Taiwan. The respondents indicate that the board of directors constitutes the most important instrument in Taiwanese corporate governance and our findings endorse the important role played by outside directors in the corporate governance system in Taiwan. Furthermore, the respondents endorsed the agency theory perspective on corporate governance as they considered the presence of outside directors improved corporate accountability to shareholders. There is, however, evidence that few companies have created remuneration and audit committees. We also found that Taiwanese directors are dissatisfied with the influence of families on the corporate governance of listed companies and do not consider that outside directors on boards should be related to founding families. Overall, the directors displayed an awareness of accountability issues and a desire to improve accountability and transparency. They clearly want international harmonisation of corporate governance standards and view corporate governance reform as a means of attracting foreign funds into Taiwan. This is an important finding as it endorses the work of the OECD and other international bodies in harmonising corporate governance at a global level.

In spite of its considerable popularity, multi-unit franchising has been considered an anomaly from an agency theory perspective. This paper addresses this anomaly by attempting a comprehensive agency theoretic explanation of international multi-unit franchising. Although past agency theoretic examinations have mostly focused on single-unit franchising, a closer examination of the international context, which is characterized by significant geographic and cultural distance between franchisors and franchisees, suggests that multi-unit franchising may be more appropriate. This paper examines several agency problems inherent in multi-unit franchising. These include: bonding, adverse selection, information flow, shirking, inefficient risk-bearing, free-riding, and quasi-rent appropriation. Consideration of each of these problems using agency theory perspective leads to the suggestion that multi-unit franchising might address agency problems better than single-unit franchising in the international context.

Considerable differences exist between Germany and Anglo- American countries in the development of the statutory audit, the emergence of professional associations of auditors, and the legal and organizational forms of audit firms. This paper examines historical developments in Germany from the late 19th century, to the formal regulation of auditing and the audit profession in 1931. Its main objective is to provide a better understanding of the comparatively slow development of the audit in Germany and reveal attitudes towards the audit and the forms of audit firms. A secondary objective is to examine the use of agency theory frameworks for this type of historical research. The study draws on primary and secondary sources, both of which have been underutilized by previous authors. The paper finds that many of the unique features of the development of auditing in Germany and the solutions adopted there can be traced to historical differences concerning the objectives of the audit, the structure of the audit market and the foundations of the audit profession. It further adds to the critique of agency theory assumptions in historical contexts. (c) 2003, Academy of Accounting Historians. All rights reserved.

Stock compensation (particularly ESOs) has become a significant component of total compensation in some countries. While ESOs dilute stock prices, they are expected to provide incentives to employees because the employees' payoff is linked to the firm's performance. In some countries, however, there are essentially no ESOs and annual bonus is the only component of compensation that is linked to the firm's performance. The paper examines a sample of firms that are not permitted to grant ESOs but are required by law to pay an annual bonus to employees in accordance with the bonus rate specified in the firm's articles of incorporation. The research question is whether equity value of these firms is positively related to the annual bonus components, particularly stock bonus. Moreover, the analysis incorporates agency theory and considers the firm's future investment opportunities. Firms with greater investment opportunities face more severe agency problems and stock bonus is expected to provide more benefits to them. Since the incentive effect provided by stock bonus is likely to decrease as the level of stock bonus increases, due to employees' risk aversion problems, the relation between equity value and stock bonus is expected to be nonlinear.

In this article, the cost minimization model of dividends, which is underpinned by agency theory, is estimated and tested on data from 882 private sector firms listed on the Mumbai Stock Exchange for the period 1994 to 1998. Specifically, the hypothesis implied by the model is that private sector firms in India set their target payout ratios so as to minimize the sum of agency costs and the costs associ ated with raising external finance. Cross-sectional weighted least squares method ology is used, and squared and interaction terms are introduced into the model, along with a number of novel explanatory variables. It is found that government ownership, insider ownership, risk, debt, and growth opportunities, have a negative impact on the payout ratio. In contrast, institutional ownership, foreign ownership and dispersed ownership have a positive impact on the payout ratio. These results are consistent with the predictions of the cost minimization model of dividends in the context of listed companies in India. (c) 2003, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

This paper examines the financial performance effect of three corporate governance mechanisms: (i) founding family CEO, (ii) board ownership, and (iii) board independence. The developed hypotheses are tested using multivariate ordinary least-squares regression on a 3-year sample of 32 publicly traded maritime firms from Norway and Sweden, and compared to the results of the same hypotheses tested on a sample of 96 manufacturing firms. This study concludes that maritime firms with a founding family CEO have better financial performance than maritime firms with a non-founding family CEO. Support was also found for the hypothesis that a high level of board independence enhances profitability in maritime firms. Contrary to agency theory predictions, no significant relation was found between the level of board ownership and firm profitability in maritime firms, although board ownership control was significant in the sample of manufacturing firms.

This paper examines issues in the design of a co-operative member's contractual relationship with the other agents (including the remaining members) using organizational economics. The paper assumes that the central defining characteristic of a co-op is the residual claim specification. Agency theory identifies certain inherent problems of the co-op form, the horizon problem, common property problem, and non-transferability. Non-transferability both reduces the incentive to monitor and imposes limits on portfolio diversification. This paper argues that features such as claim incompleteness and non-transferability are not inherent to the co-op but may be transaction-cost economizing. The paper also argues that the pre-emptive payoff feature by which the residual claimants (the co-op members) also become fixed payoff agents can affect the risk of other agents, and is an important determinant of co-op risk. A co-op may have more than one potential residual claim base. Five generic design choices are available for handling possible multiple claim bases: battleground, pre-specified allocation, limited return, alignment, and fixed payoff. The paper uses the design of residual claims in sugar co-ops to show how a co-op can partly overcome some of the problems identified by agency theory. This illustration ties together the issues of claim incompleteness and non-transferability, pre-emptive payoff, and multiple claim bases. (c) 2003 CIRIEC.

This paper examines the circumstances in which financial reporting exists. Jensen and Meckling (1995) observe that where there are high knowledge transfer costs, then decentralisation is necessary; and that where decentralisation occurs there is a control problem, which can be addressed by providing a control system. I predict that where there are high knowledge transfer costs there will be a control system; if the control system uses financial reports, these will occur for activities with high knowledge transfer costs. The ability to decentralise is reduced where dependence makes it potentially costly to allow a subordinate to make decisions about the activity. The paper predicts that high dependence will be negatively associated with the existence of financial reports. The results confirm the predictions that financial reports are positively associated with knowledge transfer costs and negatively associated with dependence. (c) AFAANZ, 2003.

This study combines elements of the upper echelons and agency perspectives to resolve some of the ambiguity surrounding how corporate elites affect corporate strategy. We propose and test the notion that while differences in individual characteristics of corporate elites may imply different preferences for particular corporate strategies such as diversification and acquisitions, these basic preferences, when situated in different agency contexts (e.g., CEO, outsider director, non-CEO top management team member), generate very different strategic outcomes. Our detailed empirical findings, based on extensive longitudinal governance and corporate strategy data from large U.S. corporations, also highlight the pitfalls of using aggregate units of analysis (e.g., board of directors or top management team) when studying the influence of corporate elites on corporate strategy.

As franchising has increased its visibility and impact on the business landscape, it has attracted the attention of a wide variety of researchers from different academic backgrounds. We draw together much of this research by juxtaposing the two key theories used to explain franchising, resource scarcity and agency theory, with the empirical findings regarding three key franchising constructs-franchise initiation, subsequent propensity to franchise, and franchise performance. We suggest that research emphasis needs to shift toward understanding why firms initiate franchising and how franchising impacts different types of organizational performance. We also find that extant research can benefit from additional theoretical diversity and thus we offer new propositions grounded in three theories not yet widely applied to franchising.

In this article, we document the growing influence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the realm of socially responsible investing (SRI). Drawing from ethical and economic perspectives on stakeholder management and agency theory, we develop a framework to understand how and when NGOs will be most influential in shaping the ethical and social responsibility orientations of business using the emergence of SRI as the primary influencing vehicle. We find that NGOs have opportunities to influence corporate conduct via direct, indirect, and interactive influences on the investment community, and that the overall influence of NGOs as major actors in socially responsible investment is growing, with attendant consequences for corporate strategy, governance, and social performance.

This study investigates the structure of the board of directors at socially responsible (SR) firms. Using a sample of 394 SR firms and comparing these to a matched sample of firms, I find that SR firms have characteristics associated with effective board structures. For instance, SR firms have more outsiders and women directors, and less instance of CEO/Chairman duality than non-SR firms. Results are similar when using a continuous measure of social responsibility. Also, I document that SR firms have higher Governance Index scores than the matched sample. Overall, this suggests that a reason for shareholders' appeal in socially responsible firms and mutual funds may be because these firms have stronger governance mechanisms in place than do non-SR firms. In addition, it appears that effective governance structures are more likely to exist in firms that focus on a broad range of stakeholders, rather than in firms that have a strict focus on shareholder wealth maximization.

The role of the board of directors in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. However, research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies: the lack of an overarching theoretical perspective, reliance on proxies for the strategy role rather than a direct measure of it and the lack of quantitative data linking this role to firm financial performance. We propose a new theoretical perspective to explain the board's role in strategy, integrating organisational control and agency theories. We categorise a board's approach to strategy according to two constructs: strategic control and financial control. The extent to which either construct is favoured depends on contextual factors such as board power, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry.

We explore impression and earnings management via reasoning and methods grounded in ethnostatistics and agency theory. We hypothesized that earnings management occurs more frequently following duality-creating successions than otherwise because CEO-chairs have greater control of the impressions created by their firms' financial reports and are operating under greater expectations of positive results. Using a sample of 173 duality-creating succession announcements and 112 non-duality-creating succession announcements, we obtained empirical results consistent with these predictions.

Prior research on the relationship between corporate controls and firm performance is premised on the notion that, in theory, there is direct association between corporate governance and firm performance. However, extensive research has produced mixed and often weak results. In this paper, we posit, as a primary relationship, a negative association between growth and firm performance and then examine whether corporate governance variables moderate this negative relationship. Our results support this notion and show that the role of corporate governance variables in firm performance should be evaluated in the context of the firm's external environment measured in this study in terms of growth opportunities.

Agency theory assumes that employees and employers have different goals, act in a self-interested manner, and are willing to assume varying degrees of risk. In this paper, we argue that cultural differences may attenuate those assumptions and thereby temper agency theory predictions. Culture may align goals between employers and employees, change a company's preference for behavior- versus outcome-based pay, require higher incentives before employees will accept outcome-based pay, and lower the moral hazard concerns associated with outcome-based pay. Based on those arguments, we develop propositions that can be tested empirically. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A curious ownership structure is found in Northern Europe-foundations that own and operate business companies. The foundations are non-profit entities, they have no members and no owners, and they cannot be dissolved. In many cases, these entities control more than 50% of the votes in successful international companies. Obviously, this structure completely blocks the market for corporate control, but it also violates other basic principles of agency theory and corporate finance. Nevertheless, we present evidence that a sample of foundation-owned companies listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange are at least as efficient as other listed companies in terms of risk adjusted stock returns, accounting returns and Tobin's Q. Thus, they question whether profit-seeking ownership is a necessary condition for competitive enterprise. (c) 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This paper describes the results of a field experiment involving 400 employees from ten financial institutions operating within the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone of the People's Republic of China. It was found that, when faced with an agency-based problem, employees indicated they would be less inclined to advise management of the existence of unethical work practices. Younger employees without supervisory experience displayed significant risk aversion. Traditional Chinese values associated with Confucian work dynamism, were shown to be poor predictors of moral choice response. A parsimonious regression model was developed that provides evidence that the universal trait Masculinity/Femininity (Human-heartedness) acted to offset the negative influence of the agency problem. On the other hand, an operative's level of education attainment exerted a negative influence on moral response scores.

This study strives to take an extra step to sharpen the comprehension of one aspect of agency theory as well as to extend previous research by examining the role of board of directors and managerial remuneration in enhancing corporate performance in the REITs industry. The main hypothesis in this study will be twofold. First, managerial remuneration is related to corporate performance. Second, the ratio of outside directors is related to corporate performance. This study will use a sample of REIT firms as of the end of 1996. The sample will consist of the actively traded REITs listed in the public stock exchanges. The final sample that meets all the criteria includes 167 REITs. The results indicate that there is a negative relationship between cash managerial remuneration and firm performance. Moreover, this study confirms a nonlinear relationship between board size and firm performance. The relationship is negative when board size is small, and it turns positive when board size grows.

This study examines both the direct and indirect effects of chief executive officer tenure and age on CEO pay in UK organizations. It was found that the positive relationship between shareholder return and increases in the value of executive options held decreases with CEO tenure. Moreover, the positive association between changes in salary and sales was found to increase with CEO tenure. CEO age, on the other hand, weakened the relationship between the level in salary and size of the organization. Several new methodological issues relating to research on executive pay are also raised. One finding was that the study of these relationships might be better pursued through the use of non-linear functions as CEO influence over the pay setting process may not become significant until about the sixth year of tenure. These findings have implications for further research relating to executive pay and to the corporate governance process. (c) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are becoming rapidly indispensable in order for large and medium sized organizations to run their operations. Therefore, management needs to know the factors that drive successful ERP implementation, a product of the continuous interaction between the implementation consultants and client firms. Agency theory has been successfully used by different researchers to explain relationships between two parties seeking a common outcome. This paper develops a model of testable propositions for applying agency theory to study the relationship between implementation consultants and client organizations deploying the ERP systems, and to consequently evaluate how the relationship affects the implementation success.

The model suggests that IPO underpricing shouM be a curvilinear hump-shaped function of retention. A large-sample empirical exploration verifies the curvilinear relation.

This introductory chapter outlines the features of the new approach to CG that can be built by integrating the insights from the different contributions gathered in the book. Further specific theses advanced in this chapter are that the 'shareholder view' and the unabashed recommendation of pay for performance misapply agency and property right theories themselves; that CG design should be grounded in an empirically-based appreciation of preferences and motivation; that the portfolio of governance mechanisms should be enlarged to include organizational mechanisms such as negotiation, social control, and community governance; and that, contrary to common wisdom, an economic and organizational efficiency view of CG should lead to differentiated rather than homogeneous solutions, while institutional isomorphism and legitimacy may lead to inefficient convergence.

The governance structure of public corporations is determined by the agency relationship between shareholders and managers, and the agency theory predicts that deregulation of an industry leads to governance adaptation. Deregulation of the Japanese banking business in the 1980s offers an interesting case study in this framework, as Japanese banks fell into serious solvency problems in the postderegulation 1990s. This paper investigates whether ineffective governance was responsible for the plight of Japanese banks. The sample is 384 corporations that were listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange between 1983 and 1990, which includes 59 banks. One of the findings is that bank shareholders allowed more diffuse ownership structure after deregulation, which demonstrates that the agency theory did not hold for shareholders of Japanese banks.

Agency theory starts with the assumption that people act in their own self-interest, and holds that under normal conditions, the goals, interests, and risks of two actors (principal and agent) are not identical. This means that the agent will not necessarily act according to the interests of the principal. CEO compensation is the type of control mechanism that companies employ to reduce the agency problem. This paper took 201 manufacturing companies in the year 1998 in Taiwan, and used the LISTREL 8 model to analyze the influence of company performance, scale, and board of director control over CEO compensation. The results indicate is that company performance, scale, and control by the board of directors all influence CEO compensation, with company scale the main factor, followed by company performance, and control by the board of directors. I also find that CEO compensation is higher when the board of directors' does not have effective control. Moreover, the board of directors control of a company is diminished when the CTO and chairman of the board are one person, and also when the number of internal directors is great. Conversely, the board of directors' control is increased when their ratio of stock ownership is higher. (c) 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Family firms are widely recognized as a major source of technological innovation and economic progress. Yet, over time, some family firms become conservative and unwilling to take the risks associated with entrepreneurial activities. Adopting a broad definition of entrepreneurial risk taking, this study uses agency theory to highlight key correlates of risk taking among 209 U.S. manufacturing family firms. The results show that family ownership and involvement promote entrepreneurship, whereas the long tenures of CEO founders have the opposite effect. These results urge managers to capitalize on the skills and talents of their family members in promoting entrepreneurship and selective venturing into new market arenas.

This paper examines whether the incidence of earnings management by UK firms depends on board monitoring. We focus on two aspects of board monitoring: the role of outside board members and the audit committee. Results indicate that the likelihood of managers making income-increasing abnormal accruals to avoid reporting losses and earnings reductions is negatively related to the proportion of outsiders on the board. We also find that the chance of abnormal accruals being large enough to turn a loss into a profit or to ensure that profit does not decline is significantly lower for firms with a high proportion of outside board members. In contrast, we find little evidence that outside directors influence income-decreasing abnormal accruals when pre-managed earnings are high. We find no evidence that the presence of an audit committee directly affects the extent of income-increasing manipulations to meet or exceed these thresholds. Neither do audit committees appear to have a direct effect on the degree of downward manipulation, when pre-managed earnings exceed thresholds by a large margin. Our findings suggest that boards contribute towards the integrity of financial statements, as predicted by agency theory. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.

This paper examines board effectiveness through an examination of the work and relationships of non-executive directors. It is based on 40 in-depth interviews with company directors, commissioned for the Higgs Review. The paper observes that research on corporate governance lacks understanding of the behavioural processes and effects of boards of directors. Whilst board structure, composition and independence condition board effectiveness it is the actual conduct of the non-executive vis-a-vis the executive that determines board effectiveness. Data about behaviour and relationships on boards suggest that traditional theoretical divisions between agency and stewardship theory, and control versus collaboration models of the board do not adequately reflect the lived experience of non-executive directors and other directors on the board. Developing accountability as a central concept in the explanation of how boards operate effectively enables the paper to both challenge the dominant grip of agency theory on governance research and support the search for theoretical pluralism and greater understanding of board processes and dynamics. Practically, the work suggests that corporate governance reform will be undermined by prescription that supports distant perceptions of board effectiveness but not the actual effectiveness of boards.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in international markets. This study argues that the ownership structures of SMEs influence their proclivity to take risks and expand the scale and scope of their internationalization efforts. Data from 889 Swedish SMEs reveal that internal owners (CEOs and other senior executives) tend to be risk averse and have a lower proclivity to increase scale and scope of internationalization than external owners (venture capitalists and institutional investors). The results provide interesting insights into the behavioral change of executives regarding the scale and scope of internationalization in the presence of external ownership.

To help understand how firms develop and maintain dynamic capabilities, we examine the effects of the dynamics, management, and governance of R&D and marketing resource deployments on firm-level economic performance. In a sample of technology-based entrepreneurial firms, we find that a history of increased investments in marketing is an enduring source of competitive advantage. We also find that managers' firm-specific experience positively moderates the relationship between R&D deployment intensity and economic returns. In addition, institutional ownership boosts economic returns from marketing deployments by subjecting these deployments to increased scrutiny and by sending positive signals to the market about the firm.

Note: This study investigated six dimensions of effective board performance, as suggested by Chait, Holland, and Taylor (1991), in relation to three theoretical explanations (agency theory, resource dependency theory, and group/decision process theory) of how board governance activities potentially influence organizational performance. Survey research findings revealed that strategic contributions from the board are more robust in organizations with higher financial performance. In addition, organizations that are judged to be higher performing also reported having high-performing boards across all dimensions. In particular, the interpersonal dimension provided a unique explanation of judgments of organizational performance. (c) Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Property rights theory has common antecedents with contractual theories of the firm such as transaction costs and agency theories, and is yet distinct from these theories. We illustrate fundamental theoretical principles derived from these three theories by analyzing the business case of oil field unitization. Theoretical principles and application of theory to oil field unitization are each summarized. From this, it is possible to see how property rights theory is well suited to explain business situations where inefficient economic outcomes persist. Additionally, property rights theory forges new theoretical connections with other branches of organizational economics, in particular, resource-based theory.

To date, the results of agency theory-based research exploring the impact of board composition on firms' critical decisions are equivocal. Through meta-analyses, this study reveals systematic relationships between board composition and six of the seven critical decisions examined. Interestingly, the results provide little support to agency theory's predictions on the impact of board composition on critical decisions that involve a potential conflict of interest between managers and shareholders. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2005 Southern Management Association. All rights reserved.

Good governance for SMEs is critical for economic development and growth in both developed and developing economies. In this paper we focus on boards and governance in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) by investigating the role and contribution of "outside" directors in this setting. By contrasting board role theories against different types of SMEs, firms are expected to recruit "outside" board members for various reasons. Illustrated by 52 empirical studies of "outside" directors in SMEs we show how agency theory, resource based view of the firm, and resource dependence theory can be applied to understand the multiple roles that "outside" directors can play in family firms, venture capital-backed firms and other SMEs. The illustration shows that the concept "outside" director is not the same in different theories and in different empirical settings. Based on this finding, we argue for the need to have a conscious and balanced use of theories for understanding the role and contribution of "outside" directors in SMEs.

Strategie management research has been characterized as placing less emphasis on construct measurement than other management subfields. To illustrate the consequences of measurement error, we revisit the debate on the causes of diversification. Our research suggests that the divergent findings between studies on this topic are largely the result of measurement error, and that prior work has underestimated the true effect of size in the relationships between variables.

This article investigates the relation between corporate governance and business ethics in the Asia-Pacific region. It draws on four examples of countries in the region (Australia, China, Singapore, and India), not because they are representative of certain regional characteristics, but as a means of reflecting on the diversity in this region. These countries display pronounced differences in terms of inter alia, historical development, cultural and social factors, legal system, corporate governance model, political system, and economic development. The complex interaction of all these considerations provides the context for corporate governance and business ethics in each of the countries. The article highlights different orientations to stakeholder management and integrity behavior in the boardroom and executives' offices. Although globalization and financial market hegemony suggests a convergent model is theoretically desirable, this research suggests that the human capacity to protect diversity and enshrine regional and local interests seems likely to inhibit rapid change.

This paper addresses how the global activities undertaken by multinational enterprises (MNEs) in international settings impact corporate governance mechanisms and accountability systems. International corporate governance and accountability research, whether from a political science, economics, finance, or accounting perspective, has thus far predominantly focused on the comparison of corporate governance schemes in different countries and on the investigation of institutional parameters that determine these schemes. Straying from this line of inquiry, this article discusses how globalization at the firm level affects governance and accountability systems at parent- and subsidiary-levels. It emphasizes how an MNE's globalization attributes such as globalization scale, foreign adaptation, global competition, and international experience influence the design of governance mechanisms such as board size, board composition, executive compensation, market discipline, interlocking directorate, ownership concentration, duality and inbreeding, as well as the design of accountability systems such as accounting information, auditing standards, and financial and non-financial disclosures. This article bases its conjectures on information processing and agency theories. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper attempts to investigate the determinants of the capital structure of a sample of 972 listed companies on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China in 2003. Various theories, namely, the trade-off, pecking order and agency theories, are deployed to explain and predict the signs and significance of each factor identified by Ragan and Zingales (1995) and Booth et al. (2001). Furthermore, we include institutional shareholdings, including state agency shareholdings, state-owned shareholdings and privately owned shareholdings, as corporate governance variables to examine the effects of corporate structure on the debt financing behaviours. As well documented, we find that profitability is negatively related to capital structure at a highly significant level. The size and risk of the firms are positively related to the debt ratio - but only in term of market value measures of capital structure. The years of the companies being listed on stock markets are positively related to capital structure, indicating the access of the firms to debt finance is more easily judged by book value. Tax is not a factor in influencing debt ratio. Ownership structure has a negative effect on the capital structure. The firms with higher institutional shareholdings tend to avoid using debt financing, a behaviour that can be explained by entrenchment effects. A further classification of the institutional shareholders reveals that, among the three groups of institutional shareholding, the state institutions, including state agency and state-owned institutions, were more averse to debt financing, particularly for state-owned institutions. There is no strong evidence indicating debt-averse behaviour by domestic institutional shareholders. (c) Springer 2006.

Agency theorists have put forth a number of internal control mechanisms that can reduce agency problems. These different mechanisms are substitutive and thus it is thought that both the board of directors and large external shareholders can influence CEO compensation. Stewardship theory challenges the presumption of self-interest of agency theory, holding that managers view themselves as stewards of their organisation. The first objective of this paper is to study the influence of the control of the board of directors and large external shareholders on CEO compensation. The second objective is to utilise both stewardship and agency theory to analyse the relationship between control mechanisms and compensation, and to see which theory is more applicable. This paper uses the LISREL model to study the influence that the control of the board of directors and external large shareholders has upon CEO compensation, with data drawn from samples of listed manufacturing companies between the years 1997 and 1999 in Taiwan. The following conclusions are reached: (1) the paper supports the viewpoint of stewardship theory whereby the CEO acts as a steward of his/her company when he/she also holds the position of chairman of the company. (2) The findings show that CEO compensation will be high when the board's control is relatively ineffective. (3) The shareholdings of the board of directors can reinforce the degree of control from the board. (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.

This paper draws on field study data to provide an examination of the condominium owner/manager relationship in the Australian tourism context. Although there has been considerable growth in tourism accommodation owned through strata-title, no research examining the somewhat idiosyncratic relationship between unit owners and resident managers has been found in the literature. The peculiar nature of the relationship underlines its significance as a context in which to apply the agency theoretical model. As Australian condominium resident unit managers provide letting and caretaker services for condominium unit owners, it appears that the relationship can be justifiably viewed as a principal-agent exchange (Mills, P.K., J. Business Res. 20 (1990) 31). The study specifically focuses on strata title condominiums located in major tourism regions. This sub-sector of the condominium management industry was chosen for study because it exhibits several key attributes distinguishing it from the non-tourist-based condominium sector. For example, two different parties represent the principal (resident owners and investor owners), also a significant proportion of a resident manager's work relates to the management of short-term holiday unit letting. In light of the particular agency relationship dynamics arising in large tourist-based condominium governance, several suggestions concerning the legal environment of the industry are provided.

This paper examines the relation between board composition and firm value in the presence of significant ownership concentration using publicly traded Canadian firms over the 1993-1997 period. The results indicate that greater board independence does not have a positive influence on firm value and that poorly performing firms increase the proportion of outside directors in subsequent periods. This may result from firms acting to appease unhappy investors by adding outside directors. However, the results also indicate that directors from financial institutions can provide monitoring benefits. Finally, the negative effect of dual class common stock on firm value is mitigated by board independence, the participation of officers from financial institutions and audit committee independence. These findings suggest that sound governance practices can enhance firm value in countries with high ownership concentration even in the presence of strong minority shareholder protection.

How and to what extent should a transnational corporation's governance structures be differentiated to satisfy varying strategic roles played by foreign subsidiaries? Drawing on an agency theory perspective, we examine the effects of agency problems in the headquarters-subsidiary relationships on the design of corporate governance in transnational corporations. We propose that corporate governance of foreign subsidiaries in a transnational corporation should be constructed in response to different levels of agency problems associated with varying strategic roles of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we postulate that differentiating governance structures for each foreign subsidiary is a key contingency requirement in order to achieve superior MNE performance as a whole.

This article brings forward the argument that the practical implementation of a corporate governance code cannot be realized by a compliance program alone. Its relevance in everyday business is determined by the moral values of the company culture. In this context, governance is defined as a company's resources and capabilities, including the moral resources, to take on responsibility for all its stakeholders. A critical discussion of the agency theory, transaction cost theory, and organization theory shows that such an approach is possible only when a company is not perceived as a maximizing machine for shareholders' interests but as an economic form of cooperation of internal and external resources and stakeholders. An empiric study on 22 European corporate governance codes shows that the predominant majority of European codes orientate themselves to stakeholders and the company. The discussion of the empirical data reveals six basic principles that determine all European corporate governance codes: shareholder rights, transparency, voting rights, regulation of remuneration, design of organizational structures, and corporate social responsibility.

This study analyses family businesses' growth andinternationalisation decisions, examining if being a family firm determines differences in these strategies. According to the Resources and Capabilities Theory, family firms can have limitations for internationalisation in their financial and human resources. On the other hand, the Agency Theory and the Altruism Perspective establish that altruism in family firms can drive their foreign strategies, facilitating them. Moreover, family business generation is one characteristic, specific for family firms, that can influence their strategic decisions. An empirical analysis is developed for the Spanish Family Firms in 2001 and 2002, with the main conclusion being that we do not find predetermined limits nor advantages in the foreign growth of Spanish Family Firms, with size and second family generations being the main determinants of internationalisation.

Government regulation in an industry is an intermediary in the principal-agent relationship that acts as a substitute for internal governance mechanisms. We propose a model for studying how different forms of deregulation (frame-breaking, metamorphic, piecemeal, and plodding) impact variations in the speed of adaptation of internal governance mechanisms to the theoretical predictions of agency theory and resulting performance implications. We develop illustrative propositions for a set of contingencies that moderate the above relationship. How government and firms manage the deregulatory process has important economic and social consequences.

When franchisors pursue different priorities, different agency problems become relevant, which drive the franchisors' choices among various franchising organization forms. We use archival and key informant data from a multi-industry sample of 94 franchisors to examine franchisors' choices of organization forms based on their goals for growth, uniformity and local responsiveness. Our results indicate that franchisors emphasizing high growth are more likely to use multi-unit rather than single-unit franchising and, within the multi-unit franchising form, they are more likely to use area development franchising than incremental franchising. Franchisors emphasizing uniformity instead of growth are more likely to use area development franchising, but those emphasizing local responsiveness are more likely to use incremental franchising. We discuss the implications of these results for franchising research and practice. (c) 2005, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

This paper is an exploration of the potential place, if any, for ethics in corporate governance. It begins with the influential role that agency theory has played both in the conception and reform of corporate governance. Its grounding assumption of self-interested opportunism leaves little or no room for ethics beyond what pays. This conception is then contrasted with a Foucauldian view of governance in which ethics is explored in terms of how an 'ethic' of shareholder value has been promulgated in the last decade. The third section of the paper explores the contemporaneous explosion of interest in corporate ethics and social responsibility and suggests that there is a nascent disciplinary regime being assembled which may redefine the terms of shareholder value to include environmental and social performance. What is paradoxical about both an ethics of shareholder value and corporate responsibility is that they are effective only through creating a preoccupation with the self and how the self is seen, rather than the other. The final concluding part of the paper suggests that ethics, following Levinas, should be understood in terms of sentience and the 'responsibility for my neighbour' that this assigns. Such a view of ethics refutes the individualism that agency theory takes as the essence of human nature, and Foucauldian analysis suggests is the product of disciplinary processes. Its grounding in sentience and proximity however offer it only a local role in corporate governance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study examines the business environment of Egypt, a nation at the beginning of its transition to a market economy, to determine whether national culture is associated with the use of accounting-based debt covenants in debt agreements. As a country's economy develops, agency problems occur. One method of reducing agency costs is the use of accounting-based debt covenants. While there has been extensive research on agency theory, most of this research has focused on developed nations. We examine three periods of Egyptian economic development using 140 Egyptian debt agreements. The use of accounting-based debt covenants increased significantly during each successive period of development. Proxies for each of (Hofstede, G. (1980). Culture's consequences - International differences in work-related values.

Three of the four cultural dimensions are significant when regressed on the number of accounting-based debt covenants in debt agreements. This indicates that as a country develops, national culture is associated with the control and understanding of the business process. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The paper aims to examine five assumptions of agency theory: that both investor and investee make rational decisions; future outcomes are predictable; both act in their own best interests; the investee has an information advantage over the investor; and the investee is work- and risk-averse. Design/methodology/approach: An agency framework is used to analyse the relationship between a venture capital investment house and one of its investees. Empirical evidence is provided on the nature of this relationship. Additional evidence of the post-investment performance of both parties is provided, to examine whether the contractual arrangements are conducive to good performance. Findings: There is general support for the assumptions of agency theory, and the framework is found to provide a useful basis for analysing the relationship between a venture capital investor and investee. Research limitations/implications: The paper uses case studies of one investor and one investee, and so is limited by data, coupled with a qualitative analysis. Further quantitative work should use a larger sample and statistical or econometric methods, to support the findings. Practical implications: The empirical evidence shows that an investor who is alert to such problems as agency theory implies may take steps to control adverse effects, e.g. through improved management accounting systems for monitoring and control. Originality/value: The paper gives evidence on the internal management practice of venture capital investors and investees, linked to publicly available performance measures. Thus it provides an insight into practice which will be of interest to investors, investees and academic researchers alike. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Understanding the foundations, functional utility, and implications is important both for HRD scholars and practitioners, as the field is striving to motivate productivity of employees in today's complex and dynamic workplace environment, where the ways in which business is conducted are changing. This paper contributes to our understanding of how organisational principals and agents interact and how HRD programmes and functions may benefit from the opportunity that agency theory offers to address the challenges which this phenomenon presents.

Researchers that have used agency theory predictions of monitoring and incentive alignment that focus solely on principal-agent relationships at the organizational level have been unable to rationalize the use and design of stock options within organizations. In the early 1990s, stock options were virtually free, but eventually, organizations were required to disclose the value of the options in the footnotes of their financial statements. This imperative ignited a battle between agents (and their advocates) who opposed the formal accounting of options and shareholders (and their advocates) who changed their opinions about options over time. In this article, we develop a model to explain how the varying pressures across the various stages of institutionalization cannot only explain how principals and agents are influenced by the institutional environment in making options compensation decisions, but also when and how these parties will shape institutional contexts at the field level to encourage, perpetuate, or delegitimate the stock option arrangements that these actors prefer.

In this paper, we develop an agency-theoretic extension of the Lucas asset pricing model and examine the resulting asset price dynamics. In the model, an agent of the firm can expand or contract the firm's output and dividend payments in response to exogenous shocks, although expansions become increasingly costly for the agent to maintain. Analysis of numerical simulations shows that the time-series of equilibrium asset prices exhibits both significant time-varying conditional heteroskedasticity, and longer memory persistence.

In this theoretical paper we are investigating the important question of why, in the face of strong evidence that mergers and acquisitions (M&As) do not generate returns for acquiring company shareholders, CEOs continue to pursue these strategies. Drawing on a variety of theoretical perspectives, we argue that the firm's agents (the CEO and executives) and M&A promoters (investment bankers, lawyers and other advisors) have developed non-efficiency based relationships in the context of increased competitive pressures and a crisis in corporate ethics. The key theoretical point is that the nexus between CEOs, professional advisors and boards provides a more compelling explanation for the observed merger preference phenomenon than either the agency problem or the promoter effect on their own. Implications of the model for practice, research and theory building are discussed. (c) 2005 Yoser Gadhoum.

Agency theories predict that the value of corporate cash holdings is less in countries with poor investor protection because of the greater ability of controlling shareholders to extract private benefits from cash holdings in such countries. Using various specifications of the valuation regressions of Fama and French (1998), we find that the relation between cash holdings and firm value is much weaker in countries with poor investor protection than in other countries. In further support of the importance of agency theories, the relation between dividends and firm value is weaker in countries with stronger investor protection.

This article seeks to link the domains of corporate governance, investment policies, competitive asymmetries, and sustainable capabilities. Conditions such as concentrated ownership, lengthy tenures, and profound business expertise give some family-controlled business (FCB) owners the discretion, incentive, knowledge, and ultimately, the resources to invest deeply in the future of the firm. These long-term investments accrue from particular governance conditions and engender competitive asymmetries - organizational qualities that are hard for other firms to copy, and thus, if tied to the value chain, create capabilities that are sustainable. Investments in staff and training, e.g., create tacit knowledge and preserve it within the firm. Investments in enduring relationships with partners enhance access to resources and free firms to focus on core competencies. And devotion to a compelling mission dedicates most of these investments to a core competency. When such investments are farsighted, orchestrated, and ongoing, capabilities will tend to evolve in a cumulative trajectory, making them doubly hard to imitate and thereby extending competitive advantage. Arguments are supported by making reference to the literature on corporate governance and agency theory and to emerging research on FCBs. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Agency theory suggests that the interests of opportunistic, self-interested agents conflict with those of principals. Stewardship theory suggests instead that executives' interests are aligned with company interests and that executives are thus more intrinsically motivated than agency theory implies. This study develops hypotheses regarding the psychological and situational factors that affect the applicability of each theory to executive compensation. I tested hypotheses using a unique data set of 1,238 executives from 528 private companies. Results suggest significant differences between founder-stewards and nonfounder agents that diminish with company growth, and significant effects of equity ownership and outside rounds of financing.

We examine data for Malaysia after the 1997 financial crisis to assess whether the regulatory reaction to the crisis increased the awareness of disclosure as a tool of corporate governance and reduced the influence of insider domination on voluntary disclosure. We contrast director ownership and government ownership as determinants of voluntary disclosure in Malaysian company annual reports. Additionally, we include consideration of proprietary costs by testing whether industry competitiveness has an impact on voluntary disclosure. We find that director ownership is significantly associated with the extent of voluntary disclosure while government ownership, new governance initiatives and industry competitiveness are not significant in pointing companies towards greater transparency. We conclude that, despite the upheaval of the economic crisis, traditional influences of director ownership and family domination of the board outweigh the effect of government-backed accountability initiatives in determining the extent of voluntary disclosure.

We draw on the concept of community-level social capital and apply it to the situation of a family-controlled public corporation. While traditional agency theory argues that agency costs are minimized in a family-controlled business (FCB) due to an improved alignment of owner and manager interests, we argue instead that FCBs endure additional agency costs uniquely related to the family firm organizational structure. To mitigate these additional costs, we propose that FCBs use board interlocks to build and maintain community-level social capital. That is, the intercorporate network of FCBs generates shared understandings, values, problem solving techniques, and approaches to dealing with family issues. Further, the network generates a level of social support for family business owners and managers grappling with challenges endemic to family control of public corporations. We generate a number of propositions that can be used in future research to test the theory developed here. We conclude with the assertion that the community-level social capital generated by the network of FCBs is an important reason for the survival and persistence of individual family firms, despite the existence of additional family-related costs.

The board of directors is regarded as one of the most imperative governance mechanisms in small and medium-sized family firms. Empirical studies examining both the roles these boards fulfil in a family business context, as well as evaluating the CEO's perceived importance of these roles, are scarce. Founded by a range of conceptual and multi-theoretical board role definitions, this paper contributes to the literature by empirically determining board roles. Furthermore, the importance of these board roles and differences between the board's performance and perceived importance are assessed. The results show it is indispensable to differentiate between two aggregated roles that boards in small and medium-sized family firms perform: control and service. The control role is predominantly based on agency theory, whereas the service role includes multiple theoretical perspectives. The CEOs of the family firms perceive the service role of the board as most important. However, in order to direct succession and to compensate for the owner/manager's altruistic behaviour, the board's control role should not be neglected. The acknowledgement of these two aggregated board roles and their importance may enhance future research on board roles within specific contexts. (c) 2006 Blaekwell Publishing Ltd.

This article provides an overview of the literature on nonprofit principal-agent relationships. It depicts the nature of agency theory and stewardship theory, analyzes the origin of their struggle within the nonprofit structure, and marks directions for a conciliatory approach. We open with an introduction to agency theory and discuss the two main components of its mathematical branch. We thereby contrast it with stewardship theory and elaborate on the arguments that can affect the position of nonprofit principal-agent relationships on the stewardship-agency axis. Analysis of the existing literature points to a lack of consensus as to which theory should be applied. We argue that the division of nonprofit principalagent relationships into board-manager and manageremployee interactions may help to clarify the balance between agency theory and stewardship theory and may lead to the establishment of a strongly founded theory on nonprofit principal-agent relationships. We close with a discussion of how this article may prove valuable to nonprofit policymakers and other empirical researchers. (c) Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper examines the corporate financing behaviour of listed companies in the People's Republic of China. Our results suggest that some determinants of firm leverage (e.g., size, asset tangibility, growth opportunities and profitability) commonly cited in studies on developed economies also appear to be important in China. In particular, the positive relationships that firm size and asset tangibility have with firm leverage are consistent with the predictions of the static trade-off capital structure model. However, these commonly quoted determinants function in a way different from that reported in developing countries. Moreover, we do not find that State ownership, legal person ownership and foreign ownership have important influences on the capital structure choices of Chinese firms. Given the tight regulatory control over equity issues and acute owner-manager incentive conflicts in State-owned firms, we also hypothesise, and find evidence to support, that Chinese firms have built-in incentives for raising equity. This provides one explanation of the negative effect of profitability on firm leverage and shows that some of the unique Chinese institutional features do help shape corporate financing behaviour.

This article assesses the corporate governance-related antecedents of nomination committee adoption, and the impact of nomination committees' existence and their composition on board independence and board demographic diversity. We conducted a longitudinal study of board composition amongst 210 Swiss public companies from January 2001 through December 2003, a period during which the Swiss (Stock) Exchange (SWX) introduced new corporate governance-related disclosure guidelines. We find firms with nomination committees are more likely to have a higher number of independent and foreign directors, but not more likely to have a higher number of female board members. Further, the existence of nomination committees is associated with a higher degree of nationality diversity but is not related to board educational diversity. We also find that nomination committee composition matters in the nomination of independent and foreign, but not of female directors. Our results suggest that understanding different board roles and composition require a multi-theoretical approach, and that agency theory, resource-dependence theory and group effectiveness theory help to explain different aspects of board composition and effectiveness. Finally, the article discusses the concept of diversity and appropriate ways to study diversity in a boardroom context. (c) Springer 2006.

This study investigated the tenure of CEOs in a sample of 304 listed companies in Taiwan; 63 firms were family controlled, 241 were not. The results show that CEO turnover is significantly lower in family firms and its relationship to corporate performance is negative. CEO ownership and board ownership are not significant in explaining the length of family CEO tenure. These findings imply that family boards can still effectively replace the CEO despite relatively low ownership. From the ownership structure perspective, this study suggested that the agency theory is applicable for nonfamily firms in Taiwan, but unsuitable for family firms.

Purpose - This study seeks to examine the influence of board independence, CEO duality and ownership structure on the firm financial distressed status using a sample of distressed companies and a matched-pair sample of non-distressed companies listed on the Bursa Malaysia. Design/methodology/ approach - This study utilized publicly available data from annual reports of a sample of 86 non-finance distressed firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia and a sample of matched 86 non-distressed firms for a period covering the 1999-2001 financial years. Findings - Board independence and CEO duality are not associated with financial distressed status. Management and non-executive directors' interests are associated negatively with financial distress. A negative association is also documented for outside blockholders. The evidence also supports the contention that ownership by non-executive directors and outside blockholders effectively increases their incentives to monitor management in ensuring their wealth in the firms is intact. Research limitations/implications - One limitation of this research is that it relies on publicly available data and agency theory. Future research could apply other theories, such as resource dependency and stewardship. Use of process-oriented data could also improve the findings. Practical implications - Independent directors need to undergo training to help them improve and be aware of their responsibilities. Originality/value - This paper offers evidence on the extent to which distress is associated with corporate governance from a developing country. The paper should be of interest to the regulatory bodies and practitioners. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Despite theoretical developments in recent years, our understanding of corporate capital structure remains incomplete. Prior empirical research has been dominated by archival regression studies which are limited in their ability to fully reflect the diversity found in practice. The present paper reports on a comprehensive survey of corporate financing decision-making in UK listed companies. A key finding is that firms are heterogeneous in their capital structure policies. About half of the firms seek to maintain a target debt level, consistent with trade-off theory, but 60% claim to follow a financing hierarchy, consistent with pecking order theory. These two theories are not viewed by respondents as either mutually exclusive or exhaustive. Many of the theoretical determinants of debt levels are widely accepted by respondents, in particular the importance of interest tax shield, financial distress, agency costs and also, at least implicitly, information asymmetry. Results also indicate that cross-country institutional differences have a significant, impact on financial decisions. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Standard accounts on the nature of the firm are highly dependent on explanations by Coase, coupled with inputs from agency theory and shareholder theory.

Alternative explanations of franchising offer contrasting predictions as to how the proportion of franchised outlets changes as franchisors age. We propose that two dominant views - resource-scarcity and agency theory - can be integrated by delineating when each is most relevant. Data from 102 franchisors over a 21-year period suggest that resource-scarcity considerations take precedence when franchisors are young, but that agency considerations prevail as franchisors age. Thus, the proportion franchised exhibits a cubic pattern as franchisors age - increasing rapidly at first, decreasing, and then increasing again. Future researchers and practitioners alike can benefit from understanding how the relative influences of resource and agency considerations shift over time. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This article discusses agency problems in sport organizations in which the same individuals are involved in both the management and control of decision making. We focus our analysis on the case of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by reviewing the behavior of selected IOC members with regard to the bidding process for the Olympic Games and the resulting reform attempts made by the IOC in an effort to address issues of corruption. After a review of examples of corrupt behavior on the part of IOC members, agency theory is introduced to discuss IOC reforms and provide some suggestions for future reform. We propose incorporating other stakeholders (in addition to the IOC members), such as corporate partners, media conglomerates, and other members of the Olympic movement (e.g., athletes, coaches, officials), into management and control functions. More specifically, it is suggested that these stakeholders comprise a board that oversees the operations of the IOC (similar to the IOC's current executive committee) and be given the ability to remove and/or sanction IOC members who act self-interestedly to the detriment of the Olympic movement. Thus, by delegating the control function of decision making to a board and the management function to internal agents, greater accountability for all organization members can be achieved.

This study investigates how employee stock ownership affects corporate R&D expenditures for information-technology firms listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange during 1996-2001. The empirical results indicate a positive association between implementing employee stock ownership and R&D expenditures. The evidence thus supports the argument that employee stock ownership could help alleviate agency conflicts between employees and shareholders, and reduce agency costs, in turn enabling firms to make sizable R&D expenditures.

This research analyzes whether variable compensation is designed as an economically rational incentive to increase organizational performance, or whether it also responds to other factors such as the search for legitimacy. A case study demonstrates how the design of the variable compensation system, at both managerial and lower levels, takes into account the company's adoption of popular management practices that increase its legitimacy but not necessarily its performance.The results show that,in the design of their compensation policies, organizations do not always seek financial objectives, as agency theory maintains, but often have other social objectives such as the search for legitimacy, as institutional theory suggests. The management of incentives not only is used to align the interests of principal and agent, but also has a symbolic character, insofar as it signals that the company belongs to a particular social context.

Women corporate inside (executive) directors constitute an elite minority of leaders of large corporations. This study examines the characteristics of CEOs and boards of Fortune 1000 firms that had women who held the dual leadership positions of corporate director and executive officer in 1998 in order to determine whether firms with women insiders had substantially different characteristics than firms without. We find that compared with firms without women inside directors, firms with women inside directors were characterized by CEOs with longer board tenure, more family ties, and fewer director interlocks, and by boards that were larger, with more insiders, and that utilize a management Chair of the board. Corporate governance implications are drawn for the presence of women at the top of the executive hierarchy.

This paper investigates the effects of investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board of directors on their judgments. I hypothesize that investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board will be negatively related to their judgments of investment risk and positively related to the amount they are willing to invest. I also hypothesize that the association between effectiveness of the board and investment judgments will be moderated by investor type such that professional investors will be less conservative than non-professional investors. Forty non-professional investors and 33 professional investors participated in the experiment. Generally, the results of the study are consistent with the hypothesized effects. The results suggest that even in the context of sound financial performance, investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the board are a key determinant of their investment judgments. This association is moderated by investor type and suggests professional investors are less conservative than non-professional investors. Such evidence is consistent with agency theory, "use of the house money" hypothesis and recent anecdotal scandals involving professional investors. Overall, the results provide evidence that investors are more confident in firms with effective corporate boards and support regulatory reforms strengthening corporate boards. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Governance of public corporations in the United States has operated under the agency model with regulatory strengthening since the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. With this foundation in place, boards are empowered to utilise their power and influence and can effectively monitor the actions of management, intervening where necessary. In effect, the rules of engagement embodied in the structure and the law guide interactions and empowerment. The governance model of the mutual funds industry, representing over 8 trillion dollars, is often viewed as a mirror of the corporate world, but upon closer analysis is found to have significant structural differences that dilute the authority of directors. The two models are compared and analysed with recommendations made to strengthen the oversight of mutual funds. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Although agency theory purportedly applies to a very broad range of organizations and suggests strategies for governing ali types of workers, very little agency theory research has involved professional organizations. Such research is needed to support generalizing agency theory's predictions to professional organizations and to guide managers in professional firms as they make decisions about their firms' governance structures. Furthermore, although professional organizations increasingly use contract professionals to provide services to clients, there has been very little research examining the governance of contract professionals. Because professionals who work on a contract basis have a different relationship with organizations than do employees or partners, agency theory suggests that professional organizations would govern them differently. This study examines whether one important type of professi onal organization, medical groups, use stronger monitoring and incentive mechanisms to govern contract physicians than they use with member physicians. We final no differences in the monitoring mechanisms used (collecting information about or requiring ratification of the physicians' decisions), but medical groups do use more incentive compensation with contract professionals when the medical group is paid by capitation. Overall, our results are not what we would have expected based on agency theory. We discuss the implications of our results for agency theory and for the governance of contract professionals, and highlight the need for further research in this area.

This paper contributes to our understanding of why, even with what appear to be the best of intentions on all sides, the principals and agents in organizations may interact to cause failure and outlines the implications of this dynamic process within the organization.

This paper examines whether the dividend valuation changed after corporate accounting scandals such as that of Enron in October 2001 broke out. We find that dividend increasing firms experienced positive abnormal returns in the industry affected by corporate scandals up to four months after the first scandal in the industry became public. We interpret this finding in the context of the agency theory of Jensen (1986). To provide a perspective, we examine the dividend valuation from early 1980s to early 2000s, and find that the dividend valuation increased consistently for this time period. We also find that the dividend valuation was highest in the information technology industry after the year 2000. These findings fit well with the agency theory as well. (c) 2006 Taylor & Francis.

Many professional service organizations have adopted a little understood contractual form: service-for-equity. Based on in-depth case studies of 12 major professional service providers with a combined experience of 179 equity-for-service deals, this paper documents 18 intended and unintended consequences, emanating from and expanding beyond agency theory, of adopting such a contractual form. Six propositions are developed which speculate how these consequences, categorized under client development, service operations, financial management, and organizational behaviour, affect long run performance. Assuming these propositions cannot be rejected through empirical analysis, the paper also provides managerial guidance for effective implementation of equity-for-service arrangements.

The replacement of a CEO is one of the control mechanisms that companies employ to reduce the agency problems. This paper divides companies into non-family businesses and family businesses and investigates the influence of outside directors, outside blockholders, and excess compensation in CEOs termination process. The samples used in the paper come from manufacturing companies in Taiwan listed between 1996-1997; the analytical method is logistic regression model. The conclusion is as follows: 1. the characteristics of family businesses, corporate governance, and excess compensation have no correlation on CEO turnover. 2. External board members play an important role in CEO termination in non-family businesses.

This paper discusses the governance issues in nonprofit organizations (NPO). The theoretical framework of agency theory is used to analyze the relationship between agents and principals (donors and volunteers) in such kinds of organizations. Similarly to the for-profit organizations, the mechanisms of incentives and monitoring are crucial to the alignment of interests among principals and agents. However, considering the NPO's intrinsic characteristics, due to the difficulty to implement external and internal governance mechanisms, the challenges of alignment are far more complicated. The NPOs are idiosyncratic, being in many situations complex to establish performance comparisons with similar organizations.

Firstly, from Transaction Costs, Property Rights and Agency perspectives, the economic rationale of mutuals is analyzed, paying particular attention to MATEP's peculiarities and incentives in terms of competition, regulation and ownership. Subsequently, the effectiveness of governance mechanisms is discussed, showing that the status quo leaves excess power in the hands of the managers of these organizations.

This paper deals with a broad and controversial part of microeconomic theory represented by the theory of the firm. An overview of the main line of criticism of the orthodox (classical) theory of the firm and also of the theories proposed as reactions to one or more aspects of this criticism is given. However, the attention is attached to managerial theories of the firm, which are represented especially by the models of Baumol, Williamson and Marris. In each case the assumptions of the particular theory are stated, followed by graphical and mathematical exposition of its main conclusions. Finally, the paper concludes with a brief discussion of the contributions and setbacks of managerial theories.

The failure to document a consistent and robust relationship between executive pay and firm performance has frustrated scholars and practitioners for over three quarters of a century. Although recent compensation research has revealed alternative theoretical frameworks and findings that hold the potential to significantly improve our understanding of executive compensation, to date this diverse literature lacks theoretical integration. Accordingly, we develop a framework to organize and review these recent findings. We further identify methodological issues and concerns, discuss the implications of these concerns, and provide recommendations for future research aimed at developing a more integrated research agenda.

Family business researchers are split on whether family managers in family firms are agents or stewards. If family managers behave as agents, family firms are expected to impose agency cost control mechanisms on them, and this will improve performance. The results based on a sample of small privately held family firms indicate that family managers are monitored and provided with incentive compensation. Those who do so obtain higher performance, thus suggesting the existence of agency behavior among family managers. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study examines the association between board composition and voluntary disclosure in annual reports. In particular, it addresses the incentives within the agency theory framework for both inside and independent directors to disclosure additional information voluntarily. Further, it provides evidence on the relation between the overall total voluntary disclosure and the components of voluntary disclosure, such as forward looking, strategic, non-financial and historical financial disclosures and board composition. Our sample is based on 181 Australian companies. We have developed and hand-collected 67 items from annual reports to develop the total voluntary disclosure index and the sub-indices of voluntary disclosure. Using two-stage multivariate analyses, our results provide some important insights. First, we find that there is a positive association between board composition and the voluntary disclosure of information in annual reports. Second, we also find that independent boards provide more voluntary disclosure of forward looking information and strategic information. However, board structure has no bearing on the voluntary disclosure of non-financial and historical financial information. Our findings are enhanced by different empirical specifications and sensitivity tests.

We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper investigates how governance mechanisms affect the ability of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to introduce strategic change. Previous research typically assumes that governance mechanisms operate independently of each other. Building on agency theory and insights from the literature on small firm governance, we hypothesize that governance variables related to ownership, the board of directors and the top management team all affect strategic change and that it is important to examine the interaction effects of these governance mechanisms. Using a longitudinal sample of over 800 SMEs, our general logic and hypotheses are supported by the analyses. We find that closely held firms exhibit less strategic change than do SMEs relying on more widespread ownership structures. However, to some extent, closely held firms can overcome these weaknesses and achieve strategic change by utilizing outside directors on the board and/or extending the size of the top management teams. Implications for theory and management practice in SMEs are discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Differently from prior studies that examine the role of stand-alone control systems within the relationship between owners and managers, our study investigates the correlation between two control mechanisms - voluntary disclosure and independent directors - in companies characterized by the presence of a dominant shareholder that is supposed to mitigate the classical agency problem. Based on agency theory, we hypothesize that the two mechanisms tend to coexist, since the presence of either one reduces the costs of introducing the other. Two further effects - the reputation and the domino effect - contribute to determine a positive relationship between the two mechanisms. We carried out the empirical analysis on 175 non-financial Italian listed companies, all controlled by a dominant shareholder. Voluntary disclosure is measured through three alternative disclosure indexes. Independent directors are identified not only according to a formal/legal definition, but also through stricter criteria. The empirical test is based on a multivariate analysis controlling for size, residual ownership diffusion, leverage, profitability and labour pressure. Results support our hypothesis and are robust to alternative criteria to identify dominant shareholders. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between different control mechanisms in particular agency settings.

Most research investigating the impact of board leadership structure as a corporate governance mechanism, on corporate performance has focused largely on either the Anglo-American context or the Asian experience and has come up with diverse conclusions. This study sheds light on the extent to which corporate leadership structure affects corporate performance by providing empirical evidence from a sample of Egyptian listed firms. The initial econometric results indicate that CEO duality has no impact on corporate performance. However, when an interaction term between industry type and CEO duality is included in the model, the impact of CEO duality on corporate performance is found to vary across industries, a result that is supportive of both agency theory and stewardship theory. In addition, when firms are categorised according to their financial performance, CEO duality attracts a positive and significant coefficient only when corporate performance is low.

Does CEO duality - the practice of one person serving both as a firm's CEO and board chair - contribute to or inhibit firm performance? Agency theory suggests that CEO duality is bad for performance because it compromises the monitoring and control of the CEO. Stewardship theory, in contrast, argues that CEO duality may be good for performance due to the unity of command it presents. The empirical evidence, largely from developed economies, is largely inconclusive. This article joins the debate by extending empirical work to the largely unexplored context of institutional transitions. Our findings, based on an archival database covering 403 publicly listed firms and 1,202 company-years in China, offer stronger support for stewardship theory and relatively little support for agency theory. Finally, we also call for a contingency perspective to specify the nature of conditions such as resource scarcity and environmental dynamism under which CEO duality may be especially valuable.

Challenging agency theory prescriptions for board composition, we contend that the boards of young firms that have recently gone public are best comprised of a majority of original top management team (TMT) members, rather than independent outsiders. We argue that such board members possess valuable tacit knowledge of the firms and their entrepreneurial visions and are in the best position to provide oversight. We additionally argue that outsiders should provide resources that firms' TMTs might use to execute their strategies, rather than monitor the TMTs. Our results from 1996-97 data on 524 initial public offerings support our contentions. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

This field study investigated contextual antecedents of free riding by franchisees on franchisor brand reputation and effects of free riding on performance in a multinational corporation's franchising network. Structural elements (increased formalization, decentralized decision-making), interactions between franchisor representatives and franchisee dealers, and market-related factors (external competition) were associated with lower levels of franchisee free riding. The findings also indicated that free riding has deleterious effects on franchisee performance. The results support theoretical arguments that both economic and social exchange perspectives are valuable in examining free riding and provide important practical guidance in designing and managing franchise systems.

This exploratory study is intended to analyze how a combination of the resources-based view and agency theory can provide a better understanding of the internal dynamic of the family business and its evolution. Our evidence seems to suggest that the desire to keep family control produces specific sources of value and conditions the firm's financial capacity to acquire resources. These peculiarities change between first and following generations. During the first generation, we find that less severe agency costs balance the negative effect of scarce financial structure on the family firm's value. After descendants join the firm, the increasing agency costs are compensated by the enlargement of the firm's financial structure. (c) 2007 Family Firm Institute, Inc.

Drawing on three prominent views about the "self" and the self's relationship with "others", a typology of five parental altruistic archetypes is derived that exhausts the possible altruistic influences on the governance of family firms. When taken in concert, these five types comprise a more balanced explanation of the cross-sectional variance in the governance efficiency of these firms than do the explanations from agency theory and more recently, by Schulze and colleagues. Therefore, the typology provides an improved explanation of why some family firms are more able than others to capitalize on the family governance's positive attributes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This article provides a definition of corporate governance and highlights the challenges in adapting understanding of governance to the privately-held firm. We emphasize the need to develop the scope of governance in privately-held firms beyond the traditional agency theory focus in the financial economics literature relating to large publicly-listed corporations. There is a need to draw on and integrate an array of theoretical perspectives from both economics and other social science disciplines as well. We present a schematic model of corporate governance which places the contributions presented in the special issue in context and which serves as a guide to highlighting gaps in the research base. We review the principal issues relating to corporate governance in privately-held firms which relate to: governance in different organizational contexts (institutional context; the industrial sector within which the firm finds itself, the ownership context of the firm, and the stage within the firm's life-cycle); the scope of corporate governance; and other internal governance mechanisms to be considered We identify areas for further research on corporate governance in privately-held firms with respect to processes of governance, organizational contexts, assumptions about the owners, executive remuneration, financial reporting, the nature of the dependent variable relating to the expected outcome of different approaches to governance and various methodological issues.

We explore the impact of CEO tenure on returns to shareholders arising from acquisition announcements. Further, we consider the value added for shareholders when the board of directors is composed in such a way as to enhance vigilance. In the absence of a vigilant board, CEO tenure is positively associated with performance at low to moderate levels of tenure, and negatively associated with performance when tenure further rises to substantial levels. In the presence of a vigilant board, however, shareholder interests can be advanced even at high levels of CEO tenure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Equity financing is important in financing growth but its special features in small business have not been well addressed in the finance or entrepreneurship literature. Since many small firms have family involvement and research shows that family firms have both advantages and disadvantages in managing agency costs, how family involvement and agency issues interact to affect equity financing in small business is an important topic of research. This study examines the effects of family ownership and management on two dimensions of small business equity financing, the use of equity financing and the use of public equity financing within the agency theory of financing. The results show that family involvement and agency issues interactively and separately influence equity financing in small business. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Some accounting information systems research suggests that the implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems improves corporate performance [Hayes DC, Hunton JE, Reck JL. Market reaction to ERPS implementation announcements. J Inf Syst 2001;15(1): 3-18; Hunton JE, Lippincott B, Reck J. Enterprise resource planning systems: Comparing firm performance of adopters and nonadopters. Int J Account Inf Syst 2003;4:165-184], while a seemingly disparate line of managerial accounting research indicates that the inclusion of non-financial performance incentives (NFPI) in executive compensation contracts also enhances performance [Said AA, HassabElnaby HR, Wier, B. An empirical investigation of the performance consequences of non-financial measures. J Manage Account Res 2003;15:193-223]. Two theoretical perspectives tie together these research streams. Cybernetic control theory explains how ERP systems offer the means by which managers can effectively use non-financial performance indicators, and agency theory describes how NFPI provide the motive and opportunity for managers to attend to key non-financial performance indicators. The research hypothesis tested herein asserts that the joint adoption of ERP and use of NFPI will yield greater corporate performance than either ERP or NFPI alone. In the current study, performance is reflected by return on assets (ROA) and stock returns (SR). Study results support the hypothesis, as archival data indicate that firms with both NFPI and ERP obtain significantly higher short-term and long-term ROA and SR than either ERP-only or NFPI-only firms. Research findings offer valuable insight into the theoretical and practical implications of jointly adopting the ERP and NFPI strategies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

While corporate governance research has had some success tying boards' demographic characteristics to relatively distant outcomes such as CEO pay and succession, numerous studies have indicated that a major weakness of this research is that it has largely ignored the intervening behaviours associated with board vigilance. This study begins to answer this call by examining the relationship between boards' demographic characteristics and boards' information-gathering behaviour. Using primary and secondary data from 149 firms, this study finds that an increase in the proportion of outside directors on a board is associated with an increase in boards' information quality and proactive information-seeking. In addition, an increase in outside director tenure is associated with boards exchanging information more frequently. Consistent with agency theory predictions, these findings suggest that vigilant boards are likely to take actions aimed at reducing the level of information asymmetry between them and their CEOs.

Board composition in large organizations has been subject to much empirical research, however, little attention has been focused on board composition in start-ups, and more specifically high tech start-ups. This lack of research is surprising given that many high tech start-ups have multiple equity stakeholders such as venture capitalists or public research organizations, such as universities. Given that high tech start-ups are commonly resource-poor these external stakeholders may play an important role in accessing critical external resources. Drawing on agency theory, resource dependence theory and social network theory we examine the tensions that exist between the founding team and external equity stakeholders in determining the presence of outside board members. In particular we focus on whether or not the outside board members have either complementary or substitute human capital to the founding team. We test our model on a sample of 140 high tech start-ups in Flanders. Our results indicate that high tech start-ups with a public research organization as an external equity stakeholder are more likely to develop boards with outside board members with complementary skills to the founding team.

Purpose The effect of corporate governance on firm performance has long been of great interest to financiers, economists, behavioural scientists, legal practitioners and business operators. Yet there is no consensus over what constitutes an effective corporate governance mechanism that induces agents or managers to consistently act in the interest of share value optimisation. The purpose of this study is to develop a model to resolve an on-going issue in financial economics: how can CEOs be effectively monitored by the board of directors? Design-methodology-approach A survey of the literature on corporate governance and the relationship between board composition and financial performance leads to the development of the proposed model, which is based on a framework which takes into account the probability of success representing a CEO's ability, and the active monitoring function (which is represented by the numbers of control visits) carried-out by the directors. Findings The design of the model is aimed at identifying an optimal level of monitoring, which will maximise share value, to guide internal and independent directors. Research limitations-implications The model has limitations: it does not address the input of other directors and it focuses solely on the monitoring function, even though boards also play important roles in providing information and advice to management. Originality-value The finding of this study contributes to the Agency Theory debate, in essence that the board monitoring of CEO will improve the performance of the CEO and avoid possible conflict of interests.

The authors examine the moderating effects of conscientiousness on the relationships between agency controls and effort and agency controls and task performance. Results show that less conscientious individuals appear to increase effort through incentive alignment and monitoring, whereas conscientious individuals do not shirk with or without agency controls. Furthermore, results show that less conscientious individuals increase task performance through incentive alignment, but not through monitoring. The study confirms that motivation to act opportunistically differs between individuals unlike what is assumed by agency theory. Also, incentive alignment may be more effective than monitoring when attempting to align principal and agent interests. (c) 2007 Sage Publications.

This paper analyzes the relationship between investors and private equity managers in order to identify the factors that affect the latter's reputation. Since there are no individual references about their past returns in developing private equity markets, the reputation of such players is thought to be linked to their capacity for obtaining new funds. Results provide evidence of the volume of investments recorded in the past, the ratio of portfolio companies to investment manager, the percentage of divestments carried out through initial public offerings and trade sales, the membership of the national private equity association and the size of funds under management as characteristics of the highest importance in raising funds.

Perspectives relating to agency theory, information asymmetries and game theory were utilized to explore two outcomes associated with the management buy-out (MBO) or management buy-in (MBI) of former private firms: whether information was shared equally between vendors (i.e., family firm owners) and purchasers (i.e., MBO/I management teams) and whether a mutually agreed price was achieved. With reference to the themes of company ownership structure, governance structure and company objectives several hypotheses were derived. Survey evidence was gathered from the managers of 114 former private family-owned firms located across Europe that recently reported an MBO/I. Multiple logistic regression analysis detected that respondents in founded (first generation) family firms and those reporting a high focus on the strategic importance of the market value increment were more likely to report that 'information was shared equally between vendors and purchasers'. Respondents reporting no suitable family successor had been identified, a high focus on the strategic importance of the market value increment, and the involvement of venture capitalists in succession planning were more likely to report that a mutually agreed sale price had been achieved. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Agency theory focuses on monitoring and incentives as two solutions to agency problems. Prior research suggests that monitoring and incentives may act either as substitutes or as complements, and that the context of the agency relationship plays a major role in determining the direction of the relationship between them. In a corporate governance setting, we contend that board information and boards' usage of CEO control mechanisms are best viewed as complements. Thus, we hypothesize that boards' information gathering behaviour will be positively related to boards' usage of CEO control mechanisms. Using primary and secondary data from 149 US firms, we find that increases in boards' information gathering are associated with increases in boards' usage of managerial controls. These findings suggest that information and managerial control mechanisms act as complements in the governance context, and that boards take a variety of actions to protect the interests of shareholders.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine whether or not divident policy is influenced by the firm's corporate control structure, investigating the relationship between the dynamics of earnings payout and the voting power enjoyed by different types of shareholders. This allows one to test a set of hypotheses derived from agency and pecking order theories. Design/methodology/approach - A large panel of UK firms for the 1990s and is analyzed that the payout policy is significantly related to control concentration. The problem of control measurement is addressed and the use of Banzhaf indices advocated as a relevant measure of voting power in the analysis of corporate policy choices. The traditional framework proposed by Linter is extended and an econometrically sound approach to modeling the dynamics of the total payout suggested. Where most - even recent - studies on payout policy show some methodological flaws, state-of-the-art dynamic panel data estimation procedures are applied. Findings - Expectedly, profitability is a crucial determinant of payout decisions, but the presence of strong block holders or block holder coalitions weakens the relationship between the corporate earnings and the payout dynamics. Block holders appear to realize that an overly generous payout may render the company liquidity constrained, and, consequently, result in suboptimal investment policy. Practical implications - The results challenge some of the implications of the agency theories of payout, and favor a pecking-order explanation for the observed patterns. The analysis of payout dynamics reveals also that companies adjust payout policies to changes in earnings only gradually, which is consistent with "dividend smoothing". In fact, the results suggest a presence of a more general phenomenon of the "total payout smoothing". Originality/value - According to one's bet knowledge, this is the first study employing those game theory-based concepts in the context of corporate payout policies.

This paper models the corporate ownership and performance relationship in Bangladesh listed firms using a simultaneous equations approach. Consistent with contemporary literature a "reverse-way" causality relationship between the two is documented. Using an unbalanced pooled sample of 660 firm-years, our results suggest that ownership does not have a significant impact on performance (Tobin's Q or ROA). However, performance does appear to have a significant negative impact on ownership. With few exceptions, other governance and control variables appear to have significant effects on both performance and ownership. These results imply that despite significant governance differences between Bangladesh and developed market economies there are strong similarities in "internal governance mechanisms" and the implications of agency theory.

We examine shareholder wealth effects in a heterogeneous sample of 115 European leveraged going private transactions from 1997 to 2005. Average abnormal returns as reaction to the LBO announcement amount to 24.20%. In cross-sectional regressions, we find that these value gains can largely be attributed to differences in corporate governance: on a macro level, abnormal returns for pre-LBO shareholders are larger in countries with a poor protection of minority shareholders. On a firm level, companies with a high pre-LBO free float and comparatively weak monitoring by shareholders tend to show high abnormal returns. Furthermore, companies that are undervalued with respect to an industry peer-group exhibit higher announcement returns, indicating that agency conflicts and/or market inefficiencies can serve as an explanation.

Purpose - This paper proposes a methodology for governing expatriate assignments in the context of corporate-level objectives. Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken is to envisage expatriate managerial assignments within the theoretical framework of agency theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm. The paper begins with the view that knowledge acquisition and integration is a primary goal for most expatriate assignments. The relationship between expatriate managers and multinational corporation (MNC) headquarters from an agency perspective are considered and the notion of a "knowledge contract" as a means of governing that relationship is discussed. Four corporate-level international strategies available to MNCs (global, international, transnational, and multidomestic) are then examined and the extent of agency problems under each strategy is discussed. Findings - The paper makes specific predictions about the type of knowledge contract that is most likely to address agency problems for each corporate strategy. Originality/value - This research extends agency theory by introducing the knowledge contract as a means of managing agency concerns. This offers a broader range of contract alternatives, moving researchers beyond traditional agency theoretic prescriptions. The research also contributes to the literature on expatriate management by integrating assignment success with research on corporate-level international strategy. Few authors have recognized organizational strategy as an important unit of study in international human resource management. Doing so, however, has yielded a unique set of contingency relationships that would otherwise be obscured.

Sumantra Ghoshal, in his recent Academy of Management Learning & Education article, argued that management theories currently taught in MBA programs are the causal factor in triggering (a), the recent wave of corporate scandals in the United States and (b), lack of theory building for contemporary management. He identified the dominance in graduate business education of agency theory as the primary culprit for these problems. In this essay I outline how a cognitive philosophy of science shift in the business school culture from Thomas Kuhn's normal science paradigm framework to Karl Popper's revolutionary science methodology would mitigate many of the dysfunctions Ghoshal catalogues. This position is based on published literature, contemporary trends in management theory, and teaching graduate courses in the administrative sciences. I also suggest that, if such a transition is not made, MBA programs will continue to lose both societal and organizational legitimacy. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

This paper uses the changing historical and theoretical frames within which management pay and investor claims are considered to provide a critique of the functionalist approach of agency and to develop an alternative, positional explanation of rewards. The first part of the paper draws on the contrast between the pre-1940 critique of the rentier and the post-1980 discursive construction of the shareholder to raise important contemporary questions about position and reward. The second part develops the idea of positional rewards to challenge agency assumptions by arguing that both giant firm managers and the less visible, though larger, group of intermediaries use their position to skim value. In contrast, the experience of position is more mixed for shareholders, who are generally passive value surfers. The final section of the paper argues that a renewed emphasis on position will enable a problem shift from value creation to value capture.

Research on the efficacy of stock-based compensation for outside directors has documented a weak or non-existent relationship with firm performance. Other variables also influence the relationships between these two constructs. Consistent with agency theory, we show, for a sample of 450 Standard & Poor 500 firms over the 1995-97 period that the use of director stock options and grants ratios was more strongly associated with positive performance in firms with (a) higher investment opportunities, and (b) weaker external monitoring. These findings have implications for compensation committees in the structuring of director compensation. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper explains, through a field study and from an agency perspective, how monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms change to support the interests of a privatized firm's new ownership. In this case, privatization led to important changes in the board of directors and to more formal performance evaluation and compensation systems for top managers, as profitability and financial control gained relevancy with the firm ownership change. Our results show that differences in incentives management before and after privatization are due to different agency relations in the two periods. We also argue that in a privatization framework the relation between monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms is complex, not simply substitutive as agency theory would predict, and this finding allows us to refine and extend agency theory for this specific context.

According to agency theory, agents base their economic decisions on self-interests when adverse selection conditions exist. However, cognitive moral development theory predicts that ethics/morals may influence decision-makers not to behave egoistically. Rutledge and Karim (1999; Accounting, Organizations and Society 24(2), 173-184) find both the moral reasoning level of the managers and an adverse selection condition affect a manager's project evaluation decisions significantly. Since prior studies have shown that national culture might influence the application of agency theory in project evaluation, this current study uses a different moral development measurement to reexamine Rutledge and Karim's hypotheses in another culture. A total of 73 Taiwanese executive MBA students with an average of 12.17 years work experience participated in this study. We found that both moral development level and adverse selection conditions significantly affect managers' project continuance decisions. The interaction effect of these two factors indicates that, when adverse selection conditions exist, participants with a high level of moral development exhibit less of a tendency to continue an unprofitable project than those with a low level of moral development. With subjects from a different culture, our results confirm the findings of Rutldege and Karim. That is, the effects of moral development and adverse selection conditions on managers' project continuance decisions are robust and can be generalized to different cultures. Implications of the findings of this study to multinational firms are also discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This paper presents a model for the governance of radical innovation (RI) efforts within the firm. A longitudinal study of 12 large established companies committed to develop and institutionalize a radical innovation capability are used to inform our work. Thus the firm, rather than the RI project, is the unit of analysis for this work. We draw on Agency Theory, Firm Level Governance, Stewardship Theory and Stakeholder Theory as well to enrich the model. We find that none of these theoretical frames adequately describes the issues faced by companies as they build governance systems to oversee high risk, high uncertainty innovation portfolios. A series of propositions is offered based on the data analysis and extant literature that address board composition, decision style and decision processes that, we believe, enhance a company's ability to generate and commercialize radical innovations.

This paper reports interview-based research examining reasons for the continued increase in executive directors' remuneration in large UK companies. This issue has not specifically been addressed by previous studies, which have focused on the level of the increases, rather than their underlying explanations. Reasons given for making changes included: increases due to being below-market; changing performance-related schemes that did not pay out or paid less than expected; changes in the company's culture or strategy; changes to senior personnel; and compliance with good practice in human resource management and in corporate governance. The results are analysed through two theoretical lenses. Agency theory provides an explanation of the structure of the contracts; expectancy theory suggests why schemes might be changed to motivate the executives. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to comprehend the whole phenomenon of corporate philanthropy in Malaysia by studying the traits of companies that make significant contributions to society. Specifically, it looks at firms' ownership structures and specific characteristics and their influence on the extent of corporate philanthropy. This study employs Agency theory as the basis for explaining philanthropic behaviour of Malaysian companies. A total of 100 public-listed companies were selected from the top 200 companies based on market capitalization as listed on the Bursa Malaysia. The ownership structures and firm characteristics of the selected companies were tested against the extent of corporate philanthropy in order to see the relationship among the variables. In addition, multiple regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. The findings of this study reveal that ownership structure does have some influence on corporate philanthropic activities. This is consistent with the proposition of Agency theory. In addition, the size factor is also found to be a significant determinant of philanthropic tendency among Malaysian companies. In view of the increasing importance of corporate philanthropy in the overall context of corporate social responsibility and nation building, this study serves well in providing an insight into the determinants of corporate philanthropic tendencies in Malaysia. By doing this, it extends the horizon of the study done by Prathaban and Rahim on the levels of firm charitable contributions. This paper offers an important explanation of the factors that influence corporate philanthropic tendency, particularly in the Malaysian context. (c) 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

The purpose of this study is to test cost management behavior of small restaurant firms and identify whether managers of these small restaurants behave differently depending on their management and ownership structure. The sample was comprised of 87 small restaurant firms identified from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances (SSBF). Cost of doing business, size of staff, and five performance measures were used as dependent variables. Independent variables included management and ownership type. Study findings identified significant differences in the profit margin depending on management type and ownership percentage of the primary owner. We also find that the cost of doing business (total expenses) varies depending upon single-family majority/minority ownership and the ownership percentage of the primary owner. The results support the notion that small restaurant firms are operated differently depending on their management and ownership structure. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Departing from the usual debates regarding the superiority of one governance structure over another, this study aims to complement the prior institutional approach by addressing how a firm's internal governance, via board competence and managerial incentives, shapes innovation performance. In a sample of 178 Taiwanese firms in the high-tech industries, the study sets out to examine the innovation-enhancing effects of the firm-level governance arrangements prescribed by agency theory. The results show that the effective governance, characterised by vigilant control through a competent board and the incentives of managers through equity ownership, are conducive to the desired and valued outcomes of innovation by aligning the risk differential between principals and agents. This universal relationship is further extended to a contingency perspective that innovation can be more significantly achieved by managerial risk readiness through a tight coupling of internal governance and the correspondingly appropriate strategy profile. The findings stress that governance and a clear posture of differentiation in high-tech environments are, arguably, multiple bases on which innovation is sought.

Corporate governance (CG) needs to acknowledge the intentional part of governance, where an actor of governance uses the set of corporate governance mechanisms in order to influence the agent to create a performance that will satisfy the interest of the principal. This paper offers a conception of this activity through the concept of governance strategy. The concept is based on a property right approach and derived within the context of agency theory, stressing the interest and the capacity of the principal. It is applied to two empirical organisations seldom investigated in CG research: the organisation of multinational corporations in a business group and the organisation of a riding school in a democratic not-for-profit association, thereby extending the relevance of the concept from corporate governance to organizational governance. The empirical analysis indicates the relevance of the conception and suggests further extension through hypotheses of governance strategy related to environmental influence, accessibility of governance mechanisms and momentum of mechanisms.

Using panel data for the period 1999-2003, this study shows that internal and external financing are not perfect substitutes, not corroborating the theorem of Modigliani and Miller. Portuguese service industries prefer internal to external financing, corroborating Pecking Order theory. The bigger the size of the company, the greater the level of debt, corroborating Trade-Off and Signalling theories. The negative relationship between the amount of fixed capital and debt corroborates Agency theory. The results allow us to conclude that debt contributes to improving management efficiency, agency problems between shareholders and creditors having little relevance.

Purpose - The purpose of the study is to explore the board of directors in leveraged buyouts (LBOs) as a distinct source of value creation and to conceptually investigate the going-private transaction via LBO as a response to deficient governance structures as well as the post-buyout board restructuring. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides a review of the literature on LBOs boards, and relies on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to develop testable propositions. The work suggests that the board as a particular source of efficiency gains in LBOs warrants further empirical research. Research limitations/implications - The paper gives strong credence to the argument that boards represent a unique source of value creation in LBOs. Previous agency-theoretic work is complemented by focusing on the monitoring function of the board, but resource dependence theory introduced to suggest the importance of a strategic service and support function. The work is conceptual in nature and thus requires subsequent empirical testing to verify assertions set forth in this study. Practical implications - The paper shows that incentives of managerial equity participation and the discipline of debt are gradually losing their distinctiveness in today's buyout industry. To compete in an increasingly crowded environment, LBO specialists need to identify new sources of value to generate attractive returns for their investors. Originality/value - The paper extends the existing LBO literature by introducing resource dependent as a complementary framework. Given that the traditional LBO literature examines the discipline of debt and managerial ownership that explain their efficiencies, the role of LBO boards as a distinct value creation mechanism in buyouts is introduced.

This paper studies secrecy in voting and the role of information on coalition building in corporate governance. It finds evidence that supports the coalition building hypothesis and, in part, rejects the agency cost hypothesis. The conditions for insiders and large outsiders to form coalitions are examined. The results are consistent with insiders and large outsiders cooperating and voting as a block to maintain power, this imposes costs on other shareholders. Consistent with the agency theory and the coalition building theory, management initiated amendments have a more negative impact than shareholder initiated amendments. The Vote Your Conscience theory is rejected.

This chapter explains how the agency theory can be used to prevent a development of divergent interests between the management team and investors after a management buy-out (MBO). Agency costs are caused by increased costs of monitoring by the investor to overcome the problems of self-interest, risk aversion, goal conflict, and information asymmetry. The chapter focuses MBOs divested from foreign or local parent companies, of which the majority of the equity after the MBO is owned by venture capitalist. The chapter focuses on the agency costs of equity and debt by analyzing the monitoring role of venture capitalists, the goal congruence between the new shareholders, the financial unification, and the repayment of debt. These mechanisms motivate managers to look for efficiencies to protect the firm against the downside risks as well as for new market opportunities to use the firms' upside potential. Examples are efficiencies in investment programs, in cutting overhead cost, and in disposal of assets. The mechanisms reduce the agency problem by stimulating the agent to make decisions that are in the interest of the principal and result in an improvement of economic performance after the MBO.

A large conceptual economic literature presents assumptions that family owned and controlled firms perform better than others, essentially on the basis of agency theory, ownership structure, cultural specificities and particular management practices. Large empirical evidence has been supplied by various studies, even if there are still contradictory debates.

Evidence is given that they perform better, and this significantly for economic profitability. Discussion is engaged about the contribution of family values and practices to their results.

Using panel data on 275 German exchange-listed companies I examine the relationship between founding-family ownership and firm performance. By separating the family effect from general blockholder effects, the paper shows that family firms are not only more profitable than widely-held firms but also outperform companies with other types of blockholders. However, the performance of family businesses is only better in firms in which the founding-family is still active either on the executive or the supervisory board. These findings suggest that family ownership is related to superior firm performance only under certain conditions. If families are just large shareholders without board representation, the performance of their companies is not distinguishable from other firms. In addition, the results indicate that other blockholders either affect firm performance adversely or have no detectable influence on performance measures. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This is a cross-sectional study of the relation between corporate governance and voluntary disclosure in Ireland. Research Findings/Results: We report clear evidence that voluntary disclosure increases with the number of nonexecutive directors on the board. Firms that have a nonexecutive chairman make greater voluntary disclosures than other firms. This finding is not robust to the inclusion of other explanatory variables. We find no evidence that ownership structure is related to voluntary disclosure. Theoretical Implications: The results regarding nonexecutive directors are interpreted as independent boards facilitating a reduction in information asymmetry between owners and managers. While this supports the predictions of agency theory, the absence of evidence that ownership structure influences voluntary disclosure does not. It is posited that sociological and organizational factors (e.g., informal networking) that pervade the Irish market mitigate against our disclosure measure capturing all aspects of voluntary disclosure. Furthermore, indirect evidence is provided that there are other costs and benefits to disclosure that vary across firms and may outweigh agency costs in many situations. We conclude that while agency theory has some explanatory power for voluntary disclosure, it cannot explain all the cross-sectional differences in voluntary disclosure by Irish public limited companies. Practical Implications: The results support the attention paid by regulators to the proportion of nonexecutive directors on the board. However, the costs and benefits to disclosure vary across firms. Regardless of agency considerations and regulatory guidelines, firms will ultimately formulate their disclosure policy with reference to overall marginal costs and marginal benefits.

We contribute to multiple agency theory by examining cases in which ventures making initial public offerings (IPOs) have managerial agents on their boards whose goals conflict with those of the investment bank agents hired to underwrite the stock. Underwriters have an incentive to underprice IPOs to maintain strong ties with institutional investors. We develop theory on agent differences based on time horizons and risk taking by managerial agents as framed through behavioral agency theory. Examining governance mechanisms, we find both monitoring by board insiders and board experience decrease underpricing. Furthermore, underpricing increases when venture capitalists have prior ties with underwriters. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

We examine the influence of CEO equity-based compensation on strategic risk taking by the firm. Building off the Behavioral Agency Model, Agency Theory, and Prospect Theory, we develop arguments about when equity-based compensation elements will increase or decrease executive risk propensity and, in turn, strategic risk taking. Incorporating a behavioral perspective into our models of incentive alignment provides us with new and potentially more accurate predictions about how individual elements of CEO pay will influence risk selection, as well as how equity compensation interacts with cash compensation and with other factors to influence risk preferences. In general, this study provides evidence that CEO equity-based compensation significantly influences strategic risk, but that this influence is more nuanced and complex than conventional treatments of executive compensation assume. In particular, we find that different forms of equity-based pay exhibit dissimilar influences on strategic risk and that their influence changes as their value and vesting status change. Second, we find that cash-based forms of pay moderate the incentive properties of equity-based pay, indicating that cash-based pay may affect how executives perceive risks associated with equity pay. Finally, we find that stock price volatility and board actions each also moderate the incentive effects of equity-based pay. In sum, our results argue for increased recognition of a behavioral perspective on executive compensation and greater precision in how we measure and model the incentive alignment properties of CEO compensation.

This article contributes to the social networks literature by examining how corporate governance factors influence CEOs' external advice-seeking behaviors. We incorporate insights from social networks research into an agency theory perspective to predict, and demonstrate empirically, that governance factors recommended by agency theory increase CEOs' tendencies to seek out advice contacts who are likely to offer perspectives on strategic issues that differ from their own; these advice-seeking behaviors ultimately enhance firm performance. Accordingly, this article also contributes to the corporate governance literature by describing how and why CEOs' advice networks mediate the effects of governance factors on firm performance.

The objective of this paper is to provide a more comprehensive view of corporate governance than that considered by the traditional agency literature predominately employed in auditing and accounting studies of governance. Specifically, we discuss three widely recognized additional theoretical perspectives: resource dependence, managerial hegemony, and institutional theory. Resource dependence is developed in the strategic management literature and focuses on the contribution of governance mechanisms as a vehicle to help a firm achieve or further its strategic objectives. In contrast with the agency and resource dependence perspectives which offer a functional view of governance, the managerial hegemony perspective views the board and its attendant committees as being under the control of management and hence could be potentially viewed as dysfunctional from a stakeholder viewpoint. Finally, institutional theory, developed in the sociology of organizations and organizational behavior literatures, suggests that it is necessary to understand the substance of the interactions between different governance parties and how these parties use at times symbolic gestures and activities to maintain their form to all relevant parties. Although the value of using multiple theoretical perspectives with respect to governance has been well recognized in the economics and behavioral literatures, this is the first paper that we are aware of that examines the effect of using alternative theories of governance on auditing issues that are influenced by the governance structure of a firm. In addition, we examine how these theories provide a useful basis for reconciling conflicting findings in the existing agency-based audit-related governance literature. Finally, we provide examples of how these alternative theories provide important new insights to issues in auditing research and practice.

Synthesizing agency theory and prospect theory, we examined the effects of stock-based incentives on CEO earnings manipulation behaviors. In analyses of data compiled from the public companies listed in Compustat's Executive Compensation Database and a U.S. General Accounting Office restatements database, we found that CEOs were more likely to manipulate firm earnings when they had more out-of-the-money options and lower stock ownership. Firm performance and CEO tenure interacted with out-of-the-money options and ownership to influence CEO earnings manipulation behaviors. Our findings inform agency-based views by providing evidence that, under certain conditions, stock-based managerial incentives lead to incentive misalignment.

We develop a conceptual model of the career horizon problem of CEOs approaching retirement and discuss its implications on firm risk taking, specifically in engagement in international acquisitions. Based on prospect theory and agency theory, we emphasize the legacy conservation and wealth preservation concerns of CEOs and investigate how their holdings of in-the-money unexercised options and firm equity accentuate or mitigate the career horizon problem. The model is tested in the context of international acquisitions with a sample of 293 U.S. firms over a five-year period (1995-1999). We find that a longer CEO career horizon is associated with a higher likelihood of international acquisitions. We also find that CEOs nearing retirement with high levels of in-the-money unexercised options and equity holdings are less likely to engage in international acquisitions than CEOs with low levels of in-the-money options and equity holdings. The study raises important considerations about the implications of CEOs ' equity and in-the-money option holdings on firm risk taking at various stages of their career horizon.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper analyzes the role of boards of directors in constraining research and development (R&D) spending manipulation. Extant research on earnings management indicates that independent directors reduce accounting accruals manipulation; however, there is little evidence on their effectiveness in limiting potentially value reducing R&D cuts motivated by short-term earnings pressures. Research Findings/Results: Using a large sample of UK firms, I study whether independent boards are efficient at detecting and constraining myopic R&D cuts. The results indicate that more independent boards constrain the manipulation of R&D expenditure. The research design controls for the potential confounding effect of the decision to capitalize vs. expense R&D outlays. Theoretical Implications: The results indicate that independent directors have sufficient technical knowledge to identify opportunistic reductions in R&D, and efficiently constrain opportunistic R&D spending. Practical Implications: The evidence supports the emphasis that recent policy statements have put on increasing the number of independent directors on corporate boards. This study offers insights to policy makers interested in enhancing the monitoring role of corporate boards. (c) 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

An important feature of most franchise chains is that they simultaneously use franchised and company-owned outlets. In this study, I show that the relationship between the resources provided to outlet managers and the financial performance of franchise chains is contingent on their governance structure. Specifically, opportunism and knowledge considerations seem to prevent chains with a large proportion of franchised outlets from fully leveraging resources such as a valuable brand name and tacit business practices. On the other hand, brand name value and business practices tacitness are not directly related to the proportion of franchised outlets in chains. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Using a sample of 714 private family influenced businesses in Germany, we investigate the relationship of goal alignment between owners and managers and the existence of a board of directors. Agency theory and stewardship theory serve as theoretical bases for our study. We find that firms with relatively high levels of goal alignment are less likely to have a board of directors. Our results provide support for the substitution hypothesis of formal by social control mechanisms. Furthermore, the findings show that firms without a board and with relatively low levels of goal alignment have less family members in the top management team. This circumstance might in turn be a trigger for owners to install a board. (c) 2008 International Council for Small Business.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and firm performance and the moderating effects of the family control factor on this relationship with respect to public companies in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs publicly available data from financial databases and the annual reports of a sample of 128 publicly-listed companies in Hong Kong in 2003. Findings - Neither agency theory nor stewardship theory alone can adequately explain the duality-performance relationship. The empirical evidence suggests that the relationship between CEO duality and accounting performance is contingent on the presence of the family control factor. CEO duality is good for non-family firms, while non-duality is good for family-controlled firms. Research limitations/implications - The study is based on publicly available financial data, and actual board processes are not observed. Practical implications - The design of board leadership structure is contingent on corporate ownership and control (family control or not). Originality/value - The paper provides empirical evidence that CEO duality is not necessarily bad for public companies in Hong Kong and would be of interest to regulatory bodies, business practitioners, and academic researchers.

Business groups, the leading economic players in emerging economies, have responded to the market-oriented transition primarily through corporate restructuring. Agency theory predicts that acquisition and divestiture would serve the interests of dominant families and foreign investors in different ways. Further, dominant families, foreign investors from shareholder-based countries, and foreign investors from stakeholder-based countries each operate under distinct institutional logics of appropriate restructuring strategies. We test hypotheses about agency and institutional mechanisms using large business groups in Taiwan between 1986 and 1998 as our empirical example. We find that, consistent with both mechanisms, family-controlled business groups are less likely to divest of unrelated businesses. However, the institutional logics mechanism can better explain the relative lack of unrelated acquisition in family-controlled groups and the difference in divestiture between groups with more shareholder-based foreign investment and those with more stakeholder-based investment. Our study contributes to the neo-institutional perspective of corporate restructuring and strategic management in general by empirically separating the two mechanisms and examining organizational responses to conflicting institutional logics. Our study also adds to the understanding of business group restructuring in emerging economies. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

This paper investigates the impact of multiple directorships on corporate diversification. We hypothesize that multiple directorships affect the quality of managerial oversight and, thus, influence the degree of corporate diversification and firm value. The empirical evidence lends credence to this notion. Specifically, we find that directors' busyness is inversely related to firm value. In other words, firms where board members hold more outside board seats suffer a deeper diversification discount. Further analysis also reveals that the negative effect of having overcommitted directors on the board is more pronounced in firms where agency costs are more severe, suggesting that the diversification discount is driven by agency conflicts. Our results aptly fit into the on-going debate on the benefits and detriments of multiple directorships. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Peer monitoring, which occurs when individuals notice and respond to their peers' behavior or performance results, is an informal organizational control that has not been extensively studied. Agency theory suggests that peer monitoring should be associated with higher performance because it allows workers whose interests are aligned with those of the organization to encourage their peers to perform well and deters inappropriate behavior by increasing the chances that it would be detected. This paper considers two research questions. The first is, "What is peer monitoring?" We found two types of peer monitoring. Direct peer monitoring occurs when workers notice their peers' behavior or results and respond in a forthright way, such as correcting coworkers who make mistakes. Indirect peer monitoring occurs when workers gossip about or avoid poorly performing peers. The second research question is, "Is peer monitoring associated with higher work-unit performance?" We examined the effects of both types of peer monitoring on the performance of 67 theme park work units. We considered supervisory monitoring, task interdependence, and cohesiveness as moderators. We measured performance as the degree to which the work unit is free of employee behavior problems and found a positive main effect of direct peer monitoring. The effect was stronger when supervisory monitoring was low or task interdependence was high. Indirect peer monitoring did not have a main effect on work-unit performance, but when supervisory monitoring or cohesiveness was high, indirect peer monitoring was associated with lower performance. We discuss these results and suggest areas for future research. (c) 2008 INFORMS.

A large body of literature has examined how managerial ownership affects corporate strategy and risk-taking. The present study extends this literature by investigating the effect of other forms of corporate ownership on a firm's equity risk (measured as the volatility of a company's stock returns) and stock returns in the People's Republic of China (PRC) - an important emerging economy that is rich in various forms of corporate ownership. We find that the various types of corporate ownership appear to have important but different impacts on equity risk and returns. In particular, companies with more state ownership tend to have higher stock volatility and lower stock returns; in contrast, companies with more legal-person ownership tend to have lower stock volatility and higher stock returns. Foreign and managerial ownership are found to have little effect on firms' equity risk and returns. These findings support the predictions of agency theory - for example, that state ownership increases agency conflicts in companies because bureaucrats and state agencies do not have the same economic incentives to maximize the value of firms. We believe that our study contributes to the international business literature on investment strategy and risk assessment in developing markets such as China, and as a result our findings could have important implications for international investors.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper aims at exploring the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance in the context of a small European capital market. Further developing existing literature, we acknowledge the multi-dimensionality of ownership by including both the fraction of shares owned by the five largest shareholders and the fraction of shares owned by management. Research Findings/Results: Using panel data for the period 2000-2003 with respect to the Italian market, we find that the ownership concentration of the five largest shareholders is beneficial to firm valuation. On the contrary, managerial ownership is beneficial only in non-concentrated firms, suggesting that the controlling owner may use his/her position in the firm to extract private benefits at the expense of the other shareholders by appointing managers that represent its own interest. Theoretical Implications: This study provides empirical support for the agency theory and the managerial entrenchment argument. As such, it suggests new avenues of research for the ownership structure literature willing to reflect the diverging interests of different types of shareholders and to explore both endogeneity and non-linearity issues. Practical Implications: This study contributes to the recent debate on the effects of government regulations inspired by the Anglo-Saxon model of corporate governance in the small European countries. In questioning the alleged competitive superiority of the widely held company, our paper also suggests that the existence of good corporate law is not a sufficient condition for the development of a corporate economy resembling the US model.

Purpose - The relationship between the board characteristics (i.e. board independence, CEO duality, board size, board meeting and board tenure) and the ownership structure (i.e. managerial ownership, family ownership and institutional ownership) and earnings quality is examined. Design/methodology/ approach - Data from 280 non-financial companies listed on Bursa Malaysia's Main Board for the year 2004 is used. Findings - Significant association was found between board tenure and earnings quality. In addition, a positive significant association was found between outside board ownership and family ownership and earnings quality. However no significant relationship was found between board of directors' independence and earnings quality. Research limitations/implications - The association between audit committees' characteristics and earnings quality was not examined. An examination of the impact of ownership structure on boards of directors and audit committees is warranted. An investigation of the impact of the ownership structure on earnings quality in Malaysia using separate test on family-controlled and non-family-controlled firms is suggested. Practical implications - The appropriateness of policy directives requiring majority independent directors may be considered by policy makers. Originality/value - The conflict of interest between outside shareholders and managers in a diffused ownership support the agency theory. However, utility of agency theory to explain the conflicts between the controlling owners and the minority shareholders where ownership concentration is prevalent is limited. Whilst demonstrating the dominant impact of ownership structure on earnings quality in Malaysia the study calls for alternative explanations of corporate governance practices in different institutional settings.

Aftermarket sales and profits are becoming an increasingly important part of an original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) business model. Because replacement parts often do not require further manufacturing, OEMs act as intermediaries in the aftermarket. As with any intermediary, the OEM must concern itself with suppliers disintermediating its supply chain selling replacement parts directly to the OEM's customers. We frame supply chain disintermediation (SCD) as a principal-agent contracting problem between an OEM buyer and a supplier. Hypotheses relate contract conditions, goal incongruence, supplier capabilities and contract enforcement to SCD. The data are collected from the aerospace industry using a multimethod study, combining an Internet-based survey with archival data. Causal modeling with structural equation modeling (SEM) shows general support for the hypotheses. Particularly, SCD is positively related to buyer-supplier goal incongruence. The agency model offers insights that differ from previous transaction-cost-based models of buyer-supplier relationships. OEM buyers with a lucrative aftermarket should consider aligning goals through incentives rather than relying entirely on economic hostages associated with specific assets.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This paper examines the role of audit committees (AC) in the initial public offering (IPO) process in a governance environment where AC best practices are well established but their adoption is voluntary. We consider the creation and characteristics of the committee as signals that issuing firms can use to reduce the underpricing often associated with IPOs. We also examine the effect of the committee on the quality of management earnings forecasts included in the prospectus. Research Findings/Results: Our empirical analysis is performed on a sample of 246 IPOs issued in the Canadian province of Quebec. We find that the creation of an AC at the time of the IPO has no effect on underpricing unless its members are independent and have expertise in financial matters, in which case it decreases significantly the level of underpricing of the IPO. However, we find no significant association between these two governance attributes and the accuracy of forecasts included in prospectuses. Theoretical Implications: Our results suggest that the AC is a credible signal that could be used in the firm's signaling strategy and the results provide support for the monitoring role of the board of directors, as proposed by the agency theory. Practical/Policy Implications: Our results support the worldwide movement in legislations requiring AC independence and expertise. They stress the importance of the presence of qualified members on the AC with sufficient knowledge of accounting and finance. (c) 2008 The Authors.

Previous studies on Japanese corporate governance were largely based on the agency theory framework, and can be seen as attempts to understand the unique monitoring mechanisms in the Japanese context. This paper briefly reviews prior research and then discusses the recent changes in the environment that have been affecting Japanese corporate governance. Our central argument is that there is both change and continuity in Japanese Corporate Governance. We also present emerging research from an institutional theory perspective. In this line of research, corporate governance is treated as part of a nation's institutional framework and hence, researchers need to understand unique institutional arrangements that affect corporate governance practices and their change or continuity.

This paper focuses on two important characteristics of board effectiveness: (1) the proportion of independent non-executive directors; and (2) CEO Duality. The objective of this study is to examine whether the presence of a majority of independent non-executive directors and the separation role between chairman and CEO, as recommended in the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) 2000, effectively constrains the incidence of earnings management as measured by income-increasing and incomedecreasing discretionary accruals. Using data from the top 200 nonfinancial companies listed on Bursa Malaysia's Main Board and Second Board for the year 2004, this study finds a positive significant result of board independence when firms undershoot target earnings. Although contradictory to the prediction of agency theory, the results show that a higher proportion of independent non-executive directors is associated with higher income-increasing earnings manipulations. Neither board independence nor CEO Duality was found significant in other models tested regarding income-increasing and incomedecreasing earnings management. The results of this study cast doubt on the notion that the independence of directors and the role separation between the chairman and the CEO reduces the incidence of earnings management activity, especially with highly concentrated ownership as is typical in Malaysia.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show that corporate governance structures differ significantly across countries. Using agency theory and institutional theory, it examines how ownership structure and national culture influence the size and leadership structure of the corporate boards of multinational firms based in industrial countries. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested with data on 399 multinational manufacturing firms based in 15 industrial countries. The authors use ownership concentration, bank control, and state ownership to represent ownership structure. They view institutional structural norms as components of national culture and infer the nature of these norms for governance structure from Hofstede's national culture dimensions. Findings - The findings show that national culture has a dominant influence on corporate governance structure, and its emphasis is recommended in future cross-national organizational research. Research limitations/implications - Although the models were successful in explaining MNC board structure, the authors addressed only the effects of ownership structure and national culture. It is expected that these models could be improved by including national political and legal differences and additional national economic variables. Practical implications - The findings demonstrate that national cultures of the home countries of MNCs have powerful influences on their governance structures. Originality/value - This paper links national culture with governance structure. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Professional service firms have distinct operational challenges due to the type of work that is transacted by the employees of these firms, and due to the nature of the employees themselves. In this paper, we develop and present factors that influence professional service operations in firms and compensation structures for professional service providers. We establish professional service influence factors, which we posit will impact agency relationships in professional service firms. That is, we hypothesize that professional service influence factors (PSIFs) will moderate the effect of task programmability and outcome measurability in predicting the use of behavior- or outcome-based compensation schemes (control strategy). Logistic regression is used on data provided by 192 professional service providers in order to examine the impact of the agency variables and moderating factors on control strategies. The results indicate that company- and profession-based factors have moderating effects on task programmability when predicting control strategy. We discuss the implications of our findings.

Purpose This exploratory study aims to provide fresh insights into the ownership transfer of private family firms through internal management buy-out (MBO) and external management buy-in (MBI) succession routes. The paper aims to explore if flows of information impact the succession planning process and if the nature of succession planning impacts the business sale negotiation process relating to family firms that select MBO-MBI succession routes. Design-methodology-approach Guided by insights from agency theory and theories relating to information asymmetries and negotiation behaviour six hypotheses were derived. Private family firms that had received venture capital and the MBO-I deals had been completed between 1994 and 2003 were identified. A structured survey was administered to 117 senior members of acquiring MBO-I management teams after the deal had been completed in several European countries. Non-parametric chi-square tests and Mann-Whitney "U" tests were used to test the presented hypotheses. Findings Evidence highlights the importance of information sharing and that the family owner(s) may not always be in the strongest position. MBOs reported lower information asymmetry. Also, lower information asymmetry was reported when vendors and management were involved in succession planning. Internal managers with greater access to information were found to influence the negotiation process and determine who is more likely to benefit from the price to be paid for the firm. A mutually agreed price was less likely when management controlled information and when personal equity providers (PEP) were involved in the process supporting the interests of the MBO-I team. Practical implications Family firm owners need to plan for succession planning. Vendors of family firms need to leverage external professional advice when negotiating the sale of their ventures to ensure "family agendas" are protected. Originality-value This study has extended the conceptual work of Howorth et al. surrounding the succession of family firms through MBOs and MBIs. Rather than relying on case study evidence alone, cross-sectional survey evidence was explored within a univariate statistical framework to explore gaps in the knowledge base relating to succession planning and business sale negotiation behaviour.

Employing both behavioral decision making and agency theories, our study seeks to identify those factors that influence a venture capital (VC) firm's decision to undertake seed capital investments and, subsequently, the scale of such activity. Using data on the investments made by 2949 VC funds raised worldwide between 1962 and 2002, we find investor age, timing of investment, and fund location to be of importance. In addition, the size of the fund and the existing number of portfolio firms exert opposite influences on the level of seed capital activity of the VC firm. These results suggest that seed activity is a valuable source of market intelligence for leading VC firms seeking proactively to identify and invest in novel technologies.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue The relationship between board members and top executives is held central to corporate governance, yet studies of it are relatively few and our knowledge of its consequences is limited. This study aims to address how board-CEO relationships, in terms of power balance and social ties, contribute to the performance of new product introduction. It proposes a contingency view to highlight the context-dependent nature of such governance arrangements. Research Findings/Results Using survey and archival data in a sample of 198 industrial firms in Taiwan, this research finds that the two distinct types of board-CEO relationships relate curvilinearly to the performance of new product introduction. Furthermore, such universal relationships are moderated by market instability and board interlocks, respectively. Theoretical Implications: This study departs from the traditional agency view to an argument that fine-tuned board-CEO relationships, in light of sociopolitical and sociopsychological forces, and will serve as an essential enabling context for managerial risk taking. It demonstrates that research in this field should accommodate different theories to elaborate on the underlying tensions in the corporate governance and emphasize the merits of complementarity. Practical Implications: Acknowledging that good governance design softens managerial risk aversion, this study helps identify the governance conditions in which risk differentials between the board and CEO may align, and thus when exploratory efforts, in the form of new product introduction, are more likely to succeed.

Director compensation can potentially represent an ethical minefield. When faced with supporting strategic decisions that can lead to an increase in director pay, directors may consider their own interests and not solely those of the shareholders to whom they are legally bound to represent. In such cases, directors essentially become agents, rather than those installed to protect principals (shareholders) from agents. Using acquisitions as a study context, we employ a matched-pair design and find a statistically significant difference in outside director compensation between acquiring and control firms. Outside directors of acquiring firms earn more than twice as much as their counterparts in the matched-sample. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

We examine the effect of non-mandatory corporate governance practices on a comprehensive set of audit judgments. We provide initial evidence on how auditors respond to corporate governance in an institutional environment where corporate governance is not mandated by law. Based on the agency and resource dependence theories, we hypothesise associations between corporate governance and auditors' judgments relating to client acceptance, risk assessments, and the extent and timing of substantive testing. Sixty Big 4 audit managers from Singapore are randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions comprising weak, moderate and strong corporate governance. Our results show auditors make more favourable client acceptance judgments when corporate governance is stronger. Clients with stronger corporate governance are assessed as having lower control environment risk. After controlling for control environment risk, we find that stronger corporate governance increases auditors' reliance on the client's internal controls and reduces the extent of substantive tests. When corporate governance is stronger, we observe that auditors conduct more substantive testing during the interim period compared to the year-end. Our findings suggest that audit strategies are responsive to the strength of a client's corporate governance.

Greatly changing scenarios are affecting how organizations must be managed, leading to the need for very efficacious, efficient governance and management systems. Nowadays, it is essential to examine the elements that organizational governance implies and to pay special attention to the relation between governance and the agency theory that is becoming vital in the seductive, complex topic of contemporaneous companies. This article broaches the theoretical bases of this issue, for the purpose of structuring a conceptual framework to organize the knowledge and scope of corporate governance and its alignment mechanisms, especially those related to the role of administration councils. The article ends by mentioning some papers on this matter, to give it a pragmatic approach.

Agency theory has been the dominant framework for a theoretical conceptualization of corporate governance. According to this view, the governance problem of uncertainty about managerial behavior can be solved by assuming opportunistic behavior and setting up governance mechanisms to curtail opportunism. However, the adequacy of agency theory has recently been challenged because distrust-based governance mechanisms that are in line with the theory's recommendations have been ineffective to avoid managerial misconduct. Moreover, agency-based control and incentive systems have even been accused of being harmful. Stewardship theory has been proposed as an alternative approach. Building on a contrasting assumption about managerial behavior, this approach recommends trust-based governance designs that may, however, result in a one-sided and potentially disadvantageous system, too. On the basis of an in-depth analysis and critique of both theories this paper explores ways to either separate or combine the rival approaches. Due to shortcomings of these strategies a new perspective for the design of corporate governance systems is presented that opens the possibility of overcoming the theoretical tension.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual. Research Question/Issue: Post-acquisition director turnover is a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that needs to be examined beyond the agency lens. In this article, we examine the likelihood of non-executive director turnover in target firms following an acquisition. Research Findings/Result: Acquisitions present an interesting case where conflict of interests may arise between shareholders and directors. This study proposes that the likelihood of target non-executive director turnover depends on the factors that determine the performance of directors in their monitoring, advisory and social roles pre-acquisition and during the acquisition process. Theoretical Implications: While there are multiple studies examining the likelihood of turnover of executive directors (TMTs) following an acquisition, there is no systematic conceptual research explaining the likelihood of turnover of non-executive directors. We draw on three theoretical perspectives-agency theory, resource-based view and the social capital perspective to comprehensively investigate target non-executive director turnover post-acquisition. We further clarify the boundaries of these theoretical arguments concerning their implications for target non-executive director turnover. Practical Implications: One of the most important tasks for the newly formed firm post-acquisition is to build the new leadership team, including a new board. In view of the important roles directors take on in modern corporations, it is critical to understand how the new board should be constituted and what members of the target firm are more likely to join that new board.

In this paper we investigate three corporate governance issues in 30 Italian family firms: (i) the orientation either to the Agency Theory or to the Stewardship Theory; (ii) the board of directors' composition; (iii) the ability to involve nonfamily individuals in the company's management and governance (Openness Index) and the decision-making quality (Extension Index) and we analyze empirical results through a cluster analysis by following the Gubitta and Gianecchini's approach (2002). Our conclusion suggests that (i) small Italian family firms' corporate governance systems seem to be consistent with the guidelines suggested by the Stewardship Theory and (ii) Italian family firms' boards are characterized by a relevant presence of family members.

The empirical support for agency theory explanations for the great variance in CEO pay has been equivocal. Drawing from the performance appraisal literature, we hypothesize that boards of directors incorporate human judgment into the evaluation and reward of CEO performance in order to balance managerial risk with agency costs. We test Baysinger and Hoskisson's (1990) proposition that insider-dominated corporate boards rely on subjective performance evaluation to reward the CEO, and we argue that R&D intensity influences this relationship. Using a sample of Fortune firms, findings support our contention that human judgment is important in evaluating and rewarding CEO performance. (c) 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Scholarly investigations on the board of directors, although intense from the mid-1990s onward, did not lead to entirely convincing results. This study proposes discussion on building a multidisciplinary and integrated theoretical framework able to capture the complexity and distinctive dimensions of the board as a group decision-making process. This is achieved through an essay developed from analytical and descriptive review of the literature. A synthesis on board research is presented, aiming to understand theoretical models lenses used to study corporate governance issues. The strengths and weaknesses of these models are pointed out, and their influence on board investigation is observed. This essay concludes by proposing a research agenda that considers the addition of psychological and sociological approaches to economic models of the analysis of group decision-making.

We examine the effects of venture capitalist involvement and equity incentives for all employees on the performance of initial public offering firms. Data was collected from 402 IPO firms, representing 242 non-VC backed and 160 VC backed firms. Results indicate venture capitalists positively influence the likelihood the portfolio firm will offer equity incentives to all employees. Consistent with the agency theory argument that monitoring and incentives can behave as complements to one another, the results suggest venture capitalist backing and incentive stock options for all employees operate in concert to have a positive effect on stock price performance three years after the initial public offering.

The attention to boards of directors in small firms is increasing. Traditionally they have been considered to be passive but boards in small firms are undergoing major changes. We test hypotheses of what makes boards in small firms active and allows them to contribute to value creation. Activity is seen in relation to board task involvement. Predictions based on agency theory, resource dependence theory and the resource-based view of the firm are used. We found strong support for hypotheses highlighting the use of the knowledge of the board members and various board maintenance tools, such as regular board evaluations, to increase board task involvement. Actionable advice to boards in small firms is provided.

Building on agency and prospect theory views, many researchers have analyzed the executive risk-taking behavior. They have usually put in evidence the role of the mechanisms of corporate governance. In this research, we try to point out that even managerial entrenchment does matter. We consider the non financial firms that are listed in the Tunisian Stock exchange during the 1996 - 2006 period. To reveal the managerial risk taking, we apply factor analysis so as to construct a global index. To find out the impact of managerial entrenchment on risk-taking, we consider the ownership of the manager, his experience within the firm as well as his age. The size of the firm is also worth investigating while exploring managerial risk taking. The results are somewhat robust to different specifications. They may enhance and extend the agency-based corporate governance literature on executive risk-taking. But above all, they may shed some light on the emerging markets context namely the Tunisian one.

Anglo governance systems rely of a number of controls to align shareholder and boards of director's interests. In general they are referred to as market control, regulatory control, and political and cultural control. Agency theory proposes that these control mechanisms are necessary as human nature is such that directors and managers act in a self-interested and boundedly rational manner in decision-making that can result in sub optimality. Notwithstanding that each country within the Anglo system accepts such controls are necessary they have their own foci and priorities, being a product of their own system's characteristics. This paper through interviewing a number of Australian business executives adds to the academic literature by providing evidence from the field of the important characteristics of the Australian governance system, the drivers of change and the effectiveness of the principles-based approach. It argues that debate needs to move beyond the principles versus rules approach to look at how firms can be provided with more guidance in operationalising some of the principles that appear to be key to governance effectiveness. It concludes that there is a need for a holistic model of governance that is broader than that focusing on the control/legalistic approach; that top management is important in setting and driving the in-firm governance agenda; that the public needs to be informed and educated about governance and its importance; and that disclosure still requires an improvement in quality.

In this article we analyse how board characteristics influence firm innovation. Firm innovation refers to basic innovation and entrepreneurial activities internal to a firm, such as the firm emphasis on new product development, innovation technology, and R&D investments. Drawing on agency theory, we developed hypotheses on specific board structural characteristics - i.e. board size, outsider ratio, directors' shareholdings, and CEO duality - and firm innovation. We tested our model on a sample of 301 large manufacturing Italian companies. We find support for our argument that - contrary to predictions of agency theory on CEO ownership - directors' shareholdings negatively influence firm propensity to innovate. Our results also suggest that board size may play a role in shaping firm propensity toward innovation.

This article presents some of the conclusions from a study about board of directors in small firms in Norway and Sweden. Theories built on neoclassical and socio-economic assumptions are integrated, and a stakeholder approach is adapted. Theories based on neo-classical paradigms have dominated most recent research about boards of directors. These studies have focused on board composition such as insider/outsider ratio, board members stock ownership and board size. Models based on agency theory and legalistic approaches have contributed to the framework for these studies, which mainly discuss the consequences of the board's independence of management in order to be an effective control mechanism. The present study adds a dimension of 'interdependence' or closeness to the traditional 'independence'- criterion. Interdependence is measured by the degree of relational norms (Macneil, 1980) between directors and management. The study is an associative cross-sectional field survey of 108 joint stock dual leadership hotels in Norway and Sweden, and uses a dyadic approach with CEOs and chairmen as respondents. This is the first study conducted using a dyadic approach in understanding directorates. The findings of this research contribute to an increased understanding of the role of directorates and board - management relations. The study illustrates the importance of distinguishing company size in research about directors and management, and it shows that a socioeconomic approach may have larger explanatory power than theories based on neo-classical paradigms.

Directors' and officers' (D&O) insurance can play an important role in disciplining managers in the interest of the shareholders' goals. I investigate the current status of the discussion on D&O insurance in Germany and the role of D&O insurance as well as D&O insurers as a corporate governance instrument. Using the agency theory, the paper argues that shareholders of large German corporations delegate the monitoring to the board (Aufsichtsrat), to the independent auditor, but also to D&O insurers. Given the German Managed Governance system with a traditionally high degree of debt financing and bank control, the monitoring role of the D&O insurers can therefore be interpreted as being similar to creditor monitoring.

This paper aims to investigate the key drivers and level of voluntary intellectual capital disclosures in Bahraini companies' annual reports. The paper uses an intellectual capital disclosure index score of voluntary disclosures in all Bahraini companies listed on the Bahrain Stock Exchange, and tests the relationship between voluntary disclosures of intangible firm value with traditional agency theory variables. The relationships are tested statistically using correlation and multiple-regression analysis. The level of voluntary intellectual capital disclosures in the annual reports is tested with regard to the following key drivers: the level of board independence; financial leverage; firm age; and firm size. Multiple regression analysis revealed that financial leverage and firm size had a significant relationship with the level of voluntary intellectual capital disclosure in Bahraini companies listed on the Bahrain Stock Exchange.

In 2003, an important national policy of rejuvenating Northeast China was put forward. The region produces nearly 25% of the country's agricultural commodities. This paper focuses on the adoption of Logistics Information Systems (LIS) in Northeast China's large-scale agricultural corporations. Case research method is used, and Jilin Grain Group Co. Ltd. and Haoyue Beef Co. Ltd. are chosen as our research cases. They both adopted LIS to enhance their logistics efficiency. We adopt the UTAUT model and agency theory to analyze the factors affecting their adoption. This paper finds and tests that principal-agent problems serve as one of the main factors affecting the adoption in Northeast China's large-scale agricultural corporations. So in order to better adopt and use LIS, it is important to adjust the organization system, and to align the interest of the principal and that of the agent. (c) ASCE.

Based on the work of Berle and Means (1932), Coase (1937), Arrow (1971), and others, agency theory emerged in the 1970s to explain economic relationships under conditions of uncertainty and less-than-perfect information. It has become a widely used theoretical lens in strategic management research, with applications intended to inform research about corporate governance (Finkelstein and D'Aveni, 1994; Walsh and Kosnik, 1993), CEO compensation (Barkema and Gomez-Mehia, 1998), firm performance (Brush, Bromiley, and Hendrickx, 2000; Li and Simerly, 1998), firm risk (Bloom and Milkovich, 1998; Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia, 1998); and strategic decisions such as diversification (Kochhar, 1996; Markides and Singh, 1997) and mergers (Holl and Kyriazis, 1997; Reuer and Miller, 1997).

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper investigates the relationship between internal governance structures and financial performance of Indian companies. The effectiveness of boards of directors, including board composition, board size, and aspects of board leadership including duality and board busyness are addressed in the Indian context using two theories of corporate governance: agency theory and resource dependency theory. Research Findings/Insights: The study used a sample of top Indian companies taking into account the endogeneity of the relationships among corporate governance, corporate performance, and corporate capital structure. The study provides some support for aspects of agency theory as a greater proportion of outside directors on boards were associated with improved firm performance. The notion of separating leadership roles in a manner consistent with agency theory was not supported. For instance, the notion that powerful CEOs (duality role, CEO being the promoter, and CEO being the only board manager) have a detrimental effect on performance was not supported. There was some support for resource dependency theory. The findings suggest that larger board size has a positive impact on performance thus supporting the view that greater exposure to the external environment improves access to various resources and thus positively impacts on performance. The study however failed to support the resource dependency theory in terms of the association between frequency of board meetings and performance. Similarly the results showed that outside directors with multiple appointments appeared to have a negative effect on performance, suggesting that "busyness" did not add value in terms of networks and enhancement of resource accessibility. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The two theories of corporate governance, namely agency and resource dependence theory, were each only partially supported, by the findings of this study. The findings add further to the view that no single theory explains the nexus between corporate governance and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study demonstrates that corporate governance measures utilized in developed economies related to boards of directors have some synergies and relevance to emerging economies, such as India. However, the nature of business structures in India, for example the large number of family businesses, may limit the generalizability of the findings and signals the need for further investigation of these businesses. The evidence related to multiple appointments of directors suggests that there may be support for restricting the number of directorships held by any one individual in emerging economies, given that the "busyness" of directors was negatively associated with firm performance.

Relatively few studies have examined the audit committee oversight process - the activities that link audit committee inputs and financial reporting outcomes. To study this process, we conducted extensive interviews with 42 U.S. public company audit committee members. We explore six audit committee process areas, offer insights into the state of audit committee processes in the post-Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) environment, and consider our results in light of agency theory and institutional theory. We find that many audit committee members strive to provide effective monitoring of financial reporting and seek to avoid serving on ceremonial audit committees, but within each of the six process areas we find evidence of both substantive monitoring and ceremonial action, such that neither agency theory nor institutional theory fully explains our results. We also find that many responses vary with personal and company characteristics, with particularly notable differences related to audit committee members' accounting expertise and time of appointment to the audit committee (pre-SOX versus post-SOX). We discuss implications and directions for future research and theory development. (c) CAAA.

Family businesses (FBs) play a key role in the world's economies. Unfortunately, the current literature surfaces disparate understandings and conclusions concerning their conduct and performance. Much of that literature falls under two insightful perspectives, agency theory and stewardship theory, that conflict quite directly. The agency view, based in economics, maintains that families will pursue utility for themselves to the detriment of their public shareholders. By contrast, stewardship proponents, arguing from a psychological perspective, suggest that family owners will invest deeply in their enterprise, to the benefit of all. This study synthesizes the literature on each of these perspectives to derive core motivational assumptions and expected organizational outcomes. Then, by employing a third sociological perspective, it proposes to reconcile these opposing views by considering the social embeddedness of firms and their key actors within the institution of the family for different types of public family enterprises. It will argue that there is a need for such integration in order to better understand and permit accurate, context-based predictions across various kinds of family businesses and family business situations.

Using takeover protection as an indicator of corporate governance, this study examines how an exogenous shift in power from shareholders to managers affects corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Two competing hypotheses are entertained. The shareholder view predicts that stronger takeover protection will lead to a decrease in corporate attention to shareholders and non-shareholding stakeholders alike, as managers divert resources from share-holders to the pursuit of their private interests. The stakeholder view, in contrast, predicts that stronger takeover protection will increase corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Because catering to non-shareholding stakeholders contributes to the long-term value of the firm, managers will be more likely to attend to those stakeholders when relieved from short-termism triggered by the threat of hostile takeovers. Using a sample of 878 U.S. firms from 1991 to 2002, the study finds that an exogenous increase in takeover protection leads to higher corporate attention to community and the natural environment, but has no impact on corporate attention to employees, minorities, and customers. Additional analyses show that firms that increase their attention to stakeholders experience an increase in long-term shareholder value. These findings provide additional evidence that relief from short-termism is a likely source of the increase in corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders following the increase in takeover protection.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: The goal of this paper is to meta-analyze the results of 35 studies that examine the effect on earnings management of firms' boards of directors and ownership structure. We examine whether differences in results are attributable to moderating effects related to the system of corporate governance, the measurement of the governance variable, or the particular specifications of discretionary accruals models. Research Findings/Insights: The findings show that the variation in the results of previous studies on CEO duality and audit committee independence are caused by sampling error. In addition, the measurement of dependent variable, discretionary accruals, and the corporate governance system moderate the association between earnings management and some corporate governance variables. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The measurement of variables, especially discretionary accruals, influences the findings found in previous studies. The findings emphasize the need to explicitly consider the legal and institutional setting when one analyzes the effect of mechanisms of corporate governance on discretionary accruals. Future research should include matrix correlations, and consider detailed measures of earnings management and more attributes of boards of directors in order to facilitate research using meta-analysis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The results suggest that board independence, board size, and audit committee independence can improve investor confidence by constraining earnings management. Additional empirical evidence regarding refined measures of ownership and board, specifically board independence, would be very useful in gaining greater understanding of how the different approaches to these constructs influence earnings management.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper takes a theory building approach to highlighting variations of agency theory in the unique and complex context of Islamic banks, mainly stemming from the need to comply with Sharia and the separation of cash flow and control rights for a category of investors. Research Findings/Results: The paper provides insights that agency structures in the context of Islamic banking might give rise to trade-offs between Sharia compliance and mechanisms protecting investors' rights. Alternative models of idiosyncratic governance might be effective in balancing the two cornerstones of the agency dynamic. In practice, the paper finds that most of the surveyed Islamic banks appear to recognize the value of governance and institute some basic mechanisms. Nonetheless, some governance flaws relating to audit, control, and transparency are observed, a situation further exacerbated by the fact that investment account holders are not represented on the board, and are not granted control or monitoring rights. This leads to a discussion on the tradeoff between the costs and benefits of such a practice. Theoretical Implications: This study contributes to the agency theory literature by providing theoretical propositions highlighting challenges to this theory whereby mechanisms with the purpose of mitigating agency problems might lead to a divergence from Islamic principles of Sharia. Practical Implications: The paper motivates Islamic banks to improve governance practices currently in place. It alerts policy makers to the need to tailor the regulations to safeguard the interests of all investors without violating the principles of Sharia. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: This paper extends the theory of bundles of corporate governance mechanisms to address agency issues within the Anglo-Saxon system of corporate governance. The focus of our study is to detail the role of firm performance as a key determinant of how the governance mechanisms of monitoring and incentive alignment serve as complements or substitutes in addressing agency issues. Previous research has looked at these mechanisms in isolation from each other, with limited regard for the contingencies of firm performance and external monitoring. We propose that it is best to look at these mechanisms as a bundle of mechanisms to protect shareholder interests, and that firm performance is a key determinant of the composition of this bundle. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce firm performance as a critical contingency that heightens shareholders' concerns over governance issues as they seek to retain control over adverse selection and moral hazard problems. We propose that when firms are performing poorly, outside monitoring by institutional investors can complement internal monitoring by boards of directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We examine governance bundles under both agency and stewardship theoretical lenses to tie together previous empirical research and advance theory. In specifying the role of firm performance in determining the mix of mechanisms within the governance bundle, we reconcile prior disparate findings as to whether or not these governance mechanisms act in a complementary or substitutable fashion. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The conceptualization of these governance mechanisms has practitioner merit in analyzing the challenges that board members face managing agency conflicts through the mix of governance mechanisms, given different levels of firm performance. Our research also shows that, under conditions of poor performance, shareholders can provide effective external monitoring that can improve the overall governance effectiveness of the firm.

This article introduces managers' personal risk considerations into the relationship between organizational decline and innovation. The agency-based perspective is used to complement threat rigidity theory and prospect theory in examining how managerial ownership and slack resources affect managers' innovation decisions when firms experience poor performance. The findings indicate that more managerial ownership decelerates innovation spending. The availability of slack resources also reduces the rate of innovation investments. Firms with more slack resources and higher levels of managerial ownership jointly reduce innovation under circumstances of decline. Last, poorly performing firms that continue investments in innovation exhibit a lower probability of survival. (c) 2009 Sage Publications.

Agency theory has focused on buyouts as a governance and control device to increase profitability, organizational efficiency, and limited attention to growth. A strategic entrepreneurship view of buyouts incorporates upside incentives for value creation associated with growth as well as efficiency gains. In this paper, we develop the complementarity between agency theory and strategic entrepreneurship perspectives to examine the performance implications for different types of buyouts. Further, we study how the involvement of private equity (PE) firms is related to the performance of the post-buyout firm. These issues are examined for a sample of 238 PE-backed buyouts in the UK between 1993 and 2003. Implications for theory and practice are suggested. (c) 2009 Baylor University.

There is considerable variation across countries in both the extent to which large publicly listed firms are family-owned and the dominance of such family-owned firms in stock markets. The literature presents competing theoretical viewpoints on what influences such country-level variation. On one hand, institutional economists suggest that institutional voids can have a strong influence. On the other hand, cultural sociologists suggest that a country's culture can have a strong influence. One type of institutional void is a lack of institutional norms and regulations needed for monitoring contracts (which can discourage owners from hiring professional agents for top management positions in their firms) and another type of institutional void is a lack of financial credit availability in the country. Cultural dimensions include collectivism (i.e. cohesion within in-groups/families) and power distance (i.e. inequalities in society). This country-level empirical study suggests that both national culture and institutional voids influence family ownership patterns around the world, and that institutional voids moderate the influence of national culture. National culture has a stronger influence when a country has institutional voids; however, the influence of national culture weakens when institutional voids are overcome. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Agency theory addresses problems created from the separation of principals and agents in modern corporations. Some agency theorists have investigated the exact relationship between control mechanisms (monitoring and bonding) and suggested that they work as substitutes. We posit that, although monitoring and bonding may be concurrent substitutes in a system of governance, monitoring intensity is positively related to bonding (i.e., compensation) so that over time, they are complements rather than substitutes. In particular, we suggest that increased monitoring intensity shifts risk to managers, who then require greater compensation to offset their increased employment and career risk. Accordingly, they reinforce each other in a negative cycle such that monitoring leads to increased pay, which in turn leads to increased monitoring due to complaints of excessive pay. The result is that in today's economic environment society often criticizes executive pay without realizing that, in part, higher compensation is an outcome of prior increased monitoring intensity. These findings are particularly important as elected officials are increasingly under pressure to monitor and limit executive compensation. An understanding of this relationship also has implications for executive risk taking and entrepreneurial activities.

Manuscript Type: Editorial Research Question/Issue: This essay identifies some key issues for the analysis of corporate governance based on the articles within this special review issue coupled with our own perspectives. Our aim in this issue is to distil some research streams in the field and identify opportunities for future research. Research Findings/Results: We summarize the eight papers included in this special issue and briefly highlight their main contributions to the literature which collectively deal with the role and impact of corporate boards, codes of corporate governance, and the globalization of corporate governance systems. In addition to the new insights offered by these reviews, we attempt to offer our own ideas on where future research needs to be targeted. Theoretical Implications: We highlight a number of research themes where future governance research may prove fruitful. This includes taking a more holistic approach to corporate governance issues and developing an inter-disciplinary perspective by building on agency theory while considering the rich new insights offered by complementary theories, such as behavioral theory, institutional theory and the resource-based views of the firm. In particular, future corporate governance research needs to be conducted in multiple countries, particularly in emerging economies, if we want to move closer to the journal's aim of producing a global theory of corporate governance. Practical Implications: Our analysis suggests that analytic and regulatory approaches to corporate governance issues should move from a "one-size-fits-all" template to taking into account organizational, institutional and national contexts.

Agency theory posits that the greater degree of control by those with decision-making authority, the greater the overall organizational performance. Conversely, entrenchment theory implies that at extremely high levels of inside control by those with decision authority, organizational performance decreases. Using a nationwide sample of 2,631 privately held and publically traded family businesses, we examined if the relationship of percent family ownership is an agency or entrenchment relationship and found the latter. Specifically, there was a statistically significant negative relationship between percent of family control and sales growth as well as a strong inverse relationship between percent of family controlling the top management team and all measures of financial performance.

Drawing on agency theory, corporate governance, and international business literatures, we develop arguments relating equity ownership structures and CEO compensation mix to a firm's choice of foreign market entry modes. Based on a sample of 432 foreign market entries by 118 non-diversified firms in the US manufacturing sector between 1991 and 1998, our findings indicate that greater equity ownership by institutional shareholders and inside directors is positively associated with a preference for full-control entry modes. In addition, our results suggest that CEOs with a greater proportion of pay tied to firm long-term performance are more inclined to choose full-control entry modes over shared-control modes.

In a broad sense, corporate governance is about how firms should be governed so that they are run effectively and efficiently. This paper takes a broad perspective on corporate governance mechanisms and considers possible synergies between corporate governance and international business (IB) research. We summarize the papers included in this Focused Issue, and draw out their main contributions to the literature. In so doing, we compare and contrast the four theoretical perspectives concerning corporate governance and IB adopted in the five papers: i.e. transaction cost economics, the resource-based view, agency theory, and institutional theory. Finally, we highlight five research themes (international diversification, business groups, entry modes, subsidiary mandates, and new international ownership structures) where future work explicitly addressing governance issues may prove fruitful.

The current literature frequently examines the effects of shareholder rights protection on corporate cash holdings in the context of agency theory. In this study, we show that national culture influences corporate managers' cash holding behavior beyond the effects of corporate governance and financial market developments in each country through the perception of agency costs and value of financial flexibility. Using Hofstede's cultural dimension indices, we find that corporations hold larger cash and liquid balances in countries where the people tend to avoid uncertainty more, are culturally more masculine, and have longer term orientation.

Drawing on the agency theory, corporate governance, and international business literatures, the authors link board characteristics and managerial incentives to the choice between acquisitions and joint ventures by firms entering foreign markets. Hypothesized relationships are examined in the context of 383 acquisition and 171 joint venture entries undertaken by relatively nondiversified firms in the U.S. manufacturing sector during the period 1991 to 1999. Findings indicate that firms with boards characterized by a higher proportion of outside directors and independent leadership structures (i.e., the absence of duality) are more inclined to favor acquisitions over joint ventures in foreign market entry. Likewise, the data reveal that firms where insiders have greater equity ownership and compensation structures that are more closely linked to long-term firm performance prefer acquisitions over joint ventures. Implications of the findings along with directions for future research are discussed. (c) 2009 Southern Management Association.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines whether ownership concentration affects board and audit committee independence, and whether the impact of board and audit committee independence on firm value is moderated by ownership concentration and dividend payouts. Research Findings/Insights: Using panel data on a sample of Australian publicly listed firms over the period 2000-2005 (1,530 firm-year observations), the study finds that ownership concentration has a negative impact on board independence, but no impact on audit committee independence. Results also suggest that board independence enhances firm value and that performance impact of board independence is stronger in closely-held firms and/or firms having low dividend payouts. A marginally positive impact of audit committee independence, especially among closely-held firms, is also found. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study suggests that the impact of governance mechanisms is moderated by companies' ownership structure and dividend policies. It extends research on the effectiveness of governance mechanisms by distinguishing two types of agency problems and using a simultaneous equations model. The findings underline the important governance role that independent boards and audit committee can play in a country that has high ownership concentration and high levels of private benefits of control. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The results of this study strengthen the idea that independent directors can also play a key role in the governance of closely-held firms. As such, for investors, as far as agency costs are concerned, investments in closely-held firms that have a higher proportion of independent directors on the board and audit committee are sensible. Closely-held firms should be aware of the investor's need for more independent directors, especially when dividends are low. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper examines the relationships between initial public offering (IPO) underpricing, CEO duality, and strategic ownership in 12 Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Research Findings/Results: Using all IPOs from January 2000 until the end of July 2007, we document an average IPO underpricing of 184.1 per cent. Underpricing is higher in IPO firms that have CEO duality. However, strategic shareholders, such as corporations and other industry-related investors, are likely to play a monitoring role whereas underpricing is found to be lower in firms with both CEO duality and strategic shareholder ownership. Moreover, the negative relation between underpricing and strategic blockholding is greater for foreign strategic ownership than it is for domestic strategic ownership. Theoretical Implications: This paper examines the level and determinants of IPO underpricing in the MENA region. It provides evidence on the role played by foreign strategic owners in reducing agency conflicts and information asymmetries within an environment where firms may be affected by the cultural issues related to political ties and family involvement. Practical Implications: Our results contribute to the existing debate on the appropriate regulations for an effective and stable financial system in Arab countries. They offer policy-makers additional evidence on the positive impact of market openness to foreign shareholders. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Syndicates are a form of inter-firm alliance in which two or more private equity firms invest together in an investee firm and share a joint pay-off, and are an enduring feature of the leveraged buyout (LBO) and private equity industry. This study examines the relationship between syndication and agency costs at the investor-investee level, and the extent to which the reputation and the network position of the lead investor mediate this relationship. We examine this relationship using a sample of 1,122 buyout investments by 80 private equity companies in the UK between 1993 and 2006. Our findings show that where agency costs are highest, and hence ex-post monitoring by the lead investor is more important, syndication is less likely to occur. The negative relationship between agency costs and syndication, however, is alleviated by the reputation and network position of the lead investor firm. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: We assess the corporate governance role and the impact of private equity. Research Findings/Results: Private equity firms are heterogeneous in their characteristics and activities. Nevertheless, a corporate governance structure with private equity involvement provides incentives to reduce agency and free cash flow problems. Additionally, private equity enhances the efficacy of the market for corporate control. Private equity investment is associated with performance gains, with such gains not simply being a result of transfers from other stakeholders. In the short term, the benefits appear clear to outgoing owners and to the new owners and management while in the longer term the benefits are less clear. While non-financial stakeholders argue that other stakeholders suffer in the short and long term, the evidence to support this view is at best mixed. Theoretical Implications: By reviewing a comprehensive selection of theoretical and empirical papers published in refereed academic journals in finance, economics, entrepreneurship, and management as well as publicly available working papers and private equity industry studies, we develop a more complete understanding of private equity investment. Agency theory has shortcomings when applied to the broad sweep of private equity-backed buyout types, as in some cases pre-ownership change agency problems were likely low (e.g., family firms), in some cases the exploitation of growth opportunities owes more to the entrepreneurial behavior of managers than to improved incentives, and in some institutional contexts outside Anglo-Saxon countries traditional agency issues are different and stakeholder interests are more important. There is a need for further theorizing on the heterogeneity of buyout and private equity types and the contexts in which they occur. Particularly useful perspectives seem to be entrepreneurial perspectives (e.g., entrepreneurial cognition, strategic entrepreneurship), stewardship theory, and institutional theory. Stakeholder governance theory (e.g., relating to employee ownership and participation) may also be useful for explaining wider distribution of gains. Practical Implications: Private equity investment is a positive feature of the corporate restructuring landscape. There is a need for managers and their advisors to be aware of the heterogeneity of the opportunities to create value and the expertise of different private equity firms. Policymakers designing mechanisms to regulate private equity need to be aware of the systematic evidence that shows a more positive impact of private equity than some have claimed, but also that there are heterogeneous effects relating to different types of buyouts and private equity firms that need to be taken into account.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Prior to China's split-share structure reform, domestic A shares were divided into non-tradable and tradable shares. Non-tradable shareholders represent the government, hold roughly a two-thirds majority, and manage the firms, while tradable shareholders have little power to affect the decisions made by non-tradable shareholders. This is a typical structure to exhibit agency problems. The 2005 structure reform program stipulates that non-tradable shareholders have to bargain with tradable shareholders in order to gain liquidity. The price that non-tradable shareholders pay to tradable shareholders for gaining liquidity is defined as "compensation." We explore the issue of why corporate governance might play an important role in affecting the level of compensation. Research Findings/Insights: Firms with a weak governance structure or severe agency problems are required to have a higher level of compensation. The level of compensation is positively correlated with the non-tradable shareholding, the pledge ratio, and related-party transactions, and is negatively correlated with foreign shareholdings. The same set of variables dictates the ex-post wealth effect of tradable shareholders, but in the reverse direction. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The share reform provides a natural setting that allows tradable shareholders to reflect their concerns with agency problems. The mechanism could ameliorate the agency problems. Corporate governance, in a broad sense, is related to compensation and the ex-post wealth effect of tradable shares. Practitioner/Policy Implications: A successful mechanism should be designed to have minority shareholders involved in the process and have the final compensation reflect the quality of corporate governance.

Entrepreneurs with firm-specific human capital represent both a potential source of competitive advantage and a threat to appropriate the rents that are ultimately generated by a new venture. This situation presents interesting agency and resource dependence challenges. While potential investors in these ventures will want assurances that their interests are protected, they will also want to ensure that these key entrepreneurs remain with the organization. Using agency theory and resource dependence theory, we examine the types of governance mechanisms that are implemented in firms going through an initial public offering comparing those ventures which indicate a dependence on these critical entrepreneurs versus those that do not. Our analysis reveals that ventures exhibiting dependence on key entrepreneurs are associated with higher insider and outsider ownership by the board, greater start-up experience by the board, greater use of contingent compensation, and greater use of involuntary departure agreements.

Recent research has shown evidence that larger firms are more likely to destroy shareholder wealth through acquisitions. Those findings suggest that managers of larger firms are less likely to be disciplined by the market for corporate control than managers of smaller firms. With a sample of nearly 8000 acquisitions over the period from 1980-1999, this paper offers evidence to the contrary. The results suggest that larger firms are more likely to be the target of a disciplinary takeover than smaller firms. Further tests indicate that CEOs of larger firms are significantly more likely to be replaced following a series of poor acquisitions than CEOs of smaller firms. In total, managers of the largest firms continue to make the worst acquisitions despite the evidence that they are more likely to be punished for doing so. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Motivated by agency theory, we explore the potential impact of managerial entrenchment through staggered boards on dividend policy. The evidence suggests that firms with staggered boards are more likely to pay dividends. Among firms that pay dividends, those with staggered boards pay larger dividends. We also show that the impact of staggered boards on dividend payouts is substantially stronger (as much as two to three times larger) than the effect of all other corporate governance provisions combined. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the notion that dividends help alleviate agency conflicts. Thus, firms more vulnerable to managerial entrenchment, i.e., firms with staggered boards, rely more on dividends to mitigate agency costs. Aware of potential endogeneity, we demonstrate that staggered boards likely bring about, and are not merely associated with, larger dividend payouts. Our results are important, as they show that certain governance provisions have considerably more influence than others on critical corporate activities such as dividend payout decisions.

We propose a research agenda that can assist in developing a dynamic and comprehensive theory of boards of directors. It is based upon the concept of temporality, with time being organised around the life-cycle metaphor, and integrates research on agency theory, decision-making theory and resource dependence theory. We identify three key roles of boards of directors: 1) Monitoring and controlling top management 2) Involvement in strategic decision-making; and 3) Providing access to resources and networks. Our analysis suggests that boards perform all three roles, but that these roles change over time. We propose clear researchable questions for each stage of the organisational life cycle as well as the transition between the stages.

In this study, we analyze the determinants of the corporate dividend policy using a sample of firms listed on New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZSE). NZSE firms traditionally have high dividend pay-outs compared with companies in the US. This raises the question whether the existing dividend theories are applicable the NZSE firms. Our findings provide strong support to the agency cost theory and partially support transaction cost and residual dividend theory. We find that a dividend payout ratio is positively related to the degree of ownership dispersion and negatively related to the degree of insider ownership. We also find that firms that experience recent growth in revenues tend to pay lower dividends. There is a weak evidence to support the imputation tax credit hypothesis. We do not find evidence to support the dividend stability theory and the signalling theory. (c) EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2009.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether anti-director laws and legal director liability rules affect the diligence of directors in setting the compensation of CEOs. The study uses a world-wide data set covering 27 countries for the period 1995 to 2005. Research Findings/Results: Controlling for a number of legal and economic determinants, we find that independent of managerial risk-aversion, CEO pay is always less generous under stricter anti-director rules and a stronger rule of law. Director liability rules are associated with more generous pay schemes. The results persist once we control for the presence of institutional investors and cross-listing in the US. Theoretical Implications: Our results suggest that there exists an agency conflict between shareholders and outside directors reflected in the degree to which directors act diligently when negotiating the pay contract with the CEO. However, this conflict may be alleviated by specific legal rules making boards more accountable to shareholders. Private measures of shareholder protection do not seem entirely capable of substituting for legal institutions. Practical Implications: Reducing managerial agency cost is commonly viewed as a desirable policy goal. We advocate the view that specific legal institutions that strengthen procedural rights of shareholders' voting on directors and the overall quality of the legal system help to achieve this goal. Director liability rules, however, appear to be ineffective for this purpose. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Previous studies have primarily focused on the relative success of collectively owned enterprises (COEs) in China during the early years of reform, but they have ignored the agency problems inherent in this type of organizational form that may be an obstacle to further improving performance in a changing environment. Drawing on agency theory and the privatization literature, we argue that the transformed COEs in the ongoing organizational transformation process may achieve better performance by reducing agency costs. We examine a sample of COEs in Chinese manufacturing industries and track their ownership statuses from 2000 to 2005. Our findings reveal that the transformed firms achieved better performance than the traditional, untransformed COEs by mitigating agency problems. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study examines the impact of shareholder rights on the wealth effects of privately negotiated stock repurchases. Our results show that wealth gains are lower when shareholder rights are more suppressed. We also find that the premium paid for shares is inversely related to the strength of shareholder rights, and this suggests that managers pay higher premiums when shareholder rights are more restricted. These findings imply that managers use shareholders' funds to eliminate blockholders who are more likely to monitor them when shareholder rights are relatively weak, thereby entrench themselves. Consistent with this view, we further show that significant positive abnormal long-run returns after private stock repurchases are limited to firms with stronger shareholder protection. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the predictions of agency theory. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Management and organization literature has treated conflicts in numerous times and from various perspectives. Still, the theoretical literature holds different views about the essence of owner-manager relationship, including the view that the top manager and the owner are seen as subjects with different goals and interests. And these differences may cause conflicts created within this relationship. The research question here is about the subject of CSR as an enhancing factor in the deepening of special interests of the owners and the managers, as well as in emphasising their different roles. The in-depth interviews contained 60 questions and were recorded. With nearly all questions, two aspects were addressed: on the one hand, the difference between the periods 1995-1999 and 2000-2004, and on the other, between enterprises based on foreign and domestic capital. By the beginning of the former period - that is 1995 - the privatisation period in Estonia was predominantly over and the first legislative framework concerning the operation of corporations in the Western sense started to develop. The second turning point is represented by the year 2000, when the "purge" following the Asian and Russian crises presented new demands on economic activities and economic thinking as a whole. A total of 25 individuals were interviewed: 7 owners, 12 top managers and 6 of those who had been both as owners and top managers. This article concentrates on the results that concern the possible sources of conflict between the managers and the owners and their perception of social responsibility and the links between those questions. When summing up the opinions of the interviewees it should be admitted that the responses reflected the insignificance of the conflicts issue rather than their serious topicality. As the respondents remarked on several occasions, the existence of owner-manager conflicts is not considered normal or built-in; as the respondents added, this should not be considered such. Thus the claim of built-in conflicts in the owner-manager relations, derived from the agency theory (at least the classical agency theory) should be questioned according to the responses of the Estonian owners and managers. At the same time this does not mean that the responses coincide with the standpoints of stewardship theory, because the results of the interviews do not enable to make general conclusion that Estonian managers tend to act in the best interest of their principals. The results of the interviews lead us to conclude that the difference between the way top managers and owners understand ideas and activities is quite clearly presented in the context of social responsibility; despite the fact that the respondents usually do not admit the existence of conflicts when discussing them in general. When comparing the opinions of the owners and top managers about social responsibility, considering the theoretical literature, we may claim to certain extent that owners and managers have a different perception of social responsibility and this leads to the conflicts between them. To conclude, the authors present the understanding that the context of CSR brings out the conflicts between managers and owners more clearly, or even intensifies the conflicts between them. Results from an empirical study, undertaken in Estonia, are used.

By employing the theoretical template provided by agency theory, this article contributes a detailed clinical analysis of a large multinational Canada-headquartered telecommunications company, Nortel. Our analysis reveals a twenty-first century norm of usual suspects: a CEO whose compensation is well above those of his peers, a dysfunctional board of directors, acts of income smoothing to preserve the confidence of volatile investors, and revelations of financial irregularities followed by a downfall. In many ways, the spectacular rise and - sudden - fall of Nortel illustrates excesses of actors within, and contradictions of the system of corporate governance implied by the agency model. Furthermore, this case illustrates limitations of the agency framework in complex situations with short-term oriented investors. (c) 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Prior research has located the issue of "professional" conduct with consultancy predominantly within the relationship between the manager and the consultant. However, recent studies provide indications that dealing professionally with consultancy may fail because of goal divergences between the individual managers and the organization. The first aim of this article is to re-examine this assumption theoretically, by drawing on agency theory, and empirically, by focusing on a single case study. Through this approach certain attitudes exhibited by managers are identified, which hinder dealing with consultancy in a professional manner across the entire organization. This observation motivates the second aim of the article: since the managers' attitudes deviate from the company's goals in dealings with consultancy, the adequacy of governance measures needs to be analyzed. Several researchers have observed that companies primarily use control-based measures, like central procurement rules or policies, to govern managers dealing with consultancy. However, these measures are not readily accepted by managers. In view of the above, this study investigates alternative measures, which are summarized as incentive-based measures.

This paper examines the firm specific characteristics - as a proxy for positive accounting research - that are associated with the propensity of companies listed on the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges (CASE) to comply with the newly harmonised Egyptian Accounting Standards (EASs) issued in 1997 and that are close to the international accounting standards (IASs). Although having an international audit firm is the dominant factor associated with disclosure and measurement/presentation compliance, ownership concentration, share trading, size as measured by market capitalisation and internationality are also associated with compliance. However, the results show that profitability, liquidity and leverage do not seem to affect the extent of compliance with EASs and the performance of manufacturing are at par with non-manufacturing firms. Also the performance of private sector firms is at par with public sector firms. This may indirectly imply that the positive accounting perspective may not be entirely applicable for de facto compliance in Egypt. Hence, it cannot be entirely inferred that listed Egyptian companies may use de facto compliance with EASs as a means of reducing agency costs, raising capital, reducing political costs or signalling to the market that they are high quality firms.

Agency theory postulates that an organization needs to achieve a balance in its organizational architecture, to develop its activities and to attain its objectives effectively. The non-profit organizations have the same requirements in their internal organization, although measurement of their efficiency is a very complex task. This paper has a twofold objective: first, to evaluate the relationship between a balanced organizational architecture and the level of efficiency and, secondly, to show that the DEA methodology is an adequate tool for measuring the efficiency of non-profit organizations. We estimate this relationship with a sample of non-governmental organizations involved in the international cooperation sector (NGO). The information was collected by means of personal interviews in 2003. The results show that NGOs with a more balanced organizational architecture have higher levels of efficiency.

It is common for host organizations that operate conventions to employ professional conference organizers (PCOs) to perform a variety of professional services relating to the organization, management and operation of the event. As such, a productive relationship between the host and PCO is essential to the successful operation of the event. Yet, the relationship is often strained as the host organization may feel uncertain about the selection of the PCO or may have reservations about its performance. Such an arrangement represents a classic principle-agent relationship that can be examined through agency theory. This study examines this relationship from the perspective of the host organization. It found that hosts do express concerns about adverse selection and moral hazard, but that these concerns can be mitigated by a series of pre- and post-contract awarding control measures.

In the 1990s, the role of the chief executive officer (CEO) of major United States corporations underwent a profound transformation in which CEOs went from being bureaucrats or technocrats to shareholder partisans who acted more like proprietors or entrepreneurs. This transformation occurred in response to changes in the competitive environment of U.S. corporations and also to the agency theory argument that high levels of compensation by means of stock options helped to overcome the agency problem inherent in the separation of ownership and control. Some critics charge that this new CEO role is objectionable for a variety of reasons, which may also be applicable to the current financial crisis in which CEO misconduct may have played a part. These objections are based largely on a team production model of corporate governance, which is held by these critics to be superior to the standard agent-principal model. This article examines the objections offered by critics of the changed role of the CEO and argues that their negative assessment of this development and their use of the team production model to support their conclusions are not warranted. CEOs have changed from hired hands to co-owners, and this change may have contributed in some measure to the current financial crisis. However, in determining the morally preferable role of the CEO, care must be taken not to discard what is sound in the changed role. (c) 2009 Business Ethics Quarterly 19:4 (October 2009).

This paper analyzes the role of compensation methods in the process of fostering corporate entrepreneurship. Drawing on agency theory and expectancy theory, hypotheses relating compensation methods to employees' entrepreneurial behavior are empirically examined in the context of defense products firms aiming at encouraging their employees' innovations at the civilian markets. The results show that entrepreneurs prefer compensation that is related to the internal venture's performance. Managers' willingness to take on civilian projects is higher if they are assured that they will be personally compensated for the project's success. Surprisingly, the more entrepreneurial employees preferred staying in the defense market rather than converting to civilian markets. (c) 2009 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.

A good understanding of the nature of the firm is essential in developing corporate strategies, building corporate competitiveness, and establishing sound economic policy. Several theories have emerged on the nature of the firm: the neo-classical theory of the firm, the principal agency theory, the transaction cost theory, the property rights theory, the resource-based theory and the evolutionary theory. Each of these theories identify some elements that describe the nature of the firm, but no single theory is comprehensive enough to include all elements of the nature of the firm. Economists began to seek a theory capable of describing the nature of the firm within a single, all-encompassing, coherent framework. We propose a unified theory of the firm, which encompasses all elements of the firm. We then evaluate performances of Korean firms from the unified theory of the firm perspective. Empirical evidences are promising in support of the integrative theory of the firm. (c) 2009 Institute of East and West Studies.

This study investigated the intermediation of expropriation in the linkage between corporate governance and firm value. We manifested the triple principal-agent relationships among minority shareholders, majority shareholders and the board of directors, and conceptualized the expropriation as rents demanded by majority shareholders to compensate their agency function in a theoretical framework of internal and external corporate-control mechanisms for firms with concentrated ownership structure. By using related party transactions as a direct measure for expropriation, and the data of related party transactions between 2002 and 2006 on China's stock market, we corroborated the negative value effect of expropriation, and found that the controlling capability of controlling shareholders, ownership balancing, identity of controlling shareholders, stock incentives for the board/executives, and the proportion of tradable shares are significantly associated with expropriation. Our work on expropriation would provide insight to understand the relationship between corporate governance and firm value, and lay a basis for future theory building on corporate governance.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the governance structure of the firm undergoing a complete buyout cycle (reverse leveraged buyout). Its purpose is to empirically explore the evolution of corporate board structures as a unique source of value creation, in addition to the agency mechanisms of the discipline of debt and incentives of equity participation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors rely on agency theory and the resource dependence perspective to develop sets of hypotheses that examine changes in the board composition of 65 R-LBOs and 65 matched continuing firms spanning a 25-year period (1979-2004). Findings: The empirical results reveal numerous insights about why R-LBOs go private, to what extent boards restructure during the buyout phase, and how those changes relate to firm performance. Taken together, the findings give strong credence to the argument that boards represent a supplemental source of value creation in the buyout process. Research limitations/implications: For scholars, the study presents a platform for further inquiry into the role of boards of directors in R-LBOs as well as the inclusion of resource dependence theory to inform on the phenomenon. Practical implications: The study helps to address this new source of value creation for practical interest. It offers a benchmark for buyout firms to compare their board characteristics by establishing linkages between pre-buyout deficiencies, post-buyout modifications, and post-SIPO performance. Originality/value: The results shift scholarly attention away from the structural governance tools to the group dynamics of the board. The findings call into question the restricted attention given by buyout researchers to leverage and ownership as value drivers by prompting a closer evaluation of the relationship between buyout board structures and related structuring of debt and managerial equity participation. Furthermore, the inclusion of the resource-dependency perspective alongside agency theory as an explanatory theory allows for a richer account of the LBO phenomenon and its sources of value creation.

The paper examines the role of debt in affecting the performance/value of a firm (DVF relationship) in the developed financial market. There is no consensus on the DVF relationship in this market. In addition, literature about the DVF relationship in the developed market lacks the interpretation of results by taking into account different business, management and financial theories. The study addresses the gap in the literature by utilizing the panel data of 60 companies for the year 2000 to 2003 from the developed (Australian) financial market. The result of the study suggests that higher debt has a negative relationship with the value of a firm supporting agency theory in this market. The result also supports the second trade off theory and the foundation of developed market as debt in the presence of the dispersed shareholding deteriorates the value of a shareholder. The results relevant to the role of control variables in affecting the value of a firm show that smaller board, liquid market and information efficiency improve the firm's performance in the developed financial market. The results of the study are of value to both academics and policy makers.

Agency theory has been widely applied to the governance of business corporations and to good advantage. The formal framework of agency theory pertains as well to polities, wherein citizens are the principals and politicians the agents. Where takeover efforts occur irregularly for corporations, they occur at regular intervals through elections for polities. Timothy Besley's Principled Agents uses the agency theory to argue that electoral competition will generally select competent and public-spirited politicians. This claim follows from his formal framework, but that framework ignores some questionable and unsettled matters that challenge Besley's relatively roseate view of the qualitative character of electoral selection.

Neoclassical and strategy frameworks stipulate that managers promote corporate performance and shareholder interests in their resource allocation decisions. Agency related works anticipate that executives seek their own personal interests at a cost to performance and shareholder wealth in their resource allocation choices. In this study, an attempt is made to resolve these conflicting anticipations. We propose that changes in levels of resource allocations (advertising expenditure, R&D spending, capital intensity) may be more positively associated with changes in levels of subsequent corporate performance for firms with greater external monitoring or with higher CEO ownership incentives. We also propose that changes in levels of resource allocations may directly (inversely) affect changes in levels of subsequent performance of the actively (passively) monitored enterprises, lacking (possessing) free cash flow. Additionally, we propose that changes in levels of resource allocations may directly (inversely) affect changes in levels of subsequent performance of firms with high (low) CEO ownership incentives in the absence (presence) of free cash flow. Regression models are utilized to test our proposals on a longitudinal sample obtained from the Compustat database. The empirical findings are generally supportive of our proposals.

This paper examines the relationship between corporate governance characteristics and corporate financial distress. There are two main theoretical factors of interest: the structure of the monitoring process, and the personal characteristics of non-executive directors (NEDs). The first approach is basically agency-theory oriented, and emphasises relationships that complicate proper control, such as dependents on the board (Jensen, 1993). The second approach refers to the resource dependency theory, which focuses on the quality of the director(s) involved (Hillman and Dalziel (2003). The relevant relationships are tested on a newly built database consisting of 52 listed companies in the Netherlands that became financially distressed in the period from 1993 to 2003 and a control sample of 167 listed companies. We collected data on NEDs such as age, education, dependency, other board positions (and chairmanships), workload, and the number of executive and non-executive board members. A positive relationship with financial distress was found to exist if the average workload of NEDs on the board was high, or if there was a foreigner on the board. If one of the NEDs has inside knowledge, this is negatively related to financial distress. As a final conclusion, the hypothesis originating in resource dependency theory, which is that the human characteristics of NEDs are important in avoiding financial distress, cannot be rejected with regard to the Netherlands as examined in the period from 1993 to 2003.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance model in Asia. The paper finds that all of the investigated Asian economies issued new corporate governance codes to promote best practices in the Anglo-Saxon model after the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. In our sample, the majority of listed firms in Asia implement a separate CEO/chairperson position and appoint a significant number of non-executive directors on the board. The result of this study also indicates that the prediction of the agency theory is valid under the Asian context. Using the combined sample of all Asian economies, we find that ownership concentration has a positive relation on firm performance and the controlling shareholder's ownership has a decreasing positive link with firm value. In addition, firms with a board dominated by non-executive directors are associated with higher performance, and smaller boards are linked with better performance. The paper also finds that the Anglo-Saxon corporate governance model is more effective in Asian countries adopting the continental law system and without the influence of Confucian values.

This paper examines the impact of corporate governance and audit quality on risk taking in the U.S. property casualty insurance industry. The evidence shows that some corporate governance variables, as well as some audit quality variables are related to risk taking. We find that longer board tenure is associated with low underwriting risk. But the higher percentage of financial experts on the board is associated with high underwriting risk. The possible reason is that financial experts possess a deep understanding of a firm's financial situation and may encourage the management to take higher risk in anticipation of a higher return for a positive net present value project. The results are consistent with agency theory and wealth transfer hypothesis in that high risk taking is consistent with shareholder interest maximization. In addition, we find a non-monotonic relation between insider ownership and leverage risk. Finally, we do not find evidence that the Sarbanes-Oxley act have impact on the risk taking behavior.

In a knowledge economy, the management of an organisation's human capital is critical and prudent management often translates into the attainment of a sustainable competitive advantage. The interaction of knowledge workers with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has presented a particularly interesting dynamic to researchers who study changes in related behavioural phenomena. One such phenomenon is self-monitoring. This paper examines the economics of self-monitoring and the integral role of ICTs in enabling knowledge workers to self-monitor. By merging Foucault's power/knowledge ideas with classical agency theory, we gain a richer understanding of human capital dynamics in a knowledge economy.

I conduct a panel data analysis by following each of the 68 non-financial firms listed on ISE over a time span of 8 years. In total, I collect 544 firm-year observations over the entire 1994-2005 period. I find a non-linear relationship between the retained proportion of the insiders' share holdings after IPO and the dependent variables (OPROA, ROA and Tobin's Q). There is no significant relation between executive remuneration and post-IPO operating and market performance. This may be due to the low pay for performance sensitivity of the executive remuneration data used in this study. I find a significant relation between ownership concentration as measured by Herfindahl indexes and the performance measures. I also distinguish mainly four types of contractual privileges (contractual devices or lock-on-control mechanisms) given to the controlling shareholders from the IPO prospectuses; "right to receive a pre-determined amount of dividend, right to buy new shares from the existing shareholders, appointment of the pre-determined number of board members and right to cast more than 1 vote for one share". I also find that these privileges have important implications for post- IPO performance in Turkey. (c) International Economic Society.

The paper reviews and discusses the literature on the concept of incentive in management; the visions of ancient Greek philosophers, classical economists, scientific management, agency theory, contracts, property theory and transaction costs theory. The discussion shows that the transaction costs theory, with its central idea of forms of governance, constitutes a comprehensive view of incentives that explains what are the inexplicable paradoxes for other theoretical perspectives. The paper analyzes the relations between incentives and helps to build up a theoretical and useful formal model of incentives.

This paper examines the link between equity compensation and executive risk taking in the merger process. We develop our hypotheses based on agency, prospect, and behavior agency theories. Based on a sample of 668 mergers during the period of 1993 to 2005, we find that acquiring firms'CEOs and executives have significantly higher equity compensation as a ratio of total compensation and their value of equity compensation enjoys a higher sensitivity to share price and return volatility compared to target firms prior to the initiation of the merger. When management is compensated with more stocks or options and the pay-for-performance sensitivity of their compensation is higher, they are more likely to acquire risky and high growth targets. This implies that stock and option grants induce risk-taking decisions for management, suggesting that equity compensation provides management with incentives to align with a firm's desired risk taking behavior.

We examine the determinants and implications of Chinese corporate cash holdings in the 1993- 2006 period. Agency theories assert that firms with a large controlling shareholder have relatively large cash holdings because of the greater ability of the controlling shareholder to extract private benefits from the cash holdings. Our findings show a very strong inverse relationship between cash holdings and firm valuation in high government ownership firms. Also, we find that in firms with high government ownership, dividend payouts are highly valued. We conclude that Chinese investors see government ownership as a factor that reduces firm value. They prefer relatively higher dividends from firms having high government ownership. Conversely, investors assign much higher value to firms with relatively low government ownership and they tend to be neutral about the dividends payouts of such firms. Also, investors value highly the presence of foreign investors in Chinese firms and tend to be neutral about dividend payouts of firms with high foreign ownership concentration.

Agency theory suggests that firms with very high cash balances ("cash hoarders") are likely to misinvest their funds. However, if investors do not fully recognize the implications of a high cash balance, then future returns may be predictable for cash-hoarding firms. We find that cash hoarders significantly underperform over the two years following their identification as hoarding. In subsequent analysis, we find that returns are significantly negative in the year that a prior cash-hoarding firm reports a significant decrease in cash. Our results suggest that investors do not fully appreciate the implications of a high cash balance for future returns, but do recognize problems when that cash is subsequently spent.

Agency theory and resource-based view explain the competitive advantage of family firms from the perspective of agency cost and resource in family firms. However, their explaination all overlook the competitive environment in which family firms are embedded. This paper tries to explain the competitive advantage of family firms from the perspective of organizational flexibility. More specifically, it: (a) reviews the theoretical studies on the competitive advantage of familyfirms from agency theory and resource-based view; (b)explors the relationship between characteristics of family firms and organizational flexibility; (c)summarizes the determinants of organizational flexibility of family firms.

This article takes a broader perspective that encompasses both traditional agency-based explanations of buy-outs as well as recognizing the buy-out phenomenon as a vehicle for entrepreneurial innovation. Although early studies suggested that buy-outs involved both agency cost reduction and entrepreneurial aspects, they did not formally conceptualize these two approaches. The agency theory approach conceptualizes buy-outs as a tool that facilitates cost efficiencies. The entrepreneurial perspective sees buy-outs as a means for implementing new innovations and strategic change that enable fuller exploitation of firm resources that may have been blocked by prior ownership arrangements, such as being part of a large diversified firm or a privately-owned firm with leadership succession problems. The article first elaborates the definitions and sources of buy-outs. Secondly, it reviews theoretical perspectives relating to buy-outs, notably the agency approach and an entrepreneurial perspective which draws on the theory of entrepreneurial cognition. The third main section reviews a model to explain different types of buy-out drawing on these two perspectives. The fourth section reviews studies of the effects of buy-outs, identifying evidence consistent with agency and entrepreneurial views of buy-outs. The final section provides discussion and conclusions. (c) Oxford University Press, 2006. All rights reserved.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the determinants of stock options attribution. We hypothesize that the equity held by managers, the ownership concentration, the liquidity constraints, the firm risk and the firm size are related to the firm's attribution of stock options. Using a sample of 44 companies listed in Euronext Lisbon, we find that only equity held by managers and firm size are related to the firm's attribution of stock options, documenting a positive relationship for both.

Agency theory predicts that managerial ownership reduces agency cost and increases firm value. However, empirical evidence on the ownership and firm value relation is, at best, mixed. To date, there is no evidence on how exactly managerial ownership affects firm value and through what channel ownership improves value. Our paper fills in the void in the literature by addressing these issues. As a firm's operating efficiency is an important indicator of its managerial performance, we uses changes in managerial ownership as an argument to evaluate changes in firm value and hypothesizes that changes in managerial ownership affect firm's operating efficiency, which in turn drives firm value. Using a large panel data set (4,451 observations for 1,162 firms for year 1990-2001), we find significantly positive relation between changes in managerial ownership, operating efficiency and changes in firm value. Larger increase in managerial ownership provides greater alignment of managerial interests with those of shareholders, hence greater improvement in firm value. However, this relation is not monotonic. The positive impact on firm's value increases at a decreasing rate. Our simultaneous equation tests remove the endogeneity concern between managerial ownership and firm value.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: We examine the business case for the inclusion of women and ethnic minority directors on the board. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the number of women directors and the number of ethnic minority directors on the board and important board committees and financial performance measured as return on assets and Tobin's Q. Research Findings/Insights: We do not find a significant relationship between the gender or ethnic diversity of the board, or important board committees, and financial performance for a sample of major US corporations. Our evidence also suggests that the gender and ethnic minority diversity of the board and firm financial performance appear to be endogenous. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Reasonable theoretical arguments drawn from resource dependence theory, human capital theory, agency theory, and social psychology suggest that gender and ethnic diversity may have either a positive, negative, or neutral effect on the financial performance of the firm. Our statistical analysis supports the theoretical position of no effect, either positive or negative. Our results are consistent with a contingency explanation because the effect of the gender and ethnic diversity of the board may be different under different circumstances at different times. Over several companies and time periods, the results could offset to produce no effect. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The results of our analysis do not support the business case for inclusion of women and ethnic minorities on corporate boards. However, we find no evidence of any negative effect either. Our evidence implies that decisions concerning the appointment of women and ethnic minorities to corporate boards should be based on criteria other than future financial performance.

In this study, we view the contracts of top managers from an integrated agency theory-trust perspective, arguing that two conditions reflecting CEO risk bearing, top management team (TMT) behavioral uncertainty and CEO vulnerability, are negatively related to a CEO's perceptions of TMT benevolence toward him-/herself, which in turn influence the protective features of TMT contracts. Model tests on data from 122 family-owned firms in Spain support our hypotheses overall. Agency theory may be enhanced by accounting for a CEO's perceptions (as principal) of TMT benevolence and for the effect of those perceptions on contracts with TMT members (as agents).

Much of the literature on corporate acquisitions has focused on managerial incentives for making acquisitions but has underemphasized the role played by the social context of major shareholders. This study of Fortune 1000 firms argues that the priorities and risk preferences of family owners can have important implications not only for the volume but also for the diversifying nature of their acquisitions. Agency and family business perspectives are used to derive expectations concerning the acquisitions behavior of family owners. Consistent with both perspectives, and owners' desire to reduce business risk, we find that family ownership is inversely related to the number and dollar volume of acquisitions. However, whereas agency theorists differ about how ownership concentration influences whether acquisitions are diversified, the family firm literature is more definitive. The latter suggests that given family owners' desire to retain control of their firms for offspring, their wealth must remain concentrated. Hence they can most easily reduce the risk of their wealth portfolio by diversifying the business-that is, through diversifying acquisitions. Consistent with this logic, we found the propensity to make diversifying acquisitions to increase with the level of family ownership. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines performance effects of ownership concentration and two types of private equity investors (venture capitalists and business angels) in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO) in the United Kingdom and France. We expand and contextualize nascent understanding of multiple agency theory by examining heterogeneity of private equity investors and by suggesting that multiple agency relationships are affected by different institutional contexts. We employ a unique, hand-collected dataset of 224 matched IPOs (112 in each country). Controlling for the endogeneity of private equity investors' retained share ownership, we find support for the agency theory argument that concentrated ownership improves IPOs' performance. The research also shows that the two types of private equity investors have a differential impact on performance, and the legal institutions in a given country moderate this impact.

We draw from legal theory to offer a fundamental rethinking of agency theory along three key dimensions: redefining the principal from shareholders to the corporation, redefining the status of the board from shareholders' agents to autonomous fiduciaries, and redefining the role of the board from monitors to mediating hierarcha. These dimensions contrast with classic agency theory, offering novel conceptions that can inform further theorization and empirical research in corporate governance. (c)Academy of Management Review.

Agency theory suggests that managerial mischief may occur when the interests of owners and managers diverge and that a solution to this agency problem is alignment of owner and agent interests through agent compensation and equity ownership. We develop the theoretical concept of CEO return and measure and estimate financial alignment as the relationship between CEO and shareholder returns. Our results, based on this new conceptualization and corresponding measurement, suggest stronger alignment than reported in previous work. The magnitude of this alignment is associated with subsequent firm performance, but in ways not clearly articulated or tested in prior research. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

This paper examines the impact of multiple directorships on stockholder wealth around the announcements of mergers and acquisitions. Grounded in agency theory, we argue that multiple directorships affect the quality of managerial oversight and thus influence agency conflicts in acquisition decisions. We show that acquiring firms where directors hold more outside board seats experience more negative abnormal returns. This adverse effect, nonetheless, does not extend across the entire range of multiple directorships. Rather, the detrimental impact is significant only when the number of outside board seats surpasses a certain threshold. We interpret this result as suggesting that directors serving on multiple boards allow value-destroying acquisitions when they become too busy beyond a certain point, and the effect of directors' busyness on acquisition performance appears to be nonlinear. We employ several alternative definitions of directors' busyness and obtain consistent results. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the relationship between corporate governance quality and dividend policy in Canada. Based on the agency theory predictions, we consider the effect of two conflicting hypotheses about the effect of corporate governance on dividend payouts: the outcome and substitution hypotheses. The effectiveness of firm-level governance mechanisms is assessed through the Globe & Mail annual corporate governance index and four sub-categories scores (board composition, shareholding and compensation issues, shareholder rights issues and corporate governance disclosure policy). Using a sample of 714 firm-years listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange over the period 2002-2005, our results show that firms with stronger corporate governance have higher dividend payouts. Among the four components of the corporate governance index, we document that board composition and shareholder rights' policy are positively related to payout ratios. We also find a positive association between firm size, the level of free cash flows and dividend payouts. Finally, we document a negative relationship between firm risk, US cross-listing and dividend payouts. Taken together our results are consistent with the outcome model of dividend policy.

We argue that executives can affect firm outcomes only if they have influence over crucial decisions. This study explores the impact of CEO power or CEO dominance on bond ratings and yield spreads. We find that credit ratings are lower and yield spreads higher for firms whose CEOs have more decision-making power. To further investigate why bondholders are concerned about CEO power, we show that powerful CEOs tend to maintain an opaque information environment. Bondholders demand higher yields because it is difficult for them to monitor managers in firms with powerful CEOs. Taken together, the results suggest that bondholders perceive CEO power as a critical determinant of the cost of bond financing. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This exploratory study sought to investigate how well 98 firms in three industries, across 10 countries, are addressing climate change through five specific governance practices. The findings suggest that non-US firms demonstrate higher performance on the governance dimensions than their US counterparts. Further, by separating firms into low versus high performers on the governance dimensions, some board structure variables, such as number of directors and an independent board chair, were associated with higher performing firms. The study contributes both to institutional and agency theory. For example, coercive isomorphisms in regions of the world, such as Europe, might be driving firms to demonstrate that they are addressing climate change at the governance level in order to gain legitimacy. As for agency theory, this study offers both confirmatory and contradictory results regarding board independence. For example, firms who separated the CEO-board chair role achieved better governance on climate change, while at the same time firms who demonstrated lack of independence with respect to the inside versus outside director ratio also achieved better governance on climate change. This paves the way for additional research in understanding how board structure influences organizational phenomena. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

There is a commonly held conviction among governance scholars and practitioners that increasing the number of non-executive directors may have beneficial effects on board practices. This view has gained momentum after each wave of scandals. Given the relevance of the issue in governance studies and practices, the aim of this paper is to investigate how independent, competent and incentivized non-executive directors should be according to governance scholars and board best practices. To answer this question, we conducted a review of the literature on non-executive directors. We then collected corporate governance codes developed worldwide at the end of 2005, and made a comparative analysis of their recommendations about the independence, the competencies and the incentives of non-executive directors. Our results show that (i) non-executive directors' independence is a commonly recommended governance practice, the meaning of which differs widely among countries; (ii) non-executive directors' competencies and incentives are not considered a governance issue to be regulated in detail; (iii) agency theory and the search for appropriate board demography tend to dominate the recommendations of governance literature and codes. Our findings have implications for both research and practice. (c) 2009 British Academy of Management.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to better understand the antecedents of shareholder activism targeted at firms located in three common law countries (i.e., USA, UK, and Australia) and three civil law countries (Japan, Germany, and South Korea) during the 2003-07 time period. Research Findings/Insights: Our findings suggest that the antecedents of shareholder activism vary by the motivation of the activist. We demonstrate that activists target firms with two motives (a) to improve the financial performance, and (b) to improve the social performance of the firm. With respect to the target firm level antecedents, we find that firm size is unrelated to financial activism, but positively related to social activism; ownership concentration is negatively related to both financial and social activism; and prior profitability is negatively related to financial activism, but positively related to social activism. Further, these relationships in the case of financial activism are generally stronger in common law legal systems, whereas those in the case of social activism are generally stronger in environments with a greater level of income inequality. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings suggest that future research should differentiate between the motivations of the activism event. Further, we find that while agency logic works well for financial activism, institutional theory provides stronger explanations for social activism. Overall, we demonstrate the complementary nature of these two theories in explaining shareholder activism. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We found that the "exposure" to shareholder activism varies by the motivation of the activist, and the nature of the firm and its national context. An understanding of these issues would help firms develop proper response strategies to activism events. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Understanding the nature of family representation in public firms has been an important topic for entrepreneurship research. Because CEO compensation is a key tool that boards use to align the interests of shareholders and managers, researchers have taken steps toward understanding how family representation affects CEO compensation. Prior research has painted family-member CEOs as stewards who accept lower compensation. Based on agency theory, we describe a different scenario wherein family representatives engage in strategic control that reduces family-member CEOs' compensation. Thus, family-member CEOs accept lower compensation only when additional family members are represented in management or on the board. In comparison with CEOs at nonfamily firms, we find that family-member CEO compensation is 13% lower when multiple family members are involved, but 56% higher when the CEO is the lone family member.

abstractBy combining insights from relational network theory and agency theory we identify the boundary conditions to the embeddedness approach to partner selection decisions in interfirm collaborations. Employing a longitudinal dataset comprising the investment syndicates for the population of UK management buyouts between 1993 and 2003, we find that relational embeddedness is less important for selecting partners when agency risks are low, allowing firms to expand their networks. Furthermore, reputational capital may act as a partial substitute for relational embeddedness, again permitting firms to expand their networks. Our findings enhance understanding of the boundary conditions associated with the relational network approach to partner selections and network behaviour. (c) 2010 The Authors.

This study examined the influence of working capital management components on corporate profitability. A sample of 30 firms listed on the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) for the periods 1993 to 2008 was used. Both the pooled OLS and the fixed effects regression models were used. The key findings from the study were: (1) there exists a highly significant negative relationship between the time it takes for firms to collect cash from their customers (accounts collection period) and profitability (p <0.01). This means that more profitable firms take the shortest time to collect cash from their customers; (2) there exists a highly significant positive relationship between the period taken to convert inventories into sales (the inventory conversion period) and profitability (p <0.01). This means that firms which maintain sufficiently high inventory levels reduce costs of possible interruptions in the production process and loss of business due to scarcity of products. This reduces the firm supply costs and protects them against price fluctuations; (3) there exists a highly significant positive relationship between the time it takes the firm to pay its creditors (average payment period) and profitability (p <0.01). This implies that the longer a firm takes to pay its creditors, the more profitable it is. (c) 2010 Academic Journals Inc.

Using a sample of 56 Italian IPOs issued between 1999 and 2005, several hypotheses are tested on the interplay between corporate governance, family ownership and performance. Specifically tested is which approach among all agency, stewardship, and contingency theory is most appropriate for Italian family firms. Findings suggest that board independence increases with family disinvestment at IPO, presence of venture capitalists, establishment of large and active boards, and existence of appointment and compensation committees. At the same time, results indicate that the presence of independent directors affects performance positively but with little statistical significance, while family involvement and the presence of execution committees negatively impact share performance.

To many, the principal-agent model is the obvious lens through which executive pay should be viewed. Such a sentiment sits uncomfortably with a large number of empirical studies suggesting that the process of determining executive pay seems to be more readily explained by recourse to arguments of managerial power and influence. This article investigates the micro-underpinnings of boardroom behavior in order to explain this departure from principal-agency theory's argument that executive compensation serves to align interests between the owners of the company and its senior managers. We find that there are strong interaction effects among social influence variables and the social setting of boardroom activity. Generous pay awards, bearing only a weak connection to corporate performance, are explained in the context of the social psychology of the boardroom. These results and a review of the empirical research, suggest the need for a more comprehensive model of executive compensation that incorporates both economic and psychological determinants.

We study the relation between stability of the nonprofit organization's environment and its board structure and the impact of this relation on organizational performance from the perspectives of both Agency Theory and Resource Dependence (Boundary Spanning) Theory. The impact of board characteristics on organizational performance is contextual. Specifically, we predict and show for a sample of U.S. nonprofits that board mechanisms related to monitoring are more likely to be effective for stable organizations, whereas board mechanisms related to boundary spanning are more effective for less stable organizations. We find that the two theories are complementary and address different aspects of nonprofit performance, but the results are statistically stronger and more often consistent with resource dependence than with agency theory. Overall, this study supports Miller-Millesen's (Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 32: 521-547 2003) contention that, because the nonprofit environment is often more complex and heterogeneous than the for-profit world, no one theory describes all tasks of nonprofit boards.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: This study examines the influence of firms' ownership structure on corporate reputation. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a panel of firms in Spain for 2000-2007, we found that ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholder erodes corporate reputation, whereas contestability of the main shareholder's power enhances it. Insider ownership shows a non-linear relationship with corporate reputation, with lower corporate reputation at low and very high levels of insider ownership. Finally, if the largest shareholder is either a pressure-resistant or a pressure-sensitive institutional investor, as opposed to other types of largest shareholder, corporate reputation is lower. This last finding markedly differentiates our sample of firms in Spain, a civil law country, from firms in common law countries such as the US and the UK, where studies have found a positive relationship between institutional investors and corporate reputation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Drawing on signaling and agency theories, our paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to analyze the influence of ownership structure on corporate reputation in civil law countries. Practitioners/Policy Implications: This study suggests that managers and directors should recognize how each characteristic of ownership structure influences the expectations of stakeholders. Low levels of ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholders, low differences in ownership concentration between first and second largest shareholders, and moderate levels of insider ownership are positive signals that should be communicated to foster corporate reputation. High levels of ownership concentration in the hands of the largest shareholders or high differences in ownership concentration between first and second largest shareholders impair corporate reputation and should be compensated by introducing corporate governance mechanisms that favor corporate reputation, such as increasing the number of independent directors or avoiding CEO duality.

It has been argued by researchers that agency theory has limitations as the underpinning theory for governance given its inability to recognize the wider environmental influencing forces impacting on organizations. This paper provides a case for incorporating a number of management-based theories to augment agency theory in recognizing these wider environmental influencing forces and the consequent extended governance paradigm it creates. Through a theory building approach that reviews and critically analyses the extant literature, a case is built to integrate four existing theories that complement each other to recognize these wider influencing forces. The paper argues that the proposed approach will narrow the theoretical practical gap in governance and will consequently have policy implications on governance guidelines. Further research is suggested to validate the approach with a wide range of real life organizational settings. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose using agency theory for assessing the likelihood of quality fade in buyersupplier relationships and prescribing contractual mechanisms for reducing quality fade. In this paper, quality fade, an element of supply chain vulnerability, is defined as the unforeseen deterioration of agreed to or expected quality levels with respect to product and/or service requirements. The use of outcomebased, behaviorbased, or mix contracts can be used to reduce the likelihood of quality fade and illustrate preferred scenarios for buyer and suppliers. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a conceptual model for using agency theory to explain and address a type of supply chain vulnerability called quality fade. A 2x2 matrix is proposed that contrasts outcome measurability with outcome uncertainty to illustrate buyer and supplier vulnerability and to suggest contractual mechanisms that can be used to mitigate vulnerability for both parties. Findings - A typology of governance mechanisms is presented and described with the use of a manufacturer thirdparty logistics provider example to illustrate the theoretical framework. Four different scenarios are discussed and described. Contractual mechanisms are provided to mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce quality fade. Originality/value - Quality fade is a term that has not been described extensively in academic literature but is a term that is relevant in the broader discussion of supply chain vulnerability. Given that quality fade is a behavioral, as opposed to process oriented, approach, it requires a theoretical framework rooted in behavioral considerations. Agency theory is an appropriate framework for studying governance options. (c) 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

This article discusses how organizations exchange with one another in China, focusing on the type of organizational ownership and the form of governance mechanism. The theoretical foundation builds on institutional theory, resource dependence theory, agency theory, and evolutionary theory. Given the three main forms of organizations in China - state-owned enterprises, privately owned enterprises, and foreign-invested enterprises - we show how these organizations choose between two types of governance mechanisms, contracts and guanxi, to manage interorganizational exchanges. We then analyze the possible modes of interaction between organizational forms. We argue that the relative importance of guanxi is likely to decline or that guanxi will shift from being primary in some organizations to complementary in all organizations with the progress of market transition. This conceptual framework is expected to help provide the momentum for further theoretical exploration and empirical study in this area. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study uses a sample of 213 Brazilian firms listed between 1995 and 2004 to examine the effect of the presence or absence of growth opportunities on the subsequent effect of leverage, dividend payout, and ownership concentration on firm value. First, we find that leverage plays a dual role: whereas it negatively affects the value of firms with growth opportunities (i.e., underinvestment theory), it positively affects the value of firms without growth opportunities (i.e., overinvestment theory). Second, we find that dividends play a disciplinary role in firms with fewer growth opportunities by reducing free cash flow under managerial control. Finally, the results show that ownership structure has a nonlinear effect-that is, ownership concentration initially improves the value of most firms. However, after a certain threshold, in firms with growth opportunities, the risk increases that large shareholders expropriate wealth at the expense of minority shareholders. Copyright (c) 2010 M.E.

Manuscript Type: ConceptualResearch Question/Issue: The aim of this research study is to theorize about the antecedents of the "board independence norm" (BIN), defined as the standard of having independent directors on corporate boards. The research approach is a comparative analysis of two governance settings - Sweden and the UK. Research Findings/Insights: The UK governance system uses a BIN of power balance from a shareholder perspective, while the Swedish governance system uses a BIN of social connectedness from a stakeholder perspective. However, our findings also suggest that exogenous variables such as pressures to conform to global "best practice" are antecedents of the BIN in the governance codes. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Any global theory of board independence must integrate differences in board structure and ownership patterns, as well as social connectedness in corporate networks. Furthermore, in addition to economic welfare, social welfare and stakeholder balance should also be considered. A synthesis of the "Varieties of Capitalism" and "New Institutional" perspectives considers that corporate governance is embedded in economic, cultural, and social contexts, yet also addresses institutional forces of conformity that are exogenous to the governance system. This seems to be a more promising framework for comparative governance research than "Contingent Agency Theory."Practitioner/Policy Implications: Multi-national regulative frameworks should focus on general principles of board independence. Local standard setters might then focus on developing a BIN that fits the specific institutional setting. We provide suggestions about how standard setters in Sweden and the UK can make their BINs more consistent with their settings. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyse the governance structure of monasteries to gain new insights and apply them to solve agency problems of modern corporations. In an historic analysis of crises and closures it asks, if Benedictine monasteries were and are capable of solving agency problems. The analysis shows that monasteries established basic governance instruments very early and therefore were able to survive for centuries. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a dataset of all Benedictine abbeys that ever existed in Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg, and German-speaking Switzerland to determine their lifespan and the reasons for closures. The governance mechanisms are analyzed in detail. Finally, it draws conclusions relevant to the modern corporation. The theoretical foundations are based upon principal agency theory, psychological economics, as well as embeddedness theory. Findings: The monasteries that are examined show an average lifetime of almost 500 years and only a quarter of them dissolved as a result of agency problems. This paper argues that this success is due to an appropriate governance structure that relies strongly on internal control mechanisms. Research limitations/implications: Benedictine monasteries and stock corporations differ fundamentally regarding their goals. Additional limitations of the monastic approach are the tendency to promote groupthink, the danger of dictatorship and the life long commitment. Practical implications: The paper adds new insights into the corporate governance debate designed to solve current agency problems and facilitate better control. Originality/value: By analyzing monasteries, a new approach is offered to understand the efficiency of internal behavioral incentives and their combination with external control mechanisms in corporate governance.

Combining a behavioral agency perspective with research on multiple-agency conflicts, this article examines factors affecting the implementation of equity-based incentive schemes in initial public offerings (IPOs). With a unique sample of U.K. IPO companies between the years 1998 and 2002, it shows that conditional (performance-related) incentive schemes are negatively associated with share ownership and board power of the IPO's founding directors. However, the retained ownership of venture capital firms is positively associated with the probability of conditional incentive schemes. Board independence weakly effects on the toughness of executive compensation. The article's interesting findings suggest a number of avenues for a future analysis of the governance development process in threshold firms. (c) 2010 Southern Management Association.

Much of the existing research in corporate governance has been directed at examining the consequences of board leadership structure on various organizational issues, with little to say about the determinants of this structure. By exploring either agency theory or stewardship theory, researchers provide contested conclusions regarding board leadership structure. The underlying premise of both theories is that 'one universal structure fits all'. However, the main argument of this paper is that the appropriate board leadership structure varies with some contextual variables and certain actors in a given environment. Econometric analysis demonstrates that board leadership structure varies with firm size, age and ownership structure. The implication of this result is that the assertion of both agency theory (CEO non-duality structure) and stewardship theory (CEO duality structure) may be valid under certain conditions. Thus, existing theories might need to be treated as complementary viewpoints, each of which draws upon a part of the whole picture, because depending on just one single perspective is more likely to result in misleading conclusions about the structure as a whole.

This paper investigates the effects of certain corporate governance mechanisms on the performance of firms listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Based on a sample of 93 firms for the period 1996 through 1999, our results show an optimal board size of ten, favour concentrated over diffused ownership, and support separation of posts of CEO and chair. Moreover, while director shareholding is found to be an insignificant factor affecting firm performance, the results show expatriate CEOs performing better than their local counterparts. We need to err on the side of caution as sampling selection was based on data availability rather than any probability criterion. Copyright (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Due to the significant role of non-profit organizations in the development of modern societies, these organizations must adjust their boardrooms. Since traditional theories of corporate governance appear to be limited in explaining the changing non-profit world, we propose an extended model of governance that integrates the traditional arguments of agency theory with a cognitive dimension. Based on a sample of Spanish foundations, we present evidence on the effect of the board composition on foundations' organizational efficiency. We show that board size and independence do not have a definitive effect on the entity's efficiency. Instead, the knowledge diversity inside the boardroom and the active character of trustees have a positive influence on resource allocation. The cognitive dimension of the extended model of governance is critical to explaining how boards impact on organizational performance. (c) 2009 British Academy of Management.

Agency theory suggests that governance matters more among firms with greater potential agency costs. Rational investors are unlikely to value safeguards against unlikely events. Yet, few studies of the relation between governance and firm value control for investor perceptions of the likelihood of agency conflicts. Shleifer and Vishny [Shleifer, A., Vishny, R.W., 1997. A survey of corporate governance. Journal of Finance 52, 737-783] identify investment-related agency conflicts as the more severe type of agency conflicts in the US. We measure the perceived likelihood of this type of agency conflict using free cash flow (Jensen, M.C., 1986. Agency costs of free cash flow, corporate finance, and takeovers. American Economic Review 76, 323-329). We find that firm value is an increasing function of improved governance quality among firms with high free cash flow. In contrast, governance benefits are lower or insignificant among firms with low free cash flow. We show that not controlling for this conditional relation between governance and firm value could lead to erroneous conclusions that governance and firm value are unrelated. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose-This study examines the factors influencing Corporate disclosure transparency as measured by the level of voluntary disclosure (VD) in the annual reports of the active share trading firms in Egypt. Design/methodology/ approach-The design and research method are empirical using archival data to collect information on the dependent variable (VD) and independent variables (corporate governance characteristics and company characteristics). A transformed multiple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model was used to test the association between the dependent variable of VD and the independent variables. Findings-The findings indicate that the extent of VD is affected by the highly secretive Egyptian culture. This implies that the introduction of a new corporate governance code has not improved information symmetry as the overall level of VD is very low at just 19.38%. In addition, several corporate governance and company characteristics variables were found significant in explaining levels of VD by the sample companies. Research limitations-The findings have generalizability limitations as the study focuses only on the actively traded companies operating in the Egyptian stock market. Practical implications-The results of this study should alarm the regulators and financial investors from the quality of financial information being provided in the Egyptian market. These results are more alarming since the investigated companies are the top 30 actively traded companies on the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX). It is logically expected that the status of disclosure would be lower in the other less actively traded companies on EGX. Originality/value-This study provides evidence regarding three variables, for the first time in Egypt, namely ''ownership structure'' and ''number of independent directors on the board'' and ''existence of audit committees'' as explanatory variables of the level of VD. This research study will stimulate further research in understanding the importance of the role of corporate governance in promoting more transparency in other emerging economies and the need to build models that include country level factors to explain the level of VD.

We examine how small and medium enterprises manage their international partners across different market servicing modes, namely exporting, joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries. The international business literature has placed emphasis on soft issues of international partner management (such as trust, cultural sensitivity etc.) in each mode category independently. Since network arrangements and knowledge sharing are involved in all these modes, we contribute to the literature by providing evidence on the mechanisms of international partner management across market modes. Specifically, based on agency and knowledge-based theories, we seek to understand the extent to which small and medium enterprises assign rights to make decisions to partners abroad, and the types of incentives and performance monitoring schemes they use. These mechanisms are drawn from agency theory. In-depth case studies were carried out in 14 Greek small firms that employed different modes to collaborate with their partners abroad. Seven of these firms had high levels of international performance while the other seven had low levels. We identify two distinguishable combinations of governance mechanisms being implemented by these two sets of firms: high performers pursue situational decision-making with outcome-oriented incentives/performance monitoring schemes, whereas low performers pursue centralized decision-making with behaviour-oriented incentives/performance monitoring schemes.

This study examines if the CEO duality influences firm performance in Bangladesh. It also examines the interaction of industries in influencing the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. From an observation of 825 firm years the study uses a 2-stage least square regression (2SLS) analysis. The finding is that there is a negative (non-significant) relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. However, when the industry interaction terms (the role of industries as moderating variable) are added, the CEO duality and firm performance is found to vary across industries. The findings of this study suggest that the CEO duality and firm performance is contingent; no single leadership structure is universal; both the leadership structure has cost and benefits. It is beneficial in some situation supporting the stewardship theory while it is not in other situations supporting the agency theory. This study contributes to the literature on CEO duality and firm performance in the context of developing countries.

We employ three views of agency theory in unison to investigate managerial risk-taking in uncertain markets. Using 124 firms that filed to go public toward the end of the technology boom (2000-2002), we explore the influence of CEO ownership on the decision to continue or withdraw an initial public offering (IPO) in deteriorating public equity markets. We find an inverse U-shaped relationship between CEOs' equity participation and the decision to proceed with a public offering: the probability of IPO cancellation in weak capital markets increases as CEOs hold too little or too much ownership. Our results also indicate that a firm's debt levels are positively linked with the IPO decision. CEO ownership and leverage intensity interact to influence the decision to take a firm public.

The agency theory, transactional cost economics, and traditional strategic management perspectives have provided several key corporate financial policies. However, these policies have generally been discussed and established separately. This study explores the causal structure of corporate financial strategies for the high-tech firms in Taiwan and China. By employing path analysis and directed graphs model, this paper explores the causal relationships among investment, financing, dividend policies, and corporate performance. The results show that the investment expenditures by Taiwan's firms positively affect financial performance and the increased borrowings jeopardize company's profits. However, the financing decisions of China's firms have a positively effect on their capital expenditures. The findings suggest that firms across the Strait adopt different strategies in financial decision environments. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: We examine how various types of shareholder activists (such as pension funds and large blockholders) impact the relative use of equity incentives at the middle management level of the firm and compare this with the impact on CEO incentive alignment. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of 124 US technology firms over the period 1997-2001, we find evidence indicating voice activist shareholders, using communication pressure, are associated with the greater use of equity incentives, and higher total compensation at middle managerial levels, relative to exit activists, who exert economic pressure. The results for CEO equity incentives are similar. We also find that as the presence of institutional ownership siding with management (banks and insurance companies) increases relative to voice activists, the use of equity incentives at middle managerial levels declines. Results for CEO equity incentives are not the same. Theoretical/Academic Implications: In agreement with contingent agency theory, we predict and find evidence of differing governance mechanisms used by voice activists (e.g., public pension funds) and exit activists (e.g., large shareholders). Voice activists face a higher cost of monitoring managers as compared to exit activists, and thus they will advocate for the heavier use of equity incentive compensation at the middle managerial level. In agreement with a managerial power perspective, however, we also find the use of equity incentives for middle managers decreases as the proportion of institutional ownership siding with the CEO increases. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Shareholder activism plays a key role in aligning managerial interests below the CEO level; however, different types of shareholders have different economic and political interests in how equity compensation is shaped to achieve this. Exit activists use monitoring and voice activists substitute equity compensation for monitoring. Shareholders siding with management may also reduce the use of equity incentives for middle managers. These differing interests should be considered in crafting policy responses. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

While much has been written on specificity (e.g., in texts on new institutional economics, agency theory, and team production theory), there are still some insights to be learnt by business ethicists. This article approaches the issue from the perspective of team production, and will propose a new form of corporate governance: enlightened corporate governance, which takes into consideration the specific investments of employees. The article argues that, in addition to shareholders, employees also bear a residual risk which arises due to their specific investments. This residual risk presents a valid and legitimate basis for residual claims. In this way, employees can be seen as residual claimants due to the fact that their income depends upon a hazardous quasi rent. Therefore, this article will call on the fiduciary duty of board members to protect those employees who are exposed to such residual risks and may thus be vulnerable as a result. This leads to a fundamental change of perspective on the "theory of the firm" - a change which will adopt the theories of new institutional economics, agency theory, and team production theory in order to promote business ethics research. Against this background, enlightened corporate governance aims to follow the criterion of specific investments as a legitimate basis for residual claims. Furthermore, it seeks to understand the consequences for board members, and to promote the sharing of control and ownership. The article will close with some discussion of the implications and future prospects for business ethics. (c) Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The study seeks to understand whether the proximity of the largest shareholder (controller) to the locus of management - whether the controller is a top executive, a board member, or an outsider - determines the value of US dual-class firms. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of 209 US dual class firms from the year 2000 and a corresponding control sample of single-class firms, we run cross-sectional regressions to determine the effect of the controller on firm value. We present robust evidence that dual-class firm value is negatively related to controller proximity. Dual-class structure overall is unrelated to firm value, because despite its negative effects with high proximity controllers there appear to be benefits when controller proximity is low (when the largest shareholder is an outsider). Theoretical/Academic Implications: Ownership structure is a widely studied subject but most studies focus on insider ownership. More nuanced aspects of ownership such as controller proximity are needed in empirical studies and theoretical models. These nuances could help us better understand the interplay between the incentive of various parties (e.g., managers, large shareholders) and the opportunity available for extraction of private benefits. Practitioner/Policy Implications: A practitioner implication is that shareholder of high-proximity dual-class firms must seek additional control mechanisms to curb agency costs. A policy implication is that investor protection (laws and institutional structure protecting shareholders) works only to a limited extent - it curbs overt acts of expropriation, but cannot eliminate acts engineered by insiders.

Tournament theory provides the basis for an assessment of the impact of pay disparity on performance. New evidence is provided regarding tournament theory by assessing two questions: (1) whether pay disparity leads to incentives for managers to engage in strategies that benefit the shareholders of the firm and (2) whether governance quality moderates the pay disparity-performance relationship, consistent with agency theory. Four measures of corporate governance are examined in order to assess governance's moderating role on the relationship between pay disparity and firm performance. The results suggest that while pay disparity can provide incentives for better performance, consistent with tournament theory, it can become destructive if it is reflective of agency conflict.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: We ask two research questions: (1) How do CEO stock ownership and options influence the amount of equity capital that a foreign firm raises in US capital markets? (2) How does the foreign firm's home-country risk moderate these relationships? Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we use a sample of firms from 40 countries that raised equity capital via ADR offerings between 1994 and 2005. Using a full-information maximum likelihood approach to estimate a model that accounts for sample selection associated with non-capital raising ADRs and non-listed ADRs, as well as hot and cold equity markets, we found that CEO stock and option ownership lead to a higher level of equity capital raised. Interestingly, the level of home-country risk of the issuing firm weakens the relationship between the CEO stock ownership and the amount of equity capital raised, but strengthens the relationship between CEO stock options and ADR equity capital raised. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We develop a framework that draws on behavioral decision making and agency theory to suggest that executive risk taking varies across countries and different forms of monitoring (stock ownership versus options) and that agents may exhibit risk-seeking as well as risk-averse behaviors. We also examined the potential corporate governance costs associated with principal-principal conflict as it relates to CEO stock-based compensation and the implications for raising equity capital. Because stock ownership and stock options have different risk profiles, and foreign firms operate in countries with different home-country risk, we theorize how home-country risk will moderate the relationship between CEO stock ownership or options with the amount of equity capital raised by a foreign firm in US stock markets through the issuance of American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that US investors pay attention to the types of stock-based executive compensation used by firms that raise capital in the US. In particular, CEOs of firms from higher risk countries need to consider US investors' perceptions of their stock-based compensation because it may hamper the firm's effectiveness in raising capital in the US.

Motivated by the inconsistent findings of the linkage between early supplier involvement practice and new product development success, this study adopts both the resource-based perspective and agency theory to investigate dynamic relationships between the manufacturer and supplier during the collaboration process. Survey data were used to empirically examine the impact of the resource factor (i.e. collaboration effect) and agency factors (i.e. interaction effect) on project team effectiveness. The results showed that selecting suppliers with appropriate knowledge and resources is necessary yet insufficient to improve project team effectiveness. The agency problem plays a dominant role in determining the quality of collaboration. In particular, the study identified information sharing and task programmability as two key governance mechanisms to curb suppliers' opportunistic behaviour. The study provides insightful managerial and policy implications for firms considering early supplier involvement practice in their innovation process.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the influence of corporate governance and internationalization on research and development (R&D) investments in USbased international firms. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws from agency theory to examine the influence of corporate governance mechanisms and internationalization on R&D intensity by the use of longitudinal data from 1991, 1994, 1997, and 2000 in a sample of large, manufacturing US firms with international operations. Findings - The paper finds that CEO total compensation is positively associated with R&D intensity, whereas equity voting power, insider ownership, and duality are negatively associated. Research limitations/implications - The findings regarding insider ownership confirms agency theory, in that agents will tend to make decisions to maximize their own utility and thus would be expected to reject R&D investments. In terms of duality, the augmented discretion that CEOs assume when they also hold the chairmanship position may reduce the monitoring function of the board, making it easier for the CEO to avoid engaging in shortterm risky ventures. Additionally, CEOs are likely to demand larger salaries when faced with risky decisions because their employment stability and reputation are at stake. Practical implications - Boards concerned with firm innovation should focus their decisions on CEO salaries on total compensation rather than on shortterm performance. Total compensation may motivate CEOs to commit to R&D investments that lead to innovations despite the risk of failure and detrimental impact on shortterm profits. Firms should be cautious in granting ownership to board members. Although ownership often stimulates commitment to strategic decisions, overinvolvement of board insiders may result in risk aversion, leading to decreases in R&D efforts. Originality/value - This paper extends the literature by integrating agency theory and organization learning in a comprehensive framework, showing that governance and internationalization play a significant role in firm R&D intensity.

Efficient information management is of high relevance for the success of young and entrepreneurial service companies. These ventures face a high level of uncertainty due to their lack of knowledge about market development, customer acceptance and customer behaviour. In consequence, one of the main marketing challenges is to deal with and thus lower uncertainties perceived by service entrepreneurs and their customers. Following the information economics approach, we argue that efficient information management can be theoretically framed as an essential ingredient to entrepreneurial marketing. A qualitative empirical study is used to verify the findings and to gain deeper insights into the marketing information management of young and entrepreneurial service ventures.

This article studies the effects on accounting performance and financing decisions of Colombian firms after issuing a corporate governance code. We assemble a database of Colombian issuers and test the hypotheses of improved performance and higher leverage after issuing a code. The results show that the firms' return on assets after the code introduction improves in excess of 1%; the effect is amplified by the code quality. Additionally, the firms leverage increased, in excess of 5%, when the code quality was factored into the analysis. These results suggest that controlling parties commitment to self restrain, by reducing their private benefits and/or the expropriation of non controlling parties, through the code introduction, is indeed an effective measure and that the financial markets agree, increasing the supply of funds to the firms.

This paper examines whether post-merger board composition affects the premiums paid to target shareholders. Using a sample of 207 stock-for-stock mergers from 1996 to 2004, we show that target merger premiums vary inversely with target director representation on the post-merger board. We also provide some evidence that both inside and outside target directors may trade shareholder wealth for board seats in the combined firms. However, we do not find board ownership moderates the relation between target merger premiums and post-merger board composition. Consistent with previous studies of management incentives in mergers, our empirical evidence supports the non-perfect agency theory. That is, target directors may sacrifice target shareholder interests to obtain a seat on the post-merger board. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Decades of research on corporate boards of directors resulting in diverse and often inconsistent findings have not dampened scholarly interest in the topic. Instead, researchers are attempting to more effectively model the board-firm relationship. One such modeling approach considers the power of the board in relation to top management. Drawing on upper echelons thinking (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) and the concept of managerial power (Finkelstein, 1992), this conceptual study develops the notion of board power in relation to CEO duality. Based on a framework composed of structural, ownership, expertise, and prestige power of the board, the study develops several propositions predicting the impact of board characteristics on a key aspect of managerial power - the appointment of the CEO to the position of board chair. This work contributes to scholarly understanding of the role of agency theory in explaining corporate governance phenomena by extending upper echelons thinking to the study of boards.

While the process of pursuing an initial public offering (IPO) provides new capital with which new ventures might pursue significant opportunities, research suggests that many IPO firms decrease in value subsequent to the new offering. Using an agency perspective, we argue that the IPO process itself may not only raise direct governance costs (due to increased monitoring and bonding), but may also create a distraction for managers who need to remain focused on the strategy to effectively use a large infusion of capital from the IPO. Likewise, we argue that governance participants, especially board members, will be distracted by the work necessary to take the firm public and, as such, may not be focused on the strategic monitoring necessary for continued firm's viability. This lack of monitoring may also allow managerial opportunism to be more prevalent, especially given the large amount of capital available to managers once the IPO is completed. Accordingly, we argue that excessive governance costs (both direct and indirect) may be associated with the IPO process and subsequent IPO firm performance.

The study investigates the relationship of corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structure and the Egyptian firm performance. This study utilizes a sample of 50 firms using the accounting and market data available for the period 2004-2006. The sample firms are all listed in either the Cairo or Alexandria Stock. The cross-sectional regression analysis is employed to test the hypotheses of the study. The results indicate a positive significant relationship between firm performance and the percentage of outside directors in boards and the existence of institutional representatives in boards. Furthermore, a significant negative relationship exists between firm performance and board size, role duality and the existence of firm's website. The results also reveal a significant, positive relationship between firm performance measures and the percentage of women members in boards of directors in Egyptian firms. Our results support previous literature and show consistency with the agency theory.

This study examines the impact of corporate governance mechanisms namely audit committee characteristics, internal audit arrangements, and managerial ownership on external audit fees. Using a sample of 539 firms listed on the main board, the results of the study document a positive relationship between audit committee independence and audit fees. Consistent with the capital reputational theory, the result suggests that independent audit committee demand for higher quality audit in order to protect their capital reputation as an expert. Contrary to our prediction, this study documents a negative relationship between audit committee expertise and audit fees indicating that auditors perceived firms with more audit committee members that possess accounting and finance expertise to be less risky and thus charged less audit fees to these firms. Furthermore, findings indicate that firms with their own internal audit function pay higher audit fees in comparison to those firms that outsourced their internal audit activities. Consistent with agency theory, the result suggests that the demand for audit services would be lower for firms whose managers own higher percentage of shares due to lower agency cost as compared to those firms with higher outsiders? ownership.

From the agency perspective, literature studying links between investor protection and governance profiles argues that family is more disposed than other shareholders to divert private benefits in countries with a poor legal framework: the question is empirically puzzling. From the stewardship perspective, the degree of familiness affects the stewardship attitude of the firm. We do not find that family firms perform worse or better than non-family counterparts. Some evidence is found as regards the entrenchment effect: family CEOs seem to weaken firm performance. Stewardship attitude - not familiness - does matter: moderate levels of stewardship improve performance and increase risk-taking.

Modern corporations have been widely accused of promoting values of managerial autonomy that can result in managerial waste and opportunistic behaviour, leading organizational theorists to suggest the adoption of alternative organizational forms that should normatively and structurally limit such autonomy. However, this mixed-methods study of an alternative organizational form - income trusts (1995-2005) - finds that income trusts were also characterized by excessive managerial autonomy. Managers strategically used the income trust form in discretionary ways such as by providing little information on important decisions to external parties, limiting investors' right to oppose managerial actions and retaining firm earnings to a great extent. Thus, the article concludes that alternative organizational forms do not necessarily promote an ethical business culture since they are unable to overcome deeply institutionalized values of managerial autonomy.

this article essentially thinks the western traditional principal-agent theory is a kind of corporate governance theory aimed at the companies with the main character of diversified equity. Obviously it is not fit for being used as the analysis framework of the governance problem of the companies with the main character of the relatively concentrated equity or highly concentrated equity. For that matter, the article indicates that, for the companies with the main character of the relatively concentrated equity or highly concentrated equity, the explaining power of double principal-agent theory is stronger. In other words, it is more favorable to reduce the double agency costs of those companies and realize the maximization of all the stockholders' interest of the companies. This article, finally, discusses how to further perfect the corporate governance of Chinese state-owned overseas companies based on the double principal-agent theory. (c) 2010 IEEE.

The diffusion of public agencies seems to characterize the European approach to public management. We analyze the governance mechanisms and, according to agency theory, the related accountability requirements in order to investigate if there is a conflict between public agency autonomy and political targets achievement. According to a multiple case study analysis, we consider three Italian public agencies: the Revenue Agency (AE), Social Security National Institute (INPS), and National Procurement Agency (CONSIP). Thus, we propose a model highlighting, for each public agency, the factors that are crucial to verify both the decision-making autonomy and coherence with public policy.

We investigate the long-run M&A performance of the listed firms in China based on a sample with a comprehensive 67 transactions. Using the Calendar-Time Abnormal Return method (CTAR), this paper finds that the performance of acquirers generally underperforms after the mergers. More over, the performance of acquirers marked by related party transactions, strong management ability or small size underperforms significantly compared with the performance of those marked by non-related party transactions, weak management ability or big size. In general, M&A activities in China actually destroy the shareholders' wealth of acquirers. It is indicated from our results that the traditional synergy theory can not explain M&A activities in China well. In contrast, tunneling theory, agency theory and hubris theory can better account for the long-run performance and motives of M&A within Chinese listed firms. (c)2010 IEEE.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of ownership structure and board structure on performance in VC-backed firms. Using 106 French VC-backed firms, our methodology in this paper is to estimate four equations. A regression analysis is then used to study the impact of ownership structure and board structure on performance and also to analyze whether ownership structure (ownership concentration, director ownership, venture capital ownership and employee ownership) and board variables (size, outside directors, COE-chairman duality, proportion of VC directors, proportion of employee directors and board meeting frequency) are significant determinants of VC-backed firm performance. Results indicate a strong positive relation between ownership concentration and performance and between director ownership and performance measured by ROE. And strong negative relation between ownership concentration and performance and between director ownership and performance measured by ROA. No strong relation was found between venture-capital ownership, employee ownership and firm performance. Results show also a strong negative relation between board size and performance measured by ROE and positive relation between board size and performance measured by ROA, Tobin's Q and MVA. The proportion of independent outside directors on the board was positively associated with ROE and negatively associated with ROA. The presence of a dual leadership structure is negatively associated with ROE and positively associated with ROA. No strong relation was found between the proportion of venture-capital in board, the presence of employee in board, or board meeting frequency and firm performance.

This paper presents empirical evidence related to a CEO's tenure, compensation, and performance. It reviews some generally accepted assumptions that have driven the rationale for CEO compensation packages, performance, and monitoring by the boards in charge of corporate governance. The empirical results of this paper provide only partial support for the underpinning basis of many of the compensation and corporate governance packages in today's corporate world. The paper uses data that was available to management and shareholders prior to the onset of the asset bubble that imploded during 2007-2009 period, and shows that there was already by then room for concern. The empirical findings presented here suggest that there is a mild positive relation between improvement in firm performance and the compensation package but even this is more evident in firms where the CEO service has a longer tenure compared to firms with a shorter tenure serving CEO. The results also support the findings from earlier studies that it is desirable to have an incentive scheme contingent on future returns, not only on the short time horizon. The findings presented here also confirm that CEOs who have passed the "early probation" test of time and skills and gained time to develop experience to lead the firm and its business have a stronger relationship between compensation and firm performance. However, the relatively low statistical relationships between compensation and firm performance for the whole sample overall leave room for concerns about the limited extent of their effectiveness. This paper also raises indirectly also concerns that the theoretical motivations of some compensation packages and the actual practices in the real world were not well aligned despite the large number of studies and efforts aimed at improving the relationship between CEO compensation and firm performance.

The purpose of this paper is to study the determinants of the presence of independent directors on boards of directors. Based on the agency theory, we study the different factors influencing the nomination of independent directors. The tests were applied to a sample of 79 companies belonging to the SBF120 index from 1999 to 2001. The results suggest that ownership concentration, the size of the company and institutional investors activism explain the presence of independent directors inside French board companies.

This paper tests the effect of managerial (inside) and block-holders (outside) ownership in relation to agency theory in Malaysian business environment. This study tests the agency relationship in different culture and social contact and provides evidence whether agency theory in non-western organizations have equal impact in Asian organizations. Consistent with agency theory and the convergence of interest hypothesis, managerial ownership (insiders) in Malaysia indicate a negative relationship with the demand for monitoring. This finding may be due to the fact that as the managers are also the owners, there is less conflict, less information asymmetry and less hierarchical organization structure in the companies, which lead to lower monitoring costs. However, another ownership structure, outside block-holders appear to demand more monitoring. This positive relationship may be explained by their effort to compensate their lack of involvement in the daily transactions and internal decisions of the company, especially in the concentrated business environment in the country.

This study investigates the relationship between strong firm environmental performance and board characteristics that capture boards' monitoring and resource provision abilities during an era when the natural environment and the related strategic opportunities have increased in importance. The authors relate the proxy for strong environmental performance to board characteristics that represent boards' monitoring role (i.e., independence, CEO-chair duality, concentration of directors appointed after the CEO, and director shareholding) and resource provision role (i.e., board size, directors on multiple boards, CEOs of other firms on the board, lawyers on the board, and director tenure). The authors provide evidence consistent with both theories of board roles. Specifically, consistent with their agency theory-driven predictions, the authors find evidence of higher environmental performance in firms with higher board independence and lower concentration of directors appointed after the CEO on the board of directors. Consistent with resource dependence theory, they show that environmental performance is higher in firms that have larger boards, larger representation of active CEOs on the board, and more legal experts on the board. Their findings are generally robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. These findings have implications for managers, firms, shareholders, and regulators who act on behalf of shareholders, if they are interested in influencing environmental performance.

In this paper, we contribute to the agency and corporate entrepreneurship literatures by focusing on board antecedents of research and development (R&D). Some researchers in this stream find outside directors negatively influence R&D spending, yet popular opinion suggests boards should be composed of outsiders, and at the same time, firms should be innovative and entrepreneurial. We begin to address this conflict by extending agency theory and incorporating resource dependence views in order to explore the influence of a wider range of director characteristics on R&D spending, a precursor of innovation and entrepreneurial activity. Our empirical results demonstrate that aspects of directors' human and relational capital (e.g. education, entrepreneurial finance experience, technical experience, and interlocks) significantly influence R&D spending. Our findings illustrate that boards can be configured to improve efficiencies, thereby reducing R&D spending, and/or to augment R&D spending. They reveal the merits of considering inside and outside directors separately and show how the independence (i.e. inside/outside status) of directors shapes the effect of their human and relational capital on R&D spending.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Does corporate governance explain US bank performance during the period leading up to the financial crisis? We adopt the factor structure by Larcker, Richardson, and Tuna (2007) to measure multiple dimensions of corporate governance for 236 public commercial banks. Research Findings/Insights: Findings reveal corporate governance factors explain financial performance better than loan quality. We find strong support for a negative association between leverage and both financial performance and loan quality. CEO duality is negatively associated with financial performance. The extent of executive incentive pay is positively associated with financial performance but exhibits a negative association with loan quality in the long-run. We find a concave relationship between financial performance and both board size and average director age. We provide weak evidence of an association of anti-takeover devices, board meeting frequency, and affiliated nature of committees with financial performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We apply agency theory to the banking industry and expect that the governance-performance linkage might differ due to the unique regulatory and business environment. Results extend Larcker et al. (2007), especially regarding the concave relationship between board size and performance, and the role of leverage. Given the lack of support for our agency theory predictions, we suggest that alternative theories are needed to understand the performance implications of corporate governance at banks. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer contributions to regulators, especially for ongoing financial reforms of capital requirements and executive compensation. Specifically, we show a consistent negative association between leverage and performance, which supports the current debate on Tier I capital limits for banks. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Agency theory and optimal contracting theory posit opposing roles and shareholder wealth effects for corporate inside directors. We evaluate these theories using the market for outside directorships to differentiate among inside directors. Firms with inside directors holding outside directorships have better operating performance and market-to-book ratios, especially when monitoring is more difficult. These firms make better acquisition decisions, have greater cash holdings, and overstate earnings less often. Announcements of outside board appointments improve shareholder wealth, while departure announcements reduce it, consistent with these inside directors improving board performance and outside directorships being an important source of inside director incentives.

New ventures often require debt financing but face difficulties convincing lenders of their creditworthiness because of agency problems. Researchers have shown that social capital can help small firms reduce lenders' agency concerns but new ventures do not yet have their own social capital. We propose that family involvement increases a venture's ability to borrow family social capital for the purpose of obtaining debt financing. Empirical tests with 1267 new ventures suggest that family involvement directly and indirectly improves a new venture's access to debt financing. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We empirically examine the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on CEO compensation using a large sample of the US firms from 1996 to 2010. We develop and test two hypotheses, the overinvestment hypothesis based on agency theory and the conflict-resolution hypothesis based on stakeholder theory. We find that the lag of CSR adversely affects both total compensation and cash compensation, after controlling for various firm and board characteristics. Our estimates show that an interquartile increase in CSR is followed by a 4. 35% (2. 78%) decrease in total (cash) compensation. We also find an inverse association between lagged employee relations and CEO compensation. Our results are robust to the correction for endogeneity using instrumental variable approach. Taken together, our results support the conflict-resolution hypothesis, but not the CSR overinvestment argument. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This paper argues for a greater focus on an agency theory (AT) perspective in understanding corporate governance in multinational enterprises (MNEs) since, despite recent developments, the traditional internalization theory approach limits our understanding of the behaviour of these firms. We analyse the contribution of an AT perspective to understanding various aspects of corporate governance in MNEs: internationalization, international joint ventures (IJVs), headquarters-subsidiary relationships, and new forms of global business groups. From this analysis, we suggest that even with the emerging AT literature's focus on the role of ownership as a key governance factor, there is substantial need for research on several key corporate governance mechanisms; namely, the role and nature of dominant owners, the composition of boards of directors, the separation of CEOs and board chairs, executive remuneration, and the role of the market for corporate control. There is scope to examine further the implications of different institutional environments for AT perspectives on the behaviour of MNEs. (c) 2010 The Authors.

Motivated by agency theory, we investigate how a firm's overall quality of corporate governance affects its dividend policy. Using a large sample of firms with governance data from The Institutional Shareholder Services, we find that firms with stronger governance exhibit a higher propensity to pay dividends, and, similarly, dividend payers tend to pay larger dividends. The results are consistent with the notion that shareholders of firms with better governance quality are able to force managers to disgorge more cash through dividends, thereby reducing what is left for expropriation by opportunistic managers. We employ the two-stage least squares approach to cope with possible endogeneity and still obtain consistent results. Our results are important as they show that corporate governance quality does have a palpable impact on critical corporate decisions such as dividend policy.

Purpose: This paper aims to construct a comprehensive theoretical framework for interpreting voluntary IC disclosure practices by organizations. Design/methodology/approach: Four most-commonly used theories in the area, namely agency theory, stakeholder theory, signalling theory, and legitimacy theory, were integrated in terms of the interrelated concepts relating to voluntary IC disclosure. Findings: The constructed theoretical framework includes three concepts: to reduce information asymmetry; to discharge accountability to various stakeholders; and to signal organizational legitimacy and excellence (or superior quality) to society, which are seen as motivations for organizations to disclose their IC on a voluntary basis. Research limitations/implications: The framework ignores some other theoretical perspectives which are also relevant to voluntary IC disclosure; the framework is not justified by any empirical evidence. Originality/value: This research is the first attempt to construct a comprehensive theoretical framework for the voluntary disclosure of IC; the constructed framework can be employed as a theoretical foundation for future empirical studies in relation to voluntary IC disclosure.

Scholars and practitioners have recently devoted considerable attention to boards of directors, but far more research is needed. We still know little about how boards actually work and how their behavior may be improved to contribute to value creation. During more than two decades agency theory has been the dominant theory in studies about boards of directors. When relaxing some of the assumptions in agency theory several new pathways for new research arise. To present new perspectives on board research we follow in this essay some of the pathways arising from relaxing agency theory assumptions about complete contracts. Alternative theoretical approaches, research questions and methods are suggested. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Purpose - The aim of this empirical study is to explore the factors that affect the capital structure of manufacturing firms and to investigate whether the capital structure models derived from Western settings provide convincing explanations for capital structure decisions of the Pakistani firms. Design/methodology/approach - Different conditional theories of capital structure are reviewed (the trade-off theory, pecking order theory, agency theory, and theory of free cash flow) in order to formulate testable propositions concerning the determinants of capital structure of the manufacturing firms. The investigation is performed using panel data procedures for a sample of 160 firms listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange during 2003-2007. Findings - The results suggest that profitability, liquidity, earnings volatility, and tangibility (asset structure) are related negatively to the debt ratio, whereas firm size is positively linked to the debt ratio. Non-debt tax shields and growth opportunities do not appear to be significantly related to the debt ratio. The findings of this study are consistent with the predictions of the trade-off theory, pecking order theory, and agency theory which shows that capital structure models derived from Western settings does provide some help in understanding the financing behavior of firms in Pakistan. Practical implications - This study has laid some groundwork to explore the determinants of capital structure of Pakistani firms upon which a more detailed evaluation could be based. Furthermore, empirical findings should help corporate managers to make optimal capital structure decisions. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that explores the determinants of capital structure of manufacturing firms in Pakistan by employing the most recent data. Moreover, this study somehow goes to confirm that same factors affect the capital structure decisions of firms in developing countries as identified for firms in developed economies.

As corporate managers interact with nonshareholder stakeholders, potential tradeoffs emerge and questions arise as to how these interactions impact shareholder value. We argue that this shareholder-stakeholder debate is an important issue within the overall corporate governance and corporate policy domain and examine one such stakeholder group - employees - by studying labor-friendly corporate practices. We find that announcements of labor-friendly policies are associated with positive abnormal stock returns. Labor-friendly firms also outperform otherwise similar firms, both in terms of long-run stock market returns and operating results. In addition, we find that the probability and benefits of labor-friendliness increase with the demand for highly skilled labor. Our analysis of excess executive compensation suggests that top management derives no pecuniary benefits from labor-friendly practices. We interpret our results as consistent with a genuine concern for employees translating into higher productivity and profitability, which in turn facilitate value creation. It appears that the benefits of labor-friendly practices significantly outweigh the costs and that what is good for employees is good for shareholders. (c) Springer 2010.

This paper contributes to multiple agency theory by examining how the compensation schemes awarded to outside directors and the CEO jointly affect firm-level risk taking. Using data of the S&P 1500 firms from 1997 to 2006, we find support for earlier arguments that providing the CEO, the outside directors, or both with stock options increases risk taking. More importantly, we find that compensating outside directors with stock options has significantly stronger effects than CEO stock options. Finally, contrary to what one would expect, we find that these effects are mutually substituting; that is, if both the outside directors and the CEO are provided with stock option compensation, outside directors' incentives weaken the effect of the CEO's incentives on firms' risk taking.

The benefits of corporate social responsibility (CSR) affect the entire supply chains a firm participates in. However, not every firm is in a position to force the implementation of CSR in its supply chains as some, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), lack the necessary power. Chain directors can implement it acting as a principal, whereas the other chain members can act as agents. In the principal-agent framework, two main problems occur due to information asymmetry: adverse selection and moral hazard. This paper examines how a code of conduct (i.e. Social Accountability 8000) can help address the principal-agent problem, for SMEs, between chain directors and partners. The research method involves four case studies on CSR practices as implemented by Italian and Dutch SMEs within their supply chains. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is twofold: to evidence the disclosure practices of Spanish companies in relation to a voluntary typology of strategic information; and to determine the factors that explain these practices. Among the factors considered, the study seeks to focus on the role of the Board of Directors in depth. According to Agency Theory, strategic information has positive consequences on external funds costs. On the other hand, Proprietary Costs theory limits these practices, given that they can lead to competitive disadvantages. Design/methodology/approach: First, online strategic information disclosure practices are analysed by examining non-financial quoted Spanish firms. A disclosure index is created, and subsequently, certain factors related to corporate governance - Activity, Size and Board Independence - as well as other factors traditionally analysed, are used to explain the volume of strategic information disclosed on the internet. Findings: The results indicate that Spanish companies, on average, give out little strategic information, mainly related to objectives, their mission, and the company's philosophy. "Company annual planning" and "Information on risks" are scarcely disclosed. The findings also emphasise that companies where the Chairperson of the Board is the same person as the CEO and, moreover, in which there is a lower frequency of meetings, disclose a greater amount of strategic information on their web sites. Practical implications: The findings suggest that the disclosure of strategic information is a decision taken by executives with the aim of satisfying the demands of creditors and investors. The Board of Directors represents the shareholders' interests, but it does not participate in strategic decision-making disclosure, maybe due to the fact that the proprietary costs lack influence. Originality/value: The link between corporate governance and strategic information disclosed online has scarcely been analysed in previous literature. This study provides interesting insights into how several Board characteristics can affect the disclosure of strategic information on the internet. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

We employ agency theory to argue that the effects of family (and founder) ownership versus management will be quite different: the former is expected to contribute positively to performance, the latter is argued to erode performance. Previous studies, due to problems of multicollinearity have been unable to distinguish these effects. Using a Bayesian approach that avoids these problems, we find that whereas family and founder ownership are associated with superior performance, the results for family and even founder management are more ambiguous. Our study is the first to assess the distinctive performance effects of family and founder presence in both ownership and management using a Bayesian approach. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we examine whether the presence of a founder influences the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and company performance in a sample of European, publicly traded, family firms. Our findings contradict the widespread belief that smaller and more independent boards as well as nondual leadership structures always lead to better firm performance, suggesting that agency theory is limited in its explanation of the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. We find a positive effect of board size on business performance in nonfounder-led family firms and a negative effect of board size on founder-led family businesses. The presence of independent directors on the board has a positive effect on performance when a firm is run by its founder. However, when descendants lead the firm, the presence of independent directors has a negative effect on performance. Although the effect of board meetings on firm performance is positive, this relationship is weaker when the family business is run by its founder. Finally, CEO duality improves firm performance when descendants run the business, although CEO duality has no effect on performance when the firm is led by the founder. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Microbanks serve micro-enterprises and poor people with financial services. This study examines how various aspects of international influence affect microbanks' financial and social performance. Grounded in agency theory and resource-based theory, we argue that there are multiple ways that the internationalization of microbanks might affect performance. Specifically, we argue that one can distinguish between four sources of such internationalization effects; international initiator, international directorship, international debt, and international affiliation/networks. This study utilizes data from 379 microbanks in 73 developing countries - assessed between 2001 and 2008. We find that the internationalization of microbanks to a large extend enhances social performance, but does not enhance financial performance. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper focuses on the relationship between one of the main corporate governance dimensions - ownership structure - and income smoothing. The paper investigates whether family-controlled companies differ from non-family-controlled companies with respect to income smoothing. Due to different incentives of management and owner investment horizons, we hypothesize that income smoothing is less likely among family-controlled companies than among non-family-controlled companies. Additionally, we hypothesize that among family-controlled firms income smoothing is less likely when CEO and Board Chairman are members of the controlling family. Various definitions of "family control" are applied. A sample of Italian listed companies is used for the empirical analysis. Research Findings/Insights: We find evidence that income smoothing is less likely among family-controlled companies than non-family-controlled companies. Moreover, among family-controlled companies, income smoothing is less likely for firms whose CEO and Board Chairman are members of the controlling family. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper fills a gap in the literature, suggesting that not only the level of ownership concentration or insider ownership but also the nature of the dominant shareholder (family versus non-family) should be considered when addressing the motivations for income smoothing. Furthermore, our findings indicate that agency theory and stewardship theory are complementary in explaining the role played by family control in income smoothing decisions. While in non-family-controlled companies the traditional owner-manager agency problems tend to prevail and motivate income smoothing, in family-controlled companies such agency issues become less relevant and a stewardship attitude emerges, rendering income smoothing less likely. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study is of interest to financial statement users, including analysts and investors, as it shows that different company types (e.g., family versus non-family) have a different attitude towards income smoothing. In particular, these results aid users in interpreting the company's reported profitability and its potential variability. The conclusions also are of interest to auditors when evaluating the reliability of the reported income of companies characterized by various ownership structures. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Whether voluntary or mandatory in nature, most recent corporate governance codes of best practice assume that board structural independence, and the application by boards of outcome-based incentive plans, are important boundary conditions for the enforcement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) pay-for-firm-performance; that is, for optimal contracting between owners and executive agents. We test this logic on a large Australian sample using a system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach to dynamic panel data estimation. We find that Australian boards exhibiting best practice structural arrangements - those chaired by non-executives and dominated by non-executive directors at the full board and compensation committee levels - are no more adept at enforcing CEO pay-for-firm-performance than are executive-dominated boards. These findings suggest that policy makers' faith in incentive plans and the moderating influence of structural independence per se may be misplaced. Our findings also hold significant implications for corporate governance theory. Specifically, the findings lend further support to a contingency-based understanding of board composition, reward choice and monitoring; an approach integrating the insights afforded by behavioural approaches to Agency Theory and by social-cognitive and institutional understandings of director outlook, decision-making and behaviour.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Recent research from the United States has advocated increasing ownership concentration and aligning ownership and control to mitigate principal-agent conflicts for entrepreneurial firms. By contrast, this study aims to demonstrate that the major governance problem in an emerging economy is principal-principal conflicts, and that increasing ownership concentration and aligning ownership and control will instead reinforce such conflicts and IPO underpricing. Research Findings/Insights: Using data from 525 IPO firms in Taiwan, an emerging economy, this study finds that increasing family ownership and institutional ownership and introducing CEO duality increase IPO underpricing, while employing independent outside directors mitigates IPO underpricing. These results are consistent with our hypotheses concerning principal-principal conflicts. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results are quite different from those of prior research using US data, in that institutions are weaker in an emerging economy than in the United States, where principal-agent conflicts are the main concern. Consequently, corporate governance research, particularly when conducted outside the US, should consider institutional contexts, which agency theory fails to do. As such, institutional theory offers a promising approach. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Government policies designed to address principal-agent conflicts, such as increasing ownership concentration and aligning ownership and control, may make principal-principal conflicts worse and increase IPO underpricing in an emerging economy. To mitigate principal-principal conflicts and IPO underpricing, regulatory reforms need to reduce ownership concentration, separate ownership, and control, and strengthen formal institutions that help minority shareholders monitor firm decisions.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of managerial ownership in relation to agency theory in the Malaysian business environment. In addition to examining the total managerial shareholdings, this study also investigates the association between direct and indirect managerial shareholdings with agency costs. Design/methodology/approach: The data for the study is obtained from two sources, namely primary (questionnaire) and secondary (annual reports) data. The sample companies are 235 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ended 2006. Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the relationship between the variables. Findings: The results of the study indicate that managerial ownership in various segments has an inverse relationship with total monitoring costs as predicted in agency theory. This finding is consistent with earlier studies in western countries and supports the convergence of interest hypothesis. Originality/value: This study gives a unique contribution to corporate governance studies relating to the effect of ownership structure in relation to agency theory in Malaysian companies, one of the countries in Asia. Previous studies claimed that it is unknown whether the agency theory findings in western countries have equal impact in Asian organizations. Previous literature also indicates that there is a possibility that given the cultural differences, the typical nature of agents in agency theory may not be the case with regard to non-western countries. Thus, this study provides evidence that support prior research findings in western countries relating to the effect of managerial ownership on the agency relationship which is reflected in its agency costs.

We study the decision to distribute funds as well as the choice of the payout channel (i.e. dividends, repurchases, or both). Our analysis of the payout policy of UK firms demonstrates that the importance of share repurchases is increasing, but dividends still constitute a vast proportion of the total payout. We document that there is a relation between the presence of blockholders and the choice of the payout channel. We find that payout decisions are influenced by directors' liquidity needs but are not consistent with the agency theory of payout. We also reject the tax-clientele explanation for payout choices.

This purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of board and audit committee meeting frequency. The determinants studied are related to the ownership structure and to the board characteristics. The study is conducted in an agency setting featured by high ownership concentration and large insider shareholders. Hypotheses are developed based on agency theory. The empirical evidence is provided by a sample of Italian listed companies. Negative binomial regression is used in the multivariate analysis to test the relationships. Robustness checks provide further empirical support. The paper finds that insider ownership negatively impacts -- either on the board or on the audit committee meeting frequency -- whilst the proportion of independent directors in the board has a positive impact. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that insider ownership and board independent monitoring are substitute control mechanisms. The findings also show that audit committees are more active in larger firms. The paper provides an agency theory-based explanation of the board and the audit committee meeting frequency, in a setting featured by large controlling shareholders.

Agency theory stipulates that executives will use their superior information to exploit owners unless effectively monitored or incentivized to do otherwise: Agents here are held to be opportunists and owners responsible parties. However, sometimes agency theory misses the mark and the reverse holds true. It may be the owners who exploit their firm and compromise its long-term interests, and steward-like agents who use their superior information to benefit a firm and its stakeholders. This analysis provides an inspiring historical example of how that can happen and illustrates some conditions under which one might expect similarly happy circumstances to arise.

We investigate the impact of board independence on earnings management on a sample of family controlled firms listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Using panel data over the period 2000-2004, we find evidence of earnings management among family controlled firms in Australia, an environment of high investor protection and private benefits of control. Findings show that a higher proportion of independent directors on boards is effective in reducing earnings management, thereby mitigating agency problems associated with entrenchment and expropriation in family firms. We also find that managers of family firms are less aggressive in managing earnings via discretionary long-term accruals compared to non-family firms. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

For decades, managers' powers and their freedom to make strategic decisions were taken for granted in the field of corporate governance. The present crisis has revealed that their managerial latitude is in reality much weaker than thought. The growing influence of shareholders has undermined the historical and professional legitimacy of managers, who are now viewed as 'agents' controlled by 'principals'. This paper makes two contributions. First, we hold that the crisis is not a purely economic or financial crisis but a fundamental crisis of management, with its function of regulating the relationship between the firm and society. Second, we show that this crisis is rooted in law, since corporate law does not actually protect the autonomy of management. Until now, management theory has underestimated the role of law in the evolutions of corporate governance; we argue that management research needs to open its boundaries and specifically to re-examine corporate law. We suggest new governance rules to ensure managers have the latitude to organize collective creation processes in a way that is both efficient and legitimate. And we discuss some avenues for reflecting on a post-crisis business law. (c) 2011 The Author(s). British Journal of Management (c) 2011 British Academy of Management.

Offshore outsourcing of administrative and technical services has become a mainstream business practice. Increasing commoditization of business services and growing client experience with outsourcing have created a range of competitive service delivery options for client firms. Yet, data from the Offshoring Research Network (ORN) suggests that, despite increasing market options and growing client expectations related to service quality and cost efficiency, clients typically renew provider contracts and develop longer-term relationships with providers. Based on ORN data, this paper explores drivers of this phenomenon. The findings suggest that providers promote contract renewal by making client specific investments in software, IT infrastructure and training, and by involving clients in outsourcing operations, thereby increasing relation specific joint equity and creating opportunities for client monitoring and control. Interestingly, these strategies apply to routine rather than knowledge-intensive tasks, and are more likely to be applied by large rather than small providers. Surprisingly, high degree of contract specification makes contract renewal less likely. The paper contributes to the growing literature on strategic outsourcing of business services and the importance of governance mechanisms addressing "hidden costs" as well as "hidden benefits" of offshore outsourcing relationships.

In developed markets including the United States, family-controlled firms, in particular founder-controlled firms, have been associated with higher firm performance than their nonfamily counterparts. Such family-controlled firms have concentrated ownership, which, according to agency theory, reduces agency costs and leads to superior firm value. Extant research, however, is not clear whether it is the family control or concentrated ownership that bestows the advantages that lead to enhanced firm performance. By examining different types of concentrated ownership, this study evaluates whether family ownership adds value beyond that provided by concentrated ownership. Based on analyses of panel data from the Indian corporate sector, we find that, in general, firms with concentrated ownership outperform firms with dispersed ownership. Surprisingly, and more importantly, however, we find there are no significant performance differences among family-controlled firms and firms controlled by either foreign corporations or the state. This result is consistent with the notion that concentrated ownership, not family control, is a key determinant of firm performance. (c) 2011 Strategic Management Society.

In this work, the author analyzes agency costs and their effect on efficiency in the context of small family firms. In particular, the author examines the effect that factors such as self-management, having related managers, and family employees exert on firm efficiency. The author offers some reasoning that may help to clarify agency problems for small firms. The author uses stochastic frontiers to measure and explain efficiency. The author's focus is on small firms in the fishing sector, which are very important entities for the development of certain local communities. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

In the slipstream of several large-scale corporate scandals, the board of directors has gained a pivotal position in the corporate governance debate. However, due to an overreliance on particular methodological (i. e. input-output studies) and theoretical (i. e. agency theory) research fortresses in past board research, academic knowledge concerning how this important governance mechanism actually operates and functions remains relatively limited. This theoretical paper aims to contribute to the promising stream of research which focuses on behavioural perspectives and processes within the corporate board, by delving into one of the research areas perhaps plagued most by these predominant approaches: board leadership. In adopting a team perspective on the board of directors our study goes beyond traditional board leadership research, which has turned a blind eye on actual leadership dynamics, by examining leadership processes and behaviours inside the board team. Specifically, we develop a conceptual framework addressing a novel and ethical approach to team leadership within the board, i. e. shared leadership, which has previously been demonstrated to result in performance benefits in various other team settings.

This paper investigates the influence of firm-level corporate governance on the capital structure pattern of non-financial listed firms, using a case study of Bangladesh. The agency theory suggests that better corporate governance will reduce agency costs and improve investor confidence, which in turn will enhance the ability of a firm to gain access to equity finance, reducing dependence on debt finance. Conversely, the controlling shareholders of poorly governed firms are likely to prefer debt, in order to retain absolute ownership and control rights. The OLS regression framework uses a questionnaire-survey based Corporate Governance Index (CGI). The study results seem to support agency theory, with a statistically significant inverse relationship between corporate governance quality and the total as well as long-term debt ratios.

This paper examines the impact on underpricing and firm market value arising from IPO firms implementing a range of governance attributes such as the separation of CEO and Chairman roles, the founder ceding CEO position, establishment of committees and board size. Furthermore I study the determinants of director retained ownership and the relation between this and underpricing. Using a comprehensive sample of 37 locally listed IPO firm's from across West Africa I find evidence of a mixed impact from the adoption of universally recognised governance mechanisms. Higher levels of retained director ownership increase underpricing in contrast to that of founders. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

How can the internal governance of civil society organizations be conceptualized more adequately by accounting for the dual and simultaneous requirements of controlling and coaching in board behavior? Empirically, we seem to agree that effective governance of a civil society organization is crucial to its sustained viability. Conceptually, however, we observe a lack of consensus on how to best understand CSO governance. By critically juxtaposing two major theoretical lenses to conceptualize governance, namely, agency and stewardship theory, we identify a number of challenges when dealing with board-management relations that deserve our attention. While agency theory privileges controlling behavior, stewardship theory emphasizes the coaching behavior of boards. The purpose of this article is to offer a concept of governance that is informed by a paradox perspective advancing a subtler, more adequate conceptualization of board governance that accounts for these often conflicting demands on CSO governance. Drawing on illustrations from a longitudinal interpretive case study, we exemplify our propositions empirically. The article concludes with discussing the implications of our argument for CSO governance research and practice.

This work shows how tenets of agency theory can be linked with institutional analysis to improve their explanatory power in the context of an emerging country such as Brazil. This study assessed the authors' propositions in a single-case analysis of a Brazilian multiple family firm. The results show that in the initial phase, characterized by less severe agency problems, the firm's competitive advantage matured, supported by the strong presence of trust derived from an extended family structure. As the company grew in complexity, the informal monitoring mechanisms that characterize collectivist societies allowed agency problems to escalate. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study examines the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries maintain active boards of directors. Active boards are in this study defined as boards that perform tasks beyond fulfilling local legal requirements. We focus on both monitoring and service roles. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a sample of 83 foreign subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is a world mandate subsidiary, which has worldwide responsibility for a product line and performs a broad scope of value-added activities. Moreover, a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is larger relative to the multinational enterprise (MNE), if it has a higher level of local responsiveness, and if its past performance is poorer. Additionally, the presence of an active board in a foreign subsidiary is related to other control mechanisms deployed in the subsidiary. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results highlight the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries are likely to maintain active boards. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that agency theory and resource dependence theory are relevant and complementary in the analysis of active boards in foreign subsidiaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that an active board may be a control mechanism to govern foreign subsidiaries and an instrument to deal with the external environment. Corporate governance regulators may consider developing governance recommendations that emphasize the importance of subsidiary boards in the oversight of foreign subsidiaries.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of independent directors and ownership structure on voluntary disclosures of Vietnamese listed firms. Design/methodology/approach Year-ending 2008 annual report disclosures of 45 Vietnamese listed firms are analyzed. Voluntary disclosure is measured using a Vietnamese Disclosure Index adapted from prior literature. Descriptive and inferential statistics (ITT/IT-test, analysis of variance, multiple regressions (ordinary least squares)) are employed to generate empirical insights. Findings The results indicate that the level of voluntary disclosure among Vietnamese listed firms is relatively low (24.23 per cent). There are higher levels of disclosure relating to director and senior management details but far lower in regards to social issues. State ownership and managerial ownership are negatively and positively related to the extent of voluntary disclosure respectively. Moreover, bigger firms are found to be positively associated with voluntary disclosure. Research limitations/ implications The results of this study are limited to one year 2008 and thus, could be biased as disclosures can change over time. Practical implications Vietnamese regulators should focus on strengthening the regulations governing the level of corporate communication in firms with high state ownership as well as encouraging more disclosure of non-financial information to strengthen its market information transparency. Originality/value This study is one of the first examining the level of corporate voluntary disclosure practices among Vietnamese listed firms. Evidence from this study extends the existing voluntary disclosure literature on emerging economies whilst providing valuable insights to Vietnamese policy makers in the process of developing and improving its financial reporting regulatory framework.

This paper examines the performance effects of family ownership and influence on board structure and its composition in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO) in the North African region. Using a unique and comprehensive hand-collected sample of 63 locally listed IPO firm's from across North Africa we find considerable evidence of a sizeable differential between family and non-family controlled firms. I find considerable evidence supporting increased participation of family members at board level while contrastingly the wider dispersion of family ownership facilitates monitoring and surveillance and mitigates underpricing. Equally in line with the extended network and relationships involved in family firms business angels provide the optimal form of governance in contrast to the more formal private equity and venture capital industry.

Although discretion among employees at organizations' lower levels seems to be increasing, it is uncertain whether this is a desirable HRM policy. To understand this issue better, this study tests competing organization theory predictions about the performance consequences of middle managers' perceived discretion. Discretion is defined as the freedom of action or decision authority available in managing subordinates. Survey data from a multinational, European sample of research and development (R&D) units were used to assess the effect of managers' perceived discretion on unit performance. The results show that a combination of ecology theory and strategic choice theory best predicts the relationship between discretion and unit performance. Greater perceived managerial discretion was linked to increased unit performance in a relationship moderated by managerial experience and limited by unit size. These findings have implications for HRM theory and practice, particularly regarding policies related to empowerment and leadership development. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper examines the interrelations among ownership, board and manager characteristics and firm performance in a sample of 54 firms listed at the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE). These governance characteristics, designed to minimize agency problems between principals and agents are operationalized in terms of ownership concentration, ownership identity, board effectiveness and managerial discretion. The typical ownership identities at the NSE are government, foreign, institutional, manager and diverse ownership forms. Firm performance is measured using Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Dividend Yield (DY). Using PPMC, Logistic Regression and Stepwise Regression, the paper presents evidence of significant positive relationship between foreign, insider, institutional and diverse ownership forms, and firm performance. However, the relationship between ownership concentration and government, and firm performance was significantly negative. The role of boards was found to be of very little value, mainly due to lack of adherence to board member selection criteria. The results also show significant positive relationship between managerial discretion and performance. Collectively, these results are consistent with pertinent literature with regard to the implications of government, foreign, manager (insider) and institutional ownership forms, but significantly differ concerning the effects of ownership concentration and diverse ownership on firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: This paper seeks to complement agency and stewardship perspectives regarding the governance of top managers by using insights from social categorization theory. Research Findings/Insights: This paper looks inside the black box of the control-performance relationship. We acknowledge that boards can positively influence organizational functioning by monitoring the top management team. However, we also argue that board control contains a hidden cost. The model we develop describes how control can highlight the distinction between principals and agents thereby causing the top management team to adopt a biased and less cooperative "us vs. them" orientation towards owners and their representatives. We contend this results in an increase in negative discretionary behavior and a decrease in positive discretionary behavior, which dampen the positive influence of control on firm performance. We also describe techniques for mitigating this unintended outcome of control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Agency and stewardship theories offer alternative views of human nature and provide divergent prescriptions for governance. This paper presents social categorization theory as a complementary lens emphasizing a situational and social view of human nature that helps explain top managers' discretionary behaviors that influence firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Ongoing governance scandals are costly illustrations of unchecked managerial opportunism. They demonstrate the need for vigilant control. A control approach to governance, however, does not consistently improve firm performance. This paper offers an explanation. It acknowledges that board control is necessary, while arguing that it can have unwanted side effects. We describe two tools (individualization and social recategorization) that can be used to ameliorate these effects. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Agency theory provides a valuable lens for understanding the role and importance of many varied governance mechanisms. We argue that transaction cost economics (TCE) provides a complementary theoretical lens for studying corporate governance because it illuminates the various contingencies that moderate the importance of alternative governance mechanisms. Using agency theory, we argue and find evidence that the confluence of advancing CEO age and large CEO stock holdings will cause the CEO to become overly risk-averse. Moreover, we use TCE to more fully explicate the ensuing performance consequences as well as the contextual factors that critically moderate this relationship. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are rapidly becoming the foundations to the decision support systems of many organizations, but have all too often failed to deliver their expected benefits. Most ERP implementation projects are carried out using implementation consultants hired from outside the client firm. The current study treated the consultants as agents and the clients as principals, and applied agency theory to test the consultant- client relationship as a predictor of ERP implementation project success. A survey collected responses from 192 client project managers who worked on the ERP implementation process in their organizations. Data analysis via structural equation modeling showed that more consultant monitoring predicts less moral hazard (i.e., consultant shirking), that less moral hazard predicts greater ERP project success, and that more monitoring directly predicts such success. However, the analysis failed to support expectations that more pre-qualification efforts (i.e., screening of the consultant) would lead to less adverse selection (i.e., the consultant's misrepresentation of skills) or that less adverse selection would lead to greater ERP success. Surprisingly greater incentive alignment predicted greater moral hazard, thus suggesting the potential of incentives to de-motivate rather than motivate. This study contributed by extending agency theory to outsourced information systems project implementation. It provided new, validated measures of prequalification efforts, monitoring, incentive alignment, moral hazard, and adverse selection constructs. The findings suggest that future researchers may want to learn more about incentive alignment and its impact, and that information systems project managers may want to monitor more to improve ERP and other large-scale system implementation success.

Franchisors monitor their franchisees to ensure that the latters' performance is consistent with the franchise agreement. Though agency theory suggests that monitoring and subsequent corrective action lead to improved performance and reduced opportunism, the psychology literature argues that, in certain circumstances, monitoring can "crowd out" the very behavior it was designed to eliminate (i.e., opportunistic behavior). Our results show that the extent and ease of monitoring reduce the crowding out effects of monitoring, whereas monitoring enforcement heightens these effects. Our findings also show that the exchange norm of relational solidarity fully mediates these effects. (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The relationship between board leadership, firm financial performance and agency costs is examined on behalf of a sample of multinational company subsidiaries (MNCs) and local public companies (LPCs) in Sri Lanka. Five years of data for 86 MNC subsidiaries and 113 LPCs, are collected and observations are analysed using a dynamic panel GMM estimation. This study provides empirical support for stewardship theory and contingency theory when firms are multinational subsidiaries. Moreover, findings support agency theory when firms are local public companies. Finally, this study indicates that there is no optimal board leadership structure. Hence, when companies commence their exploration of corporate governance practices, firms need to recognised that firm characteristics and contingency perspective boost the impact of board leadership structure on corporate financial performance.

We examined CEO attributes, board composition, and ownership structure for their relationship to the share performance of the acquiring company around the acquisition announcement. Based on 273 acquisitions by Canadian firms from 1998 through 2002, we have shown that the levels of CEO and director ownership as well as the level of board independence were positively associated with the short-term financial performance of the acquirer. Board size was negatively related to value creation. Finally, cash-based deals and cross-border transactions were also positively related to increases in shareholder wealth for the acquirer.

This study evaluates the impact of managerial ownership on the firm's performance and financial policies in the context of Pakistani market for sixty non-financial firms included in KSE 100 index for the period of 2000 to 2007. The analysis support that the concentration of managerial ownership affects the firms financial policies, mainly the leverage and dividend policies. The empirical analysis find out that leverage policy variable influenced managerial ownership negatively, supporting that the lower leverage level leads to high profitability firms engage in low managers' ownership program. The result also determines a negative and significant association among the mangers ownership concentration and dividend policy of the firms. This result is supported by the agency theory prediction suggesting that as a firm has high managerial ownership, the asymmetric information will decrease and directly decrease the effectiveness of the dividend policy. Beside this the firms with higher managerial ownership decrease their perquisites, so the conflict between manager's shareholders can be settled. It is also observed that the managers' ownership concentration in general has a positive relationship with the performance in the corporate culture of Pakistan, where major firms are the family oriented. When the managerial ownership is divided in three levels, low level (0 -5%), moderate level (5%-25% and high concentrated (above 25%), the performance positively affect only at low and moderate level. The ownership beyond 25% has a negative association with performance and support the entrenchment theory. (c) Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2011.

This article considers the 'obvious' relationship between human capital (HC) and agency theory (AT) with two goals in mind. First, to show how principal-agent theory (PAT) - the AT variant most understood by agency theory - clarifies HC as a way of describing individuals in the organizational context. Second, to explore how PAT's own shortcomings illuminate possibilities implicit but underexplored in the HC literature; for while a workplace relationship between PAT and HC seems obvious, it is conceptually complicated. The article begins with a review of the two concepts' history and the research programs from which they emerged. After considering the PAT-HC interaction, it shows how HC might contribute to the theory of the firm. Many see the firm as a socioeconomic context in which HC and agency issues collide under management's direction as other forms of capital enter the mix. (c) Oxford University Press 2011.

This paper deals with the relationships between plural form and performance in franchising networks in Europe. It is proposed that a franchisor's life cycle stage and human capital assets influence the relationship between plural form and performance. The model has been estimated using panel data on 41 publicly listed European franchising networks in the 1998-2007 period. The proportion of network-franchised units to the total number of its units in its distribution system is used as the indicator of its plural form (franchise proportion). Following an instrumental approach, the network performance is measured at the franchisor level by its industry-adjusted Return on Assets (ROA) and a relative stock market valuation measure of intangible human capital is used. The early results show that the impact of franchise proportion on performance is greater for franchisors with high intangible human capital compared to franchisors with low intangible human capital. Overall, results provide support for the contention that the franchisors' performance is contingent on the "fit" between governance structure (franchise proportion) and resources (critical human assets). In contrast, evidence that the governance/performance relationship is contingent on life cycle stage or franchisor's age is not found. However our results suggest that franchisor's age could weaken the relationship between franchise proportion and performance. These results might suggest that younger franchisors with high human capital should increase their franchise proportion to enhance their financial performance.

Purpose - This research seeks to investigate the role of key corporate governance mechanisms in determining a firm's post-bankruptcy performance following reorganisation. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on agency theory and uses a unique sample of 111 filing companies whose reorganisation plans have been confirmed by the Thai Central Bankruptcy Court during the period 1999-2002. Findings - The results indicate that monitoring and incentive mechanisms are significant determinants of a firm's post-bankruptcy performance. The key monitoring mechanism is ownership concentration, measured by shares held by the largest shareholder, whereas the critical incentive mechanisms are cash compensation and percentage of common shares held by the plan administrator. The results indicate that these mechanisms can mitigate agency problems in previously insolvent companies and increase post-bankruptcy performance over a three year period. Originality/value - The study is timely given that many organisations are facing rebuilding programs following the impact of the global financial crisis. Prior research in Thailand and elsewhere has not measured bankruptcy reorganisation outcomes in terms of the difference of actual financial performance to predicted performance and in relation to the governance factors of the reorganisation process. Neither has this aspect been considered within an agency theory framework. This provides a unique opportunity to consider these variables based on the theoretical framework of agency theory and to evaluate the importance of governance mechanisms in reorganisation proceedings.

The sustainable supply chain has become a major research topic and has given rise to a large number of academic works. These studies focus on how supply management integrates environmental, social and economic criteria allowing a network of interlinked organizations to achieve long-term economic viability. The objective of this research is to explore the paradigm shift that buyers must undergo when adopting a sustainable development approach. This new vision extends and surpasses the traditional dyadic buyer-supplier relationship that has historically dominated the field leading to a new global supply chain dynamic. The case of the Cite des Sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris is used to question the ability of a hub firm to ensure component traceability from first-tier and second-tier suppliers and thus consolidate their corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy. Indeed, second-tier supplier failure to comply with CSR requirements, even if the first-tier suppliers meet these requirements, may damage customer perception of the hub firm's strategic positioning. This research mobilizes the agency theory conceptual framework to illustrate that hub firms tend to trust first-tier suppliers with verifying CSR requirements in the upstream supply chain to reduce direct agency costs (monitoring and bonding expenditures). If this approach becomes widespread, it is highly likely that CSR expansion along the global supply chain will be ineffective.

We examine the design of control rights of external financiers, and how these interact with the firm's security issuance and capital structure when the firm's initial owners and managers may disagree with new investors over project choice. The first main result is an ex ante managerial preference for "soft" financial claims that maximize managerial project-choice autonomy, which is in contrast to agency theory. Second, a dynamic "pecking order" of cash, equity, and debt emerges. Additional results explain equity issuance at high prices, the drifting of leverage ratios with stock returns, cash hoarding, and debt usage without taxes, agency, or signaling. (c) 2011 The Author.

This book provides a framework for the study of financial ethics built on a broad review of research published in finance and economics journals. This book demonstrates that ethics is already an important part of financial research, and therefore the approach taken here is more of a "rediscovery" of the ethical dimension of financial economics. The book adopts a positivist framework for the field of financial ethics within which it is proposed that many "finance" problems are actually "ethics" problems; and that many economic phenomena can be explained as mechanisms for controlling moral risks. The text discusses several examples in which an ethics-centered approach to understanding economic phenomena is similar in spirit to other frameworks which have been applied in positive financial research including: the framework used for understanding corporate governance mechanisms as devices for mitigating agency costs and "moral hazards" in contractual relationships; the transaction "governance structure" framework that can explain the existence of hierarchies relative to markets when opportunistic behavior is assumed; and the roles of reputation and corporate culture in making credible commitments of trust in exchange. The book argues that these "financial ethical technologies" are not mutually exclusive but, rather, mutually enriching ways to deepen our understanding of the same economic phenomena. They are financial technologies because they enhance economic value; and, they are ethical technologies because their value enhancing contributions are produced by mitigating moral risks in exchange.

Agency theory has been discussed widely in the business and management literature. However, to date there has been no investigation about its utility and implications for problems in training & development. Whereas organizations are still struggling to develop and implement effective training programs, there is little emphasis on the self-interest behaviors of the trainers and how these motivations may impede the training process. Agency theory can help inform our learning and understanding of possible outcomes in this scenario. Consequently, this article is the first to explore agency theory within the training & development framework and offers propositions for research and practice. Implications for organizational policy and performance outcomes are also discussed. (c) SAGE Publications 2011.

In response to equity compensation contracts that encourage managers to commit fraud as well as provide productive effort, ownersmay choose to monitor the manager to limit the fraud. We examine the firm owners' incentives to perform both ex ante monitoring, such as internal controls, and ex post monitoring, such as audits, in a model that includes the reputational damages caused when a fraud is discovered. We provide conditions under which the owner prefers either more or less monitoring, and examine the effect of additional monitoring on the optimal equity package and equilibrium level of fraud.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to compare the governance structures of two distinctive governance forms&colon; the family firm and the leveraged buyout &lpar;LBO&rpar;. The paper also explores the relative performance of these two organizational forms over the course of the economic business cycle. Design&sol;methodology&sol;approachThe paper provides a theoretical treatment of the family firm and the LBO using the stewardship perspective and agency theory. The analysis anticipates the board structure for each organizational form and relates family firm and LBO governance to performance over the business cycle. FindingsFrom a conceptual treatment, the family&hyphen;owned concern exhibits board characteristics reflecting the longer&hyphen;term orientation of the firm, with boards empowered to include non&hyphen;economic, as well as economic, goals. LBOs are structured to maximize shareholder value over a shorter time horizon. LBOs may take advantage of expansionary environments whereas family firms may be better prepared for economic down&hyphen;cycles. Research limitations&sol;implicationsThe paper takes a holistic approach to contrasting two organizational forms that fit their respective theoretical frames and compares some of their more salient governance characteristics and performance over the business cycle. Practical implicationsManagers and boards can structure governance to manage the business cycle. Stakeholders can selectively engage firms that portray vital governance characteristics for their benefit and may also pressure boards and top management to make necessary governance improvements. Originality&sol;valueThe paper offers an introductory comparison between family firms and LBOs in terms of governance and managing the firm over the business cycle. This paper makes the case that some organizational forms are better suited to certain types of economic climates. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper offers an agency-based explanation for the junior priority status of convertible bonds. Using a simple economic model, I show that when convertible and straight debt have equal priority, shareholders can prefer value-decreasing projects, which results in wealth transfers from bondholders to shareholders; and I prove that this problem is solved when convertible debt is subordinated. Empirical evidence supports the theory. I find that firms with greater potential for investment-based agency conflicts are more likely to issue subordinated convertible debt, and firms with senior convertible debt are more likely to deviate from the optimal investment policy.

Purpose - Firms that pursue invention face special conditions that heighten the potential conflict between managers and shareholders. High R&D spending increases the information asymmetry between managers and shareholders because the invention process is rooted in tacit knowledge. Because tacit knowledge is difficult to communicate to external parties, shareholders will have problems monitoring whether managers are spending R&D in a manner that maximizes firm value. Design/methodology/approach - Using agency theory, it is argued that managerial ownership is one solution to this problem and that high levels of R&D intensity will necessitate high levels of managerial ownership to counteract agency problems. However, it is also argued based on signaling theory that a firm's patenting activity reduces ownership requirement as well as moderating the managerial ownership-R&D relationship. Findings - Using a sample of firms from the knowledge-intensive biotechnology industry, a positive relationship was found between R&D spending and managerial ownership. It was also found that this relationship is most strongly moderated by patenting activity. Research limitations/implications - The findings would be strengthened by replication using samples from other knowledge-intensive industries. Future research should examine how the critical determinants of success in other industries affect managerial ownership of firms in those industries. Practical implications - The study shows that top managers have some control over the contracting environment. By aggressively pursuing patents managers can reduce their level of ownership in the firm. Originality/value - The study finds evidence that in order to prevent agency problems firms undertaking inventive activity may require their managers to take larger ownership or aggressively pursue patents. High managerial ownership levels and patents can provide a signal to shareholders about the growth potential of the firm. (c) 2011, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study examines if the CEO duality influence the firm economic performance in Bangladesh and the moderating effects of board composition in the form of outside independent directors. While doing so, it examines the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance during the pre appointment of outside independent directors and post appointment of outside independent directors (the role of other corporate governance mechanism as moderating variable). The finding is that there is there is a negative (non-significant) relationship between CEO duality and firm performance before appointment of outside independent directors in the board. However, independent leadership structure and firm performance is found to be positively related following the acquisition of resource (outside independent directors in the board) supporting the 'resource dependence theory'. The findings of this study partially support the 'agency theory' and 'resource dependence theory' but do not support the stewardship theory. This study contributes to the literature on CEO duality in the context of less a developed country.

Based on agency theory, this paper studied on the relationship between corporate governance structure and diversification strategy. Choosing 520 listed companies in Shanghai stock on December 31, 2009 as research samples, the paper did an empirical study on the impact of corporate governance structure on diversification strategy. The result showed that concentration of ownership, proportion of legal person shares and proportion of independent directors all had negative correlation with diversification degree significantly; proportion of state owned shares, board size and management compensation all had positive correlation with diversification degree significantly. The empirical result confirmed the theoretical hypothesises and supported the explanation of diversification discount under agency theory. (c) 2011 IEEE.

This work aims to contribute to the field of research on Agency Theory, based on an approach that is different from the previous literature. It focuses on analysis of characteristics of the structure of the Board of Directors as mechanisms for control over the level of remuneration awarded to executive personnel, both in the context of "concentrated" as well as "dispersed" share ownership, with the aim of determining whether or not the postulates of this theory are applicable to both. To achieve this objective, the study is based on a sample of 80 traded Spanish companies for the period 2004-2007, to which crosscutting and panel data models are applied. The results obtained show that the characteristics that define the structure of the Board of Directors constitute efficient mechanisms for supervision and control of compensation received by Top Management, although its influence in this regard is conditioned by the concentration of ownership.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the presence of a particular financial intermediary such as venture capitalist (VCs) on the resulting governance structures. This article investigates the composition of boards of directors in VC-backed firms and analyses whether board structure has an impact on performance. Using 106 French VC-backed firms, our methodology in this paper is to estimate four equations. A regression analysis is then used to study the impact of board structure on performance and also to analyze whether board variables (size, outside directors, COE chairman duality, proportion of VC directors, proportion of employee directors and board meeting frequency) are significant determinants of VC-backed firm performance. Results indicate a strong positive relation between board size and performance measured by ROA, Tobin's Q and MVA and negative relation between board size and performance measured by ROE. The proportion of independent outside directors on the board was positively associated with ROE. The presence of a dual leadership structure is negatively associated with ROE and positively associated with other measure of performance. No strong relation was found between the proportion of venture-capital in board, the presence of employee in board, or board meeting frequency and firm performance. Venture capitalists may have a more important role to play in corporate governance. By creating boards with low number of member and with greater independence, venture capitalists play a role in mitigating principal-agent problems and improve performance. The involvement of VCs in the entrepreneurial firm may be able to create value. This paper contributes to the limited literature by establishing the important role of venture capitalists in board structure. Other contribution is to use a French VC-backed firm in the sample. This is the first paper to study French context in regard of impact of board structure on performance. (c) EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2011.

Drawing on Agency Theory this article investigates the relationship between board size and European firms' performance. The focus is on the implicit differences between financial and non-financial firms. In particular the paper addresses the following questions: does board size influence firm performance? Is financial intermediaries' corporate governance different from that of non-financial companies? The study analyses the governance of the largest listed European companies which make up the Eurotop 100 index. Companies come from 12 different countries and are subject to different regulatory and self-discipline codes. Referring to the Eurotop index the focus is on the relation between the overall size of the board of directors and the level of performance measured as Tobin's Q and Return on Assets. Diverging results emerge depending on the typology of the firm. In particular, results suggest that for non-financial companies large boards negatively influence firm performance, whereas financial intermediaries seem to be different because of the non-relation between their board size and performance.

The study investigates the change in performance of French public firms post to their Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and its relationship with the changes in the managerial ownership around the time firms to their IPOs. We develop three hypotheses: (1) Agency theory, (2) Entrenchment, (3) Curve-linear link between managerial ownership and firm performance. Tests are conducted on a sample of 65 companies going public during 2000 to 2006 on the Paris stock exchange. Overall, we observe an average decrease in managerial ownership and accounting performance two years after going public. The majority of our results show there is a significant negative relation between post-IPO change in performance and equity detention by the managerial ownership. Therefore, the most of the results are opposed to the predictions resulting from the assumption of agency (alignment of interests) but contribute to retain the entrenchment hypothesis and specially the assumption of the timing in the sense that it is beneficial for manager to plan the introduction at a time when performance is particularly high to ensure its success. This facilitates later, his entrenchment. Accordingly, a steeper decline in performance after IPO for the group of companies, where owner-managers hold a large share of ownership. Some of our results support the alignment of interest hypothesis. (c) 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Stock options are theoretically adopted to better align the interests of the managers and shareholders, thereby reducing agency costs, and consequently increasing corporate performance. The critical question is whether stock options have this impact in practice. Consequently, this study investigates if stock options attribution has impact on corporate performance of Portuguese listed firms on the Euronext Lisbon. The results suggest that stock options grant is negatively related with firm's performance. Hence, this study corroborates the rent extraction hypothesis, the crowding-out hypothesis and the multi-tasking effect, which suggest that stock options may affect adversely firm's performance.

The family firm preparing generational change, the partnership that welcomes new partners, and the shareholders of a firm that chooses to go public are making decisions that will have an impact on strategy and management. Conversely, a change in strategy such as a move to diversify or a decision to take on more risk in a business can make the firm more attractive to some shareholders and less attractive to others and is therefore not ownership neutral. Opening the black box of agency theory, Korine and Gomez show how management and ownership interact to shape the strategy of the firm. In their view, the critical question to ask is not what is the best strategy, but rather, who is the strategy for? With numerous detailed examples, Strong Managers, Strong Owners is an invaluable resource for company owners, board members and executives, as well as their advisors in strategy and governance.

This study investigates the impacts of family presence and board independence on corporate financial performance in 131 large listed firms from India, an emerging economy dominated by the presence of large business groups having concentrated ownership. Family presence includes the extent of family ownership and appointment of family CEO and family chairperson. Employing a multiple linear regression model, this study first detects a positive relationship between family ownership and financial performance. Second, a negative relationship is found between family CEO and firm performance, indicating that family firms with non-family CEOs perform better than firms having family CEOs. Third, the proportion of Board outsiders ' (i.e. independent non-family directors) is found to have no significant relation to financial performance, thus challenging agency theory's need for independent monitoring in family firms to enhance performance. These results are interpreted in the context of historical Indian family business practices and modern changes.

A considerable amount of research has been done on the figure of the CEO, approaching it from many angles. Our analysis focuses on the role played by the independent director in the supervision and turnover of the chief corporate executive. In the process, we have carried out a comprehensive reflection on the independent director, consulting the latest literature and including the results of the most recent empirical evidence. We have noticed that the role of the independent director often goes beyond the tasks that are usually considered specific to this function, namely, supervision of the company's senior management. However, the directors' independence cannot be built by requirements. It is a personal quality of the individual that transcends the various problems raised by agency theory. We believe that correct CEO supervision can only be effectively undertaken if the independent directors have these personal qualities. It seems that companies with a larger number of independent directors are more likely to replace the CEO when performance is not as expected. This can only happen if the independent directors enjoy effective independence.

This paper examines the specificities of the governance system in Tunisian companies through the remuneration policy for executives, the board and the ownership structure in the period before the revolution. The purpose of this work is to identify possible dysfunctions and subsequently propose ways of to rehabilitate governance mechanisms and optimize their effectiveness. The agency theory identifies the necessary conditions for effective controlling. Empirical validation on a panel of 30 Tunisian companies listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange and observed for two years (between 2008 and 2009), Shows firstly that the policy of executive compensation is not a mechanism for effective governance, and secondly that the impact of internal control mechanisms on performance, through its components, seems mixed.

This study considers the legitimacy of shareholder activism as a means of exercising influence in the corporate decision-making process and identifies self-reformed boards as a superior solution to the issues that activists attempt to address. We conceptualise the board of directors' role as representing the interests of multiple principals. When any one principal is able to serve its own interests by influencing corporate decision-making through shareholder activism, other principals' interests may be compromised. We argue that a better long-term solution lies not with activist shareholders, but with culturally reformed boards. We suggest a set of self-reform initiatives that would help them to achieve their potential. We develop a conceptual framework for the arguments in favour of boards taking a leadership role in corporate engagement with shareholders and stakeholders. To the extent that boards are unable to implement self-reform, governments may need to develop public policy initiatives for corporate governance reform. (c) 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Through the lens of agency theory, the paper examines the conflicts of interest arising among the actors (citizens, Local governments, private shareholders, service providers, etc.) that, at various levels, are involved in local public utilities governance systems. The main results of a multiple case study analysis on ten Italian listed local public utilities are summarized by identifying different and co-existing situations of conflict of interest among multiple principals and agents. Although governance mechanisms (e.g., the board of directors) have different roles and functions and may prevent and mitigate such conflicts, our findings pointed out that various problematic issues exist. First, the effects of the ownership structure on board composition and functioning needs to be further explored. Second, higher numbers of independent directors do not mean actual board independence. Third, service charters as tools for promoting transparency, accountability and public participation are not well implemented yet. The chapter contributes to the debate on local public utilities governance suggesting possible agency theory developments by focusing on different forms of citizens' participation (e.g., co-production).

Although much has been written about creative accounting we can see repeated processes and financial crisis in which allegations are directed toward professional accountants. These practices are considered as distort reported financial statements and basic aims of accounting regulation. The objective of this paper is to highlight aspects regarding creative accounting, connecting this issue with the corporate governance and motivational theories context. In order to achieve this aim our research includes two stages. First consisted in finding information about creative accounting, our start point being the context of the international scandals. The second stage consisted in making an introduction to the theory of agency. The utility of such research contributes to the insurance of the premises for the development of future research, looking to test the reaction of the professional accountants in our country, regarding the phenomenon of creative accounting.

An agency theory perspective is adopted to explain the high levels of non-compliance with recommendations concerning board structure of the Australian Stock Exchange's (ASX) Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations. The study compares groups of compliers and non-compliers drawn from members of the ASX All Ordinaries Index. The results indicate that, in the presence of mitigating factors such as less complexity, higher levels of managerial ownership of equity and higher ownership concentration, entities are less likely to comply with the recommendations on board independence. The results suggest that the compliance decision might be influenced by mitigating factors that reduce the need for board independence.

Combining insights from the agency theory and sociopolitical perspectives, this study examines the extent to which factors such as ownership structure, CEO power, and firm performance influence firms' adoption of board independent reform advocated by shareholder activists. Event history analysis using extensive data on 1083 Standard & Poor's 1500 companies from January 2002 to December 2004 shows that firms with more powerful CEO were less likely to adopt supermajority-independent boards, while both poorly performing firms and large firms were more likely to adopt such board structure. We also find that higher institutional blockholder ownership increased the likelihood of the adoption in firms managed by less powerful CEOs, while external non-institutional blockholder ownership decreased the likelihood of the adoption.

There is a world trend to reinforce the regulation of financial markets and of public sector enterprises, as a means to protect the interests of the principal. One way to reduce investor exposure is to improve corporate governance practices in businesses which use public funds. This article analyses the following questions in the light of the agency theory: Will best corporate government practices protect investors? Are there differences in the short and long term? Does regulation designed to improve corporate government help to improve and capital structure? In the long- and short-term in the Mexican financial market, and globalization, privileged information and convergence between Mexican businesses and their foreign counterparts seem to have an influence on risk and yield.

In this article, we examine the empirical association between corporate governance (CG) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement by investigating their causal effects. Employing a large and extensive US sample, we first find that while the lag of CSR does not affect CG variables, the lag of CG variables positively affects firms' CSR engagement, after controlling for various firm characteristics. In addition, to examine the relative importance of stakeholder theory and agency theory regarding the associations among CSR, CG, and corporate financial performance (CFP), we also examine the relation between CSR and CFP. After correcting for endogeneity bias, our results show that CSR engagement positively influences CFP, supporting the conflict-resolution hypothesis based on stakeholder theory, but not the CSR overinvestment argument based on agency theory. Furthermore, firms' CSR engagement with the community, environment, diversity, and employees plays a significantly positive role in enhancing CFP. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The present work summarizes the theoretical foundations and empirical findings regarding the relation between family involvement and firm performance. From a theory-based perspective we integrate evolutionary psychology and agency theory and describe how conflicting predictions can be made regarding the relation between family involvement and firm performance. Similarly, we describe how the empirical landscape is equally conflicted. Findings from this meta-analysis summarize the observed effects from multiple studies and provide an estimate of the relation across the entire population. Results illustrated that family involvement did not significantly impact firms' financial performance (r= .006). Based on these data, there is no relation between family involvement and a firm's financial performance. Furthermore, we examined multiple conceptual and methodologically-based potential moderating influences-none was statistically significant. Overall, these findings provide the foundation for multiple new areas of inquiry as the domain of family business studies evolves. Moving forward, we advise future research in this area to search for additional moderator effects and explore the defining characteristics, other than performance, that make family businesses distinct from non-family businesses.

We build on a stakeholder-agency theoretical perspective to explore the impact of particular corporate governance mechanisms on firm environmental performance. Our empirical evidence shows that several important corporate governance mechanisms such as the board of directors, managerial incentives, the market for corporate control, and the legal and regulatory system determine firms' environmental performance levels. These results suggest that these different governance mechanisms resolve, to some extent, the existing divergence of interests between stakeholders and managers with respect to environmental activities.

Purpose: The paper aims to explain how agency theory can be used to inform our understanding of the dynamics surrounding supply chain behaviours and relationships. Design/methodology/approach: A structured review of the literature using a three-stage refinement process is used. The articles were sourced through online databases and keyword classifications, such as "agency theory", "principal-agent relationships" and "supply chain management". The search initially identified over 86 articles. After further screening these were reduced to 19 for final assessment and comparison. Findings: Despite agency theory's prevailing descriptive and predictive qualities there is scarcity in its application to the SCM discipline. The authors posit that agency theory provides valuable insights for relationship engineering within supply chains where social, political, legal and behavioural dynamics dominate. Practical implications: It is a critical task for managers to understand and mitigate abnormal behaviours across the supply chain. Agency theory serves this need by providing them with a useful tool to respond to transaction cost dilemmas through contractual and non-contractual remedies. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies that examines the current state of agency theory application in the SCM literature and suggests potential avenues for future research.

Purpose: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, the study aims to link board demographic diversity and independence to corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from various sources for a sample of 475 publicly traded Fortune 500 companies between the years 2007 and 2008. Findings: It is found that board gender diversity is positively related to institutional and technical strength ratings, while board racial diversity is positively related to institutional strength rating only. Both the proportion of outside directors and CEO non-duality were negatively associated with institutional and technical weakness ratings. Research limitations/implications: The sample was predominantly large, publicly traded national and international corporations, which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Management personnel should be cognizant of how board configurations and leadership structure may influence their corporate reputation for social responsibility. Efforts should be made to foster a group dynamic that is conducive to effective board functioning. Originality/value: Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between board characteristics and corporate social performance. This study contributes to the literature by examining such associations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The prevalence of ownership concentration in Asian firms presents a challenge to the influential agency theory-based understanding of the role of corporate boards. In this paper we develop and test hypotheses about board attributes and firm performance that reflect Asian institutional conditions. We present the first meta-analysis of the relationship between board attributes and performance of Asian firms using a varied set of meta-analytical techniques on a database of 86 studies covering nine Asian countries. First, we find that board structure and composition preferences are influenced by the identity of the concentrated owner. Second, consistent with US data, we find very limited evidence of a direct relationship between board attributes and firm financial performance in the Asian context. Third, we find that the relationship between board structure and composition and firm performance is mediated by the revealed strategic preferences of Asian firms specifically by the level of R&D investment.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: In this paper we discuss three assumptions of agency theory: (1) conflicts of interest between principal and agent, (2) nature of risk, and (3) the proposed internal mechanisms to reduce agency costs. We review criticisms of agency theory's pessimistic assumptions of human behavior and its simplistic view about individual risk preferences to argue how the context may influence both the interest and mechanisms for aligning interest of principals and agents. Research Findings/Insights: We draw on alternative theoretical perspectives from behavioral and organizational sciences to describe circumstances under which honesty, loyalty, and trust in agents' behaviors are possible and also the development of cooperative rather than contentious relationships. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study explores the boundary conditions of traditional agency theory in the hope of extending agency theory outside its current contextual boundaries. In doing so, we provide a more robust and exhaustive view of the economic exchange between principals and agents. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to managers about how intrinsic incentives may provide an alternative mechanism of control over agents' behavior to extrinsic incentives prescribed by traditional agency theory. Indeed, intrinsic incentives of personal satisfaction and identification with organizational objects, combined with implicit social obligations and reciprocity may, under certain circumstances, provide stronger restraints on agent opportunism than the use of traditional extrinsic rewards in the form of incentive alignment.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We investigate how ownership structure, board characteristics, and regional differences in law enforcement and stock market development affect the conflict of interest between majority and minority investors in Chinese listed firms. For this purpose, we study related-party transactions as well as labor redundancy, and classify firms as either state- or private-controlled. Research Findings/Insights: We find that related-party transactions grow more extensive as the wedge between the controlling shareholder's control rights and cash flow rights increases. Related-party transactions also rise with voting rights held by the government in state-controlled firms. Next, the state as controlling shareholder exacerbates labor redundancy. The control rights of the second to tenth largest investors can offset expropriation. Regarding board characteristics, we find that a larger fraction of directors affiliated with the dominant owner enlarges related-party transactions, while large boards also increase labor redundancy in state-controlled firms. We find only weak evidence that higher-quality institutions help to restrain expropriation of minority investors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: In Chinese listed firms, a major conflict of interest arises between majority and minority investors. Also, the state may exercise its control rights to achieve imperative social and political objectives, to the detriment of external investors. Yet, as the stock market valuation and financial performance of state-controlled firms rise with the fraction of shares held by the state, future research should better delineate the conditions under which state ownership is either detrimental or beneficial to firms. Next, the results indicate that governance mechanisms suggested by conventional agency theory are deficient in Chinese listed firms. Future research could therefore establish more clearly when internal and external governance mechanisms are likely to work, thereby also taking into account the identity of the controlling shareholder. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Investors should be aware that expropriation in Chinese listed firms has specific implications when the state is the controlling owner. Also, at this stage of development, independent directors and external governance mechanisms can hardly protect the best interests of minority investors. Rather, expropriation is counterbalanced when voting rights are concentrated in the hands of other large block holders. Policy makers should work on ownership restructuring, board independence, and institutional quality to better protect minority rights in Chinese listed firms. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

We offer an institution-based view to the classic inquiry on the relationship between family business and firm performance, which has been dominated by traditional theories such as agency theory and the resource-based view. Specifically, we argue that institutions define family business characteristics such as ownership concentration and family management, and also affect the performance of family business. Our research contributes to a reconciliation of prior inconsistent findings and calls further attention to the embedded nature of family business in institutions.

Grounded in agency theory, this study explores how capital structure is influenced by aggregate corporate governance quality. We measure governance quality using broad-based comprehensive governance metrics provided by the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). The empirical evidence reveals a robust inverse association between leverage and governance quality. Firms with poor governance are significantly more leveraged. It appears that leverage substitutes for corporate governance in alleviating agency conflicts. Further, we utilize empirical methods that control for endogeneity and show that poor governance quality likely brings about, and does not merely reflect, higher leverage. Our results are important as they show that the overall quality of corporate governance has a material impact on critical corporate decisions such as capital structure choices. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: To what extent can group faultlines and their potential value-destroying effects be detected on corporate boards? Task-related attributes of the type of directorship, education, board tenure, and financial background of board members are considered as directors' characteristics that give rise to the faultline phenomenon. The impact of task-related faultlines on firm performance as well as the moderating effects of busy boards, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) tenure, executive directors' (EDs) compensation structure, and the average non-executive directors' (NEDs) involvement in board committees are examined. Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel of FTSE 350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find a strong negative effect of task-related faultlines on firm performance. Further exploration of the moderating effects demonstrates that the condition of a busy board and CEO tenure exacerbate the negative effects of faultlines. At the same time, the executive pay contingency is found to have a remedying effect on boardroom cohesiveness, whereas the involvement of NEDs in board committee work is not likely to make the adverse effects of board faultlines less pronounced. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the arguments of social identity theory, this study shows that task-related faultlines on corporate boards have strong negative value-creating implications. The positive moderating impact of the executive compensation structure renders support to agency theory predictions about executive incentive alignment. This work also underlines the usefulness of the concept of faultlines in the corporate governance literature, because unitary boards, where NEDs and EDs share board responsibility, exhibit pre-existing factions, similar to top management teams of family-controlled firms and teams managing international joint-ventures. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This research points to the importance of a careful selection process of directors by nomination committees. It also underlines the role for active leadership on boards, who should be aware of available strategies to ameliorate the negative consequences of board schisms, such as accentuating superordinate board identity and/ or informal meetings.

Corporate governance research indicates that corporate boards of directors may be overly beholden to management, which can be detrimental to firm value creation. Drawing upon agency theory and the governance law literature, we examine the effects of a new SEC rule designed to lessen managerial power by increasing large, long-term shareholders' influence in the director nomination process. We predict and find support for a positive overall market reaction to the rule's announcement as well as a greater reaction for firms with characteristics that suggest compromised board independence or greater CEO control. Moreover, we examine the implications of greater shareholder voice for another key stakeholder group, firm bondholders, and find evidence that it is also value increasing. We conclude by discussing important implications for theory and practice. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Plural forms exist when managers use two owners to perform one activity. Franchising is a plural form explained by agency theory, however, the theory is unable to explain two franchisor actions: 1) allowing franchisees to own multiple outlets and 2) co-locating company-owned and franchised outlets. We use research that describes a symbiosis between company-owned and franchised outlets to extend agency theory and explain these actions. Our investigation of ownership patterns among 4,339 outlets of 16 plural form franchisors is consistent with our theory that multi-outlet franchising is cost efficient and that co-location occurs when franchisors fill market gaps left by franchisees.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the relevance of currently accepted best practice recommendations regarding board structure on the survival likelihood of new economy initial public offering companies. We argue that industry context determines governance outcomes. Research Findings/Insights: We study 125 Australian new economy firms listed between 1994 and 2002. Each firm is tracked until the end of 2007 for monitoring their survival. We find that board independence is associated with an increase in the likelihood of corporate survival. We also find that the benefits of board independence increase at a decreasing rate. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The standard best practice recommendation of board independence stems from the monitoring role of directors and is based on agency theory. The results from our study suggest that the recommendation regarding board independence does not work well for new economy firms. While the agency theory based model implies a monotonic relation between board independence and performance, our research suggests that the relationship is nonlinear. This variation occurs because of increased monitoring costs faced by outsiders due to higher information asymmetry and complexity of new economy firms. Our empirical results suggest that inside directors play a complementary role to outsiders in mitigating firm failure. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research offers insights to policy makers who are interested in setting best practice standards regarding board structure. Our research suggests that firm/industry characteristics play a crucial role in determining the optimal board structure. In firms/industries where outsiders face significantly higher information processing costs, insiders can play a valuable complementary role to outsiders in enhancing the effectiveness of the board. Thus future hard or soft regulations related to board structure should consider industry context. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

How do managers react in an environment where bribery is likely to bring high rewards, but also presents high risks? We examine the supply side (firms' illicit payments) of bribery in a global setting, using the United Nations' (UN) Oil-for-Food Program, part of UN sanctions on Iraq. Some companies helped Iraq circumvent UN sanctions through bribe payments in the form of illicit surcharges. Our transaction-level analysis of factors affecting bribe payments draws on the economic theory of crime, agency theory, and home country institutions. Results suggest that firms pay larger bribes when there are stronger financial and managerial incentives, but pay less when their home countries have implemented the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. We find little relationship between a widely used country-level corruption perception index and firms' actual bribery. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Although research on corporate entrepreneurship (CE) has attracted increasing attention, risks of CE are not well examined. In this paper, we examine direct and indirect agency risks associated with providing middle and operational managers with autonomy in the hopes of encouraging CE. The key ideas behind our discussion involve two dilemmas of CE. (1) To solve the risk-averseness problem of middle and operational managers and unleash their entrepreneurial ideas, top management needs to encourage autonomous behaviors, which can also exacerbate a different type of agency problem: opportunistic behaviors. (2) Although the generation of new ideas to explore new strategic directions and/or opportunities is important, the very newness of the ideas make them difficult to evaluate, and thus the selection process may be perceived as unfair by some managers. We propose that (a) stock options, (b) passive monitoring, and (c) perceived procedural justice would attenuate the negative side effects associated with CE, such as opportunistic behaviors and perceived unfairness. Although research in CE often stresses autonomy of middle and operational managers for new idea generation as important, examining the whole process in terms of idea generation, selection, and implementation with respect to potential risks will extend the CE literature.

We use agency theory to investigate the influence of CEO dominance on variation in capital structure. Due to agency conflicts, managers may not always adopt leverage choices that maximize shareholders' value. Consistent with the prediction of agency theory, the evidence reveals that, when the CEO plays a more dominant role among top executives, the firm adopts significantly lower leverage, probably to evade the disciplinary mechanisms associated with debt financing. Our results are important as they demonstrate that CEO power matters to critical corporate outcomes such as capital structure decisions. In addition, we find that the impact of changes in capital structure on firm performance is more negative for firms with more powerful CEOs. Overall, the results are in agreement with prior literature, suggesting that strong CEO dominance appears to exacerbate agency costs and is thus detrimental to firm value.

Corporate political activity (CPA) represents a strategy whereby firms attempt to influence government policymaking, to advance their strategic goals; firm owners may benefit from it. However, other research indicates that CPA is uncertain and increases information asymmetries between owners and managers. Hence, this study avoids the assumption that owners and managers have similar views regarding CPA and focuses on the relationship between institutional investors, large investors' ownership and investors' portfolio characteristics on firm CPA. The results reveal that institutional ownership is associated with reduced CPA among S&P 500 firms across five election cycles, but that investors' portfolio concentration is associated with increased CPA. The implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Recent perspectives on community investments suggest that they are opportunities for firms to create value for shareholders and other stakeholders. However, many corporate managers are still influenced by a widely held belief that such investments erode profits and are therefore unjustifiable from an agency perspective. In this paper, we refine and test theory regarding countervailing forces that influence community-based firm performance. We hypothesize that high levels of available slack will be associated with higher community-based performance, but that this relationship will be moderated by three important governance variables: board independence, investment fund ownership, and CEO ownership. We find support for our hypotheses in longitudinal study of a large sample of U. S. corporations. (c) 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This study draws on agency and stewardship theory to evaluate the relationship between alternative governance regimes (founder versus non-founder CEO) adopted at the time of going public on post-IPO economic outcomes in the market for corporate control. We find that the presence of founder CEOs reduces the likelihood of post-IPO change of control but enhances target IPO firm wealth by increasing acquisition premiums. Additionally, we examine whether measures of CEO power over the board moderate the relationship between founder management and target IPO firm wealth. Our results suggest that CEO duality is the most effective instrument of CEO power available to founder CEOs to positively influence target firm wealth. Further, we find that while founder CEOs utilize power derived from CEO duality to increase acquisition premiums, non-founder CEOs use board leadership power to expropriate shareholder wealth.

This paper examines venture capital (VC) governance in innovation processes. The VC literature often presents the relationship between a VC firm and a start-up as dyadic and analyzes it with agency theory. In contrast, this paper deploys the resource interaction framework presented in Hakansson and Waluszewski (2002) to governance and innovation in networks. The paper reports an in-depth case study of Pyrosequencing, a Swedish biotech firm financed with VC. The results from this study reveal how the relationship between a VC and a start-up company is embedded in a wider network and how the governance of the VC spreads in the surrounding network and influences a start-up's possibilities to develop organizational and technical resource interfaces to critical counterparts such as suppliers and customers.

We investigated the effect of financial incentives on performance in a professional organization. Whereas agency theory treats tangible rewards such as money as a potentially powerful motivator for improving performance, the professional control perspective posits that the motivational effects of financial incentives will depend on the intended recipients attitudes toward the incentives relative to their professional values. The study setting was a large network of physician practices that adopted a financial incentive program to improve physician performance in the management of diabetic patients. Consistent with agency theory, performance did improve following the introduction of the incentive. However, consistent with the professional control perspective, physicians' psychologically based attitudes toward the incentive program regarding its impact on their own work autonomy and the importance of the performance goals moderated the effect of the incentive on performance. Study findings indicate that agency theory and professional control are complementary theoretical perspectives for understanding how professionals will respond to the imposition of performance-related financial incentives. In terms of practice, pay-for-performance programs aimed at professional organizations should be designed to take into account the values and goals of an organization's professionals to maximize the effect of financial incentives on performance.

Family firms without able and willing family successors are frequently sold to non-family managers through management buy-outs (MBOs). Whether MBOs create value is thought to be dependent upon the ability to reduce owner-manager agency costs. In this article we examine the agency costs of MBOs that acquire family firms. We contribute to theory by arguing that in such situations, value creation by reducing agency costs will depend upon pre-MBO agency costs, the ability to solve the double agency problem, and the relationship between the cost of agency control mechanisms and the residual losses from opportunism before and after the MBO.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We explore the effect of family control on investment-cash flow sensitivity and disentangle the effects of agency problems of free cash flow and asymmetric information. Excess control rights and board independence may moderate the relationship between family control and investment-cash flow sensitivity by changing agency costs. Research Findings/Insights: Family control lessens investment-cash flow sensitivity by mitigating the problem of asymmetric information. Investment-cash flow sensitivity will be higher in family-controlled firms with excess control rights because Type II agency problems predominate. Family control may affect investment-cash flow sensitivity when firms lack independent directors. Having another blockholder in addition to the controlling family reduces the agency problem and improves the independent monitoring function of the board for family-controlled firms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides a better understanding of the relationship between family control and investment-cash flow sensitivity. It delineates the separate effects of agency problems stemming from free cash flow and asymmetric information and demonstrates that excess control rights and board independence can moderate the effect of family control on investment-cash flow sensitivity. We show the significant role another blockholder plays in internal governance mechanisms. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Investors can better gauge firm value by examining the type of company control and linkages between investment distortion and firm value. Policy makers can better understand how excess control and board independence act as mechanisms to worsen or mitigate the effects of family control. Managers can understand the effects of control type and board independence on the firm's financial constraints. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Research Question/Issue: What determines venture capitalists influence on the governance of firms? How do venture capitalists shape the governance of their investees? Are venture capitalists governance practices consistent across countries? These important questions are under-investigated in the extant literature. In this study, we shed light on the effects of venture capital investors on a large set of governance decisions and we discover the existence of striking cross-country differences. Research Findings/Insights: We test our conjectures on a unique hand-collected questionnaire-based dataset of 164 companies in five countries and two regions (Europe and the US). Our empirical results show that there is a strong and positive relationship between VCs' funding and their influence on some factors like decisions on CEO hiring, executive compensation, board decisions and appointments. Employee incentives are also positively related to the proportion of VC funding. On the other hand, results show that the proportion of VC funding is only marginally significant in explaining VC influence on strategy direction and investment planning. Our analysis though, offers a remarkably different view after splitting data into European and American subsamples. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results provide a novel view of the functioning of the Venture Capital industry and its degree of pervasiveness in the management of portfolio companies. Adopting a unique dataset, we add new evidence on detailed governance decisions, thus supporting the idea that the incremental contribution of a professional investor to a new venture is largely exceeding the capital infusion only. Finally, we show that governance decisions exhibit significant country effects. This evidence supports the view that a global theory of corporate governance cannot rely on a single interpretation framework such as agency theory, but needs to be integrated with predictions from alternative views such institutional theory. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Corporate governance is the essential mechanism allowing proper management of financial and corporate resources by aligning incentives of employees and investors, thus enabling oversight and control on companies. Yet, corporate governance rules and mechanisms are costly and have different effectiveness across countries. Our results provide guidance to investors in selecting the appropriate set of governance provisions conditional on a set of investment-specific factors. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into efficient entities has been an important approach in transition economies. However, the transition literature reveals little about how control structure affects firm performance of transformed SOEs. Drawing on agency theory, we distinguish three modes of control in transformed SOEs: state-controlled, dispersedly controlled, and privately controlled modes and argue that actual control after transformation plays a critical role in determining performance. Examining the impact of different control modes in China, we find that the key is who controls the transformed firm. Non-state-controlled (dispersedly controlled and privately controlled) firms are more likely to have enhanced post-transformation performance and reduced agency costs than state-controlled firms.

Over the last thirty years, the shareholder conception of corporate governance has established itself as the foundation of the power structure and management principles of the corporation. It is based on a specific theorization of the firm: agency theory. Our aim is to explain the full significance of this theorization, by considering the context in which it was developed and the project - of a fundamentally political nature - that it conveys. For that purpose, we return to the questions raised during the first half of the twentieth century, in the seminal book of Berle and Means and in subsequent works by Berle; questions of a much broader scope that the relationship between shareholders and managers. We will show that agency theory can be considered a response to the most important ideas advanced by Berle and Means, and then by Berle (and others), after the New Deal and the Second World War. Comparison of these two themes of reflection leads us to identify two theorizations, and two radically different conceptions of the firm and the corporation. To address these issues, we start by considering the questions raised in the early twentieth century about the nature of the corporation and the status of managers; and how, in response to these questions, Berle constructed a certain conceptualization of the corporation and of managerial capitalism; we shall then revisit the contract-based approach of Jensen and Meckling, to assess the theoretical and ideological content and show how it was actually strongly opposed to Berle's vision. Lastly, by way of conclusion, we shall endeavor to show how the opposition between these two theorizations should be seen, above all, as an opposition between two theories that are both "performative" rather than positive, and that the apparent success of agency theory and the dominance of shareholder primacy in corporate governance can only be understood in an institutional and political perspective.

This paper attempts to identify the effects of several variables on the international expansion pursued by Spanish service franchise chains. These include: management and franchising experience, brand awareness, the international franchise ratio, and a franchisor's size. Specifically, the study looks at 125 franchisors doing business in 44 foreign countries in late 2009. Findings allow us to conclude that management and franchising experience, together with brand awareness, the international franchise ratio and company size are significantly associated with (i) the number of countries where the chain has a presence; (ii) the number of operational outlets the franchisor has abroad, and (iii) the number of years the chain has been operating overseas.

This paper investigates the effect of new governmental regulations on corporate Boards of Directors (BODs). We have reviewed the literature pertaining to agency theory and resource dependency theory, both of which have been assumed to explain the actions of BODs. We examine the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory regarding both the structure and actions of BODs in times of governmental regulatory change. We then describe four historical events in which radical changes were required by certain governmental regulations, and discuss responses by BODs to each event, and present a discussion of these responses and how they adhere to or stray from the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory. We conclude the paper with recommendations for the direction of further study.

Venture capitalists (VCs) increasingly rely on elaborate formal contracts and incentivization through share ownership to manage their relationships with the entrepreneurial firms in which they invest. This study analyses the impact of a high degree of such 'neoclassical contracting' on entrepreneurs' trust in their VC backers. The results from a sample of 86 Dutch entrepreneurial firms indicate not only that a high degree of neoclassical contracting tends to erode entrepreneurs' trust in their VCs, but also that the use of more informal, relational contracting fails to moderate the negative association between a strong focus on neoclassical contracts and trust. However, entrepreneurs do welcome some level of monitoring, which highlights the enduring tension between trust and control, and the need for VCs to strike a productive balance.

The "China concepts stock" in the U.S. has attracted a great deal of attention among international investors due to the fast growth in Chinese economy. This paper examines the aftermarket performance and the motivations to list in the U.S. for Chinese firms over 1993-2010 by considering the great impact of split-share structure reform in China. We find that the Chinese firms in the U.S. generally underperform the benchmark and industry peers in the post-IPO period of 3 years. The Chinese cross-listing ADRs show superior performance relative to the single-listings in the long run. It seems that more stringent listing requirements and accounting standards help to improve the corporate governance and operating performance of the Chinese firms. The evidence also supports that the Chinese issuers are motivated to cross-list in the U.S. due to over-investment incentives, leverage effects or free-cash-flow signaling, which is consistent with agency theory and signaling hypothesis.

We analyze the determinants of capital structure and its choice by small and medium-sized enterprises in Central and Eastern Europe from 2002 to 2007. We test the relevance of the three main theories: the Static Trade-off Theory, the Pecking Order Theory, and the Agency Theory, which have been derived primarily for developed markets, because our knowledge on their validity for emerging European countries is limited. We confirm the positive impact of size and asset tangibility on the leverage, while rejecting both the positive impact of profitability and tax, as well as the negative impact of business risk and non-debt tax shields. We report that SMEs behave homogeneously, and the relevant capital structure determinants show remarkable steadiness. Our results show a special time varying behaviour, in which the relevant determinants become stronger, while most of the country-specific factors present weakening effects. We argue that firms of the CEE countries remarkably converged their financial decision-making procedure to that of developed countries through the investigated period. The relevance of the Trade-off Theory is weak, as firms respect a one-sided upper threshold rather than converging to a fixed target on both sides, while they are not indifferent to the hierarchy of financing alternatives.

Making agency theory institutionally sensitive is a reasonable suggestion, as far as normal science stands. However, we argue that such a move has already been taking place, that it cannot address important problems with agency theory, and that the time is ripe for a critical re-examination of this theory. We suggest that inductive studies can not only be more sensitive to institutional features than deductive studies, but they can also offer deeper understanding of governance practices in specific contexts, as well as the potential for analytical or moderatum generalizations. Drawing from legal theory, we offer an alternative conception of the principal, and of the role and status of the board of directors. We contend that this reformulated agency theory has a greater potential of being institutionally sensitive because it recognizes various stakeholders as team members, rather than just adding specific institutional features as variables to the dominant conception of agency theory.

This paper contributes to the capital structure literature by investigating the determinants of capital structure of Australian Real Estate Investment Trusts (A-REITs) over the period 2006-2009. By using a panel approach and a Global Financial Crisis (GFC) dummy variable, our analysis incorporates the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) shock which appears to have affected the market after December 2007. We find that A-REIT size, profitability, tangibility, operating risk and number of growth opportunities impact similarly to many previous studies of international entities upon the degree of leverage. We also find mixed support for prevailing capital structure theories of Pecking Order, Trade-off and Agency Theory, but find that Market Timing Theory can be rejected over our sample period. With specific focus after onset of the GFC, we find that the relationship between capital structure and our independent variables is somewhat distorted. Consequently, the postulations of theory also become distorted whereby changes to capital structure come about because of the primary goal to survive, rather than managerial opportunism.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates two questions: (1) What is the relationship between organizational complexity and auditor choice, and (2) Does auditor choice influence the relationship between organizational complexity and firm value? Research Findings/Insights: Examination of a sample of large public US companies reveals a positive association between auditor quality and various proxies for organizational complexity. We also find a positive association between organizational complexity and firm value when the complex firm hires Big N auditors. The results are robust to alternative measures of auditor quality and firm value and to controls for the regulatory environment. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The results extend the agency theory argument that agency costs resulting from information asymmetry between managers and investors affect the demand for external monitoring by auditors, specifically the demand by organizationally complex firms for higher quality audits. We also shed light on how the value enhancement of a complex organization depends on auditor quality. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings offer new perspectives for managers of complex firms that are industrially or geographically diversified. They can use the retention of a larger auditor as a credible signal that their consolidated reports are more informative about their financial performance. Further, the findings provide new insight into the value that investors place on auditor quality when they assess the value of firms with complex organizational structures.

The goal of this paper is to determine the factors that explain voluntary improvements in audit committee activity, independence and financial expertise, both individually and jointly, within a corporate governance environment other than those used in previous works. These audit committee characteristics have been selected because previous authors have found that these attributes improve the effectiveness of this monitoring committee. The findings included a relatively high level of the proxies of audit committee effectiveness for those companies which display the best practices in terms of their board of directors' independence and activities. At the same time, we observed a non-linear relationship of substitution among internal control mechanisms, management ownership and audit committee characteristics. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose - This paper aims to extend and contribute to prior UK research on the association between information asymmetry and dividends propensity. It seeks to investigate the impact of the number of analysts following firms, a proxy for information asymmetry, on dividends propensity. Design/methodology/approach - Using a 282 UK FTSE-All Share non-financial/non-utilities firms with fiscal year ends on 2007, the paper uses a multiple regression model to investigate the association between dividends and analysts following. Findings - The paper finds that after controlling for firm-specific characteristics, there is a significant negative association between the number of analysts following firms and dividend propensity. The finding suggests that higher coverage of financial analysts for UK firms reduces levels of information asymmetry between managers and shareholders, which results in lower dividend propensity. These findings are consistent with agency theory and pecking order theory, but inconsistent with signalling theory. Originality/value - The paper contributes to prior research related to the drivers of dividend propensity by being the first UK study to examine the association between dividend propensity and information asymmetry.

This paper investigates the impact of corporate board diversity on the financial performance of Nigerian quoted firms using a panel data of 122 quoted Nigerian firms. The aspects of board diversity studied comprise board nationality, board gender and board ethnicity. The Fixed Effect Generalised Least Square Regression is used to examine the impact of board diversity on firm performance for the period: 1991-2008. The results show that gender diversity was negatively linked with firm performance, while board nationality and board ethnicity were positive in predicting firm performance. The study provides insights for practitioners and policy makers on the need to view the board as a strategic resource in line with the resource dependency theory instead of viewing the board solely from agency theory perspective.

Purpose: Since the initiation of the share split reform by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) in 2005, the private placement has become the major source of raising equity after IPO. The purpose of this paper is to investigate why listed firms in China prefer private placements compared to other options of raising capital. Design/methodology/approach: The ordinary least squares regression, the piecewise regression and the cross-sectional regression analysis were undertaken to investigate the determinants and characteristics of the seasoned-equity offerings announcement effects. Probit regression analysis was taken to estimate the probability of a firm choosing private placements. Findings: The authors find positive significant announcement abnormal returns for private placement. The findings also indicate that operating performance deteriorates immediately after announcement and poor operating performance is more likely to be contributed by large size portfolios, which suggests size effect. Research limitations/implications: The paper's evidence contributes to an understanding of the wider implication of the share split reform undertaken by the CSRC. Practical implications: The paper provides insights for policy makers in China and around the world who have and wish to adopt similar practices within their jurisdictions. Similar research can be conducted in other emerging markets to enable better understanding and implications of seasoned equity offerings on firm financial performance. Originality/value: The paper is novel in regard to the data and the wider research paradigm used. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to revisit the determinants of audit committee activity in UK listed companies after over a decade since the last investigation of this matter and with numerous significant changes in the regulatory and corporate governance framework globally. Design/methodology/ approach - Underpinned by agency theory, the study undertakes a multiple regression analysis of listed companies in the UK in order to determine the determinants of the activity of the audit committees in these companies. Findings - The study finds that audit committee activity is an increasing function of boards' independence and diligence. Interestingly, it also finds a significant negative relationship between audit committee activity and ownership structure. A higher number of large shareholders with at least 3 percent of the firm's issued equity share capital are associated with a decrease in a committee's activity. Audit committee expertise, size and the availability of an audit committee charter were not significant determinants of audit committee activity. Research limitations/implications - The findings from the study suggest the need for more research into the factors that can explain the determinants of the activity of the audit committees in the UK and elsewhere. It also opens up the discussion on the effects of changing global corporate behaviors on corporate governance mechanisms. Practical implications - This study shows that there is a positive relationship between board independence and the activity of the audit committees. In other words, to improve the performance of the audit committees in UK listed companies, board independence should be increased. There also seems to be substitution between governance mechanisms. The presence of large shareholders slowed the activity of the audit committees, as evidenced in a significant negative relationship. Originality/value - The study revisits the determinants of the audit committees after over a decade since the initial investigation in the UK. However, the study is undertaken in a very different context with far-reaching changes in the corporate landscape and regulations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper studies whether enhanced regulatory supervision of the banking system strengthens the debt contracting mechanism between borrowers and lenders in emerging markets. Specifically, we investigate: 1) whether the borrowers' accrual-based earnings management behavior is more negatively associated with the magnitude of their bank loans after the government strengthens the monitoring on banks, and 2) whether the enhanced supervision is more effective for firms controlled by the state, the major economic player in most emerging markets. Research Findings/Insights: Using China's 2003 banking reform as a natural experiment, we find that borrowers' earnings management behavior becomes more negatively associated with loan size after the reform. The association is more significant for state-owned borrowers and lenders, consistent with the prediction that although the state-owned parties face lower barriers to collusion, the reform increases the costs of side-contracting. Overall, the findings suggest that such reform is effective in enhancing banks' role in corporate governance in a transition economy. Theoretical/Academic Implications: To date, most corporate governance studies are based on the standard principal-agent theory that analyzes contracting between only two parties. For this reason, the standard agency theory has had limited success in explaining economic developments in emerging markets, where the economy is characterized by high levels of government intervention (i.e., a third party), which creates the possibility of collusion. We study debt contracting in an emerging market by adopting the theory of collusion, an extension of the traditional principal-agent theory to multi-agent settings, such as one in which there are one principal and two agents, one of whom plays the role of supervisor. Our results show that, consistent with theoretical predictions, monitoring by the government (i.e., the principal) of banks (i.e., the supervisor) has an impact on the relationship between banks and borrowing firms (i.e., the agents). Practitioner/Policy Implications: Previous research on corporate governance in emerging markets, which has focused on the disciplining role of the equity holders, has documented that corporate governance is rather weak. As private lending is the most widely used type of financing in emerging markets such as China, this paper takes a different view and shows that private lending has increased its influence on firms' corporate governance since a banking reform. The results confirm that the debt contracting mechanism between companies and banks has developed since such a reform. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: This paper seeks to examine the differences between executives and investors in the perception of determinant factors in executive compensation. Design/methodology/approach: From a survey instrument comprised of archival executive compensation determinant items, a factor analysis is performed to examine the construct determinant perceptions unique to executives and non-executive investors. Findings: The authors find differences in factors between executives and non-executive investors in a manner expected by agency theory. Non-executive investors place greater weight on factors related to performance and less weight on human capital factors, while executive investors place greater weight on human capital factors in determining executive compensation. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited in that the sample may not be representative of the population of chief executive officers or shareholders in the USA. Practical implications: Differing factors suggest that there is a misalignment of measures desired to be the foundation of executive compensation. The differing measures used to potentially motivate agents (executives) by principals (investors) results in an agency cost. Originality/value: The authors have documented a difference between executives and investors in factors desired to determine executive compensation. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This article analyses the appointments of outside directors to family firm boards within a sample of 423 observations (year/firm) regarding Italian publicly listed companies. The aim is to test predictions which suggest that efficient performance of control and service tasks by outside directors has positive effects on a company's capacity to raise capital and to grow. Unlike agency theory, which affirms that independents are efficient when performing functions of control, this article suggests that the adoption of outside directors who are also independent has no effect. The results of this research demonstrate that outside directors who have close ties with banks maintain valuable social capital with bankers in periods when such social capital is threatened by large investment policies requiring a great amount of bank financing.

Boards have become increasingly independent, to the point where some firms have removed all of the insiders except for the CEO. The authors call this phenomenon a "lone-insider board" and submit that it constitutes a fundamentally distinct governance arrangement worthy of inquiry. This paper describes institutional pressures that give rise to increasing reliance on loneinsider boards, and investigates likely outcomes. According to agency theory, the greater the proportion of independent directors, the more effective boards are in monitoring CEOs. The authors submit, however, that a lone-insider board creates a fundamental shift in board effectiveness due to a loss of mutual monitoring and an increase in information asymmetry. Mutual monitoring occurs when members of the top management team actively monitor the CEO. Information asymmetry refers to the disparity in knowledge between the CEO and the board of directors. The authors propose that reduced mutual monitoring causes increased information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and increases rather than decreases CEO power. The authors hope this article will stimulate fruitful inquiry in the area of lone-insider boards.

The aim of this paper is to analyze to what extent business growth opportunities influence decisions on bank debt. This objective is addressed by considering both the arguments of the positive agency theory and the institutional characteristics of the Chilean financial system. An empirical analysis considers the GMM system estimator applied to panel data of quoted Chilean firms for the period 1997 to 2008. The main advantage of this methodology is that it overcomes the heterogeneity and endogeneity problems. The main finding supports the hypothesis of the existence of a non-monotonic U-shaped relationship between growth opportunities and the level of bank debt. The initial negative relationship is explained by the costs associated with underinvestment problems, whilst the increasing part which reflects the positive relationship among growth opportunities and bank debt is based on the arguments of overinvestment costs. This result is robust to a number of alternative measures of growth opportunities. (c) 2012 de Cladea.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

We examine the corporate governance environment of smaller listed Australian firms to investigate the factors that determine how firms respond to recommendations contained in corporate governance codes. We group corporate governance recommendations into three distinct categories and argue that differences in adoption costs between categories, together with firm specific factors, determine a firm's decision to conform with the recommendation or to explain the reasons for non-conformance. Analysis of the conformance by smaller firms with governance recommendations highlights substantial differences in adoption rates between categories of recommendations. Our results also reveal that the cost of adopting specific recommendations, together with profitability, external audit quality, and ownership dispersion, jointly explain a firm's decision to 'comply or explain'. This study provides insights for policy makers and regulators regarding the appropriateness of corporate governance recommendations for smaller firms.

In the modern economy, a division of labor is a division of knowledge. The challenge of limited information and goal conflict within organizations takes on special salience in the presence of technology. In order to manage technical managers, general managers and executives must judge proposals beyond their direct knowledge. Technical managers may, through opportunism or overconfidence, suggest overinvestment in technology. Analyzing a dataset of information technology hardware and staff spending by large multidivisional firms during a growth phase of US IT spending, results suggest that technical managers significantly overspent on hardware, with negative consequences for performance. Chief executive experience significantly altered the effects of overspending. Solutions to the problem of monitoring technical managers are suggested, including socialization, auditing, and incentives. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The paper deals with development of a general theory of the firm. It discusses the demand for such a theory, reviews existing approaches to its generalization, and offers a new variant of general theory of the firm based on the contract theory. The theory is based on minimization of opportunistic behaviour determined by the material structure of production (a classification of ten structural factors is offered). This framework is applied to the analysis of three boundaries problems (boundaries of the job, boundaries of the unit, boundaries of the firm) and five integration dilemmas (vertical, horizontal, functional, related, and conglomerate).

Since risk plays a role in setting dividend policy and granting stock options to directors, the paper investigates the effect of director compensation structure on the riskiness of the firm's investment strategy by examining the firm's dividend payout policy. The results imply that stock options to outside directors increase the firm's appetite for risk and suggest that director stock options constitute a major incentive to changing corporate policies. The results also indicate that director stock options align the risk preferences of managers and directors. Finally, the results suggest that stock options do not motivate directors to act opportunistically in setting investment and payout policies. (c) 2012 The Clute Institute.

This article serves two purposes: to review how the agency and real options perspectives inform us about the venture capital staging decision, and to examine whether the staging decision differs between domestic venture capitalist (VC)-led and foreign VC-led investment projects. The article proceeds as follows. First, it reviews how agency theory informs venture capital staging decisions and analyzes whether domestic VCs and foreign VCs differ in using staged financing to address agency concerns. Then it considers how real options theory informs venture capital staging decisions, and examines whether domestic VCs and foreign VCs differ in using staged financing to tackle project-specific uncertainty and market volatility. It discusses the methods for the empirical test and presents empirical results. It concludes with a discussion of the study for research and practice. (c) 2012 by Oxford University Press.

I have never met Lynn Stout. Of course, just like any person even remotely interested in corporate governance and US corporate law, I know her insightful writings. But I do not know her personally. I know for a fact, however, that Lynn Stout is a nice person. And an excessively nice person she must be. Her paper on New Thinking on "Shareholder Primacy" talks about the surge of a new paradigm in corporate law. This is an excessively generous thesis. For we are not witnessing the takeover of an old science by a new one explaining facts better than the old stuff. We are witnessing the surge of a scientific analysis of the legal structure of the firm -and of the role of corporations to structure firms- which is replacing an ideology; not a science. This comment will comment on this ideology and the insightful critique developed by Lynn Stout in her paper. (c) 2012 Convivium. All rights reserved.

Agency theory is used to explain many firm marketing activities. However, its assumptions are founded in characteristics of North American actors, particularly in the United States. As such, it is not surprising that work employing agency theory in other national contexts often fails to find support. Taking a comparative institutional approach, this article theorizes how the human assumptions and prescriptions of agency theory differ across countries by utilizing the three pillars (i.e., regulative, normative, and cognitive) set forth by institutional theory. In particular, attenuations of the human assumptions of self-interest, risk-aversion, and bounded rationality of agents are theorized to influence goal alignment, risk sharing, and information processing in the agency relationship and in turn, effect prescriptions of governance and contracting given by the traditional agency model. A series of research propositions are developed to provide insight into the contractual implications in the principal-agent relationship across different institutional contexts. The theoretical attenuations presented provide guidance for marketing academics and practitioners engaged in cross-national agency relationships. (c) 2012, Academy of Marketing Science.

The purpose of this paper is to add a meaningful critique to the existing audit committee (AC) literature by providing (i) a critical analysis of the AC literature grounded on agency theory; (ii) a discussion of the emerging new theories of AC, which investigate the people serving on and working with ACs, and (iii) a description of the relationship between these two groups of literature. A number of qualitative AC studies have provided new insights by investigating the actual people serving on and working with audit committees. This review paper summarizes these findings and provides a comparative evaluation with the agency theory-based AC research. This review documents, among others, that the attributes of ACs, as measured by the quantitative literature, have hardly been reflected by qualitative investigation, whereas qualitative analysis of the data contributed by people who have actual experience of ACs questions the fundamental propositions, not only of why ACs exist, but also how they function. This paper provides a cross-examination of the afore-mentioned two paradigms of literature on AC effectiveness and invites corporate scholars to reflect on the differences between the two groups of AC studies.

This present work is an exploratory analysis of network governance models that are characterised by widespread distribution of decision-making and control, auditing and supervisory functions in company structure, frequently through stakeholder engagement in the management system. In the study, we verify the way in which NG can involve stakeholder representatives in the governance bodies and in the decision-making process, also preventing opportunistic behaviour of management, according to the stakeholder-agency theory. A case study of network governance is presented regarding the Spanish cooperative Eroski - a self-governing organisation, with direct participation by representatives of the various stakeholder categories in the main governing bodies. In the conclusions, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the network governance system and its implications for theory and practice and we describe an incremental approach, on an entirely voluntary basis, for implementing this governance model in other corporations, including non-cooperative ones.

This paper presents a critical analysis of the choice and design of executive pay incentive scheme arrangements implemented at the time of a company's initial public offering. Using a unique sample of 311 entrepreneurial companies over a five year period ( 1998-2002) it discovers that 172 companies implement executive share option schemes for the first time at their initial public offering. Taking this sub-sample, the paper evaluates and analyses the strategic choices made with regard to incentive pay schemes by the board of directors at this crucial time in a company's development. It finds that company's choices are split between schemes that have performance targets linked to reward and others that are contrary to the guidelines of the UK's Corporate Governance Code and best practice. Furthermore, it shows company characteristics that affect schemes and elaborates on the configuration of incentive schemes in respect of three critical elements: the performance target, comparator, and target level requirement for the shares to vest. In light of this, it proposes strategic reasons as to how these schemes might be set for initial public offerings and proposes that explanations for implementation are not underpinned by traditional agency theory but linked to a resource based view of the firm.

This study seeks to empirically examine the effect of ownership concentration on mitigating free cash flow agency problem in New Zealand. Following Jensen's (1986) argument that managers have incentives to misuse free cash flows, this study tests whether concentrated ownership structure helps alleviate such a problem or exacerbates it. A natural consequence of this agency problem will be overinvestment and other operational inefficiencies which are likely to have a detrimental impact on firms' future performance. The second objective of this paper is to examine the association between FCFAP conditional on ownership concentration on future firm performance. We measure free cash flow agency problem as the product of positive free cash flows and growth opportunities proxied by Tobin's Q and find that financial institution-controlled ownership structure in New Zealand is positively associated with free cash flow agency problem. We also document that free cash flow agency problem conditional on ownership concentration negatively affects future firm performance. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of the degree of control of large shareholders on the relation between dividend payout and firm value creation. From the perspective of agency theory, dividend payout is highly appreciated for firms subject to highly agency problems. Using a sample of 275 firm-years listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange over the period 1998-2007, our results show that contrary to agency theory predictions, dividend payout of Tunisian firms contributes more to value creation when the firm has low agency conflicts. We find a positive and highly coefficient for the payouts of firms with shared control and with majority financial institution control. These results may be interpreted through the trust assigned by Tunisian investors to firms that have low agency problems. Our results also indicate a strong positive relationship between the return on assets, the level of debt and firm value. Finally, we document a negative relationship between the financial business sector and firm value. (c) 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

This research work is aimed at determining whether there are any informational asymmetries between the presidents and the members of collegial bodies in Chilean universities. The framework of agency theory, in which the president of a university plays the role of agent while the collegial body serves as principal, assumes that this kind of asymmetry exists. The methodology was based on a closed-ended questionnaire where respondents had to demonstrate their knowledge of supposedly basic topics related to management performance. The results provide compelling evidence confirming the agency theory, which contends that an agent holds more information than a member of a collegial body, and, if internal, the member's knowledge exceeds that of external members.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of both firm-specific and external factors on the risk taking of European insurance companies. The extent of risk taking is quantified through variations in stock prices and these are explained by firm-specific and external factors that proxy the environment in which the insurers are active. Using a two-way panel regression analysis with fixed and random effects, our empirical study covers hand-collected data on 35 German and UK insurance companies for the period 1997 to 2010. We find that differences in company size, capital structure, liquidity, and economic development affect variations in stock prices. The analysis also highlights differences between the market-based UK corporate governance system and the control-based regime implemented in Germany, with the UK exhibiting a higher level of risk, compensation, and board independence. We also document increases in the volatility of insurance stock returns during the financial crisis. (c) 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to measure the degree of the managerial entrenchment and to study its impact on the performance of the firm. The model of the entrenchment's degree is based on both the personal characteristics of the manager and on the ownership structure of the firm. According to our empirical studies carried on 815 firms during the period 2001-2004, the entrenchment's degree depends significantly on the age and on the tenure of the manager as well as on the relative power of the managerial ownership. Moreover, the relationship between the managerial entrenchment and the performance of the firm is not linear. It takes the form of a harmful entrenchment then of a beneficial one as the entrenchment's degree increases. This result shows that the managerial entrenchment is not always harmful to the shareholders' wealth. Empirically, by exceeding a certain critical level (0.81), the managerial entrenchment becomes beneficial to the shareholders. (c) 2014 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

This article contrasts three views or paradigms of the business enterprise and of critical management issues regarding governance. The first two are the agency and contracting paradigms. These dominate most discussion of the governance of corporate activities. The third is the capabilities perspective, which is starting to gain attention in the literature. Agency theory highlights how incentives should be crafted and governance activities focused to bring about better performance for shareholders when ownership and control are separated. Transaction cost economics highlights, as does agency theory, the importance of opportunism. But it adds asset specificity considerations that are also relevant to organizational design choices, including governance mechanisms. The capabilities perspective focuses less on managing opportunism and more on harnessing and managing opportunity. In that sense, it is closer to the essence of capitalism.

This chapter considers the legitimacy of shareholder (also known as investor) activism as a means of exercising influence in the corporate decision-making process and identifies engaged boards as a superior solution to addressing issues that activists attempt to address. Drawing on ideas from multiple principal agency theory, the board of directors' wider role is conceptualized as representing the common interests of multiple principals who have both common and divergent interests. When any one principal is able to serve its own interests by influencing corporate decision-making through shareholder/ investor activism, other principals' interests may be compromised. A set of initiatives available to boards is suggested that focuses on the social dimension of their strategic governance role in mediating among multiple stakeholders to address their concerns while at the same time working towards the long-term sustainability of the business. The chapter highlights the application of multiple principal agency theory to the context of corporate governance, along with other concepts relating to the social dimension and the emerging relational perspective on board competence. From these perspectives it is proposed that the board takes a proactive role in leading this type of engagement, while at the same time recognizing that directors will need better relational skills than has traditionally been expected of them in fulfilling their fiduciary responsibilities.

This study investigates the effect of government ownership structure, business risk and financial leverage among other variables (size, age and growth) on a company's performance in a panel data, using 191 companies from five GCC countries (Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait), during the period 1999- 2006. Our results indicate that government ownership affects the performance and value of GCC firms. Government ownership positively and significantly affects firm's performance ROA. The insignificance of a firm's leverage (LEV) indicates that the firm's performance is irrelevant to its capital structure, and that supports Modigliani and Miller (M&M) (1958) argument. Our finding is that business risk (BETA) significantly and positively affects firm's performance ROE and supports the classic risk trade-off arguments. Furthermore, age was found to have a positive and significant impact on firm's performance ROA and ROE. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory and propose that cross-national comparison of corporate governance should consider how the nature and extent of agency relationships differ across different institutional contexts. Building on prior governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory we argue that performance outcomes of boards of directors, ownership concentration, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Institutions may also affect the extent of complimentarity/substitution among different firm-level governance practices producing patterned variations in firm-level governance mechanisms. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational outcomes of various governance practices.

Taking an agency theory perspective of managers as risk averse and self-interest seeking and focusing on externally generated analyst forecasts as the performance target, we propose that managers tend to cut R&D expenses when they are under pressure to meet analyst forecasts, especially when they face an increase in employment risk after missing the forecasts. We further argue that analyst coverage can serve as an external monitoring mechanism to help contain this agency problem. We test these arguments with data from a sample of U.S. manufacturing firms during the period of 1979 to 2005. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Despite increased attention given to family firms in the theory of organization and management, the value of family governance in emerging markets is not clearly understood. We draw insights from agency and institutional economics perspectives to address the debate on whether family governance fills or abuses the void left by weaker market and legal institutions. We propose a dual focus on the pattern of family control and weak institutions to reconcile these opposed assessments. We analyze how various combinations of family control over ownership, strategy, and operations yield different benefits and costs for the operational performance of firms in the absence of strong market and legal institutions. The uneven development of market institutions across industries and the impact of independent directors reinforce the importance of separating different patterns of family control. We find support for our hypotheses when tested on a data set consisting of all publicly listed firms in Taiwan between 1996 and 2005. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of family businesses in emerging markets, highlights the importance of weak institutions in shaping relative agency costs, and illuminates the differential effects of independent directors.

This article aims to increase our understanding of family firms' entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior by looking at the differences between family and nonfamily firms and by studying variations among family firms. We find empirical support for a positive influence of a nonfamily CEO on the family firm's level of entrepreneurial risk taking during the initial years of his or her CEO tenure and a leveling out of entrepreneurial risk taking as the CEO tenure of the nonfamily CEO is extended. We build on the concept of psychological ownership to explain these new findings. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

In this study we investigate how the dispersion of family ownership among family members affects the performance of small-to-medium-size family firms. Based on agency theory and prior research on family firms, we develop arguments pointing to the existence of a U-shaped relationship between the degree of family ownership dispersion and firm performance. We also consider the involvement of family members in top management as a moderating factor of this relationship. The empirical analyses conducted on 494 small-to-medium size private family firms in Italy support our hypotheses and offer further evidence about curvilinear relationships between family ownership and family involvement in management, and performance. Overall, our study represents a theoretical synthesis and extension of the effects of family involvement on the performance of small-to-medium size private firms. It adds empirical evidence to this stream of research, offers new insights into the sources of heterogeneity among the population of family firms, and paves the way for future investigations on other organizational outcomes, especially firm growth, in family firms.

Several unique characteristics of ventures distinguish them from public firms and lead to distinctive monitoring issues. In this article I develop a theoretical framework that links the attributes of the venture and the board composition with venture board monitoring and its implications for firm performance. Contributing to the strategy literature on corporate governance, the framework offers counterintuitive deviations from how agency theory is typically conceptualized, highlights that an unexpected "principal problem" could emerge as the separation of ownership and control is reduced, and presents novel insights about the interdependence between agency theory and resource dependence theory. This framework also adds to the research on entrepreneurial firms by complementing the extant emphasis in the literature on resource provisioning and by offering a richer view of key actors through opening the black box of strategic action in ventures. More broadly, by focusing on an underexamined but important context beyond public firms, this article highlights rich opportunities for developing a contingency theory of corporate governance.

Principals who delegate tasks to agents face the perennial challenge of overcoming agency problems. We investigate whether feelings of ownership among senior managers in the absence of formal ownership can align agents' interests with those of principals, thus turning agents into psychological principals. Using a moderated mediation model, we find that psychological ownership is positively related to company performance through the mediating effect of individual-level entrepreneurial behaviour. We also find that the effect of psychological ownership on individual-level entrepreneurial behaviour and, ultimately, company performance is weaker for high levels of monitoring compared to low levels. These findings offer important contributions to agency, psychological ownership, and entrepreneurship literatures.

Purpose: This study aims to measure the extent of mandatory and voluntary risk reporting and investigate the impact of competition, corporate governance and ownership structure on risk reporting practices in annual reports of Egyptian companies. Design/methodology/approach: A number of theoretical perspectives including proprietary cost, agency theory, stakeholder theory, political cost, signalling theory and legitimacy theory are used to derive research hypotheses and identify the potential determinants of risk reporting practices in the annual reports of Egyptian companies. The annual reports of 105 listed companies for 2007 were examined to measure the extent of risk reporting and examine potential determinants of risk reporting. An unweighted disclosure index, based on Egyptian Accounting Standards (EAS) 25, has been used to measure the level of mandatory risk reporting while content analysis - sentence approach - is used in coding voluntary risk reporting. Multiple regression analysis is used in evaluating the relationships between competition, corporate governance, ownership structure and risk reporting. Findings: The results indicate a low level of compliance with mandatory risk reporting requirements. A low extent of voluntary risk reporting with a tendency to report more backward-looking and qualitative risk disclosure compared to forward-looking and quantitative risk disclosure is indicated. Agency theory and proprietary cost provide explanations for the variation of risk reporting in corporate annual reports. It is suggested that competition, role duality, board size, ownership concentration and auditor type are key determinants of risk reporting practices in Egypt. Research limitations/implications: The scoring and classification process suffers from inherent judgment limitations and subjectivity, which cannot be entirely eradicated. The study applies a cross-sectional approach and examines risk reporting practice and its determinants at one point in time. However, longitudinal research may provide a better understanding of risk reporting practices of Egyptian companies. The use of only one proxy of competition is one of the limitations of this study. Practical implications: The findings regarding mandatory disclosure level and nature of voluntary risk disclosure should be on concern to regulatory authorities and standard-setters. Originality/value: The study aims to contribute to risk reporting research through addressing not only mandatory but also voluntary risk reporting in emerging economies in general and Egypt in particular. In addition, examining the impact of competition on risk reporting is a main contribution of this study. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study addresses a major gap in our knowledge about the allocation of information technology (IT) decision rights between business and IT units at the application level, including the governance of applications delivered on-premise versus those delivered with a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. Building on the findings from a multicase qualitative study of organizations that had adopted the same SaaS application, we draw on three theoretical lenses (agency theory, transaction cost economics, and knowledge-based view) to develop a theoretically grounded model with three organization-level factors, three application-level factors, and application-level IT governance. Hypotheses derived from the model, as well as a set of differential hypotheses about factor influences due to on-premise versus SaaS delivery, are tested with survey responses from 207 firms in which application-level governance is operationalized with two dimensions: decision control rights (decision authority) and decision management rights (task responsibility). Three antecedents (origin of the application initiative, scope of application use, business knowledge of the IT unit) were significantly associated with application governance postimplementation, and the on-premise/SaaS subgroup analyses provide preliminary evidence for the mode of application delivery as a moderator of these relationships. Overall, this study contributes to a growing body of research that takes a more modular approach to studying IT governance and provides theoretical explanations for differing application-level governance designs.

Drawing on a framework from agency theory, we examine the relation between the decision-making power of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and the financial performance of 468 United Kingdom (UK) publicly listed companies (plcs) using a dynamic panel data estimation method for the six years 2003-2008. We measure CEO power using a 'power index' which captures the extent to which the autonomy of the CEO to make unilateral decisions could influence firms' financial performance. To test for robustness, our analysis is conducted using different measures of financial performance. Our results reveal that, consistent with previous UK research, CEO power, as defined by CEO-Chair duality, CEO-tenure and CEO share ownership, is negatively related to financial performance. We also find that concentrated ownership is inversely related to the performance of UK plcs. CEO's compensation and board structure, however, do not appear to be related to the financial performance of the UK plcs. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Driven by the ongoing discussion of corporate responsibility, growing numbers of companies have been publishing what have become known as sustainability reports. These reports have in part been subject to voluntary external assurance. Although the percentage of assured reports is significant, the market for this kind of assurance is still in an early stage of development. In this context the present article will ascertain the theoretical determining factors in the demand for voluntary external assurance and subject these in relation to the markets in Germany, the Netherlands and Great Britain to empirical analysis. In the context of the development of hypotheses shaped by agency theory, the constructs of agency costs and signalling can be distinguished. Variables measuring these constructs will be examined. It can be shown that the type and scope of the reporting (i.e., the choice of the Global Reporting Initiative 'application level'), the existence of a sustainability department, and the size of the company are associated with the demand for voluntary assurance. Additional control variables are examined. Here it appears that the demand for external assurance is highest in Great Britain. Finally, research opportunities in this field will be indicated and recent normative developments briefly sketched. (c) 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

This study explored sport governance practice from the lived experience of one informant spanning a 30-year period in the governance of two sport organisations (basketball and cricket). Hermeneutic phenomenology, the methodological framework used for this study, seeks to grasp the everyday world, and draw insight and meaning from it. The method involves a series of in-depth interviews with one research participant, supplemented by document analysis. Interviews were analysed using an interpretative process which blended the world views of both the participant and researchers. The participant lived through an era of increasing professionalisation within sport. His narrative, which tapped into his governance expertise at state, national and international levels, provides insights into the transition from an amateur to a commercial culture, referred to in this paper as 'two worlds colliding'. From this narrative, three related themes were identified and labelled, 'volunteer and cultural encounters'; 'structural encounters'; and 'adversarial encounters'. In drawing on hermeneutic philosophy, and highlighting that which has been hidden from view, direction for future research and practice within the sport governance domain is offered. These directions invite scholars to think about future sport governance research as it relates to federated structures and how collaborative governance theory can sharpen the focus in this domain.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Direct transfer (Type I tunneling) means that the controlling shareholders transfer resources from the firm for their own benefit. This study aims to investigate the impact of internal and external governance mechanisms from the perspective of principal-principal (P-P) conflicts on Type I tunneling. Research Findings/Insights: Using hand-collected data comprising 117 Chinese listed companies with 540 firm-year observations during 2001-2005, the results show that state ownership and the number of board of directors' meetings are positively correlated with Type I tunneling, whereas the number of independent directors reveals a negative association. Other internal governance mechanisms including foreign ownership, the size of the board of directors, supervisory board size, number of professional supervisors, and the number of supervisory board meetings were found to have no impact. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Several implications can be drawn. First, this study has modeled tunneling using a well-accepted theoretical perspective - agency theory of P-P conflicts. But the results show that agency theory does not appropriately explain tunneling behavior in China and so institutional theory is suggested as an alternative theoretical perspective for future research. Second, corporate governance reforms relating to supervisory boards have not been sufficient to ensure that they properly fulfill their role of oversight. Rather, such supervisory boards are perhaps playing more of a "rubber stamp" role. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study recommends prescribing the legal responsibilities and obligations for two-tier boards in the Chinese context, allowing them to undertake their duties diligently.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on the financial performance of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) listed firms. Design/methodology/approach: Relying on a sample of 95 UAE listed firms affiliated to financial and non-financial sectors, the paper performs a cross-section regression analysis to test whether there is a significant relationship between governance mechanisms (voluntary disclosure, CEO duality, board size, board committee and audit type) and UAE firms' performance while controlling for firm size, industry type, firm listing years and leverage. The paper relies on data published on year 2008 and utilizes the accounting-based measures of Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) as well as the market measure (Tobin's Q) in order to measure the UAE firms' financial performance. Findings: The empirical results show that voluntary disclosure, CEO duality and board size are significantly influencing the UAE accounting-based performance measure, while none of the governance variables significantly affects firms' market performance measure. The results also reveal that firm size is the only control variable that significantly influences firms' performance. This paper provides evidence showing that the accounting-based performance measures are more objective in the years where unstable economic conditions exist. Practical implications: The paper's findings indicate that the underlying principles of corporate governance are applicable in emerging markets. The findings are important to regulators, investors, managers, and researchers aiming at developing new policies that establish better regulatory infrastructure that increases investors' confidence and attracting foreign investment. Originality/value: The paper is one of very few studies that examine the relationship between corporate governance and firms' financial performance under economic turbulent in an emerging market economy, the UAE.

A significant amount of research has examined firms' decisions to adopt poison pills; however, firms today are increasingly repealing or allowing poison pills to expire. Based on agency theory, the authors examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than substitutes. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

This study examines relations between the overall level of effective information technology (IT) governance and five commonly advocated individual mechanisms of IT governance. It extends the examination of individual IT governance mechanisms to include a wider number of mechanisms, justifies the mechanisms investigated via agency theory, seeks to relate these mechanisms specifically to a perceived overall level of effective IT governance in organizations, and attempts to mitigate the problems of limited generalizability and selection bias by employing a survey and generalized sampling research methodology. The results from a survey of professional auditors reveal significant positive relations between the overall level of effective IT governance and three IT governance mechanisms: IT steering committees, senior management involvement in IT, and corporate performance measurement systems. Ex-post sensitivity analyses reveal that the primary findings are qualitatively similar across internal auditors and external auditors, as well as information systems auditors (IS) and non-IS auditors.

This study examines if Chief Executive Officer (CEO) duality reduces the firms' agency cost in Bangladesh. The agency costs are measured as two efficiency ratios: 'expense ratio' and 'asset utilization ratio'. The finding is that, there is no significant relationship between CEO duality and agency costs. These findings imply that, duality may have given the CEOs enormous powers; it may have reduced the check and balance or board's ability to exercise the governance (monitoring) function, which is not helpful to enhance firm efficiency. This study contributes to the global debate on CEO duality and provides a new avenue of knowledge on CEO duality and firm efficiency in the context of an emerging economy.

Can internal corporate governance mechanisms (such as boards of directors) and external corporate governance mechanisms (such as institutional reform) promote risk-taking behavior in family firms? This paper argues that conflicts between majority and minority owners, known as principal-principal conflicts, and cronyism in the board of directors affect firm risk taking. Moreover, institutional corporate governance reform to appoint outside directors may not have an immediate effect on reducing these problems. Based on a sample of family firms in Taiwan, we find that outside directors reduce the negative relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking. However, when their influence is examined further, it is found that in those sample firms that went public after institutional reform, outside directors did not improve the relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: Given its position as a dominant logic in corporate governance, this paper evaluates the theoretical and practical implications of agency theory on good governance. Agency theory is presented as consisting of two layers, one resting on the assumption of oppositional shareholder-manager interests and the other resting on the assumption of supportive shareholder-society interests. Given the dominance of the simple economic depiction of agency theory, its first layer is heavily researched and supported, while the second layer is largely unsubstantiated and often exploited to obscure inefficiencies in the first layer. Research Findings/Insights: Agency theory is shown to fill a highly institutionalized position in governance, despite often violating the second layer's assumption of aligned shareholder-society interests. We assert that the relationship between societal benefits and value maximization must be reconceptualized from interdependent to correlated but independent. Otherwise, when the second layer of agency theory is undercut, shareholders can eschew their role as societal guardians to partner with managers and engage in mutual managerialism at the expense of society. We detail how inefficiencies in first layer mechanisms (market regulation, monitoring, and contracts) impact agency theory's second layer and present the new mechanisms of oversight boards and expanded founding firm documents to reintegrate a societal orientation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Aligned shareholder-society interests are shown to be frequently undermined, artificially substantiating the second layer assumption that societal betterment can be sufficiently promoted via financial rewards and sanctions. We discuss agency theory's underlying logic and present the possibility that a violated second layer can be exploited to obscure first layer inefficiencies. Ineffectiveness in the first layer's key mechanisms is shown to potentially undercut agency theory's promotion of good corporate governance on an organizational and societal level. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Oversight boards and expanded founding firm documents are presented to make agency theory's second layer explicit, ensuring the assumed supportive nature of the shareholder-society relationship is substantiated. Specifically, oversight boards formalize how members of boards of directors are vetted, oversee societal claims to ensure that appropriate ones are sufficiently presented and addressed, supervise reporting, and sanction firms who fail to enact these duties. Revised founding documents ensure that both economic and social goals are enshrined in the mission of incorporated firms. Together the two help establish the foundation of a measurable approach to socially responsible actions. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of corporate governance on auditor quality choice by IPO companies in an emerging market setting. It seeks to identify whether efficiency or opportunism is the driving force behind the choice of auditors in Bangladeshi firms going public. We try to see whether ownership concentration in the hands of a owner-CEO wins over foreign shareholders in the contest of ensuring financial reporting quality. Design/methodology/approach - Multivariate analysis has been carried out on all IPOs made during 1990 to 2005 whose financial statements were available. Logistic regression tool has been used to identify client's corporate governance attributes affect their choice of auditors. In total, three corporate governance attributes - CEO-Chair duality, retained ownership, and foreign equity participation - were used to test the impact of ownership structure on auditor choice. Findings - Our findings from logistic regression suggest that CEO-Chair duality and the degree of foreign equity participation are significant determinants of auditor choice while proportion of board ownership is not. In addition, issuer size and whether the issuer is a green field operation also influence auditor choice while the length of a firm's operating history does not seem to matter. The findings support agency theory prediction that (at least one category of) principals (foreign shareholders in this case), are likely to trade-off higher monitoring costs (of hiring a higher quality auditor) with agency costs arising from asymmetric information, primarily borne by absentee owners. Originality/value - The work is based on empirical data directly from company financial statements. It uses audited financial statements and makes objective analysis of auditor choice dynamics in a frontier market that demonstrated significant growth of IPO activity in recent years.

This work reports on an investigation of the dynamics of governance over breakthrough innovation within Fortune 1000 firms. The primary research question investigates the boundary of agency theory within the firm. Using agency and stakeholder theoretic perspectives, the study tests the hypothesis that innovation will thrive in firms that combine a board of directors operating in accordance with a high agency theoretic focus in addition to an innovation governance board operating deeper within the firm that employs a strong stakeholder theoretic orientation in its behavior. The model is tested with data from 98 large firms. Results suggest that the relationship between board of directors' behavior and the firm's overall innovativeness is mediated by innovation decision-making boards that (1) promote projects that are breakthrough in scope, (2) incorporate input of diverse constituencies within the firm, (3) exhibit patience with financial results, and (4) engage in frequent, informal interactions with project teams. Firms exhibiting high board of director agency orientation in combination with loyalty to mandate, patient financial capital disposition, inclusiveness, and project team interaction as described above for innovation governance board decision-making prove to be the most innovative as measured by external indicators. For firm innovativeness, consolidated managerial power and behavior is frequently present at the upper levels of the firm, but must be broken down at deeper levels of the firm. This research offers implications to innovation decision-makers as to how to proceed if the intent is to offer commercializably successful breakthrough innovations.

The philosophy of science offers two different perspectives on how empirical findings contribute to knowledge accumulation. The "law-statement" perspective interprets contributions to the extent that empirical research confirms or refutes general axioms of theory. Alternatively, the "model-theoretic" perspective recognizes contributions from models that improve scholars' ability to represent the world of managers. Management scholars often have limited awareness of the philosophical tradition underlying the model-theoretic perspective, and, consequently, useful contributions from improved models of important phenomena may be overlooked. Drawing on model-theoretic philosophy, we identify three ways in which empirical research contributes to theoretical knowledge without necessarily verifying or falsifying theoretical axioms, through the grafting, contextualizing, and repurposing of representational models. We provide examples of each by focusing on studies investigating incentive alignment. Finally, we discuss how the model-theoretic perspective contributes to an ongoing discussion about improving theoretical precision in management research. (c) Academy of Management Review 2013.

Practice-oriented publications have recently suggested a movement in the Chief Financial Officer's (CFO) role towards a more strategic role. In a family business, the CFO position is often the first into which a non-family manager is hired. However, the role of the non-family CFO in a family business is underresearched. Hence, this article uses previous findings as well as social role theory, agency theory, stewardship theory, and the resource-based view to investigate the role of the non-family CFO in family businesses compared to that in non-family businesses. Nine propositions are developed, which suggest not only a more traditional role for CFOs in family businesses, but also fewer monitoring efforts for the CFO in this setting. The article concludes with avenues for further research and concrete future research questions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the impact of family control on French acquirers' performance.We consider a sample of 239 acquisitions undertaken by French listed companies between January 1997 and December 2006. Comparing both, short-termand long-termperformance,we find that family-controlled firms outperformnon-family firms. We find that the relationship depends on the control level. The higher operating performance of family firms is statistically significant for an intermediate level of control. Around the announcement date, family firms with a high level of control outperform non-family firms. Using the calendar time approach, we find that long-term stock performance of family firms is positive and statistically significant. Robustness tests showthat our findings seem to not be driven by the endogeneity problem. Finally, we find that family wedge, due to the use of the pyramidal structure and the double voting rules, has no statistical significant effect. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This review article seeks to celebrate the deconstruction of the mythology of shareholder value inspired by Lynn Stout, and to dismantle the hegemony of agency theory, which originated the concepts of shareholder value and shareholder primacy. In order to offer a contextualized, historical critique of the intellectual forces that created agency theory and the concept of shareholder value, the analysis presents a broad consideration of the financialization of the Anglo-American corporation in the later decades of the twentieth century. It was in this period that the Anglo-American corporation was crudely transformed from being a wealth-creating vehicle for the wider community of stakeholders and whole economy, into a bundle of assets with the sole purpose of benefiting shareholder interests. This analysis traces some of the historical critique of corporate purpose, and the wider implications of the critique for corporate activity. The article goes on to analyse the interpretations of corporate purpose emerging in modern company law reform. Finally, the article considers the implications of the growing international corporate social responsibility movement for directors' duties, which is arguably in contradiction to many of the fundamental beliefs of shareholder value, and recasts the direction of corporations towards more responsible and sustainable value creation.

This study has extended existing research on CEO power, pay structure, and firm performance, offering models based mainly on agency theory and managerial power theory, and testing hypotheses using data from 112 companies across a five-year span (2001-2005) in computer-related industry groups in the United States. The results indicated that power from executive directorship positively impacts a firm's return on assets and return on equity, and that CEO power from duality negatively impacts CEO long-term pay and total pay, while CEO power from tenure positively impacts CEO long-term pay and pay leverage, and composite power negatively impacts short-term pay. Evidence for CEO pay as a mediator between CEO power and firm performance revealed that CEO short-term pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance but negatively impacts its market value, regardless of which source of power is being controlled. CEO total pay positively impacts a firm's return on assets and international performance, with power from CEO duality, directorship, or composite power being controlled. Hence, and in general, CEO pay fails to significantly mediate the relationships between CEO power and firm performance. The contributions include a multiple-perspective study of CEO power, compensation, and firm performance to comprehensively discover each of their respective relationships. This study has further extended the debate over agency perspectives with stewardship perspectives to fill knowledge and theoretical gaps. Thus, evidence-based findings provide boards of directors with practical knowledge for sound governance with another avenue for future research in corporate governance.

We adopt a construct validity lens to provide a critical reexamination of established corporate governance research. In particular, we focus on the body of work relying on the theoretical bases of agency theory and involving boards of directors' independence, CEO duality, equity holdings, and their relationships to corporate financial performance. We offer a five-step protocol involving the following components: (1) establishing the base rate for the phenomenon in question, (2) evaluating the extent to which the dependent variables are germane, (3) evaluating the extent to which the independent variables are germane, (4) determining whether explanatory power is improved as a consequence of improved measurement, and (5) concluding whether previously established estimates should be revised. We implemented the proposed protocol and used alternative measures that reduce threats to construct validity. Results yielded substantially higher estimates of relationships in corporate governance research. Future research can adopt the proposed protocol to understand whether a similar improvement in explanatory power could be achieved in other research domains. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: The main purpose of the present research is to study the relationship between ownership concentration and the type of ownership, i.e. state, firm (legal persons), individual, family, institutional - on the value of the companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE). Design/methodology/approach: The study applies panel data regression analysis to a sample of companies listed in TSE during the period 2005-2009. Two-stage least-squares analysis is conducted. Findings: The paper finds that ownership concentration is positively related to ROE, and that ownership concentration is negatively related to ROA. Moreover, state, family, and individual ownership are negatively related to performance, and firm (legal person) and institutional ownership are positively related to performance. The paper also finds that higher firm profitability requires a more diffused ownership structure. Research limitations/implications: The results of the present research support agency theory and efficient monitoring hypothesis. The results strongly suggest the failure of state ownership in increasing companies' value and underline the importance of accelerating privatization in Iran. Practical implications: To improve the performance and consequently the value of companies, the process of privatization in Iran must be accelerated and public ownership must be transferred to the private sector. Further, investors must pay special attention to the type of ownership and ownership concentration of companies when deciding to buy their shares. Originality/value: The study builds on prior research in several ways. First, the paper offers new insights into the relationship between corporate governance and economic performance by using data from Iranians listed firms, this new evidence from an emerging market enhances the understanding of corporate governance in Asian countries. Second, the study focuses on five dimensions: ownership concentration, state, firm, individual, family, and institutional ownership which allow one to get a more accurate picture of the ownership structure-firm value relationship.

This paper reconsiders the issue of share price reactions to dividend announcements. We use the difference between the actual dividend and the analyst consensus forecast as obtained from I/B/E/S as a proxy for the surprise in the dividend announcement. Using data from Germany, we find significant share price reactions after dividend announcements. We use panel methods to analyze the determinants of the share price reactions and find evidence in favour of the cash flow signaling hypothesis and dividend clientele effects. We further find that the price reaction to dividend surprises is related to the ownership structure of the firm. The results do not support the free cash flow hypothesis. An additional result of our analysis is that dividend changes are not an appropriate measure to capture the information content of dividend announcements. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The paper discusses the ownership and control structures of local public utilities by showing evidence from the Italian case. In this discussion, the focus is on three main aspects: the ownership structure, the board composition and independence, and citizens' involvement (service charters). The main results from this study reveal that there are controversial aspects, which need further investigation. The existence of a principal-principal conflict is clearly arising from an in-depth analysis of the ownership structures. In addition, the board of directors, because of the lack of actual independence, does not seem to be a useful arena to manage and solve these conflicts. Other governance mechanisms are thus needed, to increase accountability to citizens. Within this, service charters seem to be a useful tool to protect the "public interest". However, service charters content analysis suggests that further implementation actions are due. The paper contributes to the debate on conflicts of interests and governance mechanisms in local public utilities suggesting possible developments of agency theory and discussing implications for further research.

This article examines how ownership, management and governance characteristics and the associated agency problems of family firms impact the divestment decision. Based on the divestment activity of 48 listed family firms in Belgium over a six-year period, I find an inverse U-shaped relationship between family ownership and divestment likelihood, supporting the alignment view at medium levels of family ownership but entrenchment at high ownership levels. In addition to ownership, the governance of the family firm also impacts the divestment decision. Divestiture likelihood is significantly lower when the family exerts its influence through the board of directors, consistent with the entrenchment view that they will use their influence to pursue non-economic goals. Founders, on the other hand, act as active monitors of the firm's activities and do not seem to be hindered by emotional considerations which result in more divestment activity as compared to other family firms.

This study investigates how managerial shareholding affects audit pricing for listed companies in Hong Kong. Based on agency theory, we examine the relationship between managerial shareholding and audit fees, from the perspectives of the alignment effect and the entrenchment effect. We posit a non-linear relationship, which is tested by grouping sample firms into three levels of managerial shareholding: low, intermediate, and high regions of management ownership. The empirical results reveal that the association of managerial ownership with audit fees is non-linear: managerial shareholding is significantly and negatively associated with audit fees in the low and high regions of managerial ownership, whereas the association is significantly positive in the intermediate region. These correlations are further confirmed by the results of curvilinear regression analysis. (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Based on an analysis of Swedish press material covering two corporate scandals, this paper reveals the institutional logic propagated by the Swedish press pertaining to large shareholders and the relationship between this institutional logic and the attribution of blame for the scandals to shareholders by the press. Research Findings/Insights: The results reveal an institutional logic with a clear notion of what constitutes a "real owner," which is reminiscent of an understanding of ownership and control prevalent in the literature before the emergence of agency theory. Real owners are associated with moderation of management, responsibility, long-termism, and legitimate influence in the firm. In response to scandals, this institutional logic leads the Swedish press to question the "realness" of an existing controlling shareholder or, if no controlling shareholder exists, to blame the problem on the absence of a real owner. Theoretical/Academic Implications: It is important to understand the institutional logic propagated by the press to see how the media functions as a governance mechanism, since a given institutional logic leads the media to "name and shame" in specific ways. The institutional logic propagated by the Swedish press differs from what previous research has indicated is prevalent in the US, suggesting that the media as a governance mechanism has different effects in different countries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper illustrates the importance of understanding prevalent informal norms when predicting effects of corporate governance reform and suggests that these informal aspects are highly path dependent.

Although outsourcing of organisational functions has become a popular practice amongst organisations, the literature provides a myopic and simplistic view of the phenomenon by focusing on either single functions or taking monadic views of a single party. The design of our study overcomes these weaknesses by including the following features: a range of organisational functions were included; the unit of analysis was the outsourcing contract; the level of analysis was at the dyadic level where both service providers and receivers presented their views and the approach was a qualitative one. In practice, this involved interviews with managers in service receiving and providing organisations that were in charge of 10 separate outsourcing arrangements. Using agency theory as a theoretical anchor, we contribute to the outsourcing debate by highlighting its complexity and areas of convergence and divergence between service receivers and providers, thereby suggesting a contingent approach towards implementation of outsourcing arrangements.

This paper examines the impact of corporate governance and ownership structure on voluntary disclosure practices of Malaysian listed firms. The extent of voluntary disclosure is determined for a matched-sample of 100 listed firms in three different disclosure regimes during 1996, 2001 and 2006. The findings suggest that regulatory reforms over the 1996 to 2006 period resulted in enhanced corporate transparency and accountability as reflected in more extensive voluntary disclosures. We provide empirical evidence that the extent of voluntary disclosures is significantly associated with the strength of corporate governance structure in 2001 and 2006 and with ownership structure in 1996, 2001 and 1996. The findings of this study are of use to regulators in terms of guiding policy development regarding corporate transparency of publicly listed firms. Copyright (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Family business success rests on implementing a governance system that recognizes a complex nexus of social relationships. While scholars have used existing frameworks such as agency theory to explore the effect of financial incentives on agent behavior and performance, they have not integrated perspectives from psychology and sociology in a way that fully addresses the challenges of effective family business governance. Our research advances current knowledge of governance in family business by examining the implications of accountability theory to explore differences in the perceptions of accountability between family and nonfamily executives as a result of family firm monitoring. We examine the elements and linkages that form the basis of accountability in the context of firm characteristics uniquely common to family business and that are influential in the development of perceptions between executives of contrasting family status. Potential contingencies to the family status-accountability relationship is also considered, as are the implications of effective monitoring for family firm performance. (c) 2013.

Publicly traded Chinese firms recently reformed their ownership structures by converting non-tradable shares, which constituted two-thirds of shares outstanding and were held largely by the state, into shares that could trade on domestic exchanges. To facilitate this reform, tradable shareholders were compensated with stock grants from non-tradable shareholders. Our analysis focuses on the level of compensation, the compensation ratio, the ratio of new tradable shares granted to tradable shares outstanding before the reform. Contrary to the predictions of asset-pricing models, most firms set the compensation ratio around 0.3. We explain this surprising convergence using institutional theory. In doing so, we analyze the power and interests of all relevant actors - not just owners, but also state regulators, executives, and other agents - and draw on insights from resource-dependence and agency theories. We find strong evidence of coercive and mimetic isomorphism, but no evidence of normative isomorphism. Because our dependent variable is continuous (a ratio), we are able to show that the mimetic effects we observe cannot be attributed to coercion or norms. Thus, we not only explain an empirical puzzle, we also advance institutional analysis of isomorphism by clearly distinguishing three isomorphic forces that have been conflated in much previous research.

Most principal-agent literature of nonprofit organizations has focused on the relationship between board members and managers. However, in addition to the role as an agent of the board, the manager also performs a role as principal with respect to the nonprofit employees. By using a discrete choice experiment, we identify the objectives of managers and employees in nonprofit organizations and assess the presence of agency problems in this relationship. Our sample consists of 76 headmasters, 161 teachers, and 39 administrative employees in 74 secondary nonprofit schools in Belgium. We find that the six objectives set out in the experiment play an important role for both headmasters and subordinate staff. However, the results also indicate that some of these objectives are significantly more important for the headmasters. In sum, our results suggest that agency theory and stewardship theory are not necessarily in conflict with each other but can be combined into a more general governance framework for nonprofit organizations. Consequently, we argue that incentive structures that incorporate different types of objectives can facilitate the recruitment and retention of employees in nonprofit organizations.

This study develops a property rights explanation of the multi-unit (MU) ownership strategy of the franchise firm. According to the property rights theory, the allocation of residual rights of control (decision and ownership rights) in franchise firms depends on the contractibility of system-specific and local market assets (LMA). We develop and test the following hypotheses: Multi-unit franchising (MUF) is positively related to the franchisor's intangible system-specific assets and negatively to the franchisee's intangible LMA. In addition, we argue that impact of financial assets on the tendency toward MUF depends on the contractibility of LMA. Empirical results from the German franchise sector provide partial support of the hypotheses. Compared to the agency theory, which focuses on (complete) incentive contracts that specify residual income rights between the franchisor and franchisee, property rights theory focuses on incomplete contracts that allocate residual control rights between the franchisor and network partners. Furthermore, compared to the resource scarcity theory, property rights theory explains the impact of contractibility of resources/assets on the ownership strategy of the franchise firm.

The existing literature documents that the financial reporting quality is higher when firms have effective audit committees. However, recent studies find that audit committees are not effective in family firms where agency conflicts arise between controlling and non-controlling shareholders. Extending the previous findings, this study investigates the effectiveness of audit committees in firms with similar agency conflicts when one owner obtains effective control of the firm. Compared to firms with a low level of block ownership, high-blockholder firms face less agency problems due to the separation of ownership and management, but more severe agency problems between controlling (blockholders) and non-controlling shareholders. Using a unique hand-collected sample, using the largest 350 UK firms for three years from 2005 to 2007, and shows that firms with effective audit committees have less earnings management. This study also documents that the monitoring effectiveness of audit committees is moderated in firms with high blockholder ownership. Copyright (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

With growing public and private support of networks of small and medium-sized firms, many networks rely on network boards to ensure effective governance. By integrating agency and embeddedness reasoning, this article argues that network board composition aimed at effective monitoring may be at the cost of lost ability to strategize. In this study, longitudinal data of Swedish government-supported innovation networks demonstrate that network innovation improves as network board size increases, but that returns to such increases diminish when boards become overly large. Similarly, network board independence is beneficial up to a certain threshold, after which further increases in independence become detrimental. The study clarifies how agency and embeddedness theory can be combined to explain boards' abilities to combine monitoring and strategizing at the network level in increasing the levels of network innovation.

This paper examines the ethical implications of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the United Nation's climate change initiative that provides incentives to countries and firms in developed countries to motivate investments in greenhouse gas reduction projects in developing countries. Using the tenets of agency theory, we present a solid waste management project in El Salvador as an illustrative example of how the CDM can produce a disproportionately high social cost for the most marginalized populations in the developing world. We suggest that the UN needs to reformulate the CDM so that it more effectively aligns the divergent goals of multiple actors and upholds the UN's principles for sustainable development, including ethical firm-level behavior. By providing incentives for environmental, economic, and social value creation, the CDM would not only promote ethical norms for profit-seeking firms that participate in the program but also reinforce the UN's twin pro-poor and environmental objectives.

Corporate governance is usually viewed in the context of strengthening shareholder rights and enhancing shareholders' welfare. However, the impact of corporate governance on bondholders is much less understood. We explore how corporate governance influences the cost of debt financing. Using broad governance metrics encompassing fifty governance attributes reported by The Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), we document that stronger corporate governance is associated with a higher cost of debt. As governance strengthens by one standard deviation, the cost of debt rises by as much as 11 %. The results are robust even after controlling for both firm-specific and issue-specific characteristics. Our results are important because they suggest that corporate governance has a palpable effect on critical corporate outcomes such as credit ratings and bond yields. More importantly, we show that, while corporate governance may mitigate the agency conflict between managers and shareholders, it appears to exacerbate the agency conflict between shareholders and bondholders (the agency cost of debt).

The tenets of agency theory suggest that: 1) managers may pursue investment strategies that are at odds with shareholder value, and 2) effective governance mechanisms can improve the quality of managerial decision-making and enhance the outcomes of corporate investment. Accordingly, using an agency theory lens, we hypothesize that the financial outcomes of global diversification are contingent on the quality of the multinational firm's corporate governance: high (poor) quality corporate governance is associated with positive (negative) financial consequences attributable to global diversification. Using a sample of 5985 firm-year observations over the period 2002 through 2006, we find support for our hypothesis. The results are robust to using three different measures of global diversification, three different measures of financial outcomes (one accounting-based and two market-based measures), and two econometric methods to control for the endogeneity of the diversification decision.

This article examines relationships between governance characteristics and disclosure quality in an emerging economy of Pakistan. Regression analysis supports agency theory and shows that CEO duality is negatively related to disclosure quality, whereas ownership concentration and audit quality positively influence disclosure quality. This article also finds, through an interaction term in regression models, that ownership concentration becomes a negative influence on disclosure quality when firms have CEO duality. This study helps academicians and policymakers to understand how disclosure could be affected by corporate governance. Policymakers could apply the results to further promote good governance in Pakistan. (c) 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

This paper examines the connection between shareholdings by different groups of corporate officers (insiders and outsiders) and market valuation in South Africa. Specifically, we examine the effect of shareholdings by employees, chief executive officers (CEOs), chief financial officers (CFOs), other executive directors, and non-executive (outside) directors on market valuation. We find that total ownership by all corporate officers (insiders and outsiders) is positively related to market valuation. However, when we examine the link between ownership by individual groups of corporate officers and market valuation, our results suggest that firms with higher ownership by CEOs and other executive directors have lower market valuation, but we do not find any evidence that ownership by CFOs has any significant effect on market valuation. In contrast, we find that ownership by employees and non-executive outside) directors is positively related to market valuation. Our findings are generally consistent with the predictions of agency theory. Copyright (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

It has been discussed that whether family ownership perform better or less perform than non-family ownership that might create or destroy agency costs among the managers and shareholders. This paper is to investigate the financial performance of family and non-family owned banks in Malaysia from year 2001 to 2010. This study compares the financial performance of family and non-family owned banks that operate under central bank of Malaysia, (BNM) and are listed on Bursa Malaysia. Multiple regression technique was performed to investigate the relationship between independent variable (ownership structure) and dependent variables (Tobin's Q, ROA and ROE). Findings indicate that Tobin's Q is the best fit as the dependent variable for the regression model. It shows the highest F statistics value, which is 6.247 as compared to ROA and ROE for full sample. Meanwhile, the adjusted R squared of Tobin's Q indicates similar higher value as well that is 0.150 between the dependent variables. Board composition and board size indicate strong influence on the performance of family-owned banks. Smaller board size on the board can help the bank to achieve better performance in term of Tobin's Q and ROE. In contrast, board composition attains better performance in term of ROA rather than Tobin's Q and ROE. This study can provide useful insights of the governance mechanism that could influence the firm performance.

This paper examines the effect of outside block-holders' ownership on the demand for corporate monitoring in relation to agency theory in the Malaysian business environment. The results of this study provide evidence that, given the cultural differences, the agents and the principals may act differently. The findings indicate that blockholders in Malaysia appear to demand more monitoring costs as their shareholdings increase. This positive relationship may be associated with the demand for more monitoring by minority shareholders as a balance against the power of the majority shareholders in the concentrated business environment in Malaysia and the tighten regulations after 1997/98 financial crisis. Further investigation shows that the institutional and non-institutional block-holders react and demand different level of monitoring costs. The institutional blockholders who are mostly government related institutions appear to demand more monitoring costs as their share ownership increase, while the non-institutional shareholders are associated with less monitoring costs as their shares increase.

Using a panel model, and after controlling for endogeneity problems, we examined 54 listed and unlisted banks from 2005 to 2010. Our results implied that the presence of outside directors on the board and the leadership duality have no statistical impact on performance. It seems that severe regulations by the Lebanese monetary authority act as an external governance mechanism. On the contrary, insiders' ownership promotes convergence of the interests of managers/shareholders and shapes the performance of banks. Our findings may well urge Lebanese bankers and regulators towards further development and implementation of governance practices to enhance the performance and the stability of one of the pillars of the Lebanese economy.

This article tests the separation of ownership and control in South African-listed companies that leads to the divergence of interest between shareholders and directors. Where listed companies are owned by so many shareholders that their diffused shareholding results in negligible control over the directors who manage the assets of the company, it is likely that the directors will manage and direct the company to maximise their self-interest to the detriment of the interest of the shareholders. The separation of ownership and control and the maximisation of self-interest are central themes in the agency theory. Researching their validity in a South African context where the market is less liquid and the stock exchange is significantly smaller can add a valuable contribution to the continuing debate on corporate governance in the country. The article analyses 186 listed South African companies using data extracted over four years to test whether there is separation of ownership and control and whether such separation leads to the maximisation of self-interest. Data were extracted for the years 2005 and 2006, using the shareholding in 2006 to determine control, and for the years 2009 and 2010, using the shareholding in 2010 to determine control. Directors' remuneration as a percentage of assets was used as a proxy for the maximisation of directors' interest, and profit attributable to shareholders as a percentage of assets was used as a proxy for the maximisation of shareholders' interest. These proxies were used to test the impact of control during the two controlling periods, namely 2006 and 2010. The article finds that the majority of listed companies in South Africa are controlled by a dominant shareholder. However, there are still a significant number of companies where the directors have de facto control. Contrary to the expectation that companies controlled by directors will aim to maximise directors' remuneration, or companies controlled by shareholders will aim to maximise profit attributable to shareholders, this article finds the opposite to be true. This is possibly an indication that the controlling parties might consider factors other than their direct financial self-interest, or that there is an inherent cost associated with control.

In Brazil, according to Law No. 10.303/2001, the improper use of inside information in the stock market is crime. However, in literature there are studies to indicate the existence of insider trading in this market (BOPP, 2003; BARBEDO; SILVA; LEAL, 2009). Therefore, this study aims to investigate the Probability of Informed Trading (PIN) in stock trading on the BMandFBOVESPA, trying to identify its relationship with stock returns. Based on Efficient Markets Theory and Agency Theory, we analyzed 198 stocks during the year 2011. The information asymmetry was measured (PIN) using the model of Easley, Hvidkjaer and O'Hara (2002) and related to stock returns through the model of Fama and MacBeth (1973) set. The results indicate that there is 22.9% probability of insider trading has occurred, that the segments with higher governance requirements together with the stocks that lower information asymmetry and an increase of 10.0% in PIN leads to an increase of 8.0 % in stock returns.

The separation of ownership and control observed in large corporations is common to other organizations such as large professional partnerships, financial mutuals, nonprofits, and cooperatives. This separation gives rise to control and influence cost problems in cooperatives. However, it is not observed in all Brazilian agricultural cooperatives, where certain members have both residual claim and formal control rights. In this article, we examine the allocation of decision management and control rights and the determinants of ownership structure in a sample of Brazilian agricultural cooperatives. Using survey data, we employ multivariate regression techniques to empirically investigate the factors determining the allocation of ownership rights and the separation of ownership and control. Our findings do not lend strong support to agency theory, but they help inform research seeking to shed light on the determinants of decision rights allocation in agricultural cooperatives.

Fiduciary duties are an integral part of the corporate law landscape. The law and economics analysis of these duties, especially the duty of directors to maximize shareholder wealth, shows that these duties fill contractual gaps, saving on transaction costs. Although duties to shareholders are well settled, duties to other participants such as creditors or employees are heavily debated. In this paper, we use an agency theory framework to address the relative efficiency of a duty to creditors, a duty to refrain from wrongful trading, or contractual devices. Such an analysis makes clear what effect these rules have upon the behavior of shareholders and boards and whether these rules can efficiently address agency problems. The upshot of the analysis is that both types of rules protect creditors, but the same can be said of specific contractual solutions. It is therefore unclear if the rules mitigate costs above and beyond what could be achieved by contract. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the type of bankruptcy system matters as well. Creditor protection is best delivered via a board friendly bankruptcy system instead of with a creditor friendly system that includes a wrongful trading rule. The conclusion is that creditor duties, or wrongful trading rules, are superfluous, while private solutions are still inadequate to solve all the agency problems in a way that the proponents of both types of creditor protections aim for.

This study focuses on an agency cost explanation of the long-run performance of debt issuers based on debt issuance data in Malaysia during the period from January 2001 to October 2009. Long-run performance is measured by buy and hold abnormal return (BHAR), while growth opportunities (GO), managerial ownership (MO), ownership concentration (OC) and free cash flow (FCF) are adopted as proxies for agency costs. Using a linear regression method, this study finds that BHAR is positively influenced by GO and OC but negatively influenced by MO and FCF, which supports an agency cost explanation of capital structure. An improvement in the performance of debt issuers is found to be associated with the monitoring of debt by debt issuers. Debt issuers with more concentrated ownership and lower MO benefit from the issuance of debt through a reduction of agency costs.

Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate the risk and return characteristics of dividend investing compared to a passive "market" approach and provide probable explanations for any differences in return and risk. Design/methodology/approach: The research design is a standard time series analysis of two different data sets containing information about return for "dividend portfolios" and the "market portfolio". Findings: Investing in high dividend-paying firms earns abnormal returns in a long short-strategy in the USA and in world indices, confirming earlier studies. Different overlapping strategies and agency theory are used to provide explanations for the dividend strategy's persistence. Research limitations/implications: While the US findings were significant at conventional levels, the results using the world indices had significance levels that were slightly below the usual academic cut off but may be acceptable to practitioners. Practical implications: Seemingly anomalous findings should disappear once reported, yet the high dividend-paying strategy continues to persist and this article provides some explanations relating to the value strategy, beta puzzle and agency theory. Social implications: Paying dividends may be socially responsible since it is explained as a way of deploying free cash flow in an efficient manner rather than wasting money through overpriced acquisitions or buybacks of overpriced shares. Originality/value: By using different databases, earlier research is confirmed and also found to be robust across different time periods. The contribution of this paper is to link the value premium, the beta puzzle and agency issues of free cash flows together to explain the outperformance and persistence of dividend investing from a practitioner viewpoint.

The main purpose of this study is to develop and examine the theoretical model of hospital governance. For this purpose, this study integrates the literature of organizational governance and agency theory to empirically test the relationship between hospital governance mechanisms (structure of board of directors, information disclosure, and decision making) and hospital governance effectiveness (financial, customer, internal process, learning and growth, and social responsibility). This study empirically tested hospital governance related indices from 102 hospitals by using secondary data. The results find that (1) information disclosure and decision making of hospital governance mechanisms are positively related to its governance effectiveness, and (2) the relationship between the structures of board of directors and its governance effectiveness is non-significant. The theoretical and managerial implications and suggestions of future study are provided at the end of this study.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present theoretical explanations for the failure of the largest dairy processing firm in Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) after only about one year of operation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper contains a case study on the establishment and failure of a new firm is presented. Data were collected through mass media reports and interviews with knowledgeable individuals in the dairy industry. The data were analyzed using neo-institutional theories, primarily agency theory. Findings - The core of the explanation is that the various categories of institutions were not aligned. For example, poor contract enforcement created insurmountable agency costs for all parties involved. Research limitations/implications - As this paper is based on a case study it is uncertain to which extent the finding can be generalized. Originality/value - Most case studies describe successes. This paper presents a case where the odds for success were poor, but the project was still initiated. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

It is claimed that information system structure can affect the coordination, monitoring and controlling of organisational activities, and in turn reduce the costs involved. This paper aims to investigate how the information system structure of an organisation affects its demand and preference for monitoring costs in Malaysian business environment. About 867 questionnaires were distributed to public listed companies in Malaysia, however, only 235 questionnaires were completed and usable for the purpose of the study. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were carried out to analyze the data. The findings indicate that companies using centralised information system structure have negative and significant relationship with total monitoring costs, this result may be explained by the fact that the agents' self interest behaviour can be monitored by the centralised system. However the information system structure is not significant when the cost of directorship and auditing are compared. But when internal auditing and external auditing costs are compared, the result indicates that companies with centralised information system structure have significantly more internal auditing costs. This paper contributes to the literature relating to the relationship between information system structures and monitoring costs, especially in Malaysian business settings.

Referring to the dual nature of "good" theories in social and management sciences, this article claims that the same theory might generate both good and bad practices, in rational and moral terms. To illustrate this argument, it relies on the positive agency theory case and on two related practices: stock-options, and the carried interest technique which is supported by the private equity organizational structure. This article concludes that management theory and practices may be decoupled. (c) 2013 Lavoisier. All rights reserved.

Due to specific know how needed, the position of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is often the first management position in large family businesses for which a non-family manager is hired. However, the role of the CFO in family businesses is underresearched. Therefore, this article seeks to synthesize present findings and analyze the role of the non-family CFO in large family businesses compared to nonfamily businesses. As a theoretical background we employ social role theory, agency theory and stewardship theory.

Focusing on the agency conflict between manager and shareholders and on the definitions of tunneling and propping, we delve into the related party transactions between a group and its management. Firstly, the paper examines actual and previous information to disclose for directors board remunerations (as for IAS, Consob and TUF). Such remunerations are based on a contract with legal and moral managers obligations to the companies of the group they run and to the stakeholder of such companies. For this reason, a balance between their remunerations and their performance is necessary to achieve preserving the interests of all the subjects involved in the companies' activities and maintaining the continuity of the group. Then, using regressions, we measure, in a sample of listed companies, if there is a significant and sustainable connection between particular remunerations of the highest paid members of the directors board and the economic group performance.

The purpose of the study is to estimate the magnitude of the votes and the excess of votes of the majority shareholders in Brazilian companies grounded by the agency theory. The ownership structure of Brazilian organizations differs from Anglo-Saxon ones that are the most common studied. Thereby, there is a gap of literature about the conflicts between managers, shareholders and sprayed ownership in the Brazilian context. In Brazil, which has concentrated ownership structure, duality of classes of shares and strong presence of major shareholders, the conflict occurs between majority and minority shareholders. Thus, from a separation of majority shareholder types of Ibovespa companies of the year of 2010, the research is characterized as descriptive and explanatory. The author utilizes bibliographic and documentary resources, using the data system Economatica of IAN's as well as Bovespa website for the analysis. The results showed that the capital structure of publicly traded companies is mainly concentrated on equity, occurring in several cases a considerable distance between the voting power and the power of the majority shareholders' cash flow. The results also suggest that publicly traded Brazilian companies have in most cases, a controlling shareholder - with more than 50% of the shares with voting rights of companies - and in many cases when there is not a controlling shareholder, there is a controlling bloc, formed by the three main majority shareholders of the companies.

A unified framework is presented to characterise the capital structure of firms that face borrowing restrictions - which extends the classic theory of capital by incorporating elements from actuarial and agency theory. It is demonstrated that the bankruptcy and agency costs afforded by these firms can be expressed in terms of the actuarial prices of the underlying exposures. Then the optimal surplus is determined in order to maximise value - which is equivalent to minimise the cost of bankruptcy plus the opportunity cost of capital. The capital principle thus obtained explicitly depends on risk and expectations, and can be applied to allocate reserves both in financial and insurance companies. An optimal decentralised mechanism is also defined that stimulates the exchange of information inside multidivisional corporations. (c) 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

In the context of agency theory this study investigates the effect of corporate governance (CG) on Internet Financial Reporting (IFR) disclosure in a concentrated ownership environment, such as Italy. We hypothesize that IFR may be explained in term of increasing transparency in order to defend minority shareholder interest, so we predict, and find, a positive association between the extent of a firm's IFR and its CG and a negative association between IFR and ownership structure. CG is measured by ownership structure, using as a proxy the share held by the first three major shareholders and by managerial ownership, and by board composition, captured through the incidence of independent director (IND) and of a Non-Executive Chair (NEC). IFR is measured taking into consideration the content and format of information present in Investor Relations sections. (c) Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

Dividend is a division of organization profit that is compensated by an organization to its shareholders as a reward for spending in the organization. Dividend is measured as the allocation of the recognized assets among shareholders that could either be paid frequently by organization or called out by shareholders sometime. Over the last decade, several researchers disputed that the dividend policy decisions of firms are vital primarily due to the signaling effect on the firm's future growth. The paper presents the experiential results on the signaling effect of dividends with the support of different theories on dividend policy. (c) Saqib Muneer, Saif-ur-Rehman, Babar Zaheer Butt, 2013.

Although a concentrated ownership, usually by a single family, is most prevalent in Asian firms, agency costs between shareholders and managers persists to some degree unless there is 100% ownership of equity by management. In addition, with reforms spreading across Asia to promote more transparency of disclosures, more and more firms are adopting Western-style (US and UK) corporate governance measures. As a result, the difference between Asian and Western corporate governance is narrowing. The article reviews the issues of ownership structure, agency costs and liquidity, as they jointly affect firm value. The paper proposes a theoretical framework that illustrates the direct and indirect effects of ownership structure on firm value. (c) 2013 AIBE.

Moreover, corporate performance is positively related to the elasticity of compensation to scale. We find that both agency theory and managerialism hold true in Chinese listed companies. Compensation contract is the result of the game by stockholders and managers.

CEO duality-the practice of a single individual serving as both CEO and board chair-has been the subject of academic interest for more than 20 years. In that time, boards' use of CEO duality has fluctuated and the scholarly conceptualizations of the phenomenon have become more complex. As such, the need to understand CEO duality has only increased with time. We review and integrate the disparate literature on this topic so that future attempts to study it will benefit from a more complete understanding of the knowledge already produced. We review the demonstrated antecedents and consequences of CEO duality, pointing out that while much work has been done in this area, much remains that we do not understand. Finally, we offer new theoretical, methodological, and contextual directions that researchers could explore to extend knowledge about CEO duality. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Family firms represent a globally dominant form of organization, yet they confront a steep challenge of finding and managing competent leaders. Sometimes, these leaders cannot be found within the owning family. To date we know little about the governance contexts under which non-family leaders thrive or founder. Guided by concepts from agency theory and behavioural agency theory, we examine the conditions of ownership and leadership that promote superior performance among non-family CEOs of family firms. Our analysis of 893 Italian family firms demonstrates that these leaders outperform when they are monitored by multiple major family owners as opposed to a single owner; they also outperform when they are not required to share power with co-CEOs who are family members, and who may be motivated by parochial family socioemotional priorities.N (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.

Building on corporate governance research and institutional theory, this paper explores interrelationships between the firm's corporate governance, responsible leadership, and corporate social responsibility approaches in different institutional contexts. We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory with its focus on corporate social responsibility as mere compliance with rules and regulations. We link different leadership orientations and corporate social responsibility approaches to two key process dimensions of corporate governance related to monitoring and incentives. This analysis builds on previous research that differentiates between governance mechanisms based on strategic as opposed to financial controls and explains how these types of control may be related to responsible managerial behavior and the firm's corporate social responsibility strategies. Building on governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory, we further argue that links between corporate social responsibility strategies and corporate governance factors such as boards of directors, ownership patterns, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop a more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational approaches to corporate social responsibility.

Academics, politicians, and journalists are often highly critical of U.S. firms for holding too much cash. Cash holdings are stockpiled free-cash flow and incur substantial opportunity costs from the perspectives of economics. However, behavioral theory highlights the benefits of cash holdings as fungible slack resources facilitating adaptive advantages. We use the countervailing forces embodied in these two theories to hypothesize and test a quadratic functional relationship of returns to cash measured by Tobin's q. We also build and test a related novel hypothesis of scale-dependent returns to cash based on the competitive strategy concept of strategic deterrence. Tests for both of these hypotheses are positive and show that returns to cash continue to increase far beyond transactional needs. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We examine changes in firms' dividend payouts following an exogenous shock to the information asymmetry problem between managers and investors. Agency theories predict a decrease in dividend payments to the extent that improved public information lowers managers' need to convey their commitment to avoid overinvestment via costly dividend payouts. Conversely, dividends could increase if minority investors are in a better position to extract cash dividends. We test these predictions by analyzing the dividend payment behavior of a global sample of firms around the mandatory adoption of IFRS and the initial enforcement of new insider trading laws. Both events serve as proxies for a general improvement of the information environment and, hence, the corporate governance structure in the economy. We find that, following the two events, firms are less likely to pay (increase) dividends, but more likely to cut (stop) such payments. The changes occur around the time of the informational shock, and only in countries and for firms subject to the regulatory change. They are more pronounced when the inherent agency issues or the informational shocks are stronger. We further find that the information content of dividends decreases after the events. The results highlight the importance of the agency costs of free cash flows (and changes therein) for shaping firms' payout policies.

Purpose -Drawing on agency theory and legitimacy theory perspectives, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of board characteristics on sustainability reporting of listed companies in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 148 listed companies was drawn from the CSE using stratified random sampling method and data were collected from the 2012 annual reports. The proposed hypotheses were tested using a hierarchical binary logistic regression. Findings - This study documents that board size and dual leadership are positively associated with sustainability reporting and boards with female directors are negatively associated with sustainability reporting. This study also found that sustainability reporting is likely to be influenced by firm size and firm growth. Additionally, the study also reveals that younger firms are likely to adopt sustainability reporting. Originality/value - This is the first study to examine the influence of board characteristics on sustainability reporting in Sri Lanka, considered as a developing economy with an emerging equity market.

Purpose - Based on the agency theory, the purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the impact of capital structure choice on firm performance in India as one of the emerging economies. Design/methodology/approach - Fixed effect panel regression model is used to analyse ten years of data (2003-2012) on the sample units, to find the relation between leverage and firm performance after controlling for factors such as size, age, tangibility, growth, liquidity and advertising. Findings - Empirical results suggest that leverage has a negative influence on financial performance of Indian firms, which is in contrast with the assumptions of agency theory as commonly received and accepted in other developed as well as emerging economies. Consequently, postulates of agency theory have to be seen with different perspective in India given the underdeveloped nature of bond markets and dominance of state-owned banks in lending to corporate sector. Practical implications - The findings of the paper will enable the practitioners and analysts to understand as to why, in the bank-dominated debt financing system in India, leverage is negatively associated with firm performance. Originality/value - The results of the study enrich the literature on capital structure and agency costs issues in several ways. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

Although theory suggests that companies would rationally select into audit even if it were not a legal requirement, many countries impose mandatory audits. This is arguably due to an audit having elements of a public good, which may result in not enough audits being purchased without regulatory intervention. The mandatory nature of public company audit has created problems for researchers wishing to investigate the demand for voluntary audit. Recent events in the UK, however, have provided such an environment. In the UK, private companies must publicly file financial statements and, until recently, they had also to be audited. However, this requirement has now been relaxed for many private companies. We are therefore able to examine the determinants of voluntary audit in a large sample of companies for which we have financial statement data. We analyse a sample of 6274 recently exempt companies, following them for three years post-exemption. We use agency theory and prior evidence to generate our hypotheses and examine them using a more comprehensive set of explanatory variables than has previously been available in the literature. Our results indicate that companies are more likely to purchase voluntary audits if they have greater agency costs, are riskier, wish to raise capital, purchase non-audit services from their auditor, and exhibited greater demand for audit assurance in the mandatory audit regime. We also document a trend away from audit over time. Overall, our results strongly support the idea that companies choose to be audited when it is in their interests to do so.

Considerable prior research investigates whether the extent of insider presence on corporate boards is detrimental. However, the majority of past research treats all inside directors as a homogenous group. This study considers that issue in the context of chief financial officers (CFO) serving on their own company's board. Our research is important because individuals in different executive roles bring different skills and knowledge to board interactions, highlighting the potential for differential contributions. As prior research does not specifically distinguish CFOs from other board insiders, the potential benefits of knowledge sharing due to increased communication with other board members may have been masked. Specifically, the CFO is directly responsible for the quality of the financial reporting process and can therefore be associated with specific outcome measures. Our results show that the percentage of CFOs serving on their own boards is not large, likely due to the perspective (consistent with agency theory and reflected in independence guidelines) that company insiders on boards could promote their own best interest at the expense of shareholders. Contrary to this perception, we find that companies whose CFO has a seat on the board are associated with higher financial reporting quality (i.e., a lower likelihood of reporting a material weaknesses in internal controls or having a financial restatement, and better accruals quality). Yet, we also find potential drawbacks in that CFOs with a board seat tend to have higher excess compensation and lower likelihood of termination following poor performance, signaling greater entrenchment. While our results provide information to companies considering appointing the CFO to the board, both costs and benefits are demonstrated, and thus we conclude that each board should consider this decision based on its own circumstances and composition.

With recent legislation mandating that publicly traded corporations submit their CEOs' compensation for a nonbinding shareholder vote, a systematic understanding of shareholder preferences has never been so important. In spite of this, relatively little is known about what impacts shareholders' preferences and, subsequently, their ultimate voting behavior. We integrate two theories to help frame the question and to help predict shareholder behavior. Per agency theory, shareholders, as principals, will disapprove of high CEO rewards and poor firm performance, symmetrically assessing gains and losses. Per prospect theory, shareholders will be loss averse, responding much more strongly to being in a loss position than to being in a gain or neutral position. We combine these theories' predictions in two lab experiments in which we simulate a shareholder say-on-pay vote, hypothesizing that shareholders will be concerned with agency costs, but only when they are in a loss position. The results of these simulated votes suggest that shareholders do value pay for performance, in keeping with agency theory. However, shareholders exhibit this focus on agencynormative prescriptions asymmetrically, showing loss aversion in keeping with prospect theory. This finding has significant implications for both theory and practice as shareholder votes become a regular and high-profile occurrence. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Extant theories agree that debt should inhibit diversification but predict opposing performance consequences. While agency theory predicts that debt should lead to higher performance for diversifying firms, transaction cost economics (TCE) predicts that more debt will lead to lower performance for firms expanding into new markets. Our empirical tests on a large sample of Japanese firms support TCE by showing that firms accrue higher returns from leveraging their resources and capabilities into new markets when managers are shielded from the rigors of the market governance of debt, particularly bond debt. Furthermore, we find that the detrimental effects of debt are exacerbated for R&D intensive firms and that debt is not necessarily harmful to firms that are either contracting or managing a stable portfolio of markets.

Nonfinancial measures (NFMs) are a common feature of strategic performance management frameworks. We examine the role of one widely used NFM: customer satisfaction, in one aspect of strategic performance management: CEO compensation schemes. Drawing on agency theory precepts, we hypothesize that the extent to which firms link CEO compensation to customer satisfaction is influenced by satisfaction's ability to act as a leading indicator of future profitability (lead indicator strength). We further hypothesize that the extent to which customer satisfaction's lead indicator strength influences the weighting of satisfaction in CEO compensation schemes has a positive influence on future shareholder value. Our empirical results offer strong support for both hypotheses and extend research on the use and efficacy of NFMs in CEO compensation schemes. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study analyses the distribution of power among the several blockholders of a firm and the identity of those blockholders as a determinant of firm leverage. Using a sample of 694 firms from 12 Western European countries, our results support a negative relationship between ownership concentration in the hands of the main blockholder and firm leverage. Moreover, we detect that the presence of a second and third large shareholder (beyond the first blockholder) has a significant positive effect on the leverage ratio. In addition, the results show that contestability in family firms plays a more relevant role. Finally, we show that family firms do have significant impact on firm leverage level, and this impact varies depending on the legal framework and institutional environment. In our main sample the results show family firms negatively affect market leverage, supporting the theory that family firms are more averse to an increase in the debt level due to the risk of bankruptcy and financial distress as a result of having an under-diversified portfolio. In contrast, the opposite effect is found in the sample that excludes the United Kingdom. This last result cannot be explained by agency theory, given that family businesses are those that suffer less from Type I agency problems. This result suggests either some difficulty in financing their investments by issuing new equity or the need to use debt as a signal of the quality of its investments. Our results prove to be stable against a battery of robustness tests. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This study focuses on the relationship and identity changes within and between a project team and its organization following top management intervention in the context of a large international construction project. The study follows the project-as-practice orientation, examining the actions and behaviors of the project team through participant ethnography in the "praxis" of the project site over its entire duration. The longitudinal case allows the examination of the way the transition process established a new governance culture undermining the initial trust-based one and changed it from a virtual absence of mechanisms toward far more potent mechanisms of control, monitoring, and punishment. Simultaneously, the initial stewardship relationships and collectivist identity of the project team shifted toward agency relationships and individualistic identity. The triggers for the transformation process were identified as CEO succession, project failure, top management intervention driven changes in governance mechanisms, and perception of organizational betrayal of the project team.

Agency theory suggests that independent outside board members may have an important monitoring function of the financial reporting process. As a result, boards with more independent directors have a tendency for increased monitoring and are therefore expected to insist on better earnings quality. This study examines whether board independence improves earnings quality by reducing earnings management in Portugal, a country with significantly different institutional and legal characteristics from the Anglo-Saxon countries. Using ordinary least square (OLS) and two stage least squares (2SLS) techniques to control potential simultaneity problems between board independence and earnings quality, we find evidence that independent board members improve earnings quality by reducing earnings management for a sample of Portuguese listed firms. This result suggests that strengthening the independence of boards by appointing more independent board members is a positive step toward improving earnings quality.

Family offices are organisations dedicated to the management of entrepreneurial families' private wealth. Based on agency theory, we analyse types of family offices with regard to the families' goals and the control mechanisms used to ensure goal achievement. Family-dominant management and private client structures involve stronger emphasis on non-financial goals in single and multi-family offices than in non-family-dominant management and open client structures. Variations in family involvement, ranging from family dominance to the complete absence of family ownership and/or management, and diverse client structures justify the differential reliance on formal and informal control mechanisms.

The phenomena of financialisation has had a universal and pervasive impact upon economies and societies in recent decades. Global finance is now typified by a more international, integrated and intensive mode of accumulation; a new business imperative of the maximization of shareholder value; and a remarkable capacity to become an intermediary in every aspect of daily life. The finance sector has progressively increased its share of GDP, and even for non-financial corporations the pursuit of interest, dividends and capital gains outweigh any interest in productive investment. As non-financial corporations have become increasingly drawn into a financial paradigm they have less capital available for productive activity. These financial pressures are translated into the operations of corporations through the enveloping regime of maximising shareholder value as the primary objective. Agency theory has provided the rationale for this project, prioritising shareholders above all other participants in the corporation. This article seeks to discover the origins of the financialisation of corporations in the early development of agency theory and shareholder value in Anglo-American corporations. The enduring myths of shareholder primacy are examined. The article concludes with a consideration of how the reform of corporate law might serve to strengthen the recognition and pursuit of the wider purposes of corporations and longer-term investment horizons.

Drawing from agency theory and socioemotional wealth considerations, we evaluate the extent post-IPO investment policy choices and their economic consequences differ for family firms relative to nonfamily firms. Our results suggest that family firms underinvest in post-IPO liquidity, total investment spending, and R&D expenditures, relative to similar non-family firms. On the other hand, family firms overinvest in capital spending and underinvest in acquisition spending relative to nonfamily firms with dispersed but not concentrated ownership structures. Furthermore, while increases in R&D spending decrease shareholder value in family firms, the reverse is the case with acquisition spending. (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Purpose - With the licence season 2013/2014 onwards Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Financial Fair Play (FFP) fully came into force. Among other things, FFP demands from the clubs to operate within their own revenues in order to counteract the increasing over indebtedness in European club football. The purpose of this paper is to cast further light on the relationship between UEFA and the clubs as the main actors of FFP and to derive implications to UEFA to improve the efficacy of this regulatory intervention. Design/methodology/approach - This paper explicitly examines the case of FFP from an agency theory perspective. A positivist agency approach is applied in order to describe and explain (potential) problems in the relationship between UEFA and the clubs. Findings - The paper demonstrates that the relationship between UEFA and the clubs corresponds in many aspects to a classic principal-agent problem. A potential conflict of interest between both actors is outlined which together with asymmetric information creates incentives for opportunistic behaviour on the part of the clubs. The necessity of a stronger emphasis and communication of the economic and sport ethical legitimacy of FFP is detected. Practical implications - It is suggested that UEFA should consider taking a more proactive stance and endeavour to prevent non-compliance not only by limiting the opportunities to do so but also by providing information as well as education. Originality/value - FFP is supposed to have ground-breaking consequences for European club football. This is the first paper to systematically examine (potential) agency problems inherent in FFP.

Findings: Results showed that a concave relationship exists between firm value and cash holdings, which confirmed that there is an optimal cash level that maximizes firm value. It was also found that deviations from the optimal level affect firm value negatively.
Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between firm value and cash holdings for the period 2003-2008. This study seeks to find if there are costs and benefits associated with holding too much or too little cash, then an optimal cash level exists where marginal benefits are offset by their costs. If this optimal point exists, then firm value will be maximized at that point and deviation from it will affect the firm value negatively.
Design/methodology/approach: Optimal cash level between firm value and cash holding is determined by investigating the concave relationship. If concave relationship exists then a residual term is included in the equation to see how deviations from the optimal level affect firm value. A two-step generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator is used in estimating all results. GMM controls for unobserved firm heterogeneity and endogeneity problems.
Practical implications: The paper provides the existence of an optimal point of cash between costs and benefits wherein firm value is maximized. It has implications for firms' investment and financing decisions when there is limited access to external finance. At higher level of cash the study has implications for agency theory and governance practices.
Originality/value: The study establishes a conclusive relationship between firm value and cash holdings within the context of the Pakistani market. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This article analyses the financing structure of social enterprises which usually have access to a wide range of funding sources. Although a diversified financing structure promises stability in terms of cash flows to the business, empirical evidence shows that social enterprises have a rather concentrated financing structure. This can be explained as a diversified financing structure that can result in conflicts which either originate from the capital providers' divergent return requirements or the design of financing instruments. To reduce these conflicts, inherent in a diversified financing structure social enterprises concentrate on the most suitable financing sources. As social and financial return requirements differ between capital providers, the concentration on a reduced number of financing sources implies a more clearly defined set of expectations that the social enterprise has to consider. The social enterprise needs to adapt to the expectations of its capital providers and align the strategy accordingly. Copyright (c) 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how information sharing practices influenced inter-firm relationships. This was done specifically in relation to bulk commodity supply chains, due to the pre-existing power asymmetries in the system. Design/methodology/approach - This research was conducted using an interpretivist, inductive approach. The intention was to gather a wide range of data and then explore the data to see which themes emerged, rather than focusing on collecting data relevant only to specific themes. Findings - The key findings of this research focused around the difference between creating situations of compliance or collaboration in a supply chain context. This suggests that by understanding the relationships that exist between organisations, those in procurement and supply chain management roles will be able to better understand and manage the nuances of their supplier relationships. Research limitations/implications - The study is focused on a supply network specifically configured to facilitate sourcing and distribution of bulk grain. As such the findings need to be understood within the constraints of this context. Practical implications - Reliance on coercive power in an institutional change process is shown in our study to create a situation of compliance rather than of collaboration. Reliance on a different type of power, such as referent power, would be more successful in creating a situation of collaboration. Social implications - The sourcing and distribution of bulk grain is fundamental to food distribution in a developed economy. Our study provides a set of propositions indicating where managers can focus to more effectively manage these flows. Originality/value - The definition of the "agent" also provided an interesting point of comparison. This research found that the ultimate definition of the "agent" changes and can be linked to the institutional differences in ownership within a supply chain. This suggests the potential to redefine the way that Agency theory is discussed. The notion that the "agent" is dynamic and is likely to be the "agent", "caretaker" and more at the same time suggests the potential for the traditional definition of the agent to be challenged.

The purpose of this research is to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for interpreting Shariah governance mechanism in Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). After reviewing existing theories that were used to explain the phenomenon of corporate governance, three most commonly used theories in the corporate governance and Shariah governance area namely agency theory, stewardship theory and stakeholder theory were used and integrated based on their interrelated concepts and their relationship with Shariah governance. The constructed theoretical framework includes five concepts, namely accountability, disclosure and transparency, competency, confidentiality and independency among the key functionaries in Shariah governance, which are perceived to be the principles of Shariah governance. This research is among the first attempts to build an integrated theoretical foundation for Shariah governance in IFIs and the developed theoretical framework can be used as the basis for interpretations and comparisons on the ideal versus practical situation of Shariah governance in IFIs.

Are there country-level differences in the use of pay-for-performance in executive compensation contracts? We investigate how formal country-level institutions affect pay-for-performance directly and if institutions have a moderating effect on the relation between ownership structure and pay-for-performance contracts. Based on agency theory arguments, we show that substitutionary and complementary relations are conceivable, for the direct and the moderating effect. We conduct an empirical analysis based on 2766 firm-year observations for the years 2005-2008. Our empirical results show that whereas strong shareholder protection substitutes pay-for-performance, disclosure requirements complement pay-for-performance. Additionally, strong shareholder protection complements the effect of concentrated ownership on pay-for-performance while disclosure requirements substitute effects of ownership concentration. Overall, our results provide evidence for the relevance of formal institutions as determinants of executive compensation contracts. Additionally, our results indicate the general complexity of integrating institutions and internal governance mechanisms. (c) 2014.

Consistent with an agency theory of tax avoidance, this study investigates the extent to which tax avoidance results in a less timely annual earnings announcement. Using 16,340 firm-years spanning the period 1993-2010, evidence is presented suggesting tax avoidance that manifests through greater temporary and permanent book-tax differences results in a less timely annual earnings announcement. This result is robust to including several controls previously documented to affect reporting delay, including the magnitude of the earnings surprise, size, profitability, auditor-related influences, shareholder composition, capital intensity, financial reporting aggressiveness and financial condition. Evidence is also presented suggesting that tax avoidance impacts the value-relevance of earnings to investors at the announcement date, evaluated by the earnings response coefficient.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We look at the reaction to hedge fund activism of managers and shareholders in Japanese firms and explore the implications of our findings for agency theory. Research Findings/Insights: Confrontational shareholder activism of the kind practiced by American and British hedge funds in Japan during the 2000s failed to gain acceptance from Japanese investors and managers or to alter the internal focus of corporate governance practices in Japanese firms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We use a qualitative research design which treats the standard agency-theoretical model of the firm as only one possible approach to understanding corporate governance, to be tested through empirical research, rather than as an assumption built into the analysis. We find that Japanese managers do not generally regard themselves as the shareholders' agents and that, conversely, shareholders in Japanese firms do not generally behave as principals. Our findings suggest that the standard principal-agent model may be a weak fit for firms in certain national contexts. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For policymakers, our work demonstrates the importance of understanding the distinctive features of national-level corporate governance arrangements. For practitioners, it cautions against the view that national corporate governance systems are converging around the model of shareholder primacy and directs attention to the need for investors to be informed of the diversity of practices across different countries.

This study examines the determinants of board structure for Taiwanese firms by reviewing their board elections, held between 1991 and 2009. The paper emphasizes three factors: the distinction between insider-affiliated and non-insider-affiliated outside directors based on family relationships, governmental agency theory-based regulations, and the firm's choice between agency and stewardship governance philosophy. Evidence has shown that the proportion of non-insider-affiliated outsiders on the board is sensitive to changes in firm and CEO characteristics, and to changes in government regulations. Government regulations significantly shape corporate boards, encouraging a smaller size, more outside directors, and fewer insider-affiliated outside directors. For firms adopting agency and stewardship theories as governance arrangement, the determinants of board structure are diverse. The board structure of principal-steward firms is less susceptible to changes in firm characteristics but more susceptible to CEO influence, and more responsive to government regulations.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study analyses whether or not the effect of board independence on a firm's strategic performance is moderated by family involvement in ownership and control. Moderation of the board's size and the independent director ratio are tested under quadratic specifications. The effect of CEO duality with family involvement on long-term sales growth is also measured. The empirical analysis is conducted in the Southern European context using a sample of publicly traded firms that have concentrated ownership structures. The main findings indicate that when nonlinearities are considered, family involvement moderates the relationship between the independent director ratio and firm performance. The optimal proportion of independent directors is lower in family businesses than in non-family ones. However, the results fail to support nonlinearities for board size. We find positive linear relationships between both board size and CEO duality with firm performance, which are not moderated by family involvement.

Agency theory is used to investigate the relationship between top management team involvement on not-for-profit hospitals' boards of directors (BODs) and hospital financial performance. Governance data collected in 2011 by The Governance Institute was merged with hospital financial performance data from the 2011 Medicare Cost Reports. Then, an ordinary least squares regression model, using propensity score adjustments, was used to evaluate the relationship between management involvement on the BOD and three financial performance profitability ratios: total margin, operating margin, and return on assets. The sample included 637 not-for-profit hospitals, most of which (74.1%) were not government owned. As hypothesized, we found that having a larger number of managers with voting rights on the BOD was associated with lower total margin (b= -0.011, p < .065). Similarly, we found that having a greater percentage of voting BOD members who were managers was associated with lower total margin (b= -0.296, p < .002) and return on assets (b= -0.337, p < .072). We did not find support for the notion that CEO involvement on the BOD is associated with poorer hospital financial performance (b= -0.008, p < .437). Consistent with agency theory, our findings suggest that management involvement on the BOD is associated with poorer hospital financial performance. This finding suggests that management involvement on the BOD may impair the BOD's ability to effectively monitor the actions of management, which may lead managers to make decisions that are more consistent with their own interests than those of the organization.

Purpose: This paper aims to focus on governance theories and practice variables in Not-For-Profit Service Organizations. The research answers two questions: what the prevalent governance practices of Not-for-Profit Service Organizations (NPSO) are, and whether there is a crossover among NPSO governance practices and For-Profit-Organization theories in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire to the 285 organizations within the defined parameters obtained a 18 percent response. Data were collected regarding the boards' predominant roles in the organizations' governance activities, the top executives' predominant roles in the organizations' operations and their interrelationship with the boards, and the boards' most common meeting agenda topics. Findings: The findings prove that governance models in NPSO are mostly driven by Agency Theory (52 percent of the sample). Stewardship and Resource Dependence Theories also contribute to existing governance models (28 percent), while some of the organizations have developed Hybrid Models (20 percent) drawing from the various theories. Research limitations/implications: The limited number of organizations participating in the research does not allow a generalization. However the diversity of organization types and sizes within the scope do provide a panoramic view of the not-for-profit service sector. Practical implications: Having proved that there is a crossover of governance practices among For-Profit and Not-for Profit Organizations, this research opens the door to the evaluation of many other existing or potential crossovers in governance and other management elements. Originality/value: This research is novel in its approach to look for similarities rather than differences between For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Organizations. The approach allows both sectors to learn from each other and seek for fresh improvement alternatives. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - This paper aims to provide insight whether disclosed compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) leads to higher valuation on the German stock market.Design/methodology/approach - Based on agency theory, stakeholder theory and institutional theory, the authors conduct a meta-analysis and evaluate the value relevance of the compliance with the GCGC.Findings - The research finds that compliance with the GCGC is mainly not a value-relevant factor for German companies listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.Research limitations/implications - The research considered is not fully comparable with regard to observation date, full integration of the GCGC rules and company selection/sample size. Future research is encouraged to research the valuation effects of compliance with the GCGC for a longer time horizon, the use of uniform performance measures and the integration of all GCGC rules.Practical implications - Compliance with the GCGC has not proven to be a value-driver for German listed companies. The authors recommend companies to search for opportunities to make their corporate governance more comprehensive by expanding their corporate governance reporting and thus providing deeper insights on how their processes of management and control work.Originality/value - The paper is the first investigation integrating the results of ten years of "code compliance - market valuation" research in Germany. We detect reasons why soft law regulation by corporate governance codes did not function on the German stock market. We additionally address behavioral aspects why investors do not give enough relevance to companies' corporate governance statements so far. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

This study proposes a revised agency theory for the nonprofit sector, distinguishes between the extent of agency and the extent of monitoring, and compares the magnitudes of the two impacts. Using panel data for 1998-2003, the paper tests whether monitoring by principal-stakeholders such as donors, clients, the government, and the board reduces the opportunity for executive misconduct such as extravagant spending on compensation and perquisites. Given the theory, the findings show that two effects influence CEO salaries. First, while nonprofit endowments provide a fiscal cushion in tough financial situations, by offering "organizational slack" they also increase the CEO's opportunity to steal or raise her compensation (i.e., agency effect). Second, donors utilize monitoring mechanisms such as auditing or direct observations, which limit the opportunity for misconduct and reduce executive pay (i.e., monitoring effect). In the final analysis, the monitoring effect is greater than the agency effect, which implies that even if agency problems are present, the monitoring that donors provide offsets them.

This paper investigates the agency costs of multinational companies (MNCs) in relation to agency theory, in the Malaysian business environment. Using the data of 235 MNCs, this study explores their demand for monitoring costs and these companies' preferences between the monitoring costs components. The result indicates that MNCs incur significantly higher monitoring costs compared to domestic companies. However, the relationship between these companies and their preference between the components of the monitoring mechanisms, that is between directorship and auditing as their monitoring mechanism, is not significant. When the auditing components are further investigated, it reveals that MNCs incur more external audit costs compared to internal audit costs. (c) 2014, University of Malaya. All rights reserved.

We examine how time preferences impact the financing decision of firms. We hypothesize that the degree of long-term orientation in a country is positively related to the use of bank relationship lending. Based on a thorough theoretical investigation and an extensive empirical analysis using a large, worldwide dataset, we find strong support for our hypothesis on the role of time preferences for financial intermediation. Our results are robust to controlling for other determinants of the choice of debt financing as well as to applying alternative variables and different estimation methods. Firms in long-term orientation countries appear to prefer relationship bank financing, since it is usually available for the long run and will not be withdrawn quickly in response to adverse developments. This allows managers to preserve a more strategic view and pursue longer planning horizons. (c) 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

We examine the choice and the offer spreads between callable and noncallable bonds. We find significant differences by industry sector and therefore segment our results by financial and nonfinancial industries. For the financial sector, the popularity of callable and noncallable bonds is significantly related to the economic environment. Financial and high-grade nonfinancial callable bonds are also more likely to be issued via a shelf prospectus. Although firms that issue callable bonds do not consistently display the characteristics associated with severe agency problems, the issue choice for below-investment-grade nonfinancial and lower rated financial bonds, where we can expect agency problems to be more severe, is more consistent with agency theory than is the issue choice for higher rated bonds.

Research Question/Issue: When the stock options granted to CEOs go underwater, boards of directors tend to award additional stock options to their CEOs. Drawing on agency theory and attribution theory, this study explores social psychological mechanisms that explain why boards of directors increase new option grants to CEOs in response to underwater options. Research Findings/Insights: Using the compensation data of CEOs at 966 US firms, we found that contextual factors such as market conditions and industry performance affected boards of directors' decisions to grant new stock options. Consistent with our hypotheses, boards of directors granted a greater number of new options to CEOs in response to CEOs' underwater options during the recession period than the recovery period, and they granted fewer new options when the firm's industry performance was high rather than low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study incorporates attribution theory in understanding boards of directors' causal attribution of firm performance and its impact on executive compensation. It complements earlier studies on causal attribution by exploring the role of contextual factors. It also contributes to the research by examining the attribution process of boards of directors rather than that of top management, as well as the consequences of the causal attribution in terms of ex-post adjustment in executive option compensation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides up-to-date and improved evidence on boards' decision making about executive stock options. Practitioners and policy makers can benefit from the study's findings that board members rely on contextual information about the market and the competition when they make causal attribution of firm performance changes, which tends to affect their decisions about executive compensation.

This research focuses on the relationship between corporate governance and performance in the largest European listed banks, which have been studied to a lesser extent within this field. The study is based on agency theory and we use a sample of 404 observations referring to 97 banks selected from the annual ranking of the 2,000 biggest companies in the world prepared by Forbes. The paper covers the period from 2006 to 2010, thus, examining the changes in the performance drivers in the recent financial crisis. On the basis of the panel data analysis, we confirm that the variety of governance factors including board size, insider appointed, directors' age, board meetings and affiliated committees influence the performance of the banks. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the effect of corporate governance on the financial performance of the financial companies in times of high capital market volatility.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

The study investigates the moderating effect of CEO (Chief Executive Officer) duality and CEO ownership on the relationship between organisational slack and firm performance. Through reviewing relevant literature on organisational slack, agency and stewardship theories, this study develops hypotheses on the relationship between organisational slack and firm performance and the moderations of CEO duality and CEO ownership. On the basis of a large data of Chinese firms, this study finds that there is a positive relationship between organisational slack and firm performance, and the moderating effect of CEO duality is positive, whereas that of CEO ownership is insignificant. The findings not only improve the understanding on the performance implication of organisational slack but also indicates that stewardship theory is more powerful than agency theory in China.

The paper aims at identifying impact of corporate governance variables i.e. board structure (board size, board independence, board activity and board busyness) and ownership structure (foreign promoters holding, institutional shareholding and CEO duality) on financial disclosures made by the Indian firms. Using cross sectional data of 325 listed firms for the financial year 2009-10, we compute financial disclosure score (using 171 checklist points) based on disclosure requirements of accounting standards. We find average disclosure score of 73%, maximum and minimum being 100% and 46% respectively. Our finding support agency theory in terms of monitoring role of board since board size is found to be significant however we do not find any influence of board independence on the disclosures. The study also supports resource dependency theory in terms of outside directorship which might provide exposure to different corporate environment, brings diverse perspectives and knowledge to the directors and this in turn leads to improved disclosures. We also support the notion that having foreign promoter shareholding improves disclosures. (c) 2014, Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

Family governance is a typical governance structure in publicly traded firms in Taiwan and around the world. The founding family of a firm can choose direct ownership or a pyramidal ownership structure to achieve control over a publicly traded family business or a family business group. In addressing performance issues in family businesses, the family ownership structure could generate positive or negative impacts on performance. Thus, determining the contingent condition that will moderate the relationship between family ownership and performance is a key concern in family businesses. Utilizing longitudinal data in family businesses in Taiwan's personal computer industry, this study examines the relationships between the roles of professional managers on the board, the family ownership structure, and the firm's performance from agency theory viewpoint. The results indicate that the professional manager's position on the board will moderate the relationship between the family ownership structure and performance. Specifically, the professional managers serving as directors will enhance the positive impact from family direct ownership on performance and mitigate the negative performance impact from family pyramidal ownership.

In this study, we examine the interactions among cooperation and five other factors that affect supply chain performance in the context of third party logistics services. We develop a new research model, with degree of cooperation as a mediating construct and test the model's six research hypotheses using structural equation modelling. The data are from 105 manufacturing firms in Taiwan. The results show that the major factors contributing to cooperation are, in order of importance, self-control costs, transaction frequency and external uncertainty. The findings demonstrate that supply chain members should reinforce their collaborative behavior and activities and enhance cooperation in supply chains to achieve higher levels of performance overall in third party logistics services.

The aim of this paper is to address the impact of certain audit committee characteristics identified by the ASX Corporate Governance Council on improving the effectiveness of corporate audit committees on the likelihood of financial distress. Using a sample of 155 listed Australian firms, this paper finds support for the argument that the adoption of some, but not all, recommendations concerning the formation of an audit committee is beneficial for firms, which in this paper is reflected in a reduced likelihood of financial distress. In particular, the presence of a financial expert and solely non-executive directors on audit committee are associated with lower financial distress likelihood. By contrast, chairperson duality is significantly positively related to the probability of financial distress. (c) Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The study investigates the impact of changes in dividend taxes on dividend payment policies and in turn, the impact of dividend payments on share prices. An event study approach is used to analyse the share price movements before, on and after dividend announcement dates. The results for companies of which the dividend paid resulted in an increase in the dividend payout ratio were that share prices responded positively to the announcement on the announcement date and for the few days thereafter. The findings again underline the paradoxical nature of dividends and although a better understanding of the impact of dividends on South African companies was gained, the dividend puzzle remains largely unsolved.

This article evaluates the efficiency of existing dividend distribution tax in India from the perspective of investors' preference pattern, as revealed in the market. It investigates the announcement effect of dividend in India in the presence of dividend distribution tax with specific legislative intent of discouraging dividend distribution. Using data on large profitable firms, we show that despite firm-level tax, higher dividend payout announcement leads to significant rise in share price. This implies that despite being tax-disadvantaged, investors of large profitable firms prefer higher payout, because it mitigates agency cost of retention. This shows that dividend distribution tax is inefficient. JEL Classification: G32, G35. (c) 2014, (c) 2014 SAGE Publications India Private Limited.

This study investigates a link between corporate governance and ownership structures on firm performance of 293 companies listed on the Main and Second Board of Bursa Malaysia from 2000- 2006. A dynamic panel system generalized method of moment technique is applied to control the endogeneity effect. After controlling for size, gearing, industry and time, this study finds significant positive relationships between institutional and foreign shareholdings using both market and accounting performance measures. These results imply their positive roles in constraining any opportunistic behavior of management. Interestingly, role duality (positions of Chairman and CEO were the same person) was observed to be negatively related to both performance measures, thus supporting the recommendation by Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG). However, contrary to agency theory and MCCG, firm performance decreases with the increase in proportion of independent directors in the board. (c) 2014, Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

This study investigates the valuation effect of board characteristics in corporate Joint Venture (JV) investments. Despite the prevalence of a board's involvement in JV decisions in practice, extant literature is mute concerning how the board adds value to JV outcomes. Investigation into board contribution in JVs is insightful due to executives' self-serving behaviors that may underlie their JV pursuits and boards' resource provision that may mitigate critical JV challenges. The former (latter) sheds light on the board's monitoring (advisory) role in a firm's JV engagement. Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study investigates the value of representative board characteristics underscored by these two theoretical perspectives. Our results show that the two conventional board measures, board size and outside director ratio, do not have a significant explanatory power. In contrast, director experience associated with JV decisions and gained from within relevant industries are found to positively impact JV outcomes. Moreover, both board meeting frequency and director ownership have favorable moderating effects on the strength of the experience-value relationship. However, these two variables per se do not independently determine a JV's value. Our research results indicate the importance of taking an integrative view to the investigation of board effectiveness, a perspective which has long been neglected in board research. The findings of the present study contribute to the mixed findings of extant studies on board influence from an uninvestigated domain, JV. (c), 2014, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

Purpose - Stewardship theory is an emergent approach for explaining leadership behavior, challenging the assumptions of agency theory and its dominance in corporate governance literature. This study revisits the agency and stewardship theories by seeking to answer whether chief executive officers (CEOs) in China are committed stewards or opportunistic agents.
Practical implications - One size does not fit all. Leadership behaviors in China do not follow the agency assumptions inherent in Western practices, rather they favor the conditions of positive leadership expressed by the stewardship theory. Assuming that the motivations of managers in emerging markets such as China are similar to those in the West may lead to a poor fit between governance policies and the institutional context.
Design/methodology/approach - Based on 5,165 observations of 1,036 listed companies in China over the period 2005-2010, the results suggest that the corporate governance mechanisms developed from the agency theory in the West are not necessarily applicable in the Chinese context.
Findings - This study supports the stewardship theory in its findings that empowering CEOs through the practice of CEO duality and longer CEO tenure have a positive effect on firm value in China. Additionally, the positive relationships between CEO duality, CEO tenure and firm value are strengthened by the number of executive directors on the board, and weakened by the number of independent directors on the board.
Originality/value - As one of the few studies to connect the theoretical debate between the agency and stewardship theories, this study presents new evidence to support the stewardship theory, thereby strengthening its theoretical importance and relevance in corporate governance literature.

Compared to other transactions, corporate divestiture is characterized by greater ambiguity and lower transparency, which can be detrimental to stock market reaction. Drawing upon agency theory and information economics literature, this paper examines the relationship between information asymmetries, family ownership and the divestiture financial performance in Western European countries. Based on a sample of 115 Western European divestiture transactions carried out between 1996 and 2010, we find support for the assertion that information asymmetry impacts divestiture financial performance. We also show that the influence of information asymmetries is moderated by family ownership, which acts as a signal of divestiture quality.

This paper investigates the tax and agency explanations of corporate payout policy by investigating the likelihood, the level and the method of payout in founder and family firms. Controlling founders and families are both subject to the tax disadvantage of dividends arising from their substantial shareholdings, but family firms are arguably subject to more severe agency conflicts than founder firms due to their susceptibility to wasteful expenditure and the adverse effects of intra-family conflicts. Results indicate that founder firms on average are less likely and pay a lower level of dividends than family firms. Moreover, founder firms prefer share repurchase over dividends as the main method of payout whereas family firms prefer dividends over share repurchase. Overall, our findings are consistent with the agency explanation of corporate payout policy.

The interest in researching corporate governance in the broader context continues unabated. The research in this area continues to be dominated by test of agency theory in advanced capitalist economies. Few researches are seen in developing countries like Nigeria. Though there have been calls for new theories to be tested in the field of corporate governance, only few have been tested, predominantly stakeholder and resource dependence theories (Barkema and Gomez-Mejia, 1998). This paper departs from previous literature in two ways. First, it tests the identity theory. Second, it uses the case study drawing empirical data from Nigeria, an emerging economy from a developing capital market to provide insights into the corporate governance mechanisms. This study explores appropriate framework and principles governing the duties and obligations of directors, auditors and secretaries. This is crucial because there is increased reliance by the stakeholders on the three actors (directors, auditors and secretaries) as it concern corporate governance both regionally and internationally. Therefore, an exploratory case study was carried out to explore the level of development of corporate governance mechanism in developing economies like Nigeria. Despite the huge challenges, issues and bottlenecks hampering good corporate governance, the study finds growth in the number of directorships, auditors and secretaries of listed companies. Also, the study reveals the code governing the responsibilities of directors; auditors and secretaries have not produced the desired result pertaining to accountability, transparency and good corporate financial reporting. Thus this adds to the body of knowledge by contributing to the corporate governance system in developing countries. (c) 2014, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

This chapter examines the theoretical foundations of Governance Ethics and in doing so, it challenges pertinent aspects of the standard economic theory of the firm, in particular the exclusion of ethical and political aspects from the epistemic interests of economics. Governance ethics has to be understood as a contribution to the development of a new economics of organization. Its aim is to combine foundations and findings of ethics, social theory, organization theory and economics of governance in a productive way in order to improve the practical relevance and the theoretical explanatory force of an economic theory of the firm. What is at issue is the integration of organizational, social, psychological, cultural and above all moral phenomena in an economics of governance which takes an interdisciplinary understanding of economics and a comprehensive concept of governance as its starting point. This endeavor is based on the assumption that a general and at the same time application-oriented theory of economic organization and monitoring cannot be achieved without this ethical, social-theoretical and organization-theoretical extension of standard and mainstream economics.

This Chapter aims at analysing the role of the incentive and rewarding mechanism in the loose coupling PMS. Thus, it firstly identifies the purposes of the incentive and rewarding mechanism in the PMS, namely motivation, information, and recruitment and retention. After a brief introduction to the incentive theories, the discussion starts from the investigation of the incentive and rewarding process, which is composed of three main phases; the selection of the performance measures to be used in the assessment phase, the assessment and its frequency, and the model selection. Finally, the last sections provide theoretical and practical insights into the assessment of the incentive and rewarding mechanism and the dysfunctional effects resulting from the use of biased incentive and rewarding mechanisms.

The aim of this paper is to provide empirical evidence regarding the effect of insider ownership on firm value which stems from the lack of such study for the case of Romania. By using a sample of companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, over the period 2007-2011, our results showed a negative effect of insider shareholdings on firm value. Likewise, the negative effect on firm value was confirmed for insider ownership one-year lagged. Thereby, unconcerned to the level of shareholdings, we ascertained the entrenchment effect, opposite to the goal of shareholders wealth maximization. (c) 2014 Econjournals. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have tried to make a comparative analysis between the market-oriented system and the mixed governance system on the determinants of stock option awards for managers; however, these studies exhibit some failures that must be overcome. In addition, we note the absence of studies addressing the validity of the agency theory on the determinants of equity-based compensation in times of instability or crisis. We used a sample of 159 French companies and 203 US companies for the period spanning 2002 to 2010. The results of the present study support the conclusion that the variables measuring the size of the firm, growth opportunity, debt, management and control functions, size of the board, and ownership concentration explain the decision to grant equity-based compensation, regardless of the sample and period considered. Using a variable representing the presence of institutional investors, we show that this type of investor is only involved in controlling the leader in the French case, during a period of financial instability.

We study the relation between initial IPO underpricing and two-tier board structure in the Vienna Stock Exchange of Austria, where a two-tier board is mandatory for listed companies. The board ratio, defined as the size of the supervisory board to the management board, is used to capture the effect of two-tiered board on underpricing. The results show that the board ratio is negatively related with underpricing, consistent with the agency theory which predicts that more effective monitoring implied in a relatively larger supervisory board will lead to lower agency costs, and thus lower underpricing. The results are robust to the inclusion of control variables and suggest that firms seeking to raise external capital will be helped by adopting strong corporate governance standards.

In the last decade regulatory pressure includes appeals that corporate elites should reduce their multiple directorships to a minimum. The functionality of this governance mechanism is suggested by agency theory. The embeddedness view counter-argues that social relationships matter for the effectiveness of corporate governance. In particular for ill-structured tasks like stock price valuation social networks solve fundamental coordination problems in markets by reducing the risks of market exchange, by establishing a common base of recognition and by getting actions and blocking actions. For the Swiss banking sector this article shows that the social embeddedness of corporate elites reduces the volatility of stock prices. With respect to regulatory pressure against multiple directorships it recommends a more balanced view. While for investors and stakeholders certain amounts of stock price volatility are surly desirable, exorbitant fluctuations of stock prices - like in financial crises - are definitely not. Social embeddedness should therefore be considered by economic and financial theory: it does prevent the misspecification of regulatory proposals and incentive regimes.

Scholars are divided over whether listing the shares of stock exchanges improves their financial performance. Applying simple OLS regressions, I test the hypothesis that exchanges' post-IPO owners are value maximizers. However, recently demutualized exchanges have a high proportion of shareholders with conflicts of interest. Therefore, I also test whether different types of shareholders have different effects on performance. I find that investment managers behave like true value maximizers. The results also show that a higher fragmentation of share ownership is associated with lower performance. The proportion of brokers, who are the most conflicted shareholders in exchanges (since they are large customers as well as owners), is too small to have a measurable effect on performance. Most interestingly I find, by way of an inductive approach to shareholding structure, that strategic shareholders, a wide array of investors with various agendas, are on balance detrimental to shareholder value. This chapter is the first in a trilogy of articles that make up my Ph.D. dissertation. It is followed by an in-depth study of the shareholding structure of individual stock exchanges, notably in order to understand more clearly who these strategic investors are and what effects they have on exchanges.

This work concerns the study of the influence of governance mechanisms on the performance of listed companies in different contexts, with evidence for nonlinear relationships. The sample consisting of 146 companies is grouped in 46 Portuguese and 100 British companies. The multiple linear regression and nonlinear regression were used. It was concluded that the influence of governance mechanisms on the performance of companies in different contexts is diverse and that there are nonlinear relationships whose effect represents an important contribution to understand the governance model.

Evaluating agency theory and optimal contracting theory views of corporate philanthropy, we find that as corporate giving increases, shareholders reduce their valuation of firm cash holdings. Dividend increases following the 2003 Tax Reform Act are associated with reduced corporate giving. Using a natural experiment, we find that corporate giving is positively (negatively) associated with CEO charity preferences (CEO shareholdings and corporate governance quality). Evidence from CEO-affiliated charity donations, market reactions to insider-affiliated donations, its relation to CEO compensation, and firm contributions to director-affiliated charities indicates that corporate donations advance CEO interests and suggests misuses of corporate resources that reduce firm value.

Although studies about the determinants of CEO compensation are ubiquitous, the balance of evidence for one of the more controversial theoretical approaches, managerial power theory, remains inconclusive. The authors provide a meta-analysis of 219 U.S.-based studies, focusing on the relationships between indicators of managerial power and levels of CEO compensation and CEO pay-performance sensitivities. The results indicate that managerial power theory is well equipped for predicting core compensation variables such as total cash and total compensation but less so for predicting the sensitivity of pay to performance. In most situations where CEOs are expected to have power over the pay setting process, they receive significantly higher levels of total cash and total compensation. In contrast, where boards are expected to have more power, CEOs receive lower total cash and total compensation. In addition, powerful directors also appear to be able to establish tighter links between CEO compensation and firm performance and can accomplish this even in the face of powerful CEOs. The authors discuss the implications for theory and research regarding the determinants of executive compensation. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

This research investigates the relationship between board gender diversity and firm financial performance in the context of a transitional economy characterised by an underdeveloped corporate governance system. Using a sample of 120 publicly listed companies in Vietnam covering a 4-year period from 2008 to 2011, we examine this relationship in a dynamic modelling framework, which controls for potential sources of endogeneity. We find that board gender diversity appears to have an effect on firm performance. This finding remains robust when alternative proxies for gender diversity are employed and is consistent with the perspectives of agency theory and resource dependence theory. The number of female directors in the boardroom also matters, supporting the view that if female board representation affects firm outcomes, this effect is more pronounced when the number of female directors increases. It is observed, furthermore, that the marginal positive performance effect of board gender diversity ceases when the percentage of female directors reaches a breakpoint of about 20%. This finding suggests that there is perhaps a potential trade-off between the costs and benefits of board gender diversification. Our findings significantly contribute to the growing literature of non-US based studies, by providing robust empirical evidence from a transitional economy in East Asia. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, the relationship between ownership concentration and financial performance of companies in Singapore and Vietnam is investigated in a dynamic framework. By focusing on two different types of national governance systems (well-developed vs. under-developed), we observe how the relationship is moderated by the national governance quality. We find that the performance effect of concentrated ownership persists in these markets even after the dynamic nature of the ownership concentration-performance relationship is taken into consideration. Our finding supports the prediction of agency theory about the efficient monitoring effect of large shareholders in markets with highly concentrated ownership. In addition, we find that national governance quality does matter when explaining the ownership concentration-performance relationship. The positive effect of concentrated ownership on performance of firms operating in the under-developed national governance system (Vietnam) tends to be stronger than that in the well-established system (Singapore). This finding is consistent with the argument that ownership concentration is an efficient corporate governance mechanism which can substitute for weak national governance quality. Econometrically, our findings still hold even after controlling for dynamic endogeneity, simultaneity, and unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity, inherent in the corporate governance-performance relationship.

By complementing agency theory with behavioral assumptions, we explore the effects of family involvement on small and medium enterprises' (SMEs) performance. We identify three separate dimensions of family involvement and hypothesize nonlinear, direct, and interaction effects on the performance of an SME. The evidence on 787 SMEs suggests that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between family ownership and performance, and ownership dispersion among family members negatively affects performance. Balancing family and nonfamily members in the top management team (TMT) is found to be beneficial to SMEs' performance, but the family ratio in the TMT becomes crucial only at high levels of family ownership.

This paper investigates the effect of the 2009 guidance of the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs on greenhouse gas (GHG) disclosure. The sample comprises 215 companies from a population of London Stock Exchange FTSE 350 companies over four years (2008-2011). To quantify GHG disclosure, a research index methodology is employed, with information derived from several GHG reporting frameworks. The econometric model is estimated using panel fixed effects. Our findings suggest that the publication of the 2009 guidance has had a significant effect on the level of GHG disclosure, and that corporate governance mechanisms (board size, director ownership, and ownership concentration) also affect the extent of GHG information disclosure. The results also indicate that companies increased their disclosures prior to the 2009 guidance in anticipation of its publication. These results have important implications for the government, suggesting that non-mandatory guidance could increase disclosure as much as do mandatory requirements. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine whether the extent and type of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures made by Indian public listed companies are associated with firm ownership and board characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - Data analysis is based on the top 100 companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (2007-2011) using a 17-item CSR disclosure measure. Findings - The extent of CSR disclosure is positively associated with foreign ownership, government ownership and board independence and negatively associated with CEO duality. Promoter ownership has a negligible effect on the extent of CSR disclosure. In terms of the type of CSR disclosure, community information increases with government ownership and board independence, while environmental information expands with foreign ownership and board independence. Information on employees/ human resources has a positive association with foreign ownership but decreases with CEO duality. The amount of product and services information increases with promoter ownership, foreign ownership and board independence and CEO duality. Practical implications - Given the positive impact independent directors have on the extent of CSR disclosure, their role can be further strengthened in terms of overseeing quality of information disclosed. Stakeholders and regulators will need to develop greater awareness of firm CSR disclosure biases associated with ownership and more carefully scrutinize firm CSR activities that firms are "not" reporting on. Originality/value - Empirical evidence on the link between corporate governance and CSR disclosure from a developing nation context is limited. This paper provides much needed evidence in this area from India - one of the largest, rapidly developing economies in the world. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Organizational performance can be enhanced by effective project benefit generation. Although it identifies the project owner as the single point of accountability for the realization of project benefits, the literature does not comprehensively discuss this role in the project governance model, nor the management approaches that can support this role. Based on principal-agent theory and a control-trust-risk approach, we have conducted an empirical study across various managerial contexts. Results suggest that trust of the project owner in the project manager is more effective in a turbulent environment, whereas more control by the project owner of the project management process is a superior management approach in a more stable project setting. Finally, a project governance model is introduced and the management role of the project owner is discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Family firms and business groups play an important role in many emerging economies. In this paper we study how different aspects of family involvement influence technological innovation in a firm. Arguments drawn from agency theory and particularly the principal-principal agency hypothesize a negative influence of family involvement with respect to technological innovation. In contrast, stewardship theory predicts a positive influence of family involvement on technological innovation. Drawing on these theoretical lenses with contrasting directionalities with regard to the impact of family involvement on technological innovation, we study how family involvement in ownership, management and board of directors, and business group affiliation influence R&D investments and patents obtained by the firm. The hypotheses are empirically tested on a seven-year panel of 172 firms from the pharmaceutical industry in India. Our results indicate that family shareholding and family control over both CEO and chairperson positions have a positive and significant influence on the firm's R&D investments, broadly lending support to stewardship theory. We also find a positive influence of business group affiliation on R&D investments and patents applied by the firm. Our conjecture is that the high technology opportunity environment in the Indian pharmaceutical industry facilitates stewardship behavior which in turn promotes innovation in these firms.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

We review what the financial economics literature has to say about the unique ways in which the following three classic agency problems manifest themselves in family firms: (a) shareholders versus managers, (b) controlling (family) shareholders versus noncontrolling shareholders, and (c) shareholders versus creditors. We also call attention to a fourth agency problem that is unique to family firms: the conflict of interest between family shareholders and the family at large, which can be thought of as the "superprincipal" in a multi-tier agency structure akin to those found in other concentrated ownership structures in which the controlling owner is the state, a bank, a corporation, or other institutions. We then discuss the solutions or corporate governance mechanisms that have been devised to address these problems and what research has taught us about these mechanisms' effectiveness at solving these four conflicts in family firms.

Internationally, disclosures related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy usage have increased dramatically due to trends toward increased sustainability reporting, growing concerns about climate change, and the introduction of new legislation and taxes. Audit committees, management, internal auditors, external auditors, and other stakeholders all have a potential role in relation to GHG disclosures. Our study addresses the role of internal auditors. We conducted 29 interviews with senior audit committee members, senior accountants, in-house internal auditors, and partners specializing in internal audit from the major accounting firms. These interviews allowed us to gain insights into the present role of internal auditors in GHG/energy reporting, the factors explaining internal audit's role, and the future role of internal audit. In addition, audit committee members describe their present involvement in GHG/energy reporting. We consider the consistency of our findings with three corporate governance theories (agency theory, institutional theory, and resource dependence theory). Although our results support the importance of effective monitoring consistent with agency theory, no one theory fully explains our results. (c) 2015, American Accounting Association.

Prior work based on agency theory and behavioral agency model has focused on how absolute pay values affect firm outcomes. Departing from this traditional approach, we draw from behavioral decision theory to explain how relative pay levels influence firm risk taking. We investigate how CEO restricted stock value relative to reference point influences R&D intensity in high-technology firms. We propose that negative deviation increases are related to R&D increases and positive deviation increases lead to R&D decreases, while negative deviation has greater effect than positive deviation. We establish theoretical boundary conditions by considering CEO duality and board vigilance as moderators. Drawing from agency theory, we predict the main effects will be enhanced under duality and weakened under high board vigilance. Our hypotheses are largely supported.

This study examines the influence of board independence on firm agency cost among listed firms in Bangladesh, which feature concentrated ownership and high insider representation on corporate boards. This study uses three measures of agency cost: the 'expense ratio', the 'Q-free cash flow interaction' and the 'asset utilization ratio'. The finding of the study is that board independence can reduce the firm agency cost only under 'asset utilization ratio' measure of agency cost. These findings are robust to several robustness tests. Furthermore, the non-linearity tests suggest that the benefit of outside independent directors is generally plausible as a factor controlling agency costs in the case of a medium level of board independence. Overall, these findings do not reject the validity of agency theory, supporting the Anglo-American orthodoxy promoting outside independent directors as good monitors.

We examine the role of voluntary adoption of corporate governance mechanisms in mitigating the financial distress status of firms. Using a sample of 171 financially distressed and 106 healthy listed Australian firms over the 5-year period prior to the introduction of the ASX Corporate Governance Council Code in 2003, we find support for the argument that the adoption of certain corporate governance mechanisms is beneficial for firms, as reflected in a reduced likelihood of financial distress. In particular, greater levels of blockholder and director ownership and the existence of a separate audit committee are associated with lower financial distress likelihood. We also find causal evidence that the voluntary adoption of particular corporate governance structures leads to lower levels of financial distress, rather than financial distress recognition leading to corporate governance structural reform.

Relying on an alternative theoretical framework (i.e. institutional theory), rather than the dominant agency theory, this paper examines the connections between corporate governance mechanisms and good practices, as informed by an empirical and contextual analysis. On the basis of research methods triangulation, this study presents nine specific antecedents of good corporate governance in weak institutional settings (Nigeria). The study proposes how each of these antecedents must be understood, articulated and harnessed, on the basis of relevant institutional peculiarities, in order to address contextual governance challenges. This study adds to the institutional theorising of good corporate governance, by paying attention to the context (African), efficiency (instrumentality) and legitimacy (symbolic) in explaining the firm-level drivers of good governance practices in an international business environment.

We examine the effect of family control on IFRS mandatory disclosure levels, and the valuation implications of these disclosure levels, for Malaysian companies. We find that family control is related negatively to disclosure and that compliance levels are not value relevant. These findings suggest that agency theory predictions and theories linking common law legal systems to high quality financial reporting require refining in certain national contexts. Where Type 2 agency problems dominate, institutional arrangements intended to enhance financial reporting quality aimed at mitigating Type 1 problems in developed markets may have limited effect in less developed jurisdictions.

This study examines the association between Chinese stock issuers' board characteristics and dividends. We focus on the gender of CEO and accompanying board members, as well as other salient board demographics and characteristics. Using more than 9,000 firm-year observations, we observe little difference in the dividend distributions of female- and male-led Chinese firms. Other salient demographics, notably CEO age and tenure bear a strong positive association with cash distributions. Cash pay-out is also increasing in directors' equity stakes and state ownership. In a general sense, the proportion of independent directors on boards bears only limited association with cash pay-out. However, in state-invested entities, greater independent director presence acts as a brake against cash distributions. We challenge a lingering perception in the investment literature that women are significantly more risk-averse than men. Cross-cultural theory suggests that risk aversion is manifest in greater cash retention and thus lower pay-outs (Bae, Chang, & Kang, The Journal of Financial Research, 35(2): 289-316, 2012; Khambata & Liu, Journal of Asia-Pacific Business, 6(4): 31-43, 2005). Building on this literature, and extending it specifically to gender, our results are consistent with male and female CEOs displaying comparable levels of risk aversion. They are also congruent with "financial knowledge" lessening gender-based differences in risk aversion (Hibbert, Lawrence, & Prakash, Global Finance Journal, 24: 140-152, 2013) and/or its general absence in the specific field of financial decisions (Schubert, Brown, Gysler, & Brachinger, The American Economic Review, 89(2): 381-385, 1999). We also emphasize theory on managerial power (Allen, Social Forces, 60(2): 482-494, 1981) and entrenchment. Results for CEO tenure and age support notions of CEO entrenchment, while those for duality do not. In contrast to agency theory, but consistent with tunneling arguments, the present study stresses the overarching role of state-ownership in increasing (decreasing) cash (stock) payouts. We observe non-monotonic effects in this relation, thus extending related findings elsewhere (Huang, Chen, & Kao, Asia Pacific Journal of Management, 29: 39-58, 2012).

Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries--often labeled "lack of transparency"--between top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high.

There remains a good deal of uncertainty as to whether and under which governance conditions family firms, even large, publicly traded ones, are entrepreneurial. We shall argue that agency theory, behavioral agency perspectives, and the resource-based view all posit both positive and negative influences regarding entrepreneurship in family firms, while empirical studies, collectively, are no less ambiguous in their findings. We use each of the above theories to propose various governance distinctions that can reconcile these contradictions and suggest when family firms will be most and least entrepreneurial.

Purpose - Communication of risk management (RM) practices are a critical component of good corporate governance. Research, to date, has been of little benefit in informing regulators internationally. This paper seeks to contribute to the literature by investigating how listed Australian companies disclose RM information in annual report governance statements in accordance with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) corporate governance framework. Design/methodology/approach - To address this study's research questions and related hypotheses, the authors examine the top 300 ASX-listed companies by market capitalisation at 30 June 2010. For these firms, the authors identify, code and categorise RM disclosures made in the annual according to the disclosure categories specified in ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (CGPR). The derived data are then examined using a comprehensive approach comprising thematic content analysis and regression analysis. Findings - The results indicate widespread divergence in disclosure practices and low conformance with the Principle 7 of the ASX CGPR. This result suggests that companies are not disclosing all "material business risks" possibly due to ignorance at the board level, or due to the intentional withholding of sensitive information from financial statement users. The findings also show mixed results across the factors expected to influence disclosure behaviour. While the presence of a risk committee (RC) (in particular, a standalone RC) and technology committee (TC) are found to be associated with some improvement in disclosure levels, the authors do not find evidence that company risk measures (as proxied by equity beta and the market-to-book ratio) are significantly associated with greater levels of RM disclosure. Also, contrary to common findings in the disclosure literature, factors such as board independence and expertise, audit committee independence and the usage of a Big-4 auditor do not seem to impact the level of RM disclosure in the Australian context. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited by the sample and study period selection as the RM disclosures of only the largest (top 300) ASX firms are examined for the fiscal year 2010. Thus, the findings may not be generalisable to smaller firms or earlier/later years. Also, the findings may have limited applicability in other jurisdictions with different regulatory environments. Practical implications - The study's findings suggest that insufficient attention has been applied to RM disclosures by listed companies in Australia. These results suggest RM disclosures practices observed in the Australian setting may not be meeting the objectives of regulators and the needs of stakeholders. Originality/value - The Australian setting provides an ideal environment to examine RM communication as the ASX has explicitly recommended RM disclosures areas in its principle-based governance rules since 2007 (Principle 7). This differs from other jurisdictions where such disclosure recommendations are typically not provided and provides us with a benchmark to examine the nature and quality of RM disclosures. Despite the recommendation, the authors reveal that low levels and poor RM communication are prevalent in the Australian setting and warrant further investigation.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of corporate governance on intellectual capital (IC) in top service firms in Australia. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the agency theory, the paper develops hypotheses about relationships between corporate governance mechanisms (chief executive officer [CEO] duality, board size, board composition and subcommittee composition) and IC. The study uses a multiple regression analysis on data collected from corporate annual reports of 300 firm-year observations. Findings - The findings of the regression analysis indicate that CEO duality, board composition and remuneration committee composition are significantly associated with IC. In contrast, there is no evidence that board size and audit committee composition have an effect on IC. The study contributes to agency theory in general and the literature on IC and corporate governance more specifically. Practical implications - The findings of the study might be of interest to regulators, investment analysts, shareholders, company directors and managers in Australia, as well as academics, in designing corporate governance mechanisms to develop IC. Originality/value - Corporate governance is country-specific and, hence, its impact on managerial decisions leading to IC is different from country to country. This study provides empirical evidence on the relationship between corporate governance and IC in top service firms in Australia. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - How family businesses (FBs) manage to survive in the long term is still not well understood in FB research. A promising concept to explain survivability, that is currently heavily discussed in the management literature is organizational ambidexterity (OA) - the ability to balance exploring and exploiting activities at the same time. However, FB research has not yet taken sufficient advantage of the potential of OA to contribute to explaining the ability of later-generation FBs to survive. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - Using central tenets of agency theory, this conceptual paper draws together findings from the FB literature and the OA literature to create a framework for the relationship between family involvement and the ability to reach high levels of OA. Findings - Seven propositions are developed which suggest that the level of family involvement in ownership and management affect the ability of later-generation FBs to reach high levels of OA. They further suggest that the number of family shareholders, the existence of majority family shareholders, and generational involvement of the controlling family in management moderate these relationships. Originality/value - This is the first paper to theoretically analyze OA in later-generation FBs. The seven propositions and avenues for further research presented in this paper are intended to motivate FB research to take a closer look at OA. This may be crucial to better explaining and predicting one of business-owning families' most important goals: the long-term survival of the FB. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747.

Over the past decade, expectations for more effective oversight of risks by boards of directors have significantly increased. These expectations emanate from stock exchanges, regulators, credit rating agencies and other key stakeholders. Proponents of enhanced risk oversight argue that an increased understanding of enterprise-wide risks provides strategic benefit by helping the board and management identify and manage risks that may impact the achievement of strategic objectives while at the same time helping the board monitor the extent of risk-taking on the part of management in their desire to meet these objectives. In response to these growing expectations, some boards have asked management to explore implementation of a more holistic, top-down approach to risk oversight widely known as enterprise risk management (ERM) while others have not. Institutional theory would suggest that a number of organizations implement minimal elements of ERM for symbolic reasons, lacking substance in risk oversight. In contrast, agency theory would suggest that boards embrace explicit and robust risk oversight activities to monitor management's risk-taking actions, and resource dependence theory would suggest that they also do so to help the organization achieve strategic objectives. Little is known about the way in which boards and management organize their processes and the impact of those processes on the level of ERM adoption. More importantly, little is known about the extent to which ERM is perceived to provide strategic benefit to those organizations that have invested in developing a robust ERM process. Based on data gathered from 645 survey responses from executives of organizations spanning a number of industries and sizes, we find that organizations with greater ERM maturity are significantly more likely to have taken steps to formally engage the board and senior management in specific risk oversight tasks (consistent with agency theory), and certain board and management risk practices are associated with perceptions that ERM provides strategic advantage (consistent with resource dependence theory).

Family business succession is a complex and challenging process, in which family members often build on the support of trusted advisors who can be seen as the most relied external source of advice and knowledge that family businesses draw on. Based on an extensive literature review, this article aims to synthesize prior research on both advisors and succession to systematically describe and analyze the role of trusted advisors during the succession-planning process. Based on arguments from agency theory, we discuss potential benefits and drawbacks associated with the involvement of trusted advisors along the four phases-trigger, preparation, selection, and training-of the succession-planning process and outline how trusted advisors can mitigate but also enhance agency costs-in particular goal divergence and information asymmetry-during each of these four phases. Subsequently, we discuss four typical constellations of advisor involvement, which vary in their agency costs and thus have different levels of bias and efficiency. We thereby outline several inefficiencies that result from the common setup in which an incumbent and a successor both rely on their own trusted advisors or a team of expert advisors and propose a balanced and efficient model of advisor involvement as a potential solution which reduces the agency costs. This conceptual article contributes to research on succession, agency theory, and trusted advisors in family firms. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

An effective board of directors is central to agency theory's prescription to solving the problems of separation of ownership from control in the modern corporation. The shareholders' confidence in the board's ability to fulfil its duties is an important measure of the success or otherwise of this cornerstone of agency theory. The Board Shareholder Confidence Index focuses on the board of directors and is the standard by which Canadian governance best practices are measured. This paper investigates the relationship between board effectiveness and company performance. Using a sample of 699 firm year observations from 2003 to 2009, we find a positive association between the firm's measure of board effectiveness and the firm's contemporaneous and future market measure of performance, Tobin's Q. The results hold across a number of econometric models that control for different types of endogeneities. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores the relation between corporate governance and asymmetric information. We find that proxies for governance mechanisms that encourage the monitoring of managers are inversely related to proxies for asymmetric information. Specifically, greater board independence, board activeness and debt financing are significantly and inversely related to the degree of asymmetric information as reflected in bid-ask spreads, volatility of share returns, normalised share trade volumes and market value of shares traded. This implies that corporate governance mechanisms that enhance managerial monitoring lead to improvements in the informational environment of the firm. (c) 2015 The Authors.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We analyze CEO turnover in closely held firms with some level of ownership dispersion in a context of low investor protection. In particular, we examine the impact of family involvement on CEO turnover and CEO turnover/performance sensitivity. We argue that family involvement in management, ownership, and control has both a direct effect on CEO turnover from the family presence itself, and a moderating effect over CEO turnover/performance sensitivity attributable to the agency tensions between majority and minority shareholders (whether other family blocks or non-family shareholders). Research Findings/Insights: Using data from 1996-2006 for 523 Colombian firms, we find direct and moderating effects, depending on the type of family involvement. Family involvement in management and boards reduces CEO turnover, but family involvement in ownership increases it. Regarding moderating effects, family involvement in ownership reduces CEO turnover/performance sensitivity, while the opposite occurs with family directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results show that closely held firms in emerging markets exhibit a strong negative CEO turnover/performance sensitivity, which is a somewhat counterintuitive result, and also contribute to a better understanding of agency conflicts within family firms by highlighting the different ways families affect CEO turnover. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings suggest that even benevolently entrenched family CEOs are not immune to poor financial performance. Families that are majority or controlling shareholders may support CEOs even when the firm performs poorly because of potential benefits from control. Family boards are very sensitive to financial performance even when the CEO is a family member. (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

We provide evidence on the effect of corporate governance on the extent of corporate risk-taking. Provided by the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), our governance metrics are among the most comprehensive in the literature. Our results show that firms with more effective governance exhibit corporate strategies that are significantly less risky. Left to their own devices, managers tend to take excessive risk. Effective governance, however, reduces the degree of risk-taking significantly. Exploiting the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as an exogenous shock that improves governance quality, we show that the effect of corporate governance on risk-taking is likely causal.

Empirical examinations of the links between corporate governance and intellectual capital are underresearched, particularly from the context of emerging economies where corporate governance mechanisms tend to be largely ceremonial due to family dominance. This study aims to address this gap in the intellectual capital disclosure (ICD) literature by undertaking an empirical examination of the relationship between corporate governance and the extent of ICD of Bangladeshi companies. Inter alia, the key findings of this study suggest that there is a non-linear relationship between family ownership and the extent of ICD. This research also found that foreign ownership, board independence, and the presence of audit committees are positively associated with the extent of ICD. Conversely, family duality (i.e., where the positions of CEO and chairperson are occupied by two individuals from the same family) is negatively associated with the extent of ICD.

What is the impact of long-term executive compensation, particularly large pension payouts, on the firm's current dividend policy? We argue that managers with high pension holdings are less likely to adopt a high dividend policy that can risk their future pension payouts. Using a hand-collected actuarial pension dataset we show that (i) dividend payments are significantly lower when manager compensation relies more heavily on pension payouts; (ii) higher compensation leverage and inside debt have a significant negative effect on dividend payments net of stock repurchases; and (iii) the negative effect of pension on dividend is significantly weaker when pensions are protected in a pre-funding rabbi trust. We show further that this agency behavior reduces firm performance. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we examine the relationship between government ownership and dividend policy. Using a multinational sample of newly privatised firms from 43 countries, we find strong and robust evidence indicating that dividend payout is negatively related to government ownership, consistent with the predictions of agency theory. We also find that country-level corporate governance affects the relationship between government ownership and dividend policy. Specifically, the adverse effects of government ownership on dividend policy are more pronounced in countries with weak law and order and a lower level of checks and balances. Our results are important, as they show that government ownership, as well as the institutional environment, does in fact affect the critical corporate policies, such as dividend policy, of newly privatised firms.

Through construction contracts, clients and contractors are involved in principal-agent relationships. These relationships are argued to be adversarial and characterised by two main features of contracting parties, as follows: (1) different goals, and (2) different attitudes to risk. Agency-related problems contribute to the project participants concentrating on risks associated with their own parts of projects instead of joint risk management (JRM). Fewer studies have discussed JRM, although risk-sharing is a key issue in principal-agent relationships and agency-related problems must be effectively addressed to establish strong collaboration. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate how project participants address problems associated with principal-agent relationships and thereby enhance cooperative relationships (and JRM). The empirical findings are based on two longitudinal case studies and show that strong collaboration is a multidimensional activity that is crucial for JRM. Effective JRM is highly dependent on strategies for fostering relationships and collaboration (such as cooperative procurement, establishment of common goals, and open communication), and should be implemented together with these strategies.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide insights into the understanding of the relationship between board involvement and corporate performance within the context of developing countries. Design/methodology/approach - A number of aspects related to board involvement, including board's shareholdings, frequency of board meetings, availability of independent board committees, board size, CEO duality, and CEO is being a promoter, were examined in order to explore their influence on corporate performance measured in terms of earnings per share. The study mainly draws on agency theory, and is supplemented by resource dependence and stewardship theories. Multiple regression analysis is utilized to analyze the data gathered from a sample of 212 publicly listed companies in 20 industries in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings - Among the aspects of board involvement considered, board's shareholdings, board meetings frequency, independent committees, and CEO duality showed a positive influence on corporate performance. However, two other aspects, namely CEO being a promoter, and the size of corporate boards showed a negative effect. The findings also suggest that the use of multiple theories, rather than depending on a single theory, is more effective in understanding the relationships examined in this study. Further, the study highlights the need to be cautious in utilizing the theories that are more applicable to matured western economies when analyzing issues relating to developing countries. Originality/value - This study makes an original contribution to corporate governance literature by examining the relationship between board involvement and corporate performance in a developing country, namely Sri Lanka. The study also adds to the existing literature by utilizing multiple theories to examine the issue under investigation. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Unlike business models of private banks based on profit maximization and shareholder-oriented governance, alternative banks (such as cooperative banks, government savings banks, and special purpose banks) share business models based on sustainable returns with longer time horizons, corporate missions that include social and public policy goals, and stakeholder-oriented governance. Strong evidence from recent research suggests that alternative banks often equal or outperform joint-stock banks in terms of efficiency, profitability, and risk management. This counters core ideas in contemporary banking theory and expectations of regulators about the superiority of private ownership and market-based banking. Concepts and theories from banking studies help explain how alternative banks outperform private banks in core functions such as creating and managing liquidity, pooling deposits, and reducing information asymmetries and agency costs. However, heterodox theories of the firm and institutional approaches to competitive advantage broaden the scope of analysis to explain further historical, social, and organizational advantages (and risks) in alternative banking. Alternative banks therefore require, and may inspire, alternative theories of banking and new approaches to bank regulation. (c) Walter de Gruyter GmbH. All rights reserved.

This study investigates how franchising chains use advertising to enhance coordination and improve their control over prices set at franchised outlets. We argue that chains use price advertising to inform customers about their desired prices, thereby influencing franchisees to adopt the advertised prices although they are not contractually required to do so. We test our hypotheses using rich outlet-level price data collected before and after a U.S. nationwide advertising campaign by McDonald's. Our findings indicate that advertising is an effective mechanism that franchising chains use to improve their control over franchisees, enhance uniformity, and reduce franchisee free-riding.

Purpose - Drawing upon the resource dependence theory, the purpose of this paper is to examine how the board capital diversity influences the explorative innovation of firms, attempting to resolve the inconsistent empirical findings of the effect of outside directors on firm's R&D strategy. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of Korean manufacturing firms which consider R&D capability to be one of their core competencies, the study uses negative binomial model to test the influence of board capital diversity on explorative innovation. Findings - Results support the value of moderate level of board diversity hypothesis by demonstrating that board capital diversity shows an inverted U-shaped relationship with explorative innovation. The results also suggest that CEO ownership positively moderates the relationship between board capital diversity and firms' innovative performance. Originality/value - Mainstream research has focussed on the directors' monitoring role based on agency theory, overlooking the more positive resource provision role. Taking on the concepts of board capital and exploration, the study introduces the notion that outside directors should be selected with a view as vehicles for bringing in valuable expertise and social linkages for the firm's explorative innovation.

Recently, outside blockholders, external owners that hold 5% or more of their firms' outstanding common stockholdings, have been pressuring their firms to engage in divestiture activities. This study considers whether the influence of those owners also extends to how the divestiture is implemented, whether through spin-off or sell-off. Tests of an agency theory model using data from 205 divestitures show that the adoption of spin-offs or sell-offs is associated with the amount of outstanding common stockholdings held by outside blockholders and the size of the unit divested. Spin-offs are used more frequently when outside blockholders own more of the divesting firm's stockholdings and the divested unit is larger, while sell-offs tend to be selected when outside blockholders own less stock and the divested business is smaller. Consistent with agency theory expectations, spin-offs would allow the blockholders to decide whether to hold or sell their interests in the divested firm, a decision they could make in accordance with their individual portfolio risks. Sell-offs of small units could be used to preserve organizational diversity and produce proceeds that would help the divesting firm's managers pursue their self-interests. Overall, outside blockholders appear to shape how divestitures are done, even if they cannot directly intervene in their firms' operations. (c) The Author(s) 2012

In this study we examine the relation between ownership structure and corporate performance; the sample of the study included 42 out of 48 companies of all sectors in Bahrain Bourse in five years from 2007-2011. Several dimensions of ownership concentration were studied in addition to managerial and institutional ownership. Two different measurements of performance were used (ROA and Tobin's Q). The study investigated this relation using several control variables and 2SLS statistical method to overcome the problem of endogeneity that may exist between the study variables. It was found that ownership concentration have a negative effect with statistical significance on company performance. Institutional ownership was found to have a positive effect on company performance. Managerial ownership was not found to have a significant effect on company performance, however it was found that managerial ownership has a positive effect on performance only in the case of declining ownership concentration. Other results were revealed by the study regarding company age, size, growth, board size and liquidity. The study is considered to have theoretical and practical implications. It contributes to the debate about agency theory and managerial entrenchment. It also may help officials in Bahrain in making laws and legislations concerning corporate governance improvement in Bahraini market.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines how separation of cash flow and voting rights influences performance of firms affiliated with large family business groups. Complementing the dominant view grounded in agency theory, we suggest that the separation of cash flow and voting rights has positive influence on firm performance in the context of large family business groups. Research Findings/Insights: Using the data from the large family business groups in Korea, or Chaebols, between 2003 and 2010, we found that the separation is positively associated with firm accounting performance, but not with market performance. We also found that the effect of the separation is moderated by analyst coverage, R&D expenditure, and sales share in the business group. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study reveals that in the large family business groups, the context in which the separation most frequently occurs, the separation not only induces the controlling minority shareholders to pursue private benefits of control but also accompanies financing benefits from active use of the internal capital market. In addition, this study notes the importance of addressing the endogeneity in the analysis of the relation between ownership structure and performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers planning to enforce/revoke the regulation on the separation of cash flow and voting rights in the pursuit of corporate governance reform especially in countries with poor shareholder protection.

This study examines the effect of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) on audit fees, and assesses whether and how this effect varies across different countries. We specifically consider publicly listed firms in the US and Japan over the eight-year period centered around the dates on which XBRL was first mandated for use by publicly listed firms in these jurisdictions. Our comparative results show that XBRL use is inversely associated with audit fees, which are in turn positively associated with firm size. We also find that, overall, XBRL moderates the association between firm size and audit fees in both the US and Japan. However, these moderation effects are weaker among Japanese firms.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board characteristics on financial performance. Most of the existing literature implicitly assumes that the relationship between either board composition, or board leadership structure and financial performance is direct. Design/methodology/approach - The generalized least squares method was performed as a panel data analysis on a sample of 40 Egyptian listed firms during the period from 2008 to 2010. Findings - The results demonstrated that under board leadership structure that assigns the duties of the CEO and chairman to the same person, increasing the proportion of non-executive members to the total number of directors has a negative impact on firm financial performance. Practical implications - First, corporate governance structures do not operate in a vacuum, and therefore, corporate governance mechanisms must be considered and assessed altogether. Second, failure to understand the underlying interdependency among corporate governance mechanisms may result in arguments that blame some corporate governance designs for poor financial performance. Third, there is no single board governance mechanism that can be considered ideal, but there are combinations of these mechanisms that are preferred. Originality/value - The paper adds to the corporate governance literature by providing empirical evidence from the emerging market of Egypt. The evidence shows that the relationship between board characteristics and financial performance is not a monotonic relationship. Consequently, these findings imply that existing evidence explaining the relationship between board characteristics and financial performance needs to be interpreted with some caution.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Using agency theory and socioemotional wealth perspective as the theoretical framework, we evaluate the extent to which financing choices subsequent to going public and their economic consequences differ for family firms relative to non-family firms. Research Findings/Insights: Our results suggest that family firms maintain higher post-IPO leverage and longer debt maturity structure relative to non-family firms. Further, family firms raise less external capital subsequent to going public relative to non-family firms. The reluctance of family firms to raise post-IPO capital, however, results in higher investment sensitivity to internal cash flows and consequently inefficient investment. In addition, family firm financing choices differentially influence various facets of post-IPO performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study suggests that agency conflicts among firm stakeholders as well as socioemotional wealth considerations are important determinants of family firm financing behavior subsequent to going public. Further, ownership structure is an important determinant of the extent IPO firms capitalize on the opportunity to raise capital subsequent to going public to finance investments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results offer insights to entrepreneurs, managers, venture capitalists, and other capital market participants with regard to the link between firm ownership structure and the economic benefits of going public (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Agency theory suggests that dividends can be used to mitigate agency problems between shareholders and managers. If director stock options are granted to align the interests of directors with shareholders, we anticipate that there will be less need for external governance mechanisms such as dividends. Examining the association between outside director stock options and dividend policy, we show that outside director option compensation indeed varies inversely with dividend distribution. This result suggests that incentivizing outside directors reduces the need for external market monitoring through dividends. Controlling for the sensitivity of options to changes in dividends, we illustrate that the lack of dividend protection for stock options is not a sufficient explanation for the reduction of dividends. We also show that while investment policy might dominate the decision to offer a dividend, director stock options play an important role in determining the level of dividend paid in firms that pay dividends.

Purpose - This study aims to examine the role the structure of corporate boards plays in the failure of the firm. Specifically, it examines whether the remuneration committee is related to corporate failure in the UK. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 failed and 269 non-failed UK-listed non-financial firms between the periods of 1994 and 2011. This study used pooled cross-sectional, fixed and random effects LOGIT models to estimate whether corporate failure is related to remuneration committee in the UK. Findings - The findings indicate that corporate failure is negatively related to the independence of the remuneration committee chairman and remuneration committee's effectiveness but not remuneration committee's presence, size and meetings. However, a positive and significant relationship was observed between corporate failure and remuneration committee independence. Practical implications - The findings of the study provide support for the appropriateness of agency theory as analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of remuneration committee, especially the independence of the remuneration committee chairperson, as a board monitoring device, in the context of corporate failure. Originality/value - The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance by establishing the likely causes of corporate failure in the UK. (c) 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper examines the influence of top management team (TMT) pay structure characteristics (such as pay dispersion, long-term variable pay, and short-term variable pay) on corporate social performance (CSP) based on upper echelon theory and agency theory. The analysis using a large panel sample of US public firms reveals that long-term oriented and egalitarian TMT pay structure has a positive influence on CSP. In addition, the negative influence of short-term variable pay on CSP becomes stronger as the pay difference among TMT members becomes greater. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings will be discussed. (c) 2015 The Braybrooke Press Ltd.

This chapter provides a synoptic description of the main theories that see inter-organizational relationships as coordination and control issues: the Transaction Costs Economics theory, the Agency theory and the Resource Dependence theory. These three theories share the idea that inter-organizational relationships are founded on opportunism and bounded rationality, and that organizations seek to control the critical aspects of their business network interactions in order to pursue their goals. These three theories are often considered as complementary in literature, since they often provide opposite predictions in similar cases. Scholars interested in e-marketplaces and in the inter-organizational impacts of the Internet have mainly focused on the Transaction Costs Economics theory so far; this theory has undergone important evolution and hybridization processes, and is then more thoroughly described than the other two in this chapter.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the association between corporate ownership structures and audit fees paid to external auditors by Malaysian companies listed on Bursa Malaysia. This study focusses on the extent of the auditor's reliance on the client's internal control inasmuch as the corporate ownership structures are varied, and, ultimately, affect the audit fees. Design/methodology/approach - This study applies the agency theory in formulating three hypotheses that guide the results analysis. By employing a multi regression model for a sample of 345 Malaysian companies listed on Bursa Malaysia, this study examines the relationship of ownership structure, namely, managerial ownership, foreign ownership and government ownership with audit fees using data for 2010. Findings - The results show a significant positive relationship between audit fees and firms with larger foreign ownership and government ownership but no significant relationship with firms with higher managerial ownership. This study contributes recent evidence concerning the relationship between corporate ownership structure and audit fees. Practical implications - Regulators may consider ownership structure on the standards or regulation setting in order to be practical and operationalized in line with the impact associated with different ownership structures. The practitioners may also design appropriate methodologies and procedures for the different ownership structures for high-quality service and to standardize the risk mitigation process. Social implications - The ownership structures have different influences on the audit fees, as well as complexity of the firms and their profitability. Originality/value - The study looks upon certain percentages of ownership structures, and how they affects audit fees, firms complexity and profitability. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

There has been a trend of large professional service firms (PSFs) to move from the partnership form of ownership to alternative ownership forms. As part of this trend large, publicly-quoted accounting companies have emerged in Australia, the US and the UK. Research on how publicly-owned PSFs, including accounting companies, are governed, whether aspects of the governance of partnership persist, why particular governance interpretive schemes and associated structures and systems are implemented and implications for performance is sparse. This study explores the interpretive scheme of governance in two Australian publicly-quoted accounting companies and finds one of the companies to have mimicked the major attributes of the partnership interpretive scheme while the other company moved to a corporate form of governance eliminating all vestiges of the partnership interpretive scheme. Governance was found to have significant implications for the performance of the companies with moving from a partnership interpretive scheme contributing to the ultimate failure of one of the companies. The cases suggest that failed experiments in the governance of publicly-owned PSFs, a relatively recently emerged ownership form in some professions, may contribute to conflicting prior findings on the implications of ownership form for the performance of PSFs. Two alternative approaches to the introduction of corporate style governance structures and systems were identified with the findings suggesting potential benefits of evolution rather than revolution. Based on the findings, a theoretical model of the interpretive scheme of governance of publicly-traded PSFs is developed including factors affecting the interpretive scheme implemented and the introduction of more corporate-like governance structures and systems, potential performance implications of PSFs moving away from a partnership interpretive scheme and the conditions and contingencies under which the relationship may hold. The paper also extends the application of agency theory to publicly-owned PSFs. (c) The Author(s) 2015

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider the way in which agency theory has crowded out other approaches to understanding the governance of modern businesses. The paper rescues the meaning and context which informed the American corporate governance reform movement originally and demonstrates how the economically predicated agency approach became dominant in academic considerations of corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach - Both primary and secondary sources were considered in a Foucauldian history of ideas approach. Findings - Other approaches to corporate governance have been pushed out of the mainstream of corporate governance discourse by an economic model which excludes many of the key issues which informed the notion originally. Practical implications - Dominant academic attitudes to corporate governance have occluded other ways in which the governance of corporations can be understood. Originality/value - Previous accounts of corporate governance have ignored the alternative approaches represented before agency theory became dominant. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

The 2011 Tunisian revolution has played a role in bringing the corporate governance agenda to the forefront. This political change in Tunisia has revealed persistent governance problems in its banking industry. This paper presents the results of research conducted on how different aspects of corporate governance can influence bank performance. The sample comprises 10 Tunisian commercial banks for the period from 1997 to 2010. The performance-governance relationship is estimated using a range of econometric techniques. The findings reveal strong support for a negative association between blockholder ownership and performance. Our results show that the bank board size is related to directors' ability to monitor and advise management. Additionally, CEO duality is positively associated with performance. Further analysis suggests that the presence of government officials on banks' board of directors decreases bank performance. Taken together, our findings offer recommendations to regulators, especially for the on-going financial reform of corporate boards.

Based on the assumptions of agency theory, family business researchers have often argued that family firms are less likely to use formal methods of monitoring and control than nonfamily firms. We explore the relationship between family firm status and presence of a written agreement among the owners, a formal measure of control. We hypothesize economic goals and perceived level of risk taking and management efficacy will mediate the relationship between family firm status and presence of a written agreement. Results indicate that the primary goal of the firm serves as a partial mediator of this relationship. (c) 2015 International Council for Small Business.

It is well known that firms with low price to earnings ratios (value firms) earn higher stock returns in the long term than high price to earnings firms (growth firms). This study investigates how insider ownership affects this relation. We show that when insider ownership is high, returns decline for low P/E firms and improve for high P/E firms. These findings are rationalized in the context of entrenchment and alignment of incentive effects. For low P/E firms, low stock returns reflect the inability of boards of directors and outside shareholders to influence poorly performing entrenched management. For high P/E firms, boards of directors and outside shareholders are less likely to intervene since higher returns reflect increased agency incentives for value-creating managers.

Purpose - This review paper aims to compare the various dimensions in the finance literature pertaining to the Anglo-Saxon Model (Stockholder Model) prevalent in the USA and the UK with the German Model (Stakeholder Model) of corporate governance prevalent in Germany and continental Europe. The present study identifies different strands of research on the various dimensions of these models, along with aspects of governance in emerging economies and the phenomenon of the convergence of these governance mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The literature review on corporate governance models has been carried out on the themes of internal and external governance mechanisms. The review considers agency theory along with principal-principal (PP) conflicts as the fundamental blocks explaining the need for governance structures. Findings - The traditional models of governance, along with the incorporation of PP conflicts, will result in a hybrid model inculcating the best of both the traditional models. However, convergence in the true sense may not be possible owing to fundamental differences pertaining to cultural, economic, legal and socio-economic aspects of the firm. Originality/value - This paper proposes a framework incorporating the interplay of managerial talent and controlling shareholders to understand the governance system that may be applicable for firms in emerging economies.

The board of directors plays an important role in corporate governance. It is an internal mechanism that controls and monitors the actions of managers and aligns the utility functions between corporate owners and managers. The board of directors performs multiple functions that concern, for example, the replacement of the managers, financial policy, the preparation of strategic plans and other actions that affect the performance of the company. The board plays an important role since on the one hand it controls the actions of management and on the other it advises the management regarding the strategies to be adopted. In this study, 100 announcements regarding the appointment of the board of directors of 100 Italian listed companies during the period 2012-2014 are investigated. The results show a positive reaction within 20 days around the announcement date. In four of the six time windows, cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are positive and statistically significant. The positive reaction of the market would appear, however, to be linked more to the composition of the board of directors than to the size of the board of directors.

Understanding the value the right chief executive officer selection and tenure choices can bring to an organisation is under researched in legal jurisdictions such as Australia where there is strong separation of the role of the chief executive officer and chairperson. The chief executive officer is the key organisation strategist and plays an important role in formulating and implementing strategy as well as keeping the board of directors informed of the work of the executive team. This paper reviews and synthesises the corporate governance literature to develop the argument that a chief executive officer's professional development background and work context will impact his or her ability to favourably influence organisation performance. A series of research propositions of interest to a range of stakeholders inside and outside the organisation are developed drawing on a number of corporate governance theories (e.g., agency theory, stewardship theory). This conceptual paper develops a substantial future empirical research agenda. (c) 2015 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

Former audit demand studies generally consider wholly family-owned private firms as a homogeneous group of firms that incur minimal agency costs. Family firm literature, however, argues that these firms might incur significant agency costs as well and we therefore examine audit demand in this particular type of firm. As we examine private family firms from the USA, which have no audit requirement, we broaden the concept of audit demand to the demand for auditor services, which encompasses audits, reviews and compilations. Consistent with former audit demand studies, we hypothesise a negative association between management ownership and the demand for auditor services, but only for first-generation private family firms. We hypothesise that this relation turns positive for subsequent generation private family firms due to entrenching behaviour caused by weakened altruistic feelings between the family shareholders. Our results support this hypothesis, but only regarding the demand for reviews and compilations. Therefore, our findings suggest that reviews and compilations seem to be sufficient and more cost-effective in this specific context to mitigate shareholder-manager agency costs compared to more expensive audits. Moreover, results suggest that the level of shareholder-debtholder agency costs do seem to be a driver for the demand for audits. (c) 2014 Taylor & Francis.

We analyze the presence of activist investors (hedge funds and private equity funds) and their impact on top management turnover in Germany. We contrast two hypotheses. The monitoring hypothesis is based on agency theory. Under this hypothesis, we expect active investors to increase top management turnover as a consequence of their monitoring efforts. Under the restraint hypothesis, we expect active investors to exert little influence on top management turnover in consequence of the comparatively limited discretion they have in Germany due to, e.g., regulatory restraints. We test both hypotheses using an event history analysis based on a sample of top managers in the 100 largest German corporations between 1998 and 2008. Contrary to studies based on agency theory in a US context, and in accordance with the restraint hypothesis, we do not find increased top management turnover under the presence of activist investors. The presence of private equity funds is not associated with any significant influence on turnover, but that of hedge funds may even reduce top management turnover.

In this paper, we use unique features of Pakistan's corporate environment to test information asymmetry and agency theories in explaining dividend smoothing behaviour of firms. Based on a sample of 150 non-financial firms listed at the Karachi Stock Exchange over the period of 1999 to 2012, we find evidence that the degree of dividend smoothing in family firms is lower than the degree of dividend smoothing in non-family firms. Our findings are more in line with the implications of information asymmetry theory. Moreover, our findings suggest that firms in Pakistan follow more flexible dividend policies as compared to developed markets, despite the fact that Pakistan is in classical tax system.

Board of director member diversity has an impact on the functions each director successfully provides. Appropriate and necessary board member capabilities differ between small and large firms. Although these differences seem apparent, current research has favored studies related to large firms and neglected those related to board member needs of small firms. Grounded in Agency Theory and Resource Dependence Theory, the following manuscript theoretically suggests that firm size moderates the relationship between board member diversity and the two primary functions (monitoring and the provision of resources) of board members. Furthermore, small firms can enhance performance through appropriate member composition in differing ways than large firms. (c) 2015, Small Business Institute. All rights reserved.

The aim of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of board monitoring mechanisms in Government Linked Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia. Mainly it focuses on how the introduction of the transformation policy, which emphasizes strengthening the board effectiveness, would lead to an improvement in the performance of GLCs. Our study goes further to explain the impact of earnings management on performance as it is opined that the performance of the firm could be affected by the earnings management (EM) practices, and, hence, looking at the performance after stripping away the managed portion of performance could provide more accurate results concerning the impact of corporate governance on performance. Using regression analysis, the findings of the study showed that the adjusted R2 increased from 14.8% to 26.8% (between the pre-transformation and post-transformation models). In addition, more corporate governance variables were found to be significant in the post-transformation model (i.e. board independence and board meetings). More importantly, the significance of the variables are as predicted in the hypotheses, thus lending support for the argument of the agency theory. This study has recognized a few limitations. First, the main limitation of the study is that the data were collected through publicly available data which include annual reports and other databases such as Bloomberg. Other data such as qualitative information could be helpful to gain more insight concerning the issue of the effectiveness of the transformation policy. Second, although we are using all available data for the Malaysian GLCs, the sample size of 35 companies could still be considered as a small sample size for generalization purpose. The government, in its role of regulating the corporate governance for GLCs, could gain an insight from the results of the study, thereby providing empirical support for the development of new regulations and recommendations, and takes the necessary corrective decisions regarding the effectiveness of the transformation policy. The paper provides further evidence concerning the relationship between performance and corporate governance mechanisms. Specifically, it looks into such a relationship within the Malaysian GLCs after the introduction of the transformation programme. The results of the study are more accurate for interpretation as the measure of performance has deducted the portion of managed earnings. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

By using fixed-effects panel regression, we model cash holdings for agribusiness firms during the 1970-2012 period. The results suggest that agribusiness firms manage cash in a manner consistent with the precautionary theory of caution management. Specifically, agribusiness firms hold cash to quickly execute growth opportunities and limit transaction costs of acquiring capital for growth. Furthermore, a subset of cash-rich agribusiness firms, which concentrates 78.5% of the aggregate cash and 49% of total revenues, is analyzed with a logit model. Results of cash-rich agribusiness deviate from predictions by the precautionary theory. This finding has potential implications for structural changes in this sector.

This study analyzes the relationship between board size and economic-financial performance in a sample of European firms that constitute the EUROSTOXX50 Index. Based on previous literature, resource dependency and agency theories, and considering regulation developed by the OECD and European Union on the normative of corporate governance for each country in the sample, the authors propose the hypotheses of both positive linear and quadratic relationships between the researched parameters. Using ROA as a benchmark of financial performance and the number of members of the board as measurement of the board size, two OLS estimations are performed. To confirm the robustness of the results the empirical study is tested with two other similar financial ratios, ROE and Tobin's Q. Due to the absence of significant results, an additional factor, firm size, is employed in order to check if it affects firm performance. Delving further into the nature of this relationship, it is revealed that there exists a strong and negative relation between firm size and financial performance. Consequently, it can be asseverated that the generic recommendation "one size fits all" cannot be applied in this case; which conforms to the Recommendations of the European Union that dissuade using generic models for all countries.

Drawing on agency theory, this paper investigates the determinants of voluntary audit committee (AC) formation among non-bank firms listed on the Palestine Stock Exchange (PSE). We used the annual reports of nearly all non-bank companies listed on the PSE as well as the company guides issued by the PSE for the period between 2010 and 2012. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the influence of a set of corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structures and company characteristics on the voluntary formation of ACs among non-bank Palestinian firms. The result of the analysis demonstrated that the AC is influenced by foreign ownership, institutional ownership, board diligence and external auditor type. This paper adds to the limited AC literature in Middle Eastern countries in general and in the Arab World in particular. This paper not only examines the determinants of the voluntary formation of ACs but also attempts to theorise about this formation.

This study provides an overview of the research in the field of agency theory and corporate governance. This research is aimed to extend existing research contributes to the agency theory literature and particularly, the growing body of literature of corporate governance mechanisms. The agency theory suggests that corporate governance can reduce agency costs which in turn leads to improved firm performance. The problem that occurs is known as the principal-agent problem where two parties, the principal and the agent. The separation of ownership and control in the open financial system can result in the agency problem between management and shareholders. The separation of control and ownership in corporations has caused agency problems and a series of corporate governance mechanisms have been implemented to mitigate them. The primary objective of corporate governance can play an important role in minimizing the agency problem and ensuring that management's interests are aligned with those of shareholders. The agency theory implies that the board of directors is elected to manage the potential conflict of interests between management and shareholders. (c) Medwell Journals, 2015.

We study the relationship between the types of issuer and the contents of the governance codes in the new-institutional theory, using a global sample of over 70 national governance codes. We hypothesise that the code recommendations are influenced by the isomorphic pressure to embrace new social practices, exerted by the different types of issuer. The findings show that codes issued involving multiple stakeholder groups and organisations in hybrid committees are more likely to: 1) include recommendations that take into account multiple political and social institutional demands; 2) adapt the mainstream agency-theory-based governance model to the national setting. Overall, the policy-making negotiations among different stakeholder groups in the local institutional setting appear to be determinant in shaping the recommendations of the code and in improving the promotion of good governance among firms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically investigate the relationship between the types of issuer and the contents of codes, in a global sample.

Using resource-based logic as well as stewardship and agency theories, we address a paradox when governing young firms-how to design governance structures to encourage top managers to generate rents while minimizing the threat of rent appropriation. Some corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) enhance empowerment and encourage managers to generate rents for the firm. But these CGMs may also allow managers to appropriate rents excessively. The solution appears to be combining CGMs that empower managers to generate rents with CGMs that either (a) motivate stewardship behavior or (b) reduce information asymmetry between management and other stakeholders. Our empirical analyses provide substantial support for our predictions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This study examines the moderation effects of corporate governance provisions on the link between family involvement (i.e., family ownership and family management) in publicly-traded firms and firm performance by drawing upon agency theory, with a focus on principal-principal agency issues, and the extant family governance literature. We develop and test the hypotheses on 386 of the S&P 500 firms longitudinally. Findings support the hypotheses suggesting the moderation effects of the use of provisions (a) protecting controlling owners in terms of their sustainability of controlling status, and (b) protecting management legally on the inverted U-shaped relationship between family ownership and firm performance. We also found support for the moderation effects of provisions (c) protecting controlling owners in terms of their voting rights, (d) protecting noncontrolling owners, and (e) protecting management monetarily on the inverted U-shaped relationship between family management and firm performance. By this, our study provides empirical support for the principal-principal agency perspective on the corporate governance in publicly-traded family firms. As such, it suggests new avenues of research for both the corporate governance literature, as well as for the theory of the family firm. Our study also offers insights to policy directed toward monitoring the actions of large shareholders such as family and enhancing the overall shareholder value in publicly-traded family firms.

This study examines the association between corporate governance mechanisms and corporate disclosure in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Hypotheses based on agency theory and organisational power literature are developed and tested on 85 firms listed in Dubai and Abu Dhabi stock exchanges. The study also runs multiple regression tests on two sub-samples (46 financial firms and 39 non-financial firms) in order to provide a richer analysis for the empirical findings. Overall, the results show that the extent of firms' disclosure is positively associated with the number of board committees, debt finance, firm size and firm profitability, while it is negatively related to CEO power. This study's findings direct policymakers attention to the importance of: the composition of the board, the optimal size of the board, governing the type of knowledge required for board members, and revisiting the level of foreign ownership in UAE firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the implications on former accounting firm partners becoming employees of a publicly owned accounting corporation, the responses of the former partners and impacts on the acquiring company. Partners of accounting and other professional service firms selling their firms to publicly owned companies often remain with the acquiring company as employees and receive company shares as consideration for their firms. Agency theory suggests public ownership will result in changes to the roles of senior professionals with potential resistance and motivation consequences. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a case study approach involving the review of publicly available information and interviews with executives and senior professionals of an Australian publicly owned accounting company, Stockford Limited. Findings: The Stockford case indicates that selling their firm to a publicly owned company can have significant negative implications for accounting firm partners. The former partners struggled to adapt to their new roles as senior professional employees and shareholders. Their responses had significant impacts on company performance, which ultimately contributed to the collapse of the company, thus reflecting the power senior professionals retain regardless of the change of ownership form. Research limitations/implications: Care is required when generalising findings of a single case to other professions and other geographic jurisdictions. Practical implications: This paper has significant implications for entrepreneurs and executives consolidating professional service firms, partners considering selling their firms and investors in publicly owned professional service firms. Originality/value: Despite the emergence of publicly owned accounting and other professional service companies and the importance and power of senior professionals in professional service firms, this is the first study to explore the implications on senior professionals of selling their firms to public companies.

Entrepreneurship is considered as an engine for bringing about positive changes in the form of socioeconomic welfare (Kortum and Lerner 2000). However, it is a well-established fact that, one of the major constraints faced by entrepreneurs is access to finance. Self-financing is usually not sufficient and collateral-based debt funding is not always available. Information asymmetries prevailing between investors and entrepreneurs, uncertainty related to the future of the product, and bleak exit prospects of the investor severely curtail a new venture's prospects of receiving finance (Chan, 1983; Amit et al. 1990). In recent years, equity financing in terms of venture capital has emerged as one of the alternative sources of financing for new ventures. The most accepted form of definition for venture capital includes investment in young firms which are very risky but promise a great return. (Gompers et al. 1998). Recent research in venture capital indicates a trend toward venture capitalists' preference toward late stage deals (e.g., Gompers and Lerner 2001). Since a large volume of venture capital is flowing into growth stage firms, it becomes essential to understand the various factors that venture capitalists consider before investing in a particular firm which is in its growth stage. Earlier research has focused mostly on analyzing the criteria used by venture capitalists to select a new venture based on human capital, attractiveness of markets, uniqueness of products etc. However, this chapter seeks to identify the various financial indicators that venture capitalists consider before funding growth firms. One way to do this is to analyze the capital structure of firms which receive venture financing later. The basic objective of this chapter is to understand whether the determinant of capital structure of a firm has a major role to play in the access of venture capital later in its life cycle. The finance literature comprises of numerous studies that focus on the determinants of capital structure of firms. However, there do not exist many studies which talk about the determinants of capital structure of a firm which is financed by venture capital. This chapter is based on the Indian context. It uses the static trade-off theory, pecking order theory, and agency theory to explain the financial structure of firms which receive venture capital subsequently. This chapter draws from the capital structure literature to carve out the variables, i.e., tangible assets, profitability, size, volatility, growth opportunities etc. that affect the capital structure of firms which receive venture financing later. Propositions are drawn on the basis of this reasoning and a conceptual framework is put forth that tries to identify an optimal capital structure strategy for Indian growth firms that seek venture capital.

The audit function has an important role in the corporate mechanism especially by extra value conferred to the governance process; thus, over time, this issue was debated assiduously in a series of studies and researches on information transparency at the level of companies. The purpose of this article is to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the audit committee (as a guarantor of quality internal audit) and the financial performance, the quality of the portfolio, the solvency and the own funds in the Romanian banking system. Thus, concentrating attention on the features of the audit committee, the authors of this article tried to find answers motivated by the empirical analysis results to the general question: how the various recorded features of the audit committee performance influences the banking system, what is the value added by the quality of internal audit at the level of credit institutions? In order to test the formulated hypotheses, the used research methodology is mainly quantitative, based on the statistical analysis, deductive, and having as starting point in the agency theory, as the objective testing possible links from cause - effect, and analysing the significance level thereof.

The purpose of this study is to examine the empirical relationship between insider ownership and firm performance. Based on resource dependence theory, this study argues that the positive convergence-of-interests effect and the negative entrenchment effect can coexist in various industrial settings. Fixed-effect panel data regression models are applied to a sample of 1,156 effective observations. To reflect the contextual role of resources, we defined industrial settings along with industrial complexity and firm scale dimensions. The empirical results supported our research hypotheses, showing that insider ownership exerts a positive effect on firm performance in a high-complexity and large-scale setting, but a negative effect in a low-complexity and smallscale setting. The results of this study imply that contextual fitness must be deliberately considered to determine effective regulations of corporate governance. In addition, this study contributes a new aspect to related discussion, which synthesizes conflicting theoretical arguments by introducing the contextual role of resources. (c) 2015, CIBER Institute.

This paper investigates if there is a relationship between managerial ownership and firm performance in selected firms listed on the JSE, and if so, what that relationship is. The study conducts regression analyses over a sample of 23 retail sector firms, observing data stretching from 2010 to 2013. The results are found to be robust. The results suggest that the hypothesis that a positive relationship exists between managerial ownership and performance be rejected as a negative relationship is found. Instead, the results of a two-stage least squares (2SLS) analysis find that managerial ownership does not impact firm performance in any direction. Overall the results of the study do not support the agency theory, as aligning the interests of managers and shareholders does not improve firm performance, at least within the retail sector.

Purpose: This paper aims to study the determinants of variable compensation for top Portuguese executives (chief executive officers, chief financial officers and commercial directors).Design/methodology/approach: Data from 101 firms were collected through an email questionnaire sent to the human resource directors of 500 largest and best Portuguese firms of Exame, a business newspaper. A Tobit regression analysis was used to estimate the basic equation of the study.Findings: The conclusions are generally consistent with findings obtained in more developed capital markets. It was found that public and older corporations are more intensive users of variable pay, consistent with the agency theory prediction. A location in the centre of economic activity and a higher executive education increase the propensity to receive higher levels of salary in the form of variable compensation. The relation between compensation and performance was more elusive.Research limitations/implications: There are limitations as to the extrapolation of the obtained results, as the level of potential idiosyncrasy cannot be measured. Ideally, the study should be replicated in different contexts to control for country-specific influences. Nevertheless, the main finding that performance-related pay mechanisms are less used in countries where public corporations and potential agency problems are less pervasive should hold.Originality/value: As the focus is on a small economy with a developing capital market, this paper contributes to executive compensation literature that has mostly analysed firms based in well-developed capital markets, with a higher separation of ownership and control (Anglo-Saxon countries).

The impact of family ownership on strategic decision-making and diversifi cation in public corporations is an important but not clearly understood aspect of modern corporate governance. In many cases, large-block family owners of public corporations may have a great deal of input in strategic decision-making in large corporations. Previous literature investigates how ownership structure and diversifi cation are connected, but conclusions are not homogeneous. Agency theory suggests that professional managers are fundamentally self-interested, and the public corporation diversifi es because managers pursue their own interests, rather than the interest of shareholders. However in family fi rms, ownership and control use to coincide and family diversifi cation decisions which causes a lower diversifi cation. In this paper authors analyzes the impact of ownership concentration and the infl uence of ultimate owner's nature of business group (family or non-family) in diversifi cation's decision: specialization, related diversifi cation, unrelated diversifi cation and mixed diversifi cation (when a company uses both related and unrelated diversifi cation) Based on a sample of ninety-nine Spanish listed companies during the years 2000-2005, and using the listed company an their subsidiaries (pyramidal group) as unit of analysis, this research fi nds: fi rstly, the highest ownership concentration increases the adoption of specialization strategies and reduce the mixed diversifi cation; Secondly, attending to ultimate owner's nature, family fi rms adopt more strategies of specialization and related diversifi cation, and less diversifi cation strategies than nonfamily fi rms; Finally, results also show behaviour differences in family fi rms according to ownership concentration's degree: an increasing ownership concentration's degree in family fi rms rises the probability of diversifi cation.

Decades-long research on boards of directors based on the agency theoretic insider/outsider distinction (Fama & Jensen, 1983) has yielded limited results regarding the effectiveness of boards as monitors of senior management (Johnson, S., Schnatterly, & Hill, 2013) leading governance scholars to incorporate agency theory based distinctions with rich characterizations of the human capital of board composition. This study examines the human capital brought to the boards of directors by active CEOs.

This paper proposes to investigate the postulations of renowned agency theory and Earning Management (EM) in relation to Corporate Governance (CG) mechanism and external audit that CG mechanism and external auditor constrains EM. The paper conceptualized three attributes (board size, audit committee financial expertise and industry specialized auditor) from CG mechanism and external auditor in relation to EM practices in Malaysian listed companies. This is a conceptual paper which proposes to investigate the correlation between the size of board and EM, financial expertise of audit committee and EM and industry specialized auditor and EM. The proposed study has value for Malaysian government, policy makers, corporate boards, stock exchange and shareholders by highlighting the distinct impact of EM practices and its relation with board size, audit committee financial expertise and industry specialized auditor.

The Shariah law makes Amanah (trustworthiness) a fundamental obligation for all the contractual parties. From the agency theory perspective, we, thus, investigate managerial trustworthiness in capital structure decisions of Shariah firms and compare it with those of Non-Shariah firms, in the light of Islamic principle of Amanah (trustworthiness). Specifically, we examine whether capital structure of Shariah firms is partially influenced by managerial ownership under the motivation of self-interest. Using the data from Pakistan, our results show that, unlike Non-Shariah firms, leverage ratios in Shariah firms are insensitive to the varying degree of managerial ownership, indicating absence of managerial opportunism in financial decisions of these firms. For the Non-Shariah firms, on the other hand, our results confirm findings of previous research which reveal that managers manipulate leverage ratios in their own interestat the cost of firm value, indicating the severity of agency conflicts among these firms. Invoking agency theory, we argue that certain firm characteristics (such as lower free cash-flows and lesser liquidity), achieved through Shariah compliance, help Shariah firms mitigate agency conflicts. These features persuade managers to behave less opportunistically than their counterparts in Non-Shariah firms as shown from their financing choices. The results are important for understanding nature of the two types of firms studied and the cross-sectional differences between the capital structure choices of these firms. Besides, our findings have also implications for growing number of Shariah compliant firms and a new clientele of Islamic investors who have entered capital markets due to the Islamic image of Shariah firms in Muslim majority country like Pakistan.

This paper explores whether the performance of publicly-listed family-controlled firms in Malaysia is related to the extent of the families' ownership. It also explores whether there are any moderating effects from the various attributes of board independence on the ownership-performance relationship of these firms. The findings indicate that increasing families' ownership is related to better firm performance under the condition that the families do not have absolute ownership and control over their firms. However, giving more control via majority ownership that causes the families to become the only dominant party might enhance their ability to expropriate and cause firm performance to deteriorate. Therefore, proposal to increase ownership as a mean to reduce the classical agency-theory problems should be caveated under the principal-principal perspective. It is also found that the various board independence attributes do not exhibit any moderating influence on the family ownership-firm performance relationship. This finding may indicate the powerlessness of the boards of director in Malaysia when encountered with the influential controlling families whom the directorship tenures and opportunities of the non-family directors depend on. Decisions made by the controlling families which have bearing on firm performance may not have been effectively counter checked by the boards due to the lack of truly independent nature of the boards.

New concerns have been raised in Iberoamerica regarding the effectiveness of universities, especially in terms of their quality. It is an undisputed premise that the management of university governance is one of the determining factors to improve administrative tasks and, from there, academic duties. The purpose of this work is to make an analysis based on the Agency Theory (AT) as an estimate that may help detect and correct management problems in university governance, understanding that it is a theoretical drift and not a doctrinal one. In order to achieve this purpose, more than a hundred texts and papers published in internationally recognized academic journals were reviewed. As relevant findings, it is possible to highlight the identification and reflection about determining elements and factors considered by the AT , which are applicable to the world of university management (GU, by its Spanish acronym).

Salespersons represent an important and challenging set of employees for organizational management. Given frequently high autonomy levels and varied job roles, boundary spanning agents have ample opportunity and motivation to modify/ignore organizational directives. Based on a multi-theoretical perspective, this research sets forth a three-dimensionalconceptualization of directive modification intentions and develops and empirically tests a scale designed to better explainthis phenomenon while empirically validating its occurrence. Results indicate that boundary spanners have three distinctand relatively stable motivations for modifying/ignoring organizational directives, including customer-, organization-, andself-focused motivations, and that each motivation may potentially relate differently to important antecedent and outcomevariables. Managerial and theoretical implications are discussed. (c) 2015 Taylor & Francis.

This study examines multi-year dynamic response of CEO compensation to firm performance. Multi-period agency theories posit that the CEO's current performance can be compensated both today and tomorrow. This study investigates the dynamic view of CEO pay and firm performance by using partial adjustment models of CEO pay. We find that target pay levels are set on "long-run" past firm performance and that the deviation of the actual pay level causes near-complete convergence to the target in one year. Overall, the findings here indicate that a pay-for-contemporaneous-only-performance relationship significantly understates the incentive effects of CEO pay. (c) by author(s).

We examine whether a dual distribution system that uses both franchisor-operated and franchisee-operated outlets reduces a franchisor's information disadvantage when contracting with franchisee retailers. Using detailed qualitative and quantitative managerial data, we find persuasive evidence of the strategic use of performance information obtained from franchisor-operated outlets to reduce information asymmetry and enhance contracting efficiency for franchisee-operated outlets. We test whether the proximity of franchisor-operated retail outlets to franchisee-operated retail outlets reduces underpricing of quasi-franchise contracts. Our results accord with the proposition that information asymmetry reduces contracting efficiency and are consistent with our prediction that a manufacturer can reduce intrinsic information asymmetry by maintaining franchisor-operated outlets that are geographically proximate to the franchisee-operated outlets, and that this improves the franchisor's pricing of franchising contracts. We conclude that dual distribution reduces the franchisor's information asymmetry and increases their contract pricing efficiency. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

A number of family business researches affirm benefits of family involvement to the business while some of other studies assure only detriments of family involvement. When comparative studies of family businesses begin to surface on the family involvement in business, there is that irritating question on what effect is brought about by family involvement to the business. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore business advantages and disadvantages generated by family involvement in businesses in Sri Lanka. The present study attempted to address the above knowledge gap, using qualitative research approach and multiple case studies as the strategy of inquiry. Purposive sampling technique was used to select both cases and respondents. Privately held, successfully conducted four family businesses were selected as cases and, existing business owner and one family related manager from each case were taken as respondents. Data was collected mainly via semi-structured, in depth interviews, observations, and secondary documents. Data collection from interviews consisted of 15 interviews with 09 different people from four cases. Before the data analysis, coding and categorization of respondents' views from interviews helped to identify common patterns and themes from both within the case and across cases. The analysis was carried out in the light of Agency Theory and resulted in a rich understanding of business advantages and disadvantages of family involvement in businesses in Sri Lanka. The findings of this study indicated that the agency cost is created not only on business matters but also on family matters. Further, findings revealed that agency benefit also can be obtained by family business by handling the family matters carefully in line with business matters. Findings of this study clearly indicated that an extension to Agency Theory is required to explain owner agent relationship in family businesses.

The spate of scandals and the financial crisis in the recent past has resuscitated the interest of academicians and regulators in the subject of corporate governance. Since corporates employ several governance (agency-conflict controlling) mechanisms at one point of time and board independence is one of them, the central accent in this research is upon the investigation of determinants of corporate board independence in Indian institutional context. By counting on several model specifications, modulations, proxies and operationalizations, regression estimates discloses that inside ownership, leverage, dividend payout policy, institutional ownership and firm growth have a significant bearing on the level of board independence. The denouements of firm size and board affiliation level have also been recognized while analyzing the determinants of board independence. Overall, the outcomes of the empirical analysis have invigorated the applicability of agency theory standpoints in Indian context. Moreover, these findings have profound implications for corporate governance research and have also been able to abate the diversity in empirical evidences of performance consequences of board independence.

Financial accounting is a heavily regulated area in modern economies. Financial accounting standards have grown steadily and describe in great detail the financial statement representation of transactions that firms undertake and events that affect their net worth. The financial statements are audited by independent accounting experts who attest that they present fairly the financial condition of the firm. Auditors themselves are subject to auditing standards and to oversight by their peers and government institutions. The audit committee in the board of directors oversees the accounting processes and the audit of the financial statements. Many countries operate accounting enforcement institutions to ensure compliance of the audited financial statements with the rules and to impose sanctions. Finally, investors and other parties can sue firms before court if they made decisions based on erroneous financial information by the firm. (c) 2015 Stewart Jones.

The systemic banking crisis in 2008 led to the quasi-nationalisation of two UK listed banks: The Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group (National Audit Office, 2010). Using property rights and agency theory as the theoretical frameworks, this paper analyses whether the quasi-nationalisation of these banks has been successful. It is argued that as a rescue mechanism, quasi-nationalisation was a positive development. However, questions arise over its effect as an instrument of banking reform. The State's arm's length approach to management represents a lost opportunity to change the culture of profitability over people that contributed to the banking crisis.

This study seeks to furnish insights on institutional shareholders by assessing whether higher presence of institutional shareholders leads to higher dividend payout or vice versa in line with a particular version of the agency theory. The panel data consists of 100 Malaysian firms from the trading and services sector of Bursa Malaysia from the years 2005 to 2008. In line with the 'efficient monitoring hypothesis' theory of institutional shareholders and in conjunction with the outcome model of dividends, we find the presence of institutional shareholders results in higher dividends payout in Malaysia. In spite of the lower fraction of shareholding by institutional shareholders in Malaysia as compared to developed markets, it is clear from the results that the they in fact bring about a positive impact to the firms they invest in by resulting in higher dividends payments. We have provided a framework linking the two theories of dividends (outcome and substitute) and the three theories of institutional shareholders (efficient monitoring hypothesis, conflict of interest hypothesis and strategic alignment hypothesis) to better analyze the two broad ranging theories into greater depth.

The problem of managerial control and the concept of corporate governance have long been the subject of researches, often linked to widely known organizational theories (transaction cost theory, agency theory ...). But it seems that these analyzes, especially because they are too focused on relations with the shareholders and neglect the examination of "managerial discretion", can only incompletely account for the status and the actual behavior of top managers. The author proposes to follow various paths to overcome this situation by enriching the narrow approaches that are dominant today. (c) 2015, Lavoisier.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between capital structure and financial performance of the listed companies on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). Fixed effect and random effect panel regression model is applied to the data covering the period 2009-2011. The empirical evidence shows that the firm's capital structure is a significant determinant of corporate performance. Specifically, SDTA has a negative and significant impact on the performance measure ROA and ROE. The significance and negative effects of SDTA on a firm's performance ROA supports the argument that short-term debt decreases a firm's performance. Moreover, LDTA, TDTA and TDTE are significantly negatively related to ROE. These results show that higher level of leverage lead to lower ROE. In addition, the results found the positive impact of 'Agro & Food Industry' sector to corporate performance in Thailand. It may also indicate particular sector is more profitable than others.

The study investigates the impact of agency problem and the distribution of corporate control on board composition using a dataset consisting of 190 listed firms in Indonesia. The conceptual framework is derived from agency theory assuming that board composition is endogenously determined by firm's specific environment. The study reveals that corporate control drives the composition of the board. The different types of large shareholders are found to pursue different strategies in relation to the board composition. While domestic and foreign investors rely on independent board, controlling family prefer to structure a less independent board. This suggests that the battle for corporate control between controlling family, in one side, and unrelated domestic and foreign investors begins with the structure of board. The findings imply that the type of large shareholder does matter in determining the device of corporate control. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

This paper argues that a primary reason for the mixed results observed in the corporate governance and firm performance literature is that the relevant theories have not been applied to the class of phenomena they were designed to explain. For instance, the literature that focuses on ownership structure and firm performance employs entrepreneurial agency theories of the firm but applies them to managerial firms where ownership is separated from control. This is evidenced by the fact that firms in which managerial ownership is close to zero percent are included in the samples. After similarly analyzing other related governance and performance literatures, the paper provides orientation and recommendations for researchers to avoid the identified problems and secure future progress.

This study is set out to examine the cogency of capital structure theories in a unique Islamic financial environment where tax shield is irrelevant, paying or receiving interest is undesirable and government exercises control over major economic activities. To achieve this objective, the annual reports of all Kuwaiti banks listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange for the period between 2010 and 2014 were used to extract internal bank variables. In addition, external macroeconomic data were extracted from World Bank statistics. The results of the pooled regression analysis disclosed that the capital structure of the Kuwaiti banks are influenced by their size measured by total assets, cash dividends paid and the market value/book value of the bank's share. While the result was inconsistent with agency theory, it provides support to the pick-order, trade off and market theories. (c) 2015 Econjournals. All rights reserved.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the influence of family character on the level and type of diversification,additionally considering the effect of ownership concentration that exists in family business. The studyuses a sample of 99 listed companies, parent companies of business groups, with business group beingconsidered as the unit of analysis (parent company and subsidiaries firms). The results show that familygroups have lower average levels of total diversification and unrelated diversification, and they showthe negative influence of family character in unrelated diversification level. The existence of a nonlinearU-shaped relationship between the level of diversification (total and unrelated) and the ownership con-centration in family group is also observed, thus confirming a different behavior depending on the capitalheld by the main shareholders. The results obtained provide new evidence for the academic literatureon family firms and business groups, as well as on the diversification strategies adopted by the familygroups. (c) 2014 AEDEM.

Previous studies have not examined the performance of multi-unit franchise systems. The paper addresses this research gap by investigating franchisor performance of multi-unit franchise system from an organizational economics perspective by using data from Germany and Switzerland. According to the agency theory they show that under a strong brand name free-riding risk may be reduced through MUF and hence MUF positively influences the performance the systems. In addition, the data support the transaction cost hypothesis that environment uncertainty is negatively related to the performance of MUF systems. Furthermore, using property rights theory, they show that intangible local market assets are negatively and intangible system-specific assets are positively associated with MUF performance. Finally, the results indicate that decentralization of decision making has a positive performance effect on MUF systems. (c) Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Agency theory draws attention to certain behaviors of CEOs and boards that, in aggregate, create losses for society. The empirical literature, however, characterized by contentious findings, suggests that the current form of agency theory is not supporting a clear understanding of these behaviors and their costs. We propose a change to one assumption, with potentially profound implications. Expanding on the assumption of narrow self-interest underlying agency theory, we apply an empirically wellestablished refinement that self-interest is bounded by norms of reciprocity and fairness. The resulting logic is that perceptions of fairness mediate the relationships derived from standard agency theory through positively and negatively reciprocal behaviors. This mediating variable provides a parsimonious new way to help explain extreme results found in prior studies. Rather than aiming to limit CEOs' self-serving behaviors, boards that apply these arguments improve social welfare by initiating positive reciprocity and avoiding unnecessary, welfare-reducing "revenge" behaviors.

Agency and stewardship theories are prominent perspectives to examine myriad issues within family firms. Although considered opposing theories, both address the same phenomena: the individual-level behaviors and firm-level governance mechanisms that predict organizational outcomes. Accordingly, we review and synthesize these theories concurrently, using the concepts of behavior and governance as our organizing framework. Our review encompasses 107 family firm articles grounded in agency and/or stewardship theory, published between 2000 and 2014 in 24 journals across several disciplines. Additionally, we identify future research areas that provide scholars opportunities to push theoretical boundaries and offer further insights into the family firm. (c) 2015, (c) The Author(s) 2015.

This study looks at the relationship between project governance and project success from an agency theory and stewardship theory perspective. For that project governance was operationalized respectively as a) the extent of shareholder versus stakeholder orientation and b) the extent of behavior versus outcome control, both exercised by the parent organization over its project. A cross-sectional, worldwide online survey yielded 254 usable responses. Factor and regression analyses indicate that project success correlates with increasing stakeholder orientation of the parent organization, while the types of control mechanisms do not correlate with project success. Results support the importance of stewardship approaches in the context of successful projects.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: This study reviews previous country-level and firm-level studies on corporate governance codes up to 2014 in order to highlight recent trends and indicate future avenues of research. Research Findings/Results: Our data show that research on codes increases over time consistently with the diffusion and the relevance of the empirical phenomenon. Despite previous studies substantially enriching our knowledge of the antecedents and consequences of governance codes, our study shows there are still several opportunities to make significant contributions in this area. Theoretical Implications: Agency theory is the dominant theoretical framework, although other theoretical perspectives (especially the institutional one) are increasingly adopted. Future studies should be aimed at widening and combining various theoretical lenses so as to develop new interpretations and a better understanding of governance codes. Practical Implications: Legislators and policymakers should continue to develop and update the recommendations of national governance codes in order to address the potential failures of corporate governance mechanisms in place.

The ownership of corporations has been studied in multiple disciplines and using diverse theoretical frameworks for several decades. Despite a wealth of research, both research gaps and contradictory findings are common. This is partly due to the fragmentation of the foci of individual studies. We synthesize the work done to date through a content analysis of 145 articles and 523 effect size estimates. On the basis of this review, we develop an integrated perspective to understand how institutional, government, family, executive, and board ownership affect a variety of firm outcomes. We conclude by offering new theoretical and contextual directions to better understand the role of ownership in shaping firm outcomes. (c) 2016, (c) The Author(s) 2016.

We examine the unique nature of agency problems within publicly traded family firms by investigating the earnings management decision of dominant family owners relative to non-family. To do so, we draw upon literature demonstrating that family owners are loss averse with respect to the family's socioemotional wealth, or the affective endowment derived from firm ownership and control. Our theory and findings suggest that potential reputational consequences of earnings management lead family principals to engage in less of this practice relative to non-family firms, and that founder family firms are less likely than non-founder family firms to use earnings management. Moreover, the family-firm effect varies with the firm size, the degree of CEO entrenchment, and the firm's stock structure. We provide important insights regarding differences between family and non-family principals in the use of unethical accounting practices, thereby extending agency theory and advancing an underdeveloped research area.

The determinants of risk disclosure in the annual reports of listed state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have yet to be fully explored. This paper examines the potential impact of the composition of the boards of directors and other company-specific features on risk disclosure levels. The presence of women on a board made a significant difference to risk disclosure, as did the age of board members. Board directors having an accounting or finance/business qualification affected risk disclosure negatively; company size and an internet visibility were positively related to risk disclosure. Although an Italian study, the lessons here will have application to academia and to practitioners, policy-makers and standard-setters worldwide. (c) 2016 CIPFA.

Purpose - This study aims to discover the corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure practices and the potential influence of corporate governance (CG), ownership structure and corporate characteristics in an emerging Arab country, Saudi Arabia. This study extends the extant literature by investigating the drivers of CSR disclosure in a country that lacks research in this area. Design/methodology/approach - This study examines 267 annual reports of Saudi Arabian non-financial listed firms during 2007-2011 using manual content and multiple regression analyses and a checklist of 17 CSR disclosure items based on ISO 26000. Findings - The analysis finds that the CSR disclosure average is 24 per cent, higher than 14.61 and 16 per cent found by Al-Janadi et al. (2013) and Macarulla and Talalweh (2012) for two Saudi Arabian samples during 2006-2007 and 2008, respectively. This improvement may be due to the application of Saudi CG code in 2007. The analysis also shows that government and family ownership, firm size and firm age are positive determinants of CSR disclosure, firm leverage is a negative determinant and effective AC, board independence, role duality, institutional ownership, firm profitability and industry type are found not to be determinants of CSR disclosure. Originality/value - This study is important because it uses the agency theory to ascertain the influence of specific board characteristics and ownership structures on disclosure. As a result, it provides important implications for CG regulators and different stakeholders and provides an evaluation of the recently applied Saudi CG code from the CSR disclosure perspective.

Agency theories predict that older firms make value-destroying acquisitions to benefit managers. Neoclassical theories predict instead that such firms make wealth-increasing acquisitions to exploit underutilized assets. Using IPO cohorts, we establish that, while younger firms make more related and diversifying acquisitions than mature firms, the acquisition rate follows a U-shape over firms' life cycle. Consistent with neoclassical theories, we show that acquiring firms have better performance and growth opportunities and create wealth through acquisitions of nonpublic firms throughout their life. Consistent with agency theories, older firms experience negative stock price reactions for acquisitions of public firms. (c) 2015 the American Finance Association.

Agency theory-grounded research on boards of directors and firm legitimacy has historically viewed CEO power as de-legitimating, often taking this fact for granted in theorizing about external assessors' evaluations of a firm. With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be. Data from 151 U.S. semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms over a 10-year period generally support our predictions. (c) 2016 Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose - Theories develop over time and are influenced by both events and people. Looking primarily at the applications between contracting principal-agent relationships, the purpose of this paper is to explore how agency theory emerged from a number of economic and social developments. In doing so, the authors explain how this once dominant theory comes up short regarding varying realms of entrepreneurship as well as with multiple modern business phenomena. Design/methodology/approach - The authors first present a brief overview of agency theory. Second, the authors identify major events and people and address how they impacted the development of agency theory. Third, the authors provide insights on agency theory across three contexts (strategic entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, and family business). Implications, limitations, and future research directions are then offered. Findings - The authors provide a deeper understanding of agency theory, thus broadening its underpinnings and enabling readers to more readily understand why agency theory is limited in its explanation of certain and modern business phenomena. The authors find that some of the seminal influences to agency theory are quite dated which has limited its explanatory power in terms of the modern day business and with more recent disciplines such as entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications - The authors are limited by their choices of major events that influenced agency theory at the expense of not being able to include everything that may have impacted the theory over time. These limitations, however, are offset by the research implications. As the authors highlight the underpinning of agency theory, the authors subsequently provide scholars and practitioners with five primary boundary conditions, each of which are in need of attention for agency theory to maintain relevant explanatory power. Originality/value - A deeper understanding of agency theory can be gained by looking at its underpinnings. By presenting numerous principal-agent conflicts and demonstrating areas in which it has fallen short (i.e. entrepreneurship and more recent business phenomenon), we shed light on the obstacles agency theory must overcome in order to maintain its position as a prominent theory.

Purpose: By revisiting the agency theory literature, this paper aims to both incrementally advance historical viewpoints and reveal four prominent influences on agency theory: Weber and Simon, The Great Depression, Cooperation and the Chicago School. This is critical given that understanding the history behind the authors' major theoretical lenses is fundamental to using these theories to explain various phenomena. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a plethora of archival sources and following the influence-mapping approach used by other management history scholars, this manuscript synthesizes historical accounts and archival information to provide a clearer picture of the major historical influences in the formation of agency theory. Findings: We shed light on four areas related to management history that helped propel agency theory. Whereas past scholarship has not recognised them as influencers, we find and show how the industrial revolution, unionization, the stock exchange and other management approaches all played a role in the development of agency theory's core tenants. Originality/value: We extend upon the influential people and events that shaped agency theory, thus providing a fuller understanding of the theory's usefulness. Moreover, we fill in gaps enabling scholars to better understand the context in which the core tenants of agency theory were developed. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study examines the effect of institutional ownership on dividend payouts through the lens of agency theory. We hypothesize that only institutions with certain traits are likely to monitor. Monitoring institutions will use dividend payouts as a tool to mitigate firms' agency problems, conditional on those firms' financial performance. We find that (1) there is a positive relation between lagged long-term institutional ownership with a large stake and the dividend payout ratio, (2) the positive relation is more salient in firms with high agency costs, and (3) the positive relation is more salient when external monitoring is weak. These findings support that (1) concentrated and long-term institutional investors play a monitoring role and (2) monitoring institutions use dividend payouts as a monitoring device. Our findings are robust to endogeneity tests, level and change models, alternative income-based dividend payout measures, alternative measures of long-term institutions, and sub-period analyses.

This article seeks to examine the relationship between the board size and firm performance. Existing literature on board size is based on different theories of corporate governance. While agency theory and resource dependency theory suggest that the board size positively affects performance, stewardship theory favours smaller board size and argues that larger board size negatively impacts the firm performance. The present article adds to the empirical literature by employing panel data analysis of 145 non-financial companies listed in the NSE CNX 200 Index of India corresponding to 16 industries. The study is carried out for a period of five years from 2008 to 2012. The firm performance has been measured using Tobin's Q and the market-to-book value ratio (MBVR) as market-based measures and return on assets (ROA) and return on capital employed (ROCE) as accounting-based measures. The fixed effect model, random effect model and feasible generalised least square (FGLS) regression models are applied to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. The results conclude that the board size has a positive and significant impact on the firm performance. (c) 2016 Institute of Public Enterprise.

Previous studies report inconsistent findings regarding how board monitoring influences firms' research and development (R&D) intensity. This study uses agency theory and resource dependence theory to argue that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between these two constructs. By using board capital theory, the present study also postulates that this curvilinear relationship varies depending on the firm- and industry-specific human capital of outside directors. 467 firm-year observations collected from a randomly selected sample of large public firms from high-tech industries between 2005 and 2010 largely provide empirical support for these arguments. The findings contribute to the corporate governance literature by refining the understanding of the costs and benefits associated with board monitoring. The curvilinear relationship reported herein may also help reconcile prior inconsistent findings. The results also contribute to board capital theory by emphasizing the role of outside directors' firm-specific human capital in the context of R&D investments. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in the association among the board of directors, audit committee effectiveness and the cost of debt between the family- and non-family-owned companies in the Sultanate of Oman. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a panel data set that has multiple observations on the same economic units. Each element has two subscripts: the group identifier, i (68 companies listed on the Muscat Securities Market), and within the group index denoted by t, which identifies time (2005-2011). The regression model of this study is based on the random effects model, which, according to the Hausman and Breusch-Pagan (LM) (Breusch and Pagan, 1980) tests, is an appropriate model. Findings - This study finds that the association between a board of directors' effectiveness and cost of debt is negative and significant for the full sample and non-family firms. This relationship, however, is weak and not significant for family firms. Additionally, this study indicates that audit committee effectiveness has a significant effect on the cost of debt based on the full sample and family firms, but is not significant for non-family firms. Originality/value - This study examines firms in the Sultanate of Oman, where family ownership control is common. Based on a framework conceptualized according to the agency theory, using data from Oman enables a comparison between family and non-family firms with respect to the effect of the board of directors' and audit committee's characteristics as a composite measure. This composite measure captures their combined effect on the propensity of the cost of debt. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The management literature has devoted increased attention to nonmarket activities of firms, such as political involvement and social responsibility, including philanthropy. While these activities may be presumed to have the intent of improving the competitive position of firms or enhancing their reputation, firms have recently increased their support for or opposition to a wide array of politically charged social issues with no direct performance motivation. These "sociopolitical issues" are vastly different from corporate social responsibility and corporate political activities, as they are divisive, emotionally charged, and institutionally contested social issues. In this article, we explore sociopolitical issues and develop a distinct model that relies on multiple theoretical perspectives - agency theory and a push-versus-pull perspective of stakeholder theory - to provide complementary or at times competing explanations for firm involvement in such controversial issues. We also explore the contexts (or facilitating institutional environments) that enable management to get involved in sociopolitical issues. In addition to drawing attention to this growing phenomenon, the article provides guidelines for future research on corporate participation in politically charged social issues.

This study examines the dividend policy behavior of Islamic and conventional banks operating in Arab markets. These banks operate in an environment of Sharia law and low levels of investor protection. Our results support the substitution agency model of dividends for Islamic banks, and Islamic banks use the dividend policy as a substitute mechanism for alleviating relatively more significant agency problems and higher risks of expropriation by insiders. In these markets, conventional banks operate in a more competitive environment and experience relatively less significant agency problems. In contrast to Islamic banks, conventional banks follow the outcome agency model of dividends. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This article examines the relationship between long-term orientation, family involvement in the top management team (TMT), and family firm performance. On the basis of agency and stewardship theory, we propose that the inclusion of family members in the TMT only enhances firm performance if it induces a long-term orientation among management. An empirical analysis involving 201 privately owned family firms from Germany supports our theory that a long-term orientation helps align family and organizational goals. As such, it represents an important mediator that links family involvement in the TMT to performance. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Prior work examining the antecedents of capital structure for small and medium-sized enterprises in emerging markets is limited. This paper sheds light on how the corporate governance mechanisms adopted by firms on the newly established Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) in China influence their use of debt. We find that the financial leverage of GEM firms is positively influenced by executives' shareholding and their excess cash compensation. Ownership concentration appears to reduce leverage, whereas the percentage of tradable shares increases leverage. In contrast, institutional investors' shareholding does not influence the level of debt. Traditional factors such as tax and operating cash flow are insignificant in explaining the debt levels among GEM firms. (c) 2016, The Author(s).

In the private sector, research on information technology (IT) governance has frequently applied the classical view of agency theory and focused on the controlling role played by the board of directors in constraining a potentially opportunistic manager/agent. However, in the public sector, the board of directors does not exist and there may be less need to focus on the controlling aspect of governance and more need to focus on the politically challenging distribution of state resources. In this U.S.-state-based study, we adopt, apply, and extend the legal view of agency theory past its sole focus on the board of directors as the solitary mediating hierarch in order to examine the strategic mediating hierarch role played by the state legislature and then conceptualize and test for the existence of a tactical mediating hierarch played by the IT steering committee and the production role of an independent Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) in using a fee-for-service funding model. We apply these concepts to extend theory to examine the combination of roles that lead to superior outcomes for the state (the principal) versus those necessary for the IT department (the agent). Our results show that by shifting from the control-oriented view of governance in the private sector to a more mediating view in the public sector, important practices may be portable between the public and private sector, despite their widely differing structures.

This paper examines whether and to what degree agency conflicts in ownership structure affect firm leverage ratios and external financing decisions, using a universal sample of UK firms from 1998 to 2012. We use two distinctive measures to capture ownership structure, namely, managerial share ownership (MSO) and institutional ownership. Our empirical results show a non-monotonic relation between MSO and the debt ratio, supporting two competing theories: interest alignment theory and the management entrenchment hypothesis. Nevertheless, institutional ownership is found to be positively related to firm leverage levels. Our results further suggest that firms with concentrated MSO decrease their leverage by increasing the probability of issuing equity over bonds, an effect strengthened during hot market periods.

Product-harm crises are ubiquitous in today's marketplace. Prior research has explored the negative consequences associated with these crises and highlighted effective crisis management strategies. Limited attention, however, has been devoted to exploring the antecedents of such crises. The authors use agency theory to explore corporate governance and top management team (TMT) characteristics that impact firms' likelihood of experiencing a product-harm crisis. They argue that family firms, firms with higher levels of managerial ownership, and firms in which the marketing function has a higher influence in the TMT are likely to exhibit a higher strategic emphasis on product quality. Strategic product-quality emphasis, in turn, mediates these firms' lower likelihood of encountering a product-harm crisis. An analysis of 116 S&P 500 firms across 2006-2011 provides considerable support for the authors' arguments. These results have important implications for practitioners and for scholars working in the areas of innovation, family business, and corporate governance. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to employ agency theory to identify the determinants of the audit delay among Palestinian companies listed on Palestine Stock Exchange (PSE). Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the agency theory, eight hypotheses are tested using data collected from the year 2011 annual reports for all the 46 listed companies on PSE. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the influence of a set of company characteristics, ownership structure variables, and corporate governance mechanisms. Findings - The result of the analysis demonstrated that the audit reporting delay is influenced by the board size, corporate size, status of audit firm, company complexity, existence of audit committee, and ownership dispersion. Research limitations/implications - The main shortcoming of the current study is that the analysis covered the Palestinian companies' annual reports for only one year. A time series analysis might give fuller and understandable picture about the audit report lag (ARL) determinants. The outcome of the study canbeusedbycompanies' managements and policy makers in Palestine to improve future disclosure. Originality/value - This paper adds to the limited audit delay literature in Middle East countries in general and Arab World in particular. This paper not only examines the determinants of the audit delay but also attempts to theorize such delay. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Because security analysts, who serve as brokers between public firms and investors, arrive at their forecasts by incorporating guidance from managers, there is immense pressure on the managers to meet or beat analyst earnings forecasts; moreover, investors reward (penalize) firms for exceeding (missing) analyst forecasts. Reasoning that decisions taken in response to analyst forecasts involve discretionary budgets, the authors study four contingent conditions under which quarterly analyst forecasts drive unanticipated adjustments to advertising and R&D budgets, and the long-term consequences of these budgetary changes. The choice of contingent conditions is related to agency theory-driven concepts of monitoring and bonding costs. Results from a panel data set of 515 firms and a hierarchical Bayesian model that provides firm-level coefficients show that both artificially imposed incentives on managers (monitoring costs) and personal career management concerns (bonding costs) moderate the extent to which managers react to analyst forecasts. Specifically, (1) bonus versus equity proportion of CEO compensation enhances the likelihood of managers reacting to analyst forecasts with unanticipated decreases in advertising and R&D budgets; (2) output experience of CEOs decreases this likelihood; (3) throughput experience of CEOs increases this likelihood; and (4) increasing marketing and R&D intensity decreases this likelihood. The authors also find that the unanticipated adjustments in advertising and R&D budgets adversely affect long-term firm returns and risk. (c) 2016, American Marketing Association.

Purpose: - This paper aimsto synthesize the extant researchon earnings management infamily firms. Design/methodology/approach: - The paper reviews the current state of knowledge about earnings management in family firms, identifying the main theoretical frameworks used in the empirical research on the topic, as well as the main types of said research and its findings. Findings: - Agency theory is identified as the main theoretical framework used. Two major types of research identified in the literature are discussed, namely, earnings management in family firms versus non-family firms and earnings management in different types of family frms. Originality/value: - Important research gaps are identifed, and future research priorities are suggested. These pertain to the lack of research on earnings management in different types of family firms, the utility of using qualitative and experimental research, as well as the importance of using theoretical frameworks better able to capture the peculiarities of family firms.

The widely publicised product recalls of lead-paint tainted toys in 2007 caused serious concerns among consumers, investors and the government. The widespread practice of global outsourcing in toy industry further intensifies consumers and investors' uncertainties about toy safety. This paper assesses the stock market reaction to recent toy recall announcements. Based upon the theoretical underpinnings from agency theory, signalling theory and prospect theory, it also develops an understanding of factors that influence the direction and magnitude of the stock market reaction. One hundred and forty-five toy recall announcements in 2000-2014 were analysed using event study and linear regression. The results show that the announcement of a toy recall was associated with a negative stock market reaction. The stock market reaction was more negative for toy product recall announcements by retailers or distributors, smaller source firms, toys with more severe hazards and source firms with higher growth potential. This paper contributes to the product harm crisis literature by extending the automotive industry-based literature to toy industries and studying their unique features. It is important that toy industry managers are aware that the stock market penalty for a product recall increases with the degree of hazard. Moreover, toy companies, retailers and distributors with high growth potential should be aware of the signal sent by following a proactive recall strategy.

Using principal-agent theories, this study examined differences in the perceptions of nonprofit chief executive officers (CEOs) and board chairs on key governance aspects, including board performance, leadership, satisfaction with diversity, and board meetings. Using data from the CEOs and board chairs of 474 nonprofit organizations, we found statistically significant differences in the governance perceptions of these leaders of nonprofit organizations. The findings provide support for an agency theory explanation about the differing interests of principals (board chairs) and agents (CEOs). The findings suggest that these two sets of nonprofit actors frequently operate from different perspectives, potentially affecting the governance of their organizations.

The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between corporate performance and corporate governance by companies listed on the Palestinian Stock Exchange. Accounting and market performance measures were used to proxy corporate performance. Corporate governance represented by the board of directors' size, the frequency of the annual meetings of the board, existence or otherwise of an audit committee, institutional investors ownership and foreign ownership. To achieve the objective of the study, all non-financial companies listed on the exchange and published their annual reports during the period between 2010 and 2012 were used. The result of the analysis revealed that corporate performance is negatively associated with corporate governance. This implies that the result is inconsistent with agency theory. This might be due to the fact that corporate governance in Palestine is still at its infancy stage. Copyright (c) 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study analyses the effects of agency conflict between "active family owners" (who participate in firm management) and "passive family owners" (who do not do so) on the performance in unlisted Spanish family firms wholly owned by family members. We employ agency theory to argue that ownership concentration by active family owners and governance mechanisms (direct control by passive family owners, existence of board of directors, and family governance mechanisms) improve the firm performance and that this effect intensifies in later-generation firms. Our findings show that family managers' ownership and family governance mechanisms have a positive influence on the performance in second- and later-generation firms. The results also show a positive effect of direct control by passive family owners over active family owners in second- and later-generation firms. However, the existence of a board of directors is not related to family firms' performance. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper addresses the effect of having multiple large shareholders on shareholder protection. More specifically, we examine to what extent this effect depends on whether such large shareholders are beneficiary or fiduciary. Research Findings/Insights: Analyzing longitudinal, hand-collected data covering Swiss listed companies, we find that having several large shareholders leads to overall higher shareholder protection (i.e. adoption of more formal corporate governance mechanisms). This is because large shareholders have an interest in putting more formal governance mechanisms in place when there is another large shareholder that might try to extract rents at the expense of others. Moreover, we find that this effect is driven by the presence of several beneficiary shareholders, i.e. shareholders that invest their own wealth in the company in contrast to dispersed ownership and fiduciary shareholders, i.e. shareholders acting on behalf of others. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Building on recent developments in agency theory, this paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by empirically showing that potential "principal-principal" conflicts among large shareholders lead to overall better shareholder protection in terms of more formal governance mechanisms being adopted. This finding contrasts with situations in which there is only one large shareholder that does not have an interest in strengthening formal corporate governance. Our findings imply, however, that the characteristics of the large shareholders matter: Fiduciary shareholders in the Swiss setting are mostly passive buy-and-hold shareholders and therefore do not engage extensively in improving shareholder protection. Beneficiary shareholders, in contrast, directly intervene in the governance of the firm (i.e. governance by voice), so that in the presence of multiple beneficiary shareholders, more formal governance mechanisms help to monitor not only management but the other large shareholders as well. In addition, more formal governance mechanisms serve as a platform to coordinate their diverging objectives. Practitioner Implications: We demonstrate the influence of a second (or several) large beneficiary shareholder(s), on corporate governance and the benefit to all shareholders. In addition, we propose the strengthening of governance mechanisms as a platform to reconcile conflicting interests among prominent shareholders and contribute to the debate on the allocation of certain voting privileges to long-term shareholders.

This study examines the impact of CEO inside debt on earnings management. Theory predicts that CEOs with higher inside debt holdings adopt less risky corporate policies and choose investment policies that result in less volatile earnings. Under such circumstances, CEOs would face weaker demand for income smoothing. Consistent with these expectations, our results reveal that CEO inside debt is negatively associated with both accrualand real activities-based earnings management. We also find that firms with higher levels of CEO inside debt are less likely to meet or slightly beat analysts' earnings forecasts. Furthermore, the capital market response to positive earnings surprises is greater when CEOs hold higher positions of inside debt. Overall, our findings suggest that inside debt counteracts CEOs' incentives to smooth earnings through earnings management and investors understand the deterrence effect of inside debt on earnings management.

This study incorporates insights from both institutional and family socioemotional wealth perspectives with agency theory to examine the relationships among governance practices, family ownership, and information disclosure quality. Employing a sample of 516 publicly listed firms in Taiwan over a period of 5 years (2006-2010), we found that high levels of board independence and board activity have a significant positive effect on disclosure quality. Further, family ownership positively moderated the relationship between board independence and disclosure quality. This relationship is stronger with a higher level of family ownership. The results support the institutional proposition that family-owned firms that pursue socioemotional wealth are more likely to promote information transparency to gain legitimacy and enhance their reputations with outside stakeholders.

Purpose: This study aims to understand the antecedents of export performance at the firm level. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, the authors investigate how the board composition determines the export competitiveness of the firms operating in an emerging country from the point of view of corporate governance mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations. The separation of chairman of board of directors and chief executive officer (CEO) positions has significantly positive impact on export performance. On the other hand, the authors find no support for the position that inside director professional representation neither reduce nor increase all measures of export performance of firms. In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Findings: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is a negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations. The separation of chairman of board of directors and CEO positions has significantly positive impact on export performance. On the other hand, the authors find no support for the position that inside director professional representation neither reduce nor increase all measures of export performance of firms. In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Research limitations/implications: Export performance is one of the most widely researched areas within international marketing research but least reached topic of management. However, exporting continues to be an important mode of internationalization for multinational companies, especially operating an emerging economy. This study is one of the first studies on the impact of governance factors such as board structure on only export performance rather than overall (firm) performance in light of international management. In other words, the study of the determinants of exports in the context of an emerging economy is an important contribution to the literature, given that our understanding of how the board composition determines the export competitiveness from the point of view of firms operating in an emerging country such as Turkey. Moreover, this research investigates this relationship at objective export performance dimensions using primary data set from listed and non-listed export firms. Practical implications: The current study offered in-depth information to multinational companies that aim to gain a competitive exporting advantage in Turkey. Further, the results of this study give managers an opportunity to see the reasons behind the success of the exporting firms from the point of view of corporate governance mechanism. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors contribute to this recent stream of research providing evidence on the effects of governance mechanism on the export performance from the point of view of emerging countries. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, and international management, the authors provide a new framework that models the linkages between board composition and export performance. This work helps us to gain a deeper understanding of how board dynamics contribute to the internalization of firms. Research in this area has been sparse, although some studies have linked governance with export intensity. In this effort, the authors differentiate from previous studies in several ways.

Based on Upper Echelons Theory and Agency Theory, we explore the effect of CEOs' power through their tenure, board committee membership and other corporate governance factors on idiosyncratic volatility. Our study addresses the gap in the literature to find the direct link between the source of corporate governance practices and idiosyncratic volatility in stock price. We use a generalised method of moments in a panel analysis of Australian firms for 2004-2013 and a robust model that controls for firm size, firm age, trading volume, market-to-book ratio, dividend payout, the global financial crisis, product market competition and financial intermediaries. We find that CEOs who have stronger managerial power are associated with lower idiosyncratic volatility. This determining factor remains significant with the inclusion of widely-researched firm characteristics and external factors on idiosyncratic volatility in our robust analysis.

This study extends the family firm performance literature by focusing on birth order differences among descendant CEOs. Data collected from a sample of Korean family firms yield three insights. First, descendant birth order is directly associated with differences in the distribution of control through ownership, leadership (i.e., CEO), and the incorporation of outside board participation and governance. Second, descendant birth order also moderates the relationship between outside block holdings and firm performance. Third, we find evidence suggesting that because of firm performance differences, first-son descendant CEOs may find themselves more often replaced over time. (c) 2016, (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Empirical findings on the relationship between CEO shareholdings and earnings manipulation are inconclusive. In response, this study attempts to shed more light by suggesting that this relationship is influenced by situational contingencies that affect CEO perceptions of the costs and benefits associated with earnings manipulation. To support this perspective we draw on the prospect theory and the approach/inhibition theory of power to examine the relationship between CEO shareholdings and earnings manipulation in light of CEO power. We test this relationship on a sample of 16,873 observations from 2,257 US public firms. Findings show that increasing CEO shareholdings has a negative effect on earnings management, and on re-statements due to irregularities, and that duality positively moderates these relationships. The findings contribute to the corporate governance practice since they have implications for the design of CEO remuneration packages. (c) 2016 European Academy of Management.

The ownership structure of Chinese firms has experienced significant changes over the last three decades, including the development of a fast growing stock market through which a large number of domestic firms have become publicly traded corporations. These changes have drawn increasing attention from researchers of corporate governance. In this article, we review the empirical research on corporate governance in China, with a focus on the internal and external governance mechanisms that have been investigated and the findings about the effectiveness of these mechanisms. On the basis of our review of 132 studies, we summarize the major findings and discuss the limitation of agency theory in understanding the governance issue in Chinese firms. We offer several ideas (e.g., the importance of the social context, new conceptualization of governance, different outcomes of governance, and data/method issues) for a new agenda to guide future research in the corporate governance of firms operating in the Chinese and other emerging economy contexts.

This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by examining relations between family involvement and CEO compensation. Using a panel of 362 small U.S. listed firms, we analyze how founding families influence firm performance through option portfolio price sensitivity. Consistent with the dual agency framework, we find that family firms have lower CEO incentive pay, which is further reduced by higher executive ownership. Interestingly, such incentive pay offsets the positive impact that families have on firm valuation. Collectively, our results show that, compared with nonfamily firms, lower incentive pay adopted by family firms due to lower agency costs mitigates the direct effect of family involvement on firm performance. Once accounting for CEO incentive pay, we do not observe performance differences between family and nonfamily firms. (c) 2016 International Council for Small Business

Purpose: Borrowing from arguments of agency theory, the present study aims to investigate the moderating effect of the deviation from optimal franchising on the relationship between corporate governance provisions and firm financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 35 publicly listed US restaurant firms for the 1990-2008 period. The study uses a hierarchical regression with cross-sectional time-series fixed effects. Findings: The results show that the deviation from optimal franchising worsens the negative relationship between corporate governance provisions and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The availability of governance data restricts our sample to large publicly listed firms in the US restaurant industry, limiting the ability to generalize results for small and privately held restaurant firms. Practical implications: Firm executives should not only pay attention to which corporate governance provisions they adopt but also strive to maintain an optimal level of franchising. Originality/value: The key contribution of this study to governance literature is that this study demonstrates how the presence of multiple governance mechanisms influences firm performance.

Recent studies have criticized MBA programs for their association with self-serving behavior, although there is little empirical research to establish the firm-level consequences of that relationship. We explored whether MBAs versus non-MBAs in a sample of celebrated CEOs of major U.S. companies--thus CEOs who have achieved and had opportunity to exploit their fame--were more apt than their counterparts to engage in self-serving behavior that benefits them but disadvantages their companies. We assessed this behavior via the pursuit of costly growth strategies, an inability to sustain performance, and the capacity to obtain superior private benefits in compensation. Our analysis of 444 star CEOs celebrated on the covers of major business publications confirmed that an MBA education either fosters or is related to such behavior among these executives.

Recent analyses of U.S. public family firms (PFFs) show that family firms outperform other forms of organization. However, scholars call for more studies to determine why PFFs outperform the market. High performance work systems (HPWSs) reflect the extent to which an organization adopts and implements a strategic approach in HRM practices and could be why PFFs outperform. Using the stewardship perspective, agency theory, and the resource-based view of the firm, this study empirically examines the relationship among family governance oversight, HPWS, and performance at PFFs. Using a sample of 159 Taiwanese public firms, the empirical results indicate that independent directors on the board and the level of family member board participation associate with HPWS adoption. Adopting HPWS also mediates the effect of independent directors and subjective firm performance. This finding has both theoretical and practical implications. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore factors influencing the effectiveness of buyer initiated behavioral-based governance methods (BBGMs). The ability of BBGMs to improve supplier performance is assessed considering power imbalances and the resource intensiveness of the BBGM. Agency Theory is used as an interpretive lens. Design/methodology/approach: An explorative multiple case study approach is used to collect qualitative and quantitative data from buying companies involved in 13 BBGMs. Findings: Drawing on Agency Theory several factors are identified which can explain BBGM effectiveness considering power differences and the resource intensiveness of the BBGM. The data show that even high resource intensive BBGMs can be implemented effectively if there are benefits for a powerful supplier. Cultural influences and uncertainty of the business environment also play a role. Originality/value: This study develops a series of propositions indicating that Agency Theory can provide valuable guidance on how to better understand the effectiveness of BBGMs. Underlying mechanisms are identified that explain how power imbalance does not necessarily make improvement initiatives unsuccessful.

In this study, we examine how board characteristics, such as the independent director ratio, board size, and the number of interlocks, influence the investment of slack resources into research and development (R&D) by a firm. Both the agency theory and resource dependence theory predict a positive influence of independent director ratio on the financial slack-R&D investment relationship. However in the case of board size and number of interlocks, resource dependence theory argues for a positive moderating effect, while agency theory predicts a negative effect. The hypotheses are tested on the seven-year panel data of 172 firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry, an emerging economy, high technology industry. We find broad support for the resource provisioning role of the board of directors, which is attributed to the emerging economy context of the Indian pharmaceutical industry, where firms face high levels of opportunity but lack resources to make use of them effectively.

This study investigates the association between investment decisions and financial reporting quality in the context of family firms versus non-family firms. Building on the classic agency theory and the behavioral agency theory, we argue that financial reporting quality may play a different role on investment decisions for family and non-family firms. We address our research question by using a sample of listed firms in Taiwan from 1996 to 2011. Consistent with the behavioral agency theory, our findings suggest that family firms are more likely to under-invest than non-family firms in order to protect their socioemotional wealth, and financial reporting quality is more negatively associated with family firms' under-investment behavior. The existence of internal financing channels attenuates this negative association. However, this study does not find a significant role on such association when a family member serves as the chief executive officer. These results are robust after controlling for the potential endogeneity issue of financial reporting quality, alternate measures of inefficient investment as well as internal financing channels, family firm subsample, and different industry groups. This study contributes to the literature on the relation between financial reporting quality and investment decisions by highlighting the unique characteristics of family firms.

On the basis of agency theory and resource dependence theory, as well as other corporate governance literature, it is predicted that board composition measured as the ratio of non-executive to executive board members and the number of directors on a firm's board can be positively related to firm performance. This study seeks to test the predictions of this body of theory and to investigate the form of the empirical relationships among these effects. In so doing, this study tests theory that relates these variables in the context of a developing country, using data from South Africa's Johannesburg Stock Exchange, over a seven-year period, 2006-2012.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between ownership structure and indebtedness for a sample of 2,544 Spanish small and medium enterprises. A System Generalized Method of Moments methodology is applied to control for the heterogeneity and endogeneity problems. The finding shows a negative effect of several measures of ownership on debt ratio. Therefore, the presence of an individual as main shareholder has a positive effect on debt, while the presence of a corporation as main shareholder exerts a negative influence. As research implications, this paper includes the agency problem based on principal-principal conflicts to explain the capital structure of small and medium enterprises, going beyond traditional principal-agent conflicts. The main practical implications of the paper is that owners who seek equity financing can use the results of this study for understanding better why investors are reluctant to invest in their small and medium enterprises. Policymakers can use the results of this study to develop better policies and to promote better provision of information for all stakeholders. About the contribution of this study, we are not aware of any paper that uses a panel of small and medium enterprises operating in a French-civil law country to examine the relationship between indebtedness and three different proxies of the ownership structure.

Islamic banks are banks that are set up to operate within the Islamic business framework that is more equitable and based on socio-economic welfare of the society and the people. In Islamic law on commercial transactions and other related contractual activities (the framework), transparency and adequate disclosure are the fundamental determinants of a successful and peaceful relationship between the contracting parties. This is because the stakeholders of Islamic banks believed that the prescriptions of the framework would be the key determinants of the bank's Ethical Identity Disclosures (EID). This study aimed at exploring and identifying the practical determinants of EID in Islamic banks. Disclosure information in annual reports (from 2007 to 2011) of 21 Islamic banks operating in Bahrain and Malaysia was gathered and analysed using Ethical Identity Index (EII) and Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) models. The results of EII and MRA on nine ethical disclosure dimensions consisting of 80 constructs and 4 assumed determinants of EID among Islamic banks indicated that EID of both countries is low and that independent directors do not affect the level of social disclosure. However, board size, Shari'ah supervisory Board and investment account holders can significantly influence the disclosure level in Islamic banks. Hence, we conclude that our findings are in conflict with main theories such as agency theory, however supports institutional theory.

Prior research suggests that information technology (IT) project escalation can result from the deaf effect, a phenomenon in which decision makers fail to heed risk warnings communicated by others. Drawing inspiration from stewardship theory, we posited that when messengers carrying risk warnings about a project are seen as collaborative partners, decision makers are more likely to heed the message. Conversely, we theorized that when messengers are seen as opponents, decision makers are more likely to exhibit the deaf effect. We further posited that certain psychological factors (i.e., framing and perceived control) would moderate the effect of the messenger-recipient relationship on the deaf effect. To test these ideas, we conducted two experiments. When messengers were seen as collaborative partners, recipients assigned more relevance to the risk warning and perceived a higher risk, making them less willing to continue the project. Framing the outcomes associated with redirecting or continuing the project in terms of losses (rather than gains) weakened this effect. However, when recipients perceived a high degree of control over the project the effect was strengthened. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.

This study aims to investigate the influence of board interlocking in income smoothing practices in public companies with shares traded on the BM&FBOVESPA. To achieve this objective we adopted a sample comprised of 58 Brazilian companies included in the Bovespa index. The study is classified as empirical and analytical and uses as a proxy for income smoothing a metric called the "smoothing factor" (SF), obtained through the factor analysis technique using the metrics EM1 and EM3 from Leuz, Nanda and Wysocki (2003). As independent variables we employed indicators of social network analysis. From a theoretical point of view, the study is relevant and innovates in making the connection between the resource dependence theory, the agency theory and board interlocking. In practical terms, the study shows the effects of the constitutive elements of corporate social networks, arising from the board interlocking structure, on income smoothing accounting practices. Regression with panel data using fixed effects showed that the constituent elements of corporate social networks tend to influence the practice of smoothing in the sample used. The results of the study show that companies that share board members with other organizations which smooth their results tend to adopt this organizational practice more easily, which can be explained by: (i) companies causing variations in performance due to operational decisions or financial reporting choices; and (ii) managers making use of discretionary practices in the reporting of profits.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between boards and board activity and subsequent business performance, in the context of high-growth companies, through the lens of decision making and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: A critical realist approach was used to conduct a longitudinal multiple-case study of two medium-sized, quasi-public high-growth companies. Data collection included first-hand observations of boards in session, semi-structured interviews with key actors and the inspection of board and company documentation. An iterative approach to analysis was used to gain an in-depth understanding of how the boards worked and how they sought to exert influence. Findings: The paper provides empirical insight about board involvement in strategic management. A proactive involvement by boards in the strategy development process and assessment of strategic options, and a collaborative form of board involvement in strategic management together with management is indicated as being important if the board is to exert influence beyond the boardroom. A conceptual model of a collaborative form of board-management interaction is developed. Practical implications: The paper provides guidance for boards, suggesting that a more direct level of involvement in strategic management by the board together with management may be material to improved business performance. Originality/value: The paper responds to calls for more research on the relationship between boards and business performance. It contributes much-needed first-hand evidence from within the boardroom.

Despite the increasing use of the agency perspective in studies of headquarters-subsidiaries relations in the multinational corporation (MNC), opponents fundamentally question its utility. In an attempt to contribute to this debate, we evaluate prior studies and develop considerations for future research. Our review of extant studies of headquarters-subsidiaries relations that make (explicit) use of the agency perspective reveals two significant shortcomings. First, we identify a need to validate the underlying assumptions when using the agency perspective in studies of headquarters-subsidiaries relations. Second, we detect a need to better account for the complex nature of headquarters-subsidiary relations in the MNC. A focus on these two areas can improve the use of the agency perspective and, ultimately, help resolve the contentious debate over the utility of the agency perspective.

This paper examines the effects of board quality on the relationship between corporate bankruptcy and nomination committee effectiveness. We argue that the proportion of outside directors, a proxy of board quality, arguably captures the extent of board control and resources. Based on dataset from 1835 firm-year observations for 98 bankrupt and 269 non-bankrupt UK listed non-financial firms between 1994 and 2011 and using the agency and resource dependence theories, we predict and find that nomination committee effectiveness negatively affects corporate bankruptcy and that board quality mitigates the negative effects. The results lend support to the notion that firms benefit from board quality in terms of outside directors' ability to monitor CEO on behalf of shareholders and also provide advice, counsel and legitimacy to the firm. This study extends the present research on corporate bankruptcy by providing evidence on the impact of board quality and nomination committee effectiveness on UK corporate bankruptcy.

In this study, we investigate how persuasiveness of self-Assessment-based post-completion auditing (PCA) reports on capital investment is constructed. We examine what makes companies consider that information in these reports rises to an acceptable quality level. The investigation was motivated by extant agency theory (AT) informed literature suggesting that self-Auditing will entail obvious risks for the quality of PCA reports in terms of data manipulation. We employed actor-network theory as our method theory. The empirical evidence of our case study came from 24 semi-structured interviews and the analysis of the construction of 22 PCA reports of strategic investments in one of the major European forest companies. We add to the capital budgeting literature by identifying and discussing the role of various conditions affecting the construction of persuasiveness of PCA reports. We maintain that the existence of three conditions (i.e. An appropriate collective process, alignment with relevant external/internal reference points, and following of formal guidance) can play a major role in facilitating the production of a persuasive PCA report. Additionally, the paper is able to make sense of the complex process of fabricating the persuasiveness of PCA reports, which would remain a black box when examined from the AT viewpoint only.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Governments worldwide bestow orders of merit upon their citizens as a recognition of distinguished service. In this paper, I study whether orders of merit can function as an external form of perquisite through which the government can supplement the compensation given by a publicly listed firm to the CEO. Research Findings/Insights: I build upon the literature on perquisites to develop hypotheses on the relationship between orders of merit and executive compensation. The predictions are tested through an empirical analysis that revolves around the 1974 legal reform in which Sweden discontinued the conferral of orders of merit to citizens. The difference-in-differences methodology I employ enables me to make causal statements on the relationship between orders of merit, firm performance, and monetary compensation. I find that orders of merit function as symbols that visibly confirm social status vis-a-vis the general public and are valued by CEOs as a substitute for the need to engage in conspicuous consumption. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support that orders of merit can be seen as an external form of perquisite that can substitute for monetary compensation. Essentially, this is evidence that governments can affect CEO salaries through the provision of a non-monetary status good. The findings also indicate that CEOs not only care about distinguishing themselves as "superstars" among their peer group of corporate leaders but also value non-monetary symbols that emphasize their social status in relation to the general public. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Companies should take into account that CEOs may receive valuable status goods from the government when determining compensation policies. In addition, governments should consider that the removal of non-monetary awards may result in higher levels of monetary compensation in publicly listed firms. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This paper investigates whether auditors' client acceptance and pricing decisions following the resignation of the incumbent auditor in family firms are significantly different from those in non-family firms. Relying on the auditing literature (client acceptance and audit pricing) and using insights from the agency theory, we document that successor auditors incorporate a firm's ownership structure into their acceptance and pricing decisions following the resignation of the incumbent auditor. Big 4 auditors are more likely to serve as successor auditors following auditor resignations in family firms as opposed to non-family firms. The changes in audit fees following auditor resignations in family firms, however, are significantly smaller than those in non-family firms. These results hold when we account for whether a family firm is managed by a founder, a descendant, or by a professional manager, and when we use the percentage of shares held by the family members as another proxy for family ownership. Additional analysis further demonstrates that the likelihood of financial restatements in family firms in the post-resignation period are significantly lower than those in non-family firms. Overall, our findings suggest that Big 4 auditors perceive family firms from which the incumbent auditors resigned as being less risky than their non-family counterparts.

Blockholders impact strategic firm decisions because they are better at monitoring managers than dispersed shareholder groups. Nevertheless, we do not sufficiently understand how preferences of different blockholder types impact strategic firm decisions. We discuss this in the context of takeover premiums offered for publicly listed firms. Prior studies have argued that managers are often tempted to offer excessively high premiums. Consistently, blockholders might better control managers and ensure lower premiums. To better understand the impact of blockholder preferences, we focus on the special case of family firms. Specifically, drawing on the behavioral agency model, we hypothesize that bidders with family blockholders offer lower premiums than bidders with other blockholders or bidders without blockholders. Our empirical results support our hypotheses based on a sample of 149 takeover offers. (c) 2015, (c) The Author(s) 2015.

The audit committees, as a part of the internal corporate governance mechanisms, play an important role to enhance the financial reporting quality. The busyness of audit committee members of a firm in boards and committees of other firms can affect its independent functioning, ceteris paribus. The current study examines, first, the association between multiple directorships of audit committee members and quality of financial reporting in India, second, whether endogenously determined busyness limits of busyness of the audit committee members provide better insights than those exogenously mandated by regulators. The study finds that endogenously determined busyness limits of sub-samples and the full sample explain the association between multiple directorships of audit committee members and financial reporting quality in a better way than those stipulated by regulators. Further, a lower (higher) level of busyness of audit committee members enhances (deteriorates) financial reporting quality of firms. (c) Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This paper asks the question whether international executives receive higher pay than their non-international peers. Building upon human capital theory and agency theory, we assume that highly international executives achieve higher market value in terms of their level of compensation than less international executives. To investigate this relationship, we use a multidimensional construct of internationalisation and differentiate between fixed and variable pay components of top executives. Based on a comprehensive sample of top executives from Germany's DAX firms, we find empirical evidence that 'being international' pays off for the individual in terms of variable compensation but not in terms of fixed compensation. We also demonstrate that the structure of compensation is affected by the internationalisation level of the supervisory board members. Hence, we show that governance bodies who are deciding on management board members' compensation should not be neglected in top management research. Copyright (c) 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The study analyzes the characteristics that motivate the voluntary disclosure on intangible representing organizational structural capital of the banking organizations registered on stock exchanges: Brazil and Spain. Traditional accounting is not approaching the real value of the organizations, obtained by its intangible capital. To mitigate the marked difference between the book value and the market price of these organizations, the trend to voluntary disclosures on their intangible resources has emerged. The asymmetry of information, resulting from not accounting for the organizational structural resources is studied by 2 theoretical perspectives. Agency theory suggests that the voluntary disclosure of information reduces agency costs. The theory of the cost of the owner assumes that reveal information generates additional costs, as well as the possibility of loss of its competitive advantages. This research examines 174 annual reports of 29 banks, from 2006 to 2011. The technique of multiple linear regressions using the method of least squares with panel data was used. The test results confirm the hypothesis that large banks, the most profitable and the oldest are more motivated to voluntarily disclose information representing organizational structural capital.

In 2003, a new UK corporate governance Code recommended that the CEO should not become chairman of the same firm. The UK regulator, adopting an agency theory perspective, argued that this prevents powerful CEOs from clinging to power, to the detriment of firm performance. An alternative viewpoint, offered by stewardship theory, proposes that managers are inherently motivated to act in the best interests of the company and such controls are unnecessary, bringing no benefits to shareholders. This study therefore asks: (i) Does allowing the CEO to remain as chair damage firm performance? (ii) Did the changes to recommended best practice affect the number of CEOs remaining as chairman? (iii) Did the Combined Code (2003) affect the use of relay-style succession in the UK? Analysing a sample of 225 CEO routine departure events from 1996 to 2007 produces the answers: (i) this practice caused no apparent harm to accounting or stock market performance; (ii) there was a significant reduction in the practice in the period following the reform; and (iii) while UK firms were employing relay-style succession practices prior to the reforms, this has since abated. Overall, the evidence fails to support the agency view adopted by UK regulators. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd

This study assesses the link between nomination committees' presence and size as well as male directors on nomination committee and gender diversity in Ghanaian boardrooms. We use a dataset of 25 listed and 20 unlisted Ghanaian firms for January 2006 to December 2012; nine years after the Ghana Government endorsed an Affirmative Action Plan to achieve 40% representation of women on all boards by the year 2000. We employ probit and logit regressions to test our hypotheses. Listed firms and financial institutions are more likely to have more gender diverse boards. By contrast, we have no evidence to support the link between board gender diversity and board size, firm age, firm size, firm ownership, board composition and nomination committees' presence and size as well as male directors on nomination committee. Overall, our results raise questions on the appropriateness of the continual use of both the agency and resource dependency theories in explaining board gender diversity in developing economies' perspective.

This study attempts to investigate the effect of the ownership structure characteristics (ownership concentration, managerial ownership and government ownership) on firm performance (ROA) among non-financial Omani companies during 2012-2014. For achieving the objective of this study, 81 firms were taken as a sample to test the above relations. The sampling was obtained from annual report of the companies for three years with a total sampling equal to 243 firms. Multiple regression analysis was employed to test the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. In addition, this study tried to fill the gap in the existing literature concerning the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance in the developing countries such as Oman. This study found a positive and significant association between ownership concentration and government ownership to firm performance (ROA). The study provides some suggestions for future researchers before the conclusion. (c) 2016, Virtus interpress. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the possible trade-off between accountability and enterprise in the context of comply or explain governance. The issue was addressed through examining the effect of compliance with the corporate governance code (CGC) on corporate entrepreneurship (CE) and organisational performance. Design/methodology/approach: Based on cross-sectional survey and content analysis of annual reports, the level of CE and compliance with the CGC were measured in the large and medium-listed companies in the UK during 2010. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used for data analysis. Findings: The results suggest no conflict between compliance with the CGC and CE in the UK, which can be attributed to the flexibility of the "comply or explain" approach. This implies that no trade-off between accountability and enterprise in the context of comply or explain governance. Practical implications: The study provides evidence in support of the regulatory governance framework in the UK and the comply or explain approach at large. This evidence contributes to the debate on the rules-based or principles-based governance, which may affect future CG regulations. It can also guide the directors to achieve the balance between their conformance and performance roles. Originality/value: The study bridges the gap between CG and CE disciplines through developing a theoretical model that integrate contingency and agency theories lenses. Adopting a holistic approach provides insights into the relationships between CG and CE, rather than investigating the effect of each of these practices separately on organisational performance.

Tension often arises when Chapter 6 business rescue practitioners (BRPs) are appointed by directors to rescue their distressed businesses. Regulating by means of standard agency contracting becomes irrelevant in the resulting multiple relationships. Looking through the agency lens, using analytic autoethnography and compiling narratives, this paper explains the perceptions of what appear to be quasiagency relationships and obtains a better understanding of these. The findings suggest that the apparent principal-agent relationships suffer from asymmetries of goals, information access, informal power and diverging perceptions of moral hazard, transaction costs and adverse selection. As a solution, contracting has been shown to have limited value owing to outcome uncertainty and measurability. This is because the tasks of the BRP are non-programmable and term-dependent. The findings provide filing directors, shareholders, creditors, regulatory authorities and BRPs in this newly instituted regime, with enhanced understanding of how the relationships manifest in practice and overcome the non-contractibility of the newly formed relationships.

Committees on a board of directors are now subject to recommendations by regulations in practically all jurisdictions. At the same time, scholarly work on the topic has escalated since the mid-1990s. In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

Purpose: This paper aims to explore an alternative approach to regulation for addressing governance problems relating to director and executive remuneration in publicly listed firms. The author investigates the development of hybrid regulatory framework, composed of state regulation and self-regulation, for remuneration governance in Australia. Design/methodology/approach: The synthesis of constructs borrowed from agency and institutional theories and its contextual analysis examines the effectiveness of formal (state regulation) and informal (self-regulation) institutions for the development of a hybrid of regulation. Thereafter, the author examines the impact of hybrid regulation on remuneration disclosure behavior in Australia. Findings: The author finds that improvement in disclosure is primarily driven by the establishment of remuneration committees and separate role of chief executive officer (CEO) and chairperson but weakened by the presence of CEO at remuneration committee and presence of remuneration consultant. Originality/value: Global crises have called for greater transparency and protection of investors through state regulation alone. However, corporate governance, being a social practice that is shaped by diverse interests, calls for a holistic approach. A useful contribution of this study is that through an in-depth examination into the stages and actors of the government interventions involving the balancing of tension between conflicting forces, it provides insights for developing an effective regulatory hybrid which has greater acceptance for corporate governance. In conclusion, it implies the significance of priming the social arena through active engagement of diverse market forces prior to introducing state regulation.

Stock options (hereafter SOs) have been extensively investigated by the literature. The debate has been mainly grounded in the agency theory that has interpreted these tools as mechanisms to align the conflicting interests of managers and owners towards the shareholder value maximization. However, the latest empirical evidence suggests that SOs are often used by opportunistic managers to extract rents to the detriment of shareholders. In addition, literature identifies the perceived cost as a further theoretical lens to interpret the use of SOs. Despite the growing interest around the topic, the research is still fragmented and fails to present a comprehensive picture on the factors that affect the aim of SOs. Our literature review attempts to fill this gap by providing a systematization of the studies on the topic. The paper concludes by presenting the theoretical and practical implications of the study and suggesting directions for future research. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The purpose of this article is to examine the Intellectual Capital (IC) disclosure strategies of high-tech companies under different theoretical perspectives (agency, signalling and proprietary costs theories). According to the agency theory, the failure of traditional financial statements to report the 'soft assets' would lead knowledge-intensive firms (where the components of IC are structurally higher) to provide a higher level of disclosure in order to reduce the greater information asymmetries with external firm agents. However, because of the highly proprietary nature of IC information (proprietary costs theory) as well as the relevance of IC information to externally signal the key sources of superior quality of a company (signalling theory), different IC disclosure strategies may be adopted by managers of intellectual-capital-rich firms, depending on the particular motivations associated with firm-specific characteristics of these companies. Therefore, this study aims to better understand which theoretical framework under examination (if any) is best at interpreting the observed IC disclosure policies of high-tech companies. To this end, we deduce, and test, a set of hypotheses in accordance with the theoretical frameworks considered. The study also takes into account the effects of changes in the governmental regulation concerning non-financial information that occurred during the period examined. The empirical analysis is conducted on all Italian high-tech listed companies and based on longitudinal data (of 5 years: 2007-2011). By using longitudinal data and the population of all of the high-tech Italian companies, the analysis overcomes the well-known limitations of the sampling and the cross-sectional data that provide snapshot results. The findings reveal that the companies' disclosure strategy primarily depends on the specific category of the IC information. In particular, the results suggest that the proprietary costs theory prevails in explaining the companies' disclosure behaviour on internal IC information. The signalling theory prevails in the explanation of the communication strategies about external IC most likely to enhance investors' confidence in the intangible key value drivers relating to relational capital. Finally, for companies examined, higher levels of ownership diffusion represent the primary incentive to disclose human capital information to reduce agency/monitoring costs (in presence of higher leverage) or signal to the market the superior quality (in presence of higher profitability). This article extends the existing empirical literature on IC disclosure behaviour in high-tech industries by analysing the disclosure strategies of high-tech companies under different theoretical perspectives including proprietary cost theory. In addition, the comprehensive regression model (with specific two-way interaction terms) used in this study expands on the extant approaches for the analysis of IC disclosure determinants allowing to capture some aspects that could be omitted when only the explanation variables taken separately are considered. This study has practical implications for various parties, such as regulators. It provides empirical evidence for the primary limits (relating to the proprietary costs) to an introduction of mandatory law requirements regarding the information on internal structure of IC. In particular, our findings prove that companies exposed to the threat of competitive disadvantages prefer not to provide - by formal channels, such as annual reports - additional internal IC information.

This paper proposes to investigate the postulations of renowned agency theory and shareholder value (SHV) in relation to corporate governance (CG) attributes. SHV is of a great concern to the shareholders of firms. SHV have been investigated by numerous studies of CG but with inconsistent empirical evidence. This study will focus on investigating the impact of CG attributes on SHV measured by Tobin's Q or return on both equity and assets. The paper conceptualized four attributes (Separate leadership, proportion of Independent director, independent chairman, independence of nomination committee) from CG mechanism in relation to SHV in companies listed on BURSA Malaysia. This is a conceptual paper which proposes to investigate the relationship between SHV and separate leadership, SHV and proportion of independent director, SHV and independent chairman, SHV and independence of nomination committee in the context of Malaysia. The proposed study has value for Malaysian government, policy makers, corporate boards, stock exchange and shareholders by highlighting the distinct impact on SHV and its relation with separate leadership, proportion of independent director, independent chairman, and independence of nomination committee.

The presence of key institutional investors/owners and BOD characteristics as highlighted by Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) may have influence on the yield to maturity (YTM) of bonds and sukuk. It is argued that higher institutional ownerships will produce enhanced active monitoring on cost of debt and presumably more control on the likelihood of default risk occurrence as measured by the size of yield spreads for conventional bonds and sukuk. Agency theory also explains the relationship between principal and agent and the possible misalignment of interest of both parties is reflected through the incurrence of what is termed as agency cost. To reduce this agency cost requires the necessity of incurrence of cost of monitoring and controlling by the principal which in large firms is represented by institutional investors which delegated this responsibility to the appointed board of directors (BOD). Thus, the main objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between these corporate governance mechanisms with respect to institutional investors and BOD characteristics with the default risk as proxy by yield spread of bond and sukuk in Malaysia. The data are obtained from firm issuers' annual reports, Bondinfo Hub of Malaysian Central Bank, Malaysian Department of Statistics and Bloomberg databases for the period beginning 2000 to 2014. Unbalanced panel data are applied for the tests which cover the pooled ordinary least square (OLS), fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models. The results suggest that the presence of institutional ownerships does have an inverse relationship on the default risk for long-term sukuk. However, the results do not support any relationship between institutional ownerships and long-term conventional bonds defaults. Mixed result reveal by BOD characteristics.

Our study is based on the "Agency Theory", as it interprets the relationship between corporate governance and market capitalization of firms listed in Bahrain Bourse (BB). Longitudinal data is used in this study from 36 listed firms in Bahrain Bourse during the period of 2009-2013. A set of econometric methods, including the fixed effects method, is used to overcome different measurement problems of such relationship. The study findings include a set of results that are related to effect of ownership structure and board of directors' characteristics on market capitalization of firms. Based on these findings, a set of recommendations, along with study limitations and future research, are put forward. (c) 2016, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

This study examined the influence of agency conflict Type I (as represented by managerial ownership and institutional ownership), and agency conflict Type II (as represented by control rights, cash flow rights, cash flow rights leverage) on earnings management. A model was developed and tested using a sample of 108 pyramidal structure companies listed on Indonesian stock exchange from 2008 to 2012. Data were collected and analyzed using least square regression model. The result showed that there is a significant association between managerial ownership and control rights. However, control rights (in agency conflict Type II) have the greatest influence on earnings management. Consequently, Type II agency conflict have the largest influence on earnings management compared to Type I agency conflict. The significance of the study is the potentials to assist the institutions and investors know the actual company performance and provides a better understanding of the agency theory more broadly viz. the relative impacts of Types I and II agency conflicts.

This study examines whether the characteristics of the board of directors may affect the level of remuneration, for two samples having different systems of governance for the period from 2002 to 2010. Given the importance the financial crisis for executive pay, investigations in executive compensation during periods of crisis are very limited. This study provides a contribution to the literature where we tried to determine if the manager takes advantage of this period of instability. The results indicate the positive impact of the period of crisis on the level of compensation of the U.S. manager, which is not true with his French counterpart. To our knowledge, no study has been conducted on board effectiveness during periods of instability. The results show that during this period this mechanism is unable to control the manager who benefits from excessive compensation.

Agency theory, despite its influential normative prescriptions, has been subject to a long-standing critique from management scholars for being theoretically inconsistent and empirically unsubstantiated. The article examines how agency theory is rooted in contractarian theory of the firm that by and large renders extant corporate law irrelevant and instead emphasizes the auxiliary benefits of the market (i.e. financial markets). What is addressed as 'the market for corporate control', based on the ceaseless pricing of the shares and bonds issued by public firms, is portrayed as a more effective mechanism for disciplining managers and monitoring the corporate system than corporate legislation and court ruling. This argument, derived from elementary neoclassic economic theory, turns a blind eye to the historical roots of corporate law and overstate the ability of the, e.g., shareholders to assess managerial decision-making on basis of information available in the market. Ultimately, agency theorists and contractarians, in their pursuit of free-market capitalism, seek to disconnect the corporate system from the authority and regulatory control of the state.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze certain organizational changes that occur after privatization. More specifically, the authors analyze from an agency theory perspective how changes at the corporate governance level (ownership type/structure and board of directors) influence firm strategy, and what implications these issues have for the design of compensation mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology employed in the study can be described as a longitudinal multiple case study approach. A multiple case study enables the comparison of pre- and post-privatization periods in five Spanish companies. This methodology is especially suitable to track the organizational changes occurring in relation to the firms' internal management. Findings - First, the variables that traditionally relate to greater board independence in monitoring do not suffer from variation after privatization. Second, the interests of the firms' new ownership have an impact on firm strategy after privatization. Finally, compensation system design clearly aligns with firm strategy after privatization. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on a multiple case study approach, which limits the scope and generalizability of the findings. Originality/value - Whereas research in privatization generally adopts a macroeconomic or political perspective, organizational and managerial implications are current aspects in need of further examination. This research offers a study that integrates three sets of variables (corporate governance, strategy and compensation) that have been rarely analyzed in this context.

The aim of this chapter is to project the agency theory about triple helix; being more specific, corporate governance mechanism about the entity's organizational structure that emerge as intermediaries partnerships within the triple helix (structured as a spin-off, business incubator, business accelerator, science park, among others), having as a base the agency theory. In this context it is proposed a governance framework starting with two drivers that make part of is known as governance throughput: the macro-structure of power and the organization's management macro-processes. In this framework has built an array of classification of governance environment, based on information about the implementation of normative governance mechanisms and supervision generating quadrants with favorable and unfavorable levels of each dimension of governance drives. The proposed framework does not predict optimal decisions about key issues in governance (accountability, disclosure, compliance and fairness), but lists mechanisms to secure theoretical foundation that can mitigate the agency problems, hoping thereby to contribute to better understand the governance environment in partnerships within the triple helix.

Traditional agency theory (principal-agent conflict) has been a widely-accepted theoretical perspective for understanding corporate governance practices in developed economies. Institutions in these economies are characterized by effective contract enforcement, disperse ownership, separation of ownership, and control and protection of minority shareholders' rights. However, the principal-agent relationship, alone, may not be appropriate for analyzing corporate governance in emerging-economy institutional contexts, in which these institutional characteristics are often absent, weak, or poorly implemented. Scholars characterize corporate governance in emerging economies as having a conflict of interest between controlling and minority shareholders, known as the ''principal-principal agency model''. This relatively new sub-field has attracted the attention of scholars across disciplines including finance, economics, and strategy. The present chapter attempts to synthesize and review conceptual and empirical developments regarding principal-principal conflicts, and suggests possible directions for future studies.

Investment funds are potentially plagued by principal-agent problems between investors and fund management companies, in particular with respect to fees. Market forces play a role in mitigating these problems, but based on existing empirical studies, there can be doubts about whether these forces are sufficient for protecting investor interests. When market forces fail, there is room for fund boards to add value for investors. U.S. funds have mandatory independent directors who are empowered to be the watchdogs for the fund investors, negotiating fees with the fund management company on their behalf. This is not the case for Luxembourg funds that are established in accordance with the EU Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive. This study uses a sample of Luxembourg UCITS funds and shows that, although there is no regulatory requirement, approximately half of the sample funds have appointed at least one independent board member. A survey among board members of the sample funds showed that, in the absence of the requirement to negotiate fees with the fund management company, Luxembourg boards give relatively low priority to costs, which they see as primarily the responsibility of the promoter, leaving the monitoring to market forces. This finding is irrespective of whether or not the board has (semi-) independent board members. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This paper discusses the cause of the conflict between principal and agent, looking for answers in the disciplines of biology, particularly in the science of criminal anthropology. A setting has been made between the findings of the agency theory and white-collar crime theories, reinterpreting the actions of the agent from their configuration between instinct, heritage and personality. The results in the biological sciences could provide new interpretations and explanations in administration science, moving towards better interpretations of the conflict through more empirical content theories. Overall, despite the ongoing conflict between the parties, their dynamic boosts the results sought by the principal. (c) 2016 Universidad ICESI. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

This chapter describes a theoretical framework that can be used to understand the impact of board gender diversity on board effectiveness and firm performance. It highlights four key theories: agency theory, resource dependency theory, gender role theory and upper echelons theory. The chapter reviews the arguments in the corporate governance literature for greater female boardroom representation. It deals with the ethical case and it considers the business case. The former is concerned with the principle that there should be no discrimination in the workplace, while the latter focuses on the benefits that women bring to the boardroom by drawing from a broader talent pool of directors. The chapter reviews the possible costs associated with an increase in the gender balance of boards. It concludes with an evaluation of the evidence, both positive and negative, concerning the effectiveness of greater female boardroom participation in improving business performance.

Historical accounting research provides evidence, within the framework of agency theory, of the conflict of interests produced in the organisation. By means of a longitudinal study based on primary sources, the present study aims to examine how agency relationship is regulated by means of formal contracts, as well as to explore the function performed by accounting within that relationship. The case study on which our research is based, and which might constitute an important contribution to the field, examines the leasing of the State tobacco monopoly to a private corporation, from the beginning of this process (1887) until this monopolistic activity starts to decrease (1986). The findings underline that the specific contracts established lead to a significant control of the principal over the agent, and that not all conditions required in order to consider them as "good contractual agreements" are met. On the other hand, accounting appears as a key factor in State control of the lessee corporations. The main conclusion of the study is that the agent takes more risks in the leasing, and that the principal maintains an opportunistic behaviour throughout the whole process, which questions the most widespread assumptions on the theory, and suggests the possibility of softening of the initial assumptions.

During the second half of the nineteenth century, a growing interest in joint-stock corporations emerged. At the same time, managerial opportunism was observed in many of these corporations. Inefficient capital markets and inadequate transparency of operations as well as their results were characteristics of the time. Little was known about the means to reduce this opportunism. This knowledge grew over time out of pragmatic ideas, which foreshadow elements of present day agency theory. The important question to be answered by these pragmatic ideas was how managers could be influenced to act according to the goals of the owners of these corporations. In this paper, we draw on mostly academic literature of the nineteenth century to illustrate the developments of such pragmatic ideas. The presentation is structured by major mechanisms of agency theory. It is shown that attempts at reducing asymmetry of information by limiting corporate activities to less risky business, belief in high moral standards of managers or governmental supervision of operational activities were basically unsuccessful ideas. However, the empowerment of shareholders by introducing a supervisory board and the offering of monetary incentives showed more promise. Obviously, these ideas were not perfect. The pros and cons of any of these instruments became more visible over time, which led to better legal structures for establishing supervisory boards. With respect to monetary incentives, the contemporary debates seem to have been quite enlightened as compared with recent discussions. (c) 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The high level of completion along with deceitful financial reporting has recently pointed the increasing consideration of researchers and academicians on the internal controls and internal audit functions (IAF). IAF in banks has several principles that are essential to be adhered. The bank's management bears the final responsibility to apply these principles properly and effectively to avoid such corporate scandals that would shake the confidence of investors and make it hard for organizations to enhance equity within the stock market. Thereby, they would need to understand the internal factors which influence their profitability performance. The main purpose of this paper is to develop the relationship between new standards of IAF issued by Basel Committee (2012) and banks' performance. In addition, it presents a theoretical research framework to understand this relationship supported by literature review from recent studies. The literature review indicates that practicing IAF creates discipline and enhances effectiveness of control and governance practices which are necessary to promote performance in the banks. Due to limitations of literature in bank sector, future studies are suggested to broaden the research empirically and highlight more on the effective IAF that can lead to better banks' performance.

Manuscript type: Empirical Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically determine whether the one-rule-fits-all approached adopted by the Nigerian Securities Exchange Commission in terms of the separation of board chairman form the CEO promotes firm performance irrespective of the firms' ownership structures, in Nigerian with strong dominance of family owned firms. Design/methodology/approach: The study is restricted to firms quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Pooled data for 18-years period 1994-2011 were collated from published annual reports and statement of accounts of 91 ownership dispersed firms and 72 ownership concentrated firms. Two equation system Ordinary Least Square multiple regressions were used to estimate the relationship between firm financial performance and CEO duality along ownership structures in Nigeria. Findings: The findings of the study showed that while board duality was negative in predicting the financial performance of ownership dispersed firms; same cannot be said of ownership concentrated firms (family owned firms) as duality was found to be positive in predicting financial performance. Research Limitations/Implications: Paucity of substantial local literature on institutional perspective of agency constitutes the major limitation of this study. Although, this study is meant to close this gap, the implication is that foreign theoretical and empirical literature standpoint constitutes the bulk of the review, which may not explain reasons for any identifiable local trends in Nigeria. Practical Implication: The study reveals the importance of taking into cognizance, institutional perspective of agency theory in solving the excess power assigned to the board of directors, especially for family owned firms, where the family members have strong incentive to monitor the managers. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the institutional perspective of agency theory from Nigerian institutional perspective. The study revealed the importance of accommodating individual country specificities in draft corporate governance laws. (c) 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

Purpose - The purpose of this chapter is to analyse how in recent years the rediscovery that extreme inequality is returning to advanced economies and has become widespread. What is at issue are the causes of this inequality. It is becoming clear that the wider population, particularly in Anglo-American economies have not shared in the growing wealth of the countries concerned, and that the majority of this wealth is being transferred on a continuous and systemic basis to the very rich. Corporate governance and the pursuit of shareholder value it is argued has become a major driver of inequality. Methodology/approach - The current statistical evidence produced by leading authorities including the US Federal Reserve, World Economic Forum, Credit Suisse and Oxfam are examined. The policy of shareholder value and the mechanisms by which the distributions from business take place are investigated from a critical perspective. Findings - While the Anglo-American economies are seeing a return to the extremes of inequality last witnessed in the 19th century, the causes of this inequality are changing. In the 19th century great fortunes often were inherited, or derived by entrepreneurs from the ownership and control of productive assets. By the late 20th century as Atkinson, Piketty and Saez (2011) and others have highlighted, the sustained and rapid inflation in top income shares have made a significant contribution to the accelerating rate of income and wealth inequality. Research implications - The intensification of inequality in advanced industrial economies, despite the consistent work of Atkinson and others, was largely neglected until the recent research of Picketty which has attracted international attention. It is now acknowledged widely that inequality is a serious issue; however, the contemporary causes of inequality remain largely unexplored. Practical/social implications - The significance of inequality, now that it is recognized, demands policy and practical interventions. However, the capacity or even willingness to intervene is lacking. Further analysis of the debilitating consequences of inequality in terms of the efficiency and stability of economies and societies may encourage a more robust approach, yet the resolve to end extreme inequality is not present. Originality/value - The analysis of inequality has not been neglected and this chapter represents a pioneering effort to relate the shareholder value orientation now dominant in corporate governance to the intensification of inequality.

This study analyzes the relationships between the farmer and processing industry in broilers production. Original contracts of Brazilian processing industry were examined, hence, a primary source of research. Through the Principal-Agent Model, as a theoretical approach Principal-Agent, it aims identify the existing mechanisms of incentives in the legal contract, considering asymmetric information in the agency relationship system. It was also represented analytically whereas industry proposes a contract anticipating the behavior of farmers aimed at maximizing the efficiency ratio. It is concluded that the restrictions legal participation as well as the compatibility restrictions of incentives converge to achieve the index of efficiency that, in turn, depends on the level of effort of the agent, low or high. Analyses and conclusions allow understand the structure of contracts governing farmer and the broiler processing industry in view of Principal-Agent theory.

This paper investigates the influence of the board's profile on the economic performance and value of companies publicly traded in Brazil. To assess such relationships, eight independent variables were used in the board's profile and three control variables in a sample of 180 companies listed on the BM & FBovespa. It was found that the age of the chairman of the board relates positively to the performance. The variables independence and board size are negatively related to the performance of the surveyed companies. There were no statistically significant results between independent variables and companies' value measured by Tobin's Q.

In the last decade, the interest for the study of ownership structure as a determinant of diversification arises. However, there is a lack of researches that analyze the influence of the nature of the ultimate owner in the level and type of diversification. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to analyze the diversification strategies used by the main Spanish business groups whose parent company is listed on the stock markets, and to study the differences between family and non-family business groups, considering in these last, the type of ultimate owner. In the study a sample of ninety-nine listed companies is used, where companies that constitute the business group are identified. In the paper are used as econometric methodologies the binomial logistic models and panel data models. The results show that family nature of business group positively influences in specialization and related diversification and negatively on unrelated diversification. Family groups differ most form those non-family groups where there is not a reference shareholder than can exercise effective control and ownership dispersion is higher, the groups referred as "non effective control". The research allows further analysis of differences between family and non-family groups, considering the nature of the ultimate owner for non-family groups.

We show that firms with younger CEOs are more likely to experience stock price crashes, including crashes caused by revelation of negative news in the form of breaks in strings of consecutive earnings increases. Such strings are accompanied by large increases in CEO compensation that do not dissipate with crashes. These findings suggest that CEOs have financial incentives to hoard bad news earlier in their career, which increases future crashes. This negative impact of CEO age effect is strongest in the presence of managerial discretion. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of CEO age for firm policies and outcomes.

Research summary: Agency theory suggests that external governance mechanisms (e.g., activist owners, the market for corporate control, securities analysts) can deter managers from acting opportunistically. Using cognitive evaluation theory, we argue that powerful expectations imposed by external governance can impinge on top managers' feelings of autonomy and crowd out their intrinsic motivation, potentially leading to financial fraud. Our findings indicate that external pressure from activist owners, the market for corporate control, and securities analysts increases managers' likelihood of financial fraud. Our study considers external governance from a top manager's perspective and questions one of agency theory's foundational tenets: that external pressure imposed on managers reduces the potential for moral hazard. Managerial summary: Many of us are familiar with stories about top managers "cooking the books" in one way or another. As a result, companies and regulatory bodies often implement strict controls to try to prevent financial fraud. However, cognitive evaluation theory describes how those external controls could actually have the opposite of their intended effect because they rob managers of their intrinsic motivation for behaving appropriately. We find this to be the case. When top managers face more stringent external control mechanisms, in the form of activist shareholders, the threat of a takeover, or zealous securities analysts, they are actually more likely to engage in financial misbehavior.

This article intends to review the theoretical aspects and empirical evidences made on agency theory. It is aimed to explore the main ideas, perspectives, problems and issues related to the agency theory through a literature survey. It discusses the theoretical aspects of agency theory and the various concepts and issues related to it and documents empirical evidences on the mechanisms that diminish the agency cost. The conflict of interest and agency cost arises due to the separation of ownership from control, different risk preferences, information asymmetry and moral hazards. The literatures have cited many solutions like strong ownership control, managerial ownership, independent board members and different committees can be useful in controlling the agency conflict and its cost. This literature survey will enlighten the practitioners and researchers in understanding, analysing the agency problem and will be helpful in mitigating the agency problem.

Multinational corporations (MNCs) are facing increasing pressure on two fronts - the demand for more transparency and disclosure and the need to implement good corporate governance practices. This paper develops several testable hypotheses that address these issues based on agency theory and stakeholder management approach arguments. As such, the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs and firm-level governance structures are discussed. CSR is measured using Transparency International's study on the disclosure practices of the world's largest MNCs. Links between board size, board independence, and duality are explored. The results indicate that board independence and board size are strongly and positively related to several CSR practices. In addition, extractive industries have a significant and positive impact on the level of CSR activities. Policy and managerial implications related to these findings are also discussed.

This study investigates the impact of board gender diversity on dividend payments in the context of emerging economies. Using a dataset of listed firms from India, China and Russia over the period 2007-2014, we find strong and robust evidence indicating that board gender diversity is negatively related to cash dividend payments in all emerging economies. Moreover, we find that state-ownership positively moderates the relationship between gender diversity and dividend payments. However, this effect is observed only for China and Russia. In additional analyses, we find that the negative link between board gender diversity and dividend payments is more pronounced during the financial crisis. However, the moderating role of state-ownership does not remain significant during the financial crisis. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

This study investigates the impact of internal corporate governance on the relation between disclosure quality and earnings management in the UK listed companies, in particular whether governance mechanisms have deterrent effect on earnings management similar to firms' disclosure quality. Unlike prior literature, we measure a number of board and audit committee-related governance instruments, three disclosure quality proxies (i.e. Investor Relation Magazine Award, Forward-Looking Disclosure and Analyst Forecast Accuracy) and the Modified Jones Model to test the hypotheses of the study on a matched-pair sample data of Investor Relation Magazine Award winning and non-winning firms. Our findings in the OLS and sensitivity analyses using Heckman Procedure and 2SLS regressions consistently report a significant negative association between earnings management and disclosure quality for all proxies in restraining earnings management. In contrast, corporate governance variables are mostly insignificantly related to earnings management. This provides an emerging trend of the outperformance of disclosure quality over internal governance mechanisms in lessening earnings management. These findings warrant due attention of the policy makers, investors, corporate firms and other stakeholders in shaping a high-quality disclosure and governance regime in corporate settings to mitigate managerial manipulations of earnings across the countries in the world.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG, 2007 and 2012) on the performance of the listed companies in Malaysia. The agency theory and resource dependency theories indicate that the firms with strong corporate governance outperform firms with weaker governance. This paper explores this relationship in a developing country like Malaysia having different institutional environment compared to western countries. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a sample of 113 listed companies in Malaysia. The study incorporates the endogenous relationship between corporate governance, firm performance and leverage. Findings: The study analyzes how the corporate governance framework affected firm performance in Malaysia with the help of self-developed corporate governance index (MCGI). The authors' findings show that the performance of the firm is positively and significantly related with corporate governance measured by MCGI. Secondly, corporate governance of sample firms shows marked improvements after implementation of MCCG 2012 as compared to MCCG 2007. Originality/value: The findings of this paper support the agency and the resource dependency theories. The study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the corporate governance and firm performance in emerging economy and builds a case for enforcement of strong corporate governance code by government agencies.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine the impact of Shari'ah supervisory boards (SSBs) on the performance of Islamic banks (IBs). It also tests whether SSBs' attributes affect the performance of IBs. Based on a sample of 1, 803 Islamic bank-year observations from 82 banks in 15 countries over the period 1993-2014 and controlling for factors known to affect bank performance, this study reveals a robust and significant positive relationship between SSBs and Islamic bank performance. This study also shows that the characteristics of SSBs affect the performance of IBs. This research reveals how SSBs influence the performance of IBs, as well as the processes and roles SSBs use to ensure Shari'ah compliance in business transactions. Design/methodology/approach - The purpose of this study design is to relate SSB presence, size and diversity to financial performance using three techniques. The first technique is a multivariate data analysis that analyzes data arising from more than one variable. The second technique is a clustered regression (clustering by bank), which corrects for serial correlation and produces unbiased t-statistics. Because this sample is drawn from panel data, it is expected serial autocorrelation of the independent variables and error term within banks. In cases where within-company correlation exists, t-statistics based on average regression coefficients from year-by-year regression are upwardly biased and potentially severe (Peterson, 2009). Therefore, this study uses a technique that agrees with Stock and Watson (2002), who show that the standard method of calculating heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors for the fixed-effects estimator generates inconsistent variance estimates. Thus, using the clustered regression is consistent with the fixed-effects estimator. The third technique is a two-stage least-squares regression that helps build an instrumental variable for robustness tests purposes. Findings - The findings suggest that large corporate boards and large SSBs are more efficient in dealing with different monitoring and advisory roles than small SSBs. Consequently, this suggests that increasing the size of corporate boards and SSBs should improve monitoring and advisory functions, management behavior and organizational performance. Research limitations/implications - It is possible that there is an upper limit to this benefit, however; we do not explore this limit, which therefore provides opportunities for additional research. Because Shari'ah compliance relates only to a rational legal framework of negative screening relegated to interest prohibition and limiting uncertainty. The interest prohibition and limiting uncertainty have not been investigated between the two samples due to data unavailability. In addition, limited accounting-based measures of financial performance may not accurately portray IB performance; hence, an additional market measure is implemented, which is Tobin's Q. Practical implications - Ultimately, these findings could help IBs improve their financial results by enhancing their internal and external governance mechanisms (Walsh and Seward, 1990). They provide a basis for developing larger, more diverse SSBs that are more focused on complying with Shari'ah and corporate governance. The results also have significant policy implications for improving firm-level corporate governance versus improving country-level institutional factors. Both views have their advocates. However, it is very difficult to reform the legal system in a short time. Still, this study shows that struggling IBs have a way to improve their corporate governance and simultaneously improve their financing environment. Originality/value - This research contributes to the literature on the effects of SSBs on IBs' organizational financial performance, processes and roles. It is the first to examine empirically the underpinnings of how SSBs affect organizational financial performance via agency theory and contingency theory. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

The recent financial crisis has brought to the forefront the need for companies to effectively manage their risks. In this regard, one approach that has gained prominence is enterprise risk management (ERM). Importantly, little is known about the link between ERM and the financial reporting process. This link is critical, because it is imperative that financial reporting adequately depicts the financial status (e.g., valuations, estimates) and associated risks of a company as revealed by ERM. Additionally, from an auditing perspective, ERM affects the risks of misstatement, which should impact audit planning. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to examine the experiences of audit partners, CFOs, and audit committee (AC) members ("the governance triad") on the link between ERM and the financial reporting process. To determine whether members of the governance triad focus on monitoring, strategy, or both, we also examine their definition of and experiences with ERM with respect to agency and/or resource dependence theory. To address these issues, we conduct semistructured interviews of experienced individuals that form the governance triads from 11 public companies. There are three major findings from our study. First, importantly, all three types of participants see a strong link between ERM and the financial reporting process. Second, despite recognition of the broad nature of ERM, the predominant experiences of the actual roles played by triad members center on agency theory, while resource dependence may be relatively underemphasized by all triad members. Finally, CFOs and AC members indicate that auditors may be especially underutilizing ERM in the audit process, suggesting an "expectations gap.". (c) CAAA

This study examines how financial reporting quality affects corporate dividend policy. We find that higher quality reporting is associated with higher dividends. This positive association is more pronounced among firms with more severe free cash flow problems and among firms with higher ownership by monitoring-type institutional investors. Further analysis of the relation between reporting quality and under-/over-payment of dividends suggests that reporting quality largely mitigates underpayment of dividends. Additionally, both a granger causality test and a difference-in-difference analysis of dividend changes around a quasi-exogenous reporting event yield evidence consistent with the direction of causality going from financial reporting to dividends. Overall, these findings are consistent with financial reporting quality acting as a governance mechanism that induces managers to pay dividends by disciplining free cash flow problems. Our findings support the view that dividends are the result of enhanced monitoring (Jensen 1986; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny 2000).

Research summary: Corporate scandals of the previous decade have heightened attention on board independence. Indeed, boards at many large firms are now so independent that the CEO is "home alone" as the lone inside member. We build upon "pro-insider" research within agency theory to explain how the growing trend toward lone-insider boards affects key outcomes and how external governance forces constrain their impact. We find evidence among S&P 1500 firms that having a lone-insider board is associated with (a) excess CEO pay and a larger CEO-top management team pay gap, (b) increased likelihood of financial misconduct, and (c) decreased firm performance, but that stock analysts and institutional investors reduce these negative effects. The findings raise important questions about the efficacy of leaving the CEO "home alone.". Managerial summary: Following concerns that insider-dominated boards failed to protect shareholders, there has been a push for greater board independence. This push has been so successful that the CEO is now the only insider on the boards of more than half of S&P 1500 firms. We examine whether lone-insider boards do in fact offer strong governance or whether they enable CEOs to benefit personally. We find that lone-insider boards pay CEOs excessively, pay CEOs a disproportionately large amount relative to other top managers, have more instances of financial misconduct, and have lower performance than boards with more than one insider. Thus, it appears that lone-insider boards do not function as intended and firms should reconsider whether the push towards lone-insider boards is actually in shareholders' best interests.

This paper examines the relationship between board structure and corporate risk taking in the UK financial sector. We show how the board size, board independence and combining the role of CEO and chairperson in boards may affect corporate risk taking in financial firms. Our sample is based on a panel dataset of all publicly listed firms in the UK financial sector, which includes banks, insurance, real estate and financial services companies over a ten year period (2003 - 2012). After controlling for the effects of endogeneity through the application of the dynamic panel generalized method of moments estimator, the findings of this study suggest that the presence of non-executive directors and powerful CEOs in corporate boards reduces corporate risk taking practices in financial firms. The negative relationship can be explained within the agency theory context, where managers are regarded as more risk averse because of the reputational and employment risk. An increased power concentration is therefore expected to enhance the risk aversion behaviour of directors. The findings however, do not show any significant effect of board size on corporate risk taking in financial firms. As this study covers recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code on the role of corporate boards in managing firms' risk, the empirical evidence could be useful for corporate governance regulation and policy making.

A growing number of recent studies highlight an avenue of entrepreneurship in family business. Previous studies have examined the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and firm performance, and generate inconsistent results probably due to the omission of the moderating role of family governance. To explicitly address this gap, this study investigates how entrepreneurial orientation (EO) influences firm performance in the contingencies of family and nonfamily firms by considering the influence of family governance. Built on agency theory and stewardship theory, the empirical findings of this study show that EO is positively associated with the concurrent and sustaining performance of firms, and such positive relationships are particularly strong when family ownership is combined with active family management and control; while in passive family governance, the EO-performance relationship becomes insignificant. These findings suggest that the potential advantages of EO can be better realized in family firms because active family governance alleviates agency problems and facilitates stewardship within firms when family CEOs, family top management, family chairpersons, and family directors are in presence.

The relationship between HRM and well-being has received a significant amount of research attention; however, results are still contested. Our study addresses this phenomenon in the Higher Education sector. We specifically investigate the association between performance management and the perceived well-being of academic staff. Our research finds that the application of a directive performance management approach, underpinned by agency theory ideas as evidenced by a high reliance on performance measures and targets, is negatively related to academics' well-being (i.e. the more it is used, the worse people feel). In contrast, an enabling performance management approach, based on the learnings of stewardship theory, emphasising staff involvement, communication and development, is positively related to academics' well-being. We also find the positive relationship between enabling practices and well-being is mediated by how academics experience their work (i.e. their perceptions of job demands, job control and management support). These results indicate that current trends to intensify the use of directive performance management can have consequences on the energy and health of academics, which may influence their motivation and willingness to stay in the profession. This research suggests that an enabling approach to managing performance in this context, may have more positive effects. (c) 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This paper studies how governance drives entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in small firms. We argue that founder status and ownership create powerful personal incentives for small firm CEOs to engage in behaviors that influence EO. Integrating stewardship theory and the principal-principal branch of agency theory, we test our hypotheses on a sample of 339 Swedish firms, and find that CEO founder status is significantly and positively associated with EO, while CEO stock ownership significantly but negatively predicts EO. We additionally test two boundary conditions that show that the founder-CEO's prior managerial experience in start-up firms positively moderates the founder-EO relationship, while contrary to expectations, CEO ownership diversification has no effect on the negative association between ownership and EO. Thus, our study adopts a corporate governance perspective to explain how variations in EO across small firms are driven by the goals and motivations of its leader. Our research also shows that in small, private firms the balance of power is tipped in favor of the CEO rather than the board of directors. Finally, we underline the importance of adopting alternative theoretical lens like stewardship and principal-principal agency, given that traditional principal-agent problems are largely mitigated in the small firm context.

This article examines whether agency or stewardship is the more effective form of managerial governance within family firms. Synthesizing arguments regarding the differential tendencies of nonfamily versus family managers and the bifurcated manner in which they are likely to be governed, we propose asymmetric responses to agency versus stewardship mechanisms. Our empirical results provide evidence challenging common assumptions regarding the behavior exhibited by nonfamily versus family managers and the mechanisms by which each is governed. Although our findings also provide evidence of response asymmetry, they nevertheless point to the greater effectiveness of stewardship over agency governance irrespective of a manager's family affiliation.

Research summary: Shareholder activism has become more widespread, yet the role of corporate governance as antecedent to shareholder activism remains equivocal. We propose a new conceptual model that characterizes the stochastic of observable shareholder activism as a compound product of two latent components representing (1) shareholder activists' propensity to target a company and (2) executives' propensity to settle activists' demands privately. Our model explicitly decouples corporate governance expectations for the two latent components embedded in activism process, and thus allows us to relax assumptions of homogenous shareholder interests and constrained managerial discretion where corporate managers are expected to negotiate privately and settle only value-creating activist demands. Bayesian analysis of zero-inflated Poisson regression reveals that corporate governance relationships with activism vary across shareholder demands and private settlements. Managerial summary: Increasing shareholder activism has generated debates as to whether activism promotes managerial accountability and responsibility or instead encourages managerial short-termism. Our research model allows for heterogeneous interests among a company's shareholders. We theorize and empirically investigate a broader role of corporate governance: governance mechanisms need to ensure that executives are not (1) ignoring activists' value-increasing demands or (2) accommodating activists' value-decreasing demands in a private, opaque manner that disenfranchises other shareholders. Our results indicate that corporate governance implications differ for visible shareholder demands in contrast with private activism. A plausible application of our model is that it provides estimates of the probability of the numbers of shareholder demands to be received by a firm and the probability of privately settling a demand.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

This study aims to examine the influence of board independence on corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting by publicly listed companies in Malaysia. Content analysis was used to determine the extent of CSR reporting. A reporting index consisting of 51 items was developed based on six themes: General, Community, Environment, Human Resources, Marketplace and Other. An Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression was used to examine the relationship between board independence and firm CSR reporting. The results indicate that the association between board independence and company CSR reporting is industry specific. Overall, the empirical evidence partially supports agency theory.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the links between company ownership structure and financial performance in the context of the largest Central European stock market. Using the framework of agency theory, the authors address the question of the expropriation effect by dominant owners and the effect of collusion between shareholders of different types on company performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test hypotheses on the relations between ownership concentration and the involvement of different shareholders (state, CEO, industry and financial investors) vs return on assets (ROA). The authors adopt the panel model controlling for endogeneity and sector of operation and analyze the data from the unique sample of 495 Polish non-financial firms listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in years 2005-2014 with a total of 3,203 observations. Findings: The authors identify a negative correlation between ownership concentration by the majority shareholder and ROA, which corresponds with the expropriation rationale of blockholders. The authors also observe negative effects due to ownership concentration by the second largest shareholder, supporting the notion of collusion. The results show that ownership by industry investors is associated with a higher ROA. Ownership by the CEO, state and financial investors proves to have no statistically significant effect on performance. Originality/value: The paper further develops the nature of ownership-performance relations in the specific economic context of a post-transition, emerging European stock market, weak external corporate governance mechanisms, insufficient investor protection and significant concentration of share ownership. The results add to the understanding of monitoring vs expropriation effects by large owners and the collusion between different types of shareholders. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This research examines the relationship between independent directors, the audit committee (AC), and firm performance, taking into account the impact of the chief executive officer's powers and block shareholders. We use the maximum likelihood estimator, based on agency theory assumptions and cylindered panel data, to examine three models of firm performance. The results show that the independence of the board is reflected clearly by increased economic and equity performance of the firm. However, an AC that is fully independent or meets frequently is associated with lower firm performance. Unlike pension funds, institutional shareholders can be considered an effective control mechanism in the context of France. Our results development includes advanced explanations for market liquidity and shareholders' portfolios. The study period ends before the European regulation on ACs came into effect in 2008. This allows for an appreciation of soft law in French corporate governance. It also lets us compare the data with the way firms operate their boards one decade later. The evidence provides useful guidelines on the supremacy of soft law in corporate governance and suggests that the composition and functioning of the board of directors should be moderated based on the firms' context. The specificity of the cylindered panel data helps to better examine the impact of the board and AC's independence and functioning in French corporate governance structure.

This article theoretically and empirically intertwines agency and stewardship theories to examine their distinct and combined influences on family firms. Primary matched triadic data from CEOs, family employees, and nonfamily employees in 77 family firms suggest that agency and stewardship governance affects individual-level behavior and firm-level performance. Specifically, agent behavior is highest under conditions of coexisting low agency governance and high stewardship governance and is lowest when agency and stewardship governance coexist at high levels. Furthermore, when high levels of agency and stewardship governance coexist, family firm performance is the highest. Theoretical implications and future research directions are discussed.

Taking a combination between agency theory and resource dependence theory, we point out that directors' capital may have an effect on R&D strategies. A sample of both high-tech and low-tech industries for the period 2007-2011 is used. The results indicate that, regardless of the type of industry and the specific expertise on R&D intensive companies, board members with multiple directorships influence R&D corporate strategies. The resources acquired by directors through their experience and connections positively influence R&D intensity, but only if directors can carry out their monitoring activity adequately. This evidence implies a step forward in the understanding of the role of board of directors in corporate strategy, thus having significant implications for academics, companies and regulators, which are both theoretical and practical.

Emerging evidence suggests that pay dispersion among non-CEO top management team (TMT) members harms firm performance, which raises questions about why firms' owners tolerate or even support it. Prior research shows that the key distinction between founder and family owners is that in addition to firm performance and growth goals, family owners pursue socioemotional goals. On the basis of this distinction, we develop and test theory linking founders' and families' ownership to TMT pay dispersion. Consistent with our theory, a Bayesian panel analysis of Standard & Poor's 500 firms shows that founder owners use less TMT pay dispersion and that family owners, relative to founder owners, use more, although that declines across generations. We also provide evidence that TMT pay dispersion harms firm performance. Our theory and results are significant because they help to explain why some owners favor compensation practices that cause TMT pay dispersion, despite evidence that this harms firm performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to adopt an agency theory approach to investigate the integration of environmental issues into management control systems (MCS). Prior environmental accounting research has focussed on increasing organisations' environmental accountability by "monitoring" through external reporting to stakeholders. However, this overlooks the alignment of agents' interests within the firm. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study is undertaken in a large Australian listed property trust to investigate how agents' interests may be integrated with environmental objectives through the use of MCS. Findings: From the case an analytical framework is developed to illustrate how environmental issues are incorporated into organisational behaviour through MCS. The findings include, single objective environmental MCS; multiple objective MCS, which include priorities that specify environmental and economic trade-offs; and balancing MCS, which provide overarching decision-making principles without priorities. Practical implications: The findings provide examples of how an organisation may integrate environmental issues across a range of MCS and the things to consider in doing so. Originality/value: This paper draws on an agency perspective as an approach to incorporate environmental issues into MCS and to align behaviour. It explains a new way in which tensions can be managed. This study is one of the first to adopt the control package approach in investigating the incorporation of environmental issues in MCS.

More and more boards are tapping interim CEOs to temporarily fill the corner office. Prior research indicates the negative performance implications of this decision; yet, little is known about the rationale behind this decision. Our aim is to fill this research gap. Drawing on agency and human capabilities frameworks, we examined the contextual elements that influence a board's decision to pursue temporary leadership. Within a sample of 375 successions occurring between 1998 and 2005, we found that boards of directors were more likely to select interim CEOs under certain succession conditions, namely, when the prior CEO was forced out and there was no heir apparent or when the prior CEO had served for a short tenure. Our results highlight the importance of context in succession selections and provide insights into why a board would pursue a decision with seemingly negative repercussions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate that notwithstanding the fact that stewardship theory embraces things like trust of directors, their professionalism, loyalty and willingness to be concerned for the interests of others, as well as rejecting the foundations of classic agency problems that are asserted by agency theory, board accountability is as relevant to stewardship theory as it is to agency theory. Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies the theory underlying board accountability in corporate governance, which is so often applied both in the corporate governance literature and in practice with agency theory in mind, to stewardship theory. Findings - While the idea of accountability of boards is generally associated with an explanation and conceptualisation of the role and behaviour of directors as agents within classic agency theory, the paper demonstrates that board accountability is a necessary part of board life even if the role of directors is explained and conceptualised in terms of stewardship theory. Practical implications - The paper suggests some accountability mechanisms that might be employed in a stewardship approach. Originality/value - While many authors have talked in general terms about board accountability and its importance, this is the first paper that has engaged in a substantial study that links board accountability directly with stewardship theory, and to establish that accountability is necessary.

This paper traces the career of Michael Jensen, a Chicago finance PhD turned Harvard Business School professor to reveal the intellectual and social conditions that enabled the emergence and institutionalization of what we call the "neoliberal common sense of capital," what others have called the "shareholder value" view of the American firm. Jensen's work was embraced by a generation of corporate raiders aggressively advancing new financial practices and discourses. His contribution, commonly understood as "agency theory," was intertwined with the transformations in corporate management and governance of the last decades of the twentieth century--from the junk bond market in the 1980s to the exponential growth of CEO pay in the 1990s to the shareholder value management strategies of the 2000s. While debates about the spread of neoliberal ideas and governance tools have largely centered on the transformations of the state and international institutions or the role of actively organized intellectual networks, this essay emphasizes the importance of identifying specific carriers of particular transformations within the space of American "business discourse".

Conventional agency theory typically focuses on a unidirectional problem, in which an agent behaves opportunistically against the interests of a principal. Yet, this conceptualization is too limited to fully describe all aspects of principal-agent relationships. This article presents a more comprehensive framework explaining a potential three-directional problem--that is, (i) agents behave opportunistically against the interests of principals, (ii) principals behave opportunistically against the interests of agents, and (iii) relationships between agents and principals representing confluence of interests affect the interests of third-party stakeholders. The article provides evidence of these problems, describes their unique characteristics, and outlines implications for society. It concludes with a discussion focusing on the implications of the proposed framework for purported governance solutions, the ongoing debate between shareholder and stakeholder views of the firm, and business practices.

This reflection focuses on what insights Catholic Social Teaching (CST) can provide for corporate governance. I argue that the 'standard' agency theory is overly reductionist and insufficiently incorporates important economic limitations (such as asymmetric information, incomplete contracts, and the need for coordination) as well as human frailty. As a result, such agency theory insufficiently distinguishes firms from markets, which can easily relativize how we treat others and facilitate rationalization of unethical behavior. I then explore how three pillars of CST--human dignity, solidarity, and subsidiarity--can help overcome these limitations. CST proposes a vision of the business corporation as a community of persons, working together in cooperative business relationships toward the shared purpose of contributing to human flourishing.

In this study we introduce a justice perspective to examining the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards over the allocation of firm residuals that ultimately determines CEO compensation. Framing CEO pay as the result of bargaining between CEOs and boards focuses attention on the power of CEOs to increase their share of firm residuals in the form of increased compensation, and the diligence of boards of directors to constrain CEO opportunism. Framing this negotiation through a theory of justice offers an alternative perspective to the search for pay-performance sensitivity. We predict and find that as board diligence in controlling opportunism declines and CEO power increases, CEOs are increasingly able to capture a larger portion of firm residuals relative to shareholders. This finding supports critics who charge that CEO pay violates norms of distributive and procedural justice. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

Purpose: Presently, one of the major governance issues faced by management and shareholders of organizations is the gender composition of the boards of directors and audit committees. This study aims to examine the impact of gender diversity in audit committees on the accuracy of management earnings forecasts disclosure in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample comprises 190 Malaysian companies issuing IPOs that transformed into public companies during the period 2002-2012. Earnings forecasts accuracy (quality) is proxied by absolute forecast error and the study model is developed based on the frameworks of the signalling theory, the agency theory and the resource-dependence theory. Findings: The study proposes that female directors introduce a set of specific features in the boardroom that serve to improve investor protection and efficient monitoring of management. However, findings reveal an insignificantly positive relationship between gender diversity in audit committees and absolute forecast error, which shows that more female directors in audit committees could translate into more errors and less accuracy in earnings forecasts. Practical implications: Considering the recent regulatory developments that encourage the number of women on the board of directors, the findings obtained have significant implications for policymakers. The study findings can also be invaluable to investors, investment analysts, market players and researchers. Originality/value: The composition of the board of directors and audit committees in terms of gender plays a significant role in the promotion of effective corporate governance practices. This study is one of the pioneering studies that examines the advantages of gender diversity in the board of directors. It is also the first study to extend IPO literature by investigating the role of gender diversity in audit committees in the enhancement of accurate management earnings forecasts included in the IPO prospectuses.

This paper investigates the relationship between decision making power of chief executive officers (CEOs) and corporate capital structure in the context of emerging market characterized by deep collectivism and less prescriptive regulatory and legislative environment. Using a sample of 297 firms listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange SMEs Board from 2009 to 2013, it finds a hump-shaped association between CEO power and leverage suggesting a strong nonlinearity between these two variables. Furthermore, the results show that the entrenchment effect of CEO power on firm leverage becomes more fiercely in state-owned firms. Our findings are robust to alternative calculation procedures for the CEO power index and to alternative estimation techniques. The shareholders and policy makers might leverage our findings to improve the performance of CEOs in the Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Performance appraisal interviews remain central to how employees are scrutinised, rewarded and sometimes penalised by managers. But they are also often castigated as ineffective, or even harmful, to both individuals and organisations. Exploring this paradox, we highlight the influence of agency theory on the (mal)practice of performance appraisal. The performative nature of human resource management increasingly reflects an economic approach within which its practices are aligned with agency theory. Such theory assumes that actors are motivated mainly or only by economic self-interest. Close surveillance is required to eliminate the risk of shirking and other deviant behaviours. It is a pessimistic mind-set about people that undermines the supportive, co-operative and developmental rhetoric with which appraisal interviews are usually accompanied. Consequently, managers often practice appraisal interviews while holding onto two contradictory mind-sets, a state of Orwellian Doublethink that damages individual learning and organisational performance. We encourage researchers to adopt a more radical critique of appraisal practices that foregrounds issues of power, control and conflicted interests between actors beyond the analyses offered to date.

We examine the effect of the form of ownership on the profit efficiency of bank holding companies (BHCs) before and during the US financial crisis. For the pre-crisis period, the difference in profit efficiency between privately held and publicly traded BHCs is small. For the crisis period there is no statistically significant difference. These unexpected results suggest that agency issues do not affect the relative profit efficiency of private and public BHCs, or more likely, that these are offset by pressures for efficiency from capital markets and managerial labor markets and the advantages of specialization, a very important consideration in commercial banking.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Family firms, as insider-controlled companies, should be less likely to exhibit CEO turnover after poor performance and may thus promote enhanced focus on long-term goals. However, when a non-family CEO is in charge, the relatively limited empirical evidence is contrasting. Some studies find that only family CEOs are immune from the threat of dismissal following poor financial performance, while other studies show that family firms discipline their CEOs for poor financial performance regardless of their family status. In this work, we try to reconcile these contrasting findings and investigate what ownership and governance conditions influence the owners' pressure on the CEO to achieve short-term financial results. Research findings/insights: Drawing on a longitudinal dataset that covers the entire population of Italian medium and large family companies, we find that when family ownership is concentrated in the hands of few family shareholders or there is a low number of family members involved in the board of directors, non-family CEOs are less likely to be dismissed after poor performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study, adopting the behavioral agency theory as the guiding framework, highlights the importance for governance decisions of the potential goal divergence among principals in closely held ownership structures. Our results also add to the still scant literature on the relationship between family owners and non-family CEOs. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research suggests that, in the decision to hire a non-family CEO, family business owners should not only assess their gaps in managerial skills but also carefully consider the ownership structure and family involvement conditions. On the side of professional non-family managers, our results offer insights on ways to address the employment relationship with the controlling family. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate whether family CEOs benefit investment efficiency under uncertainty with Chinese family firms and to test the moderating effect of ownership structure, including family ownership, the separation of family control from family ownership and the multiple large shareholder structure. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effects models are designed for a sample of 5,734 firm-year observations for Chinese family firms from 2009 to 2014. Findings: The results show that investment efficiency is low under uncertainty, and having family CEOs can reduce this negative relationship. Further analysis reveals that for firms with family CEOs, the negative effect of uncertainty on investment efficiency is weaker when the family has higher ownership, when family control is less separated from family ownership, or when family firms have multiple large shareholder structures. Research limitations/implications: The authors do not distinguish founder-CEOs and descendant-CEOs. Most of Chinese family firms are still managed by founders, so the authors cannot explore the generation effect although different generations manage firms differently. Because family succession is becoming a more and more important problem in China, further research may be able to explore the generation effect. Practical/implications: This paper suggests that in emerging economies with weak investor protection, outside minority shareholders can avoid expropriation from family owners by investing in firms with large family ownership, little separation of family control from ownership or multiple large shareholder structure. In addition, policymakers can encourage institutional investors to participate in family business to improve corporate governance. Originality/value: Drawing on both Type I and Type II agency theory perspectives, the authors argue that although family CEOs can generally benefit firms' investment efficiency, the benefits vary with firms' ownership structure. In other words, family CEOs are not absolute agents or stewards but some extent of combination of both. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

The purpose of this study is examine how agency theory and stewardship theory lead to different firm-level outcomes on an array of different outcomes. Based on these differences, we argue for the development of an agent-steward measurement scale, which will help researchers classify chief executive officers (CEOs) along an agent-steward continuum. This, in turn, will spur research to predict and test CEO behaviors and firm-level outcomes. Agency theory suggests CEOs take advantage of their powerful positions to maximize their personal economic utility, whereas stewardship theory suggests CEOs are motivated through intrinsic awards and will balance their interests with those of other stakeholders. We use these theories to examine possible differences in CEO behaviors. This is important because different CEO behaviors might lead to differing impacts on important firm-level outcomes. This paper reviews the relevant agency and stewardship literatures, then offers propositions regarding CEO behaviors from agent and steward perspectives.

This paper aims to provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between board leadership structures and executive compensation. According to agency theory, the combined position of CEO and Chairperson of the Board (COB) entails greater compensation for the CEO in order to reduce conflicts of interest. In the literature, combined board structure is generally considered to generate additional costs for companies. However, the choice of two separate structures implies the payment of incentive compensation for the COB in addition to that defined for the CEO. This paper investigates the financial cost of duality when compensation packages are set for both leaders. Our results suggest that although combined board structure is associated with higher incentive compensation for the CEO, the overall compensation cost to the company is no higher when the chairperson's compensation is considered.

We combine agency theory with the law and finance approach to analyze how the legal protection of investors and the corporate ownership structure affect corporate investment in research and development (R&D). We use information from 956 firms from the five most R&D-intensive industries in 19 developed countries. Our results show that better protection of investors' rights by the institutional environment has a positive influence on corporate R&D. We also find that corporate ownership concentration works as a substitute for legal protection. This finding means that R&D investment of the firms in the countries with poor legal protection increases as ownership becomes more concentrated. Our results also show that the identity of shareholders has a relevant effect: Whereas banks and nonfinancial institutions as shareholders result in lower R&D, institutional investors as shareholders increase corporate investment in R&D.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the presence, expertise, independence, size and meetings of the audit committee (AC) have an effect on corporate insolvency. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 insolvent and 269 solvent UK-listed non-financial firms from 1994 to 2011. Findings: The authors find that corporate insolvency is negatively related to thenieetings and independence of the AC but not to AC's presence and size. The authors also observe that financial expertise on the AC is not related to corporate insolvency. These associations are robust to different specifications, while after controlling for board composition, board size, the number of board meetings, CEO duality, financial and firm characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The study's approach has two main limitations: neglect of small and medium private unquoted firms and more regulated corporate governance environment. Practical implications - The findings lend support to the continual use of the agency theory as an explanation in understanding the role of the analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of the AC in reducing the likelihood of insolvency. Social implications: The findings support continued efforts to strengthen boards' ACs in the wake of high profile insolvencies. The findings will assist regulators and firm management to design appropriate ACs (e.g. independence) and processes (e.g. number of meetings). Originality/value: The authors provide empirical evidence on the impact of the AC on firm insolvency in the UK context, an important but neglected area in research.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the influences of corporate governance on intellectual capital disclosures in chief executive officers' (CEOs') statements in annual reports. Design/methodology/approach: Index score, word count and overall tone of CEOs' intellectual capital disclosures are calculated to represent the extent, amount and tone of these disclosures, respectively. With a sample of 78 FTSE 100 companies, this paper uses content analysis and empirical analysis to examine the impacts of board size, board composition and shares concentration on the above three measures of CEOs' intellectual capital disclosures, controlling for company size, profitability and leverage ratio. Findings: Empirical results demonstrate a significant positive relationship between board composition and the extent, amount and tone of CEOs' intellectual capital disclosures and a significant negative relationship between shares concentration and the amount of these disclosures. Originality/value: This paper focuses on the impacts of corporate governance on CEOs' intellectual capital disclosures. It also groundbreakingly measures the tone of CEOs' disclosures.

This study investigates dividend initiation as the product of the imbalance of power between shareholders and management in U.S. firms from 2003 to 2012. We find that dividend initiation is associated with a stronger governance structure (strong shareholders' rights and board independence), in accordance with the outcome model. We do not identify a single motivation for dividend initiation. Dividend-initiating firms tend to rely on various forms of governance balanced by the interests and ownership of CEOs and directors. Firms with institutional owners are more likely to initiate dividends concurrent with the turnover of the CEO. Dual CEOs initiate dividends when they own more shares, and boards of directors initiate dividends with a higher personal ownership stake when shareholders' rights are weak. We also find that when initiation is due to stronger governance, it is significantly related to the firm's investment opportunities, while for weak governance firms, that relationship is not observed. We interpret this as evidence that, under weaker governance, the decision to initiate dividends is motivated by agency conflicts rather than investment or capital structure considerations. (c) 2017

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of internal corporate governance mechanisms on the capital structure decisions of Chinese-listed firms. Design/methodology/approach - Using a large and more recent data set consisting of 2,386 Chineselisted firms over the period from 1998 to 2012, the authors use different statistical methods (OLS, fixed effects and system GMM) to analyse the effects of firm-specific and corporate governance influences on capital structure. Findings - The authors find that the proportion of independent directors and ownership concentration exert significant influence on the level of Chinese long-term debt ratios after controlling for firm-specific determinants and split share reforms. Further analysis separating the sample of this paper into state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privately owned enterprises (POEs) suggests that ownership concentration in the hands of the state leads to decrease in debt ratios. Research limitations/implications - The finding implies that concentrated ownership in the hands of the state appears more efficient compared to their private counterparts in their monitoring role. Originality/value - This paper extends prior literature, which has concentrated disproportionately on firm-specific influences on capital structure, to the effects of within-firm governance mechanisms on capital structure decisions. The paper contributes to the agency theory-capital structure discourse in an emerging country context where corporate governance system appears weak. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

It is a common belief that CEOs must delegate to be successful. We hesitate to support this generalization and investigate how the distribution of responsibility within top management teams (TMTs) can influence the likelihood of a CEO's dismissal. Consistent with an agency theory perspective, our results indicate that CEOs may choose not to delegate their responsibilities to other executive TMT members, so as to benefit from an increased information asymmetry vis-a-vis the board of directors. Taking the resource-based view as a complementary theoretical perspective, we find that non-delegating CEOs benefit from their greater firm-specific knowledge, which the board of directors considers as a valuable resource that should be retained. Our work also demonstrates that a more intense CEO-TMT interaction weakens the relation between non-delegation and the likelihood of CEO dismissal. In sum, our research shows that the CEO's delegation decision does not necessarily lead to a competence distribution that is in the firm's best interest; rather, it reflects a complex interplay between the potentially opportunistic career interests of the CEO, the involvement of other TMT members and the board of directors.

Purpose - The objective of this study is to understand the linkages among executive compensation, corporate governance and performance of the Indian family and non-family firms. Further, the study also analyzes the level of shareholding pattern of the Indian family firms on their performance and the executive compensation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have collected panel data of the companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The data set consists of 284 companies (both family and non-family) for the period 2005-2014. The authors have made use of a dynamic panel data model with generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation to formulate the hypotheses and used fixed-effects regression model to check the robustness of our findings. Findings - The authors find support for the agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory in the paper. Specifically, variables related to executive compensation, corporate governance (board size, proportion of independent directors on board, chief executive officers duality and other directorships held by the executive directors outside the company), firm performance (Tobin's Q), leverage and shareholding pattern of the family are significant in this study. Practical implications - The study has practical implications for all stakeholders of the family and non-family firms, especially in the emerging market economies. It can be used as a reference guide by various other stakeholders of the family firms, viz., customers, educators, tax authorities, government and society. Originality/value - The authors confirm that their research is original and provides valuable insights on the Indian family firms. The authors study cross-holding of directorships, inter alia, in the Indian family business groups. As most of the previous studies in the Indian context ignored this important aspect, this study is unique in nature. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the topic of agency problems in service ecosystem for innovation. It specifically explores the corporate policies aimed at encouraging collaboration, so as to prevent opportunistic behaviors within the innovation hub, where service exchange is central for innovation creation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply the agency theory framework to the hub as a service ecosystem in order to understand how it would be possible to address agency problems between the firm (principal) and the other actors of the hub (agents), involved in peer-to-peer interactions. The research explores the case study of a high-tech leading company, which is a pioneer in the use of the hub for supporting its innovation process. Data are collected through semi-structured interviews to some key informants of the Hub Program regarding structure and organization; participation; incentives and monitoring. Findings - In service ecosystems, corporate policies are based on commitment, psycho-social incentives and social control may encourage collaboration among the actors, thus contributing to align their own interests to the hub's innovation common goals. Research limitations/implications - Given the exploratory nature of the research, the paper is based on a single case study. Thus, it is not possible to either generalize the results or evaluate any statistical correlation. Practical implications - The paper provides a wider awareness about the benefits and risks related to service ecosystems for innovation, and advise both managers and practitioners about appropriate corporate policies to better address the agency problems. Originality/value - This study enhances the literature on service ecosystems, highlighting the importance of corporate policies in preventing opportunistic behavior of actors in order to ensure the value co-creation process. It also extends the agency theory application to informal and not-hierarchical contexts. Besides, it suggests practitioners a way to reconcile the different interests of the firm and the other hub's participants. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates the relation between director compensation structure and shareholder interests in the context of acquisitions. Our evidence suggests that acquirer firms that compensate their directors with a higher proportion of incentive-based compensation have significantly higher stock returns around the announcement. Compared to acquirers in the low equity-based compensation group, acquirers in the high equity-based compensation group outperform by 9.54% in a five-day period surrounding the announcement date. These results hold even after controlling for endogeneity issues. We further find that acquirers with higher equity-based pay exhibit greater improvements in stock price and operating performance in the three years following acquisitions. An increase in director equity-based pay also results in a lower acquisition premium for targets. These results indicate that equity-based compensation provides incentives for directors to make decisions that meet the interests of shareholders. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to investigate whether operating and market performance are aligned to CEO compensation and how board governance and dividend policy could influence pay-performance link in the capital market of Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: The hand-collected information on 219 non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan stock exchange (PSX) is acquired over the period 2012-2016. Additionally, panel data technique, namely Prais-Winsten (PCSE) and 2SLS (robust standard errors) regression are applied to account for the heteroscedasticity, serial correlation and endogeneity issue. Findings: The empirical results indicate that CEO compensation is positively associated with operating performance and market performance. The evidence also provides partial support to agency perspective that board independence and optimal board size could positively, while CEO duality negative moderates the relationship between operating performance and CEO compensation. However, none of these mechanisms are proved to be effective in aligning market performance to CEO compensation. In fact, dividend policy negatively moderates the association between firm performance (operating and market) and CEO compensation. Thus, contrary to the agency theory's proposition, dividend policy cannot be utilized as a substitute control device in the absence of strong corporate governance mechanisms. Practical Implications: In light of this empirical evidence, regulatory bodies in Pakistan could improve corporate governance mechanisms as well as CEO compensation structure to ensure remunerative and ethical financial market. Originality/value: This study contributes to the academic literature by validating the underexplored pay-performance alignment propositions of agency theorists, especially in the reference of Pakistan.

For a long period of time, researchers from the corporate governance field have been interested in finding out what drives companies' performance. The present study identifies five attributes of boards - size, age, female representation, proportion of non-executive directors, and chairman-CEO duality - in an attempt to link these to diversification strategy and financial performance. These relations are investigated using archival sources of data for a sample of 56 publicly traded companies from an emerging economy. The results are consistent with other studies performed abroad and at the same time offer new theoretical and managerial perspectives on the issues analyzed. The findings offer some valuable insights into the decision of corporate diversification at both theoretical and managerial level. The results provide support for both managerial hegemony and agency theory. Board members have little involvement in the strategy-making process as this is most often an attribute of managers, where as the existence of more members without executive responsabilities is a determinat of superior company performance.

The article tries to examine the relationship between equity ownership held by the foreign institutional investors and firm performance both in a static and a dynamic framework. We also examine how the relationship differs between group-affiliated and stand-alone firms. By employing the 2SLS panel data estimation technique on 137 BSE listed Indian firms, the study finds that foreign institutional investment has a positive influence on the firm performance as measured through Tobin's Q and ROA.Application of linear dynamic panel data estimation in a dynamic framework also yields similar results.The latter method also shows that FII has a positive significant effect on Tobin's Q in group-affiliated firms. The results are analysed from the perspective of a multi-theoretic approach consisting of agency theory, information asymmetry theory, institutional theory and resource dependency theory.

This paper examines how family firms substitute corporate governance with family governance and self-governance at different stages of their development. We argue that the types of agency problems that family firms face as they pass from one generation to the next determine the extent to which these mechanisms can be used as substitutes for one another. Our empirical investigation provides evidence that in the early stages of a family firm's life cycle, instruments of self-governance lessen the need for mechanisms of corporate governance, whereas in the later stages, instruments of family governance can substitute for mechanisms of corporate governance.

Some business ethicists view agency theory as a cautionary tale - a proof that it is impossible to carry out successful economic interactions in the absence of ethical behaviour. The cautionary-tale view presents a nuanced normative characterisation of agency, but its unilateral focus betrays a limited understanding of the structure of social interaction. This article moves beyond unilateralism by presenting a descriptive and normative argument for a bilateral cautionary-tale view. Specifically, we discuss hat swaps and role dualism in asymmetric-information principal-agent relationships and argue that the norm of reciprocity can function as a moral solution to agency risks in adverse-selection and moral-hazard problems. Our bilateral cautionary-tale formulation extends the normative boundaries of agency theory, while leaving the fundamental economic assumptions of agency theory intact.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: We examine determinants of cash holdings in Chinese subsidiaries of US multinational corporations (MNCs), a setting where growth opportunities make cash holdings desirable for investment opportunities but also vulnerable to potential expropriation because of poor investor protection. Research Findings/Insights: We show that headquarters accumulate larger cash holdings in foreign subsidiaries with locally registered patents and in foreign subsidiaries operating in the same industry as corporate headquarters. Further, foreign cash holdings are higher when these are safeguarded by a subsidiary board. Moreover, the effect of shared industry on subsidiary cash holdings is larger when a board is installed in the subsidiary. Finally, the positive relation between a subsidiary's capability to innovate and to transfer knowledge and its level of cash holdings is stronger when the subsidiary is led by US expatriate CEOs. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results indicate that MNCs accumulate cash in foreign subsidiaries with innovation and knowledge transfer capabilities. Furthermore, and in line with agency theory, we find that MNCs safeguard foreign cash via the installing of subsidiary boards and expatriate CEOs. These findings suggest that the installing of monitoring devices are crucial in reducing the potential expropriation risk of foreign cash holdings. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our study highlights the importance of considering foreign subsidiaries' positions in innovation and in knowledge transfer when MNCs make decisions on the levels of overseas cash holdings. It offers insights regarding the importance of subsidiary boards and expatriate CEOs in monitoring and controlling foreign subsidiaries. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine an association between board demographics and corporate performance using a sample of Pakistani firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange in the 2014 year. Design/methodology/approach: This study is unique in that corporate performance is examined using a mixture of performance measures: accounting-based measures (return on assets), market-based measures (Tobin's Q, earnings per share, and total return) and economic profit measures (economic value added). Findings: The results of this research show a significant positive relationship between board size, minority representation on the board and the appointment of a family director and enhanced firm performance. However, contrary to expectations, the authors also find that instead of adding value, the appointment of independent directors to Pakistani firm boards negatively impacts firm value. Originality/value: This study adds to a growing body of empirical evidence that suggests that agency theory-based corporate governance recommendations adopted in developed economies may not be relevant to emerging economy firms.

We aim to investigate the decision process leading to the adoption of corporate governance practice at a cooperative. This paper expands current knowledge by presenting the institutional logics approach as a complement to decision-making process studies. Literature on the decision process grounds the investigation, supported by corporate governance and agency theory. We draw on oral history for collecting and analyzing data from documents, observation and interviews related to the decision process. A total of 19 interviews were conducted with members and employees of the cooperative. We used the Atlas TI software to organize the data and then subjected them to content analysis, based on the historical analytical method. By demonstrating how logics are a basis for the adoption decision, the paper provides evidence of how hybridization operates as a mechanism for balancing actors' demands in response to contrasting institutional pressures or expectations. In addition, we provide recommendations to management with respect to corporate governance decisions. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) and Summer Olympic National Sporting Organisations (NSOs) to determine the effect the relationship has on Olympic performance outcomes. Five Olympic NSOs were examined: Athletics Australia, Cycling Australia, Rowing Australia, Swimming Australia and Yachting Australia. All five NSOs represent sports in which Australia has consistently achieved strong results at previous Olympic Games. These NSOs receive significant funding from the ASC and, as such, are expected to achieve success at the Olympic Games. The ASC-NSO relationship was examined through an agency theory framework whereby the 'contracts' between the ASC (principal) and the NSOs (agents) were investigated through a survey, interviews and document analysis to identify potential management issues that may affect Olympic performance outcomes, such as agent or principal opportunism. The findings identified a lack of a collaborative high performance sport system in Australia, with the findings emphasising concerns over the ASC's management of NSO programmes. While the ASC staff identified their organisation as the leader of high performance sport in Australia, the study's NSO participants did not believe that the ASC had the capacity, capability and knowledge to fulfil this role.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of board composition on the profitability of banks in Tanzania. First, it examines the differences between local and foreign-owned banks in terms of their boards and profitability, and then the contribution of board composition to banks' profitability. Design/methodology/approach: The paper utilizes a secondary panel data set of information on the boards, their operations and financial statements of 35 banks. The data were collected between 2009 and 2013. The authors tested the stated hypotheses using descriptive and econometric analyses. Findings: The results show a significant difference in board composition and profitability between local and foreign-owned banks. Local banks have a higher income and profits. With their contextual knowledge they are able to attract diverse board directors who contribute positively to their performance. The paper also found that large boards and those with women on them were associated with high profitability. Research limitations/implications: The study focused on three aspects of boards, which are size, foreign directors and women's representation. The paper is limited in the sense that other aspects of composition that also affect performance are not included in the study. Practical implications: The paper suggests that in order to maximize profitability, banks should increase the number of directors. Many board members can share skills and knowledge, which can improve performance. Women are underrepresented on boards. With current changes in policy and education in emerging countries, there is a need to increase their representation. Originality/value: This study contributes to the agency theory by showing that large boards are indeed efficient at monitoring and bringing in profits, especially in an emerging economy where there are multifaceted risks at country and company level. These risks require shareholders and investors to have a much better understanding of the banks and that is where a large board plays a key role. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not gain sufficient economic returns despite their significant economic contributions. A possible cause of poor SME performance is weak corporate governance. However, the corporate governance of SMEs is rarely investigated. Ownership structure provides SMEs with a monitoring mechanism that enhances performance. This study examines the relationships between board characteristics (including size, composition boards, CEO duality, expertise, and ethnicity) and SME performance in Malaysia. This study also explores how such relationships can be moderated by monitoring ownership structure. Survey results on SMEs in Klang Valley and Selangor areas show that non-executive boards and CEO duality are significantly and positively related to firm performance. In comparison, management ownership is significantly and negatively related to performance. Board size, expertise, ethnicity, and family ownership are not significantly related to SME performance. Findings indicate that good corporate governance improves decision making and firm performance. Furthermore, agency theory can explain conflict of interest in SMEs and the importance of corporate governance in enhancing their performance.

Information asymmetry in an employment relationship is much researched in the organization studies literature because of its consequences for employment contracts, compensation, and rent appropriation by the involved parties. However, its psychological antecedents have not been adequately addressed so far. We conceptually investigate the psychological drivers of supervisor-subordinate information asymmetry by primarily invoking social exchange theory. Whereas agency theory examines how information distribution is driven by self-interest seeking, social exchange theory emphasizes how individuals may be motivated to fulfill social obligations and not by exclusive self-interest seeking. This paper advances several propositions regarding the influence of a subordinate's and supervisor's psychological variables, such as relational identification, disposition for relational trust, assumed similarity, and the shaping techniques used by a supervisor on information asymmetry. In doing so, it highlights the underlying social exchange (social attraction and reciprocity), and the cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes. The influence of the psychological variables on information asymmetry may be moderated by contextual factors, such as interactional justice climate in teams, agency costs, and the type of employment relationship.

This study explores two ownership issues in private family firms. First, we investigate the relationship between the ownership of family CEOs and firm performance, and postulate that this relationship in private family firms is more complex than the inverted "U" relationship found in public family firms. Second, we predict a potential moderating effect of the second largest owner, who may exert a monitoring role on family CEOs. We focus on private family firms as recent studies show that private family firms have distinct features compared to public family firms, and that findings documented in public family firms may not apply to the ubiquitous, but much less studied, private family firms. We have applied agency theory to develop the two hypotheses, used secondary data on a large sample of private family firms, utilized an adjusted conventional quadratic technique to test the hypotheses, and validated the findings using a second method of piecewise linear specification. The results show that the non-linear relationship between the ownership of family CEOs and firm performance is more complicated than the often-documented inverted "U" shape from public firms. Meanwhile, the second largest owner with a high enough ownership stake can impose a positive moderating effect by mitigating potential agency problems caused by family CEOs.

In this paper we analyze the relationship between conformity to executive remuneration standards, corporate ownership, and the level and structure of CEO compensation for large European listed companies in the years 2007 and 2010. We show that controlled corporations conform to executive remuneration standards less than widely held firms. We also show that weaker compliance is associated with lower CEO pay and more cash-based incentive structures. We interpret this "conformity gap" from the perspective of individual firms and from a societal perspective, with the aim to contribute to frame the policy questions concerning executive pay at controlled corporations. Different policy implications depend on whether the conformity gap reflects a lower need for managerial incentives, given the monitoring by controlling shareholders, or the latter's willingness to extract private benefits of control. We argue in this paper that the former hypothesis prevails, so that regulators should abstain from increasing the level of enforcement of executive remuneration standards.

This paper analyses the performance effects of management controls and goals for the business across both male and female-controlled farm and rural family businesses revealing that female-controlled farm and rural family businesses do not underperform their male counterparts. (c) 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.
Purpose: Prior research indicates that family businesses have fewer management control practices in place and are more likely to have non-economic goals for their firm. Further, researchers in this domain contend that female-controlled businesses tend to underperform compared to male-controlled businesses. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the performance effects of management controls and goals for the business across both male and female-controlled farm and rural family businesses. Design/methodology/approach: The data used in the analyses are from the 2012 Intergenerational Farm and Non-Farm Family Business Survey. The sample comprises 576 small- and medium-sized rural family businesses. The authors used probit analysis to model both family business objective and subjective success for women and men. Findings: The results suggest that female-controlled farm and rural family businesses do not underperform their male counterparts in terms of objective or subjective assessments of performance. The results do indicate, however, that strategic management via management control practices within the firm influence objective and subjective performance differently across male and female-controlled farm and rural family businesses. Originality/value: The results provide three primary contributions to the family business literature. First, the authors determined that strategic management practices via management control mechanisms, as well as the monitoring of managers, are of significance to the objective performance (i.e. gross income) of both men and women-controlled farm and rural family businesses. Second, the authors found that communicating economic vs non-economic goals do not influence satisfaction with the firm's performance, but do influence the probability of success for female-controlled family businesses. Finally, the authors find that when we compare male and female-controlled businesses in the same industry, while controlling for family and business factors, men and women do not differ in a statistical sense in objective or subjective performance.

The objective of this paper is to systematize and analyze existing empirical studies of the relationship between family involvement in family businesses and their financial returns. With this purpose in mind, a systematic review of papers has been carried out. These papers have been selected with criteria clearly defined in the most relevant databases of social sciences, aiming at seeing whether this relationship is positive or negative. Based on the findings, three trends of the studies analyzed were obtained: positive relationship, negative relationship and neutral relationship. With these heterogeneous results it has been concluded that the relationship between the family businesses and their performance are complex and probably moderate or affected by factors that are not included in these analysis.

We examine whether predictions of capital structure theories hold true for Indian SMEs. In order to do so we conduct a panel data regression to test how the firm characteristics affect their capital structure decisions. Results suggest predictions of pecking order theory to be useful in explaining the capital structure decisions of Indian SMEs for short-term debt only and support the applicability of trade-off theory implying that greater the operating risk faced by a firm, more inclined it is in reducing its leverage. We do not find any evidence for the applicability of agency theory. (c) Serials Publications Pvt. Ltd.

Purpose: The authors contend that immediately following the initial public offering (IPO), the new owners that replace the original ones are likely to request changes in two corporate governance mechanisms, board of directors and top management teams (TMTs). Following these alterations, the purpose of this paper is to propose that such changes will be detrimental for the performance of young entrepreneurial firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the post-IPO governance changes in young entrepreneurial firms. The sample consists of 185 companies that went public between 2001 and 2005. A hierarchical linear regression approach with the appropriate control variables is adopted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results revealed that, following the changes in ownership structure post-IPO, changes are observed in one of the corporate governance mechanisms the authors considered, boards of directors, but not TMTs. Consistent with the general theme of this study, the authors also observed a negative impact of changes in boards of directors on subsequent firm performance; this was not the case with TMTs. Research limitations/implications: Contrary to the fundamental contentions of agency theory, the results highlight the need for adopting a different approach for young entrepreneurial firms. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of preserving the entrepreneurial efficacy of young entrepreneurial firms. Originality/value: This paper challenges the fundamental contentions of agency theory in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results demonstrate that post-IPO shareholders' interference with the governance mechanisms results in lower performance. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

While prior research has generally shown a positive price reaction to voluntary declarations of compliance with codes of corporate governance, this is the first paper to examine how investors react to the release of mandatory corporate governance reports. Positive reactions to declarations of compliance are generally interpreted in terms of signalling effects for those companies more committed with transparency. However, once corporate governance reports are mandatory, such signalling effects make no sense anymore. In the current context, the market would react according to the relevance of the information conveyed by the report. While prior related research has examined market reactions only through the behaviour of returns, we use three indicators: returns, price volatility and trading volumes. Our main result would be the lack of a significant market reaction to the release of corporate governance reports. This finding is robust as it is reported for each indicator of market reaction. However, for some subsamples of firms we show some weak reactions in the lines suggested by the agency theory. Our results might have some implications for regulators and policy makers when designing corporate governance regulations. (c) 2017 European Academy of Management

Using NCUA credit union call report data, I find that uninsured depositors and excess share insurers provide valuable monitoring benefits for credit unions for the years following the 2008 financial crisis. I find that the capital ratio, liquidity ratio, and delinquencies-to-total loans and leases decrease with an increase in the percentage of deposits that exceed the $250,000 per depositor regulatory threshold of standard deposit insurance. The influence of uninsured depositors is generally more significant for small credit unions than large credit unions. The results for the precrisis period are not consistent with those of the postcrisis period. However, the results are consistent across the six-year period following the financial crisis. Overall, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that uninsured depositors are value-maximizing stakeholders who exercise control over the firm.

Prior research shows that internationalization increases information asymmetry and conflicts of interest between managers and outside investors, which lead to greater agency problems. Agency theory predicts a demand for higher quality auditors when agency problems are more severe. This study investigates whether the extent of internationalization influences auditor choice and whether audit quality has performance implications for internationalization. Using a set of U.S. firms from 2003 to 2009, we find the extent of internationalization positively related to audit quality. Furthermore, higher quality audits positively moderate the relation between internationalization and firm performance. Taken together, these results suggest that higher quality audit mitigates the agency problem associated with internationalization. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Conflicts of interest represent an increasing problem in organizations, given the expansion of stakeholder concerns, needs, and expectations. Existing remedies to address these conflicts largely involve aligning management incentives with the interests of investors, or recusing parties with special interests from the decision-making effort. Both focus on a dyad between the primary stakeholder and the decision-maker. However, increasingly complex situations involving multiple stakeholders exist. The added complexity of considering multiple stakeholders heightens uncertainty that can facilitate the pursuit of self-interest. Ironically, a potential remedy may involve ensuring the presence of competing interests. A review of military procurement suggests that competing interests can mitigate self-interest.

In light of the need to develop mechanisms of control, protection, and transparency regarding the relationships between principal and agent, and with the aim of eliminating or reducing the agency problem, corporate governance has emerged. Based on Agency Theory, separation of ownership and control of activities derives from the complexity of organizations. In this context, this study aims to analyze the relationship between dimensions of complexity and corporate governance in companies listed on the Sao Paulo Stock, Commodities, and Futures Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA), in which contingency factors might influence organizational characteristics. The investigation gathers data from a sample of 162 companies listed on the BM&FBOVESPA. The following statistical tests were used in the data analysis: Factor Analysis, Multiple Linear Regression, Correspondence Analysis, and Correlation Analysis. For measuring complexity, contingency variables such as age, size, diversification, and internationalization were adopted; and, to assess corporate governance, a representative index of the adoption of good governance practices was used. The results show that organizational complexity is explained by the size and diversification variables, whereas operational complexity is explained by the size, diversification, and internationalization variables. It was observed that in the two dimensions of complexity - organizational and operational - corporate governance was influenced by the diversification, internationalization, and age variables, with the latter involving an inverse relationship. It is concluded that companies displaying more complexity, in its two dimensions, record a higher level of corporate governance, which confirms the research hypothesis.

Purpose: This paper aims to present case study evidence on the changes in the relations between chief executive officers (CEOs) of large firms and shareholders in the past three decades of the twentieth century. In line with insights from agency theory, the CEOs have experienced increased scrutiny from their principals, the shareholders. This development has affected financial communication and investor relations as well as stock market prices. Design/methodology/approach: The Dutch electronics firm Royal Philips NV in the transition period of 1971-2001 has been studied using publicly available disclosures and stock market prices. A descriptive case study approach is combined with event study methodology. Findings: It was observed that the increased emphasis on shareholder interests has affected the interactions between Philips' respective CEOs and the shareholders' reactions to strategic decisions as measured by stock price changes. Around the beginning of the twenty-first century, clarity and openness in CEO communication was the norm and deviations were punished with volatile stock prices. Research limitations/implications: The study relies on publicly available data. Originality/value: The case study of Philips can be extrapolated to other exchange-listed firms in the late twentieth century, which faced changed expectations about the role of the CEO, investor relations and the CEO's accountability toward shareholders. This transition is relevant not only as a historical observation, but also as a background to studies in finance and management about top management and financial markets.

In this study, we examine the effects of corporate governance practices on financial performance of Pakistani listed firms. On the bases of agency theory, MM theorem, and theory of firm, we suggest that corporate governance effects firm performance directly as well as indirectly via mediation of capital structure and dividend policy. The model was tested using a cross-lagged analysis of 100 non-financial firms with the structural equation modeling (SEM). The study concludes that corporate governance improves financial performance by exploiting capital structure and dividend policy. The findings of this study, highlights the importance of corporate governance practices for peer firms to restructure their debt and dividend policies for the enhancement of their financial performance.

To this day, corporate governance remains the topic of the most intense discussions among scholars, especially concerning its legal and regulatory development over the past few years. Since most of the current developments deal with global concerns about the impact of recent financial crises and their related scandals, academics have not yet been able to settle the score with long-standing matters of corporate governance. Indeed, under the significant influence of an Anglo-Saxon culture, largely disseminated among the literature, the prevailing theoretical framework of corporate governance is still based on a series of preposterous presumptions. These outdated presumptions appear to originate more from rhetorical statements than any deep analysis of the issues characterizing the early era of modern corporate governance. Because over the years they have fulfilled their task of supporting the development of capitalism throughout the industrial world and providing a legitimate rationale for corporate owners to adopt certain aggressive and reckless behaviors, these corporate governance presumptions have since been held up as the cornerstones of an efficient social economy, profitable for all and everyone. With the global economy having encountered a few unfortunate setbacks over the past decades, it is important to question the legal value of these presumptions, as they might have more to do with unsubstantiated myths than any extensive legal or scientific work. The aim of this article is not to present the paramount truth on this topic, but rather to highlight the discrepancies between what have always been considered as the foundations of corporate governance, and what corporate governance should have been had it not been implemented with the sole intention of nurturing certain illegitimate purposes of modern capitalism, such as shareholder primacy or financial profitability. Therefore, this article explores five typical corporate governance myths: (1) the corporation as a nexus of contracts, (2) the shareholders as owners of the corporation, (3) the shareholders as the only residual creditors of the corporation, (4) the effectiveness of shareholder activism, and (5) corporate governance as a legitimate rationale for shareholder primacy. The aggregate theory of corporations - which maintains that the corporation is nothing less than a nexus of contracts and that it may only benefit the shareholders - held its own throughout most of the twentieth century, but now finds itself faced with some more inclusive and realistic theories of unprecedented rigor, such as the consideration of the corporation as an institution pursuing a social purpose. Considering shareholders as the owners of the corporation might therefore be a thing of the past as well. Undeniably, what the recent ups and downs on the financial markets have shown the world is that corporate directors ought to be considered as the central core of the corporation, acting collectively, but independently from the shareholders, and promoting the success of the company, in the interests of all corporate stakeholders. Consequently, shareholders can no longer be considered the owners of the corporation, dictating to directors how they must govern, because the corporation has its own legal personality, effectively managed and controlled by the board of directors. Subsequently, neither can they be considered as the only residual creditors of the corporation, as all the other stakeholders' investments are also at stake. More importantly, while shareholders have become more active over the years, the effectiveness of their involvement in the management of the corporation has been questionable, as they often lack long-term vision and considerations for other stakeholders' interests. Finally, it is quite arguable to still promote shareholders' primacy in today's world, as law, jurisprudence and doctrine have, timidly but still, embraced the stakeholder theory which states that the board of directors has to consider the whole corporation's interests first, rather than simply focusing on short term profitability for the shareholders.

This article examines the association between the equity concentration and agency costs as well as the impact of agency costs on performance of non-financial firms listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). These relations are examined by using dynamic panel data and a two-step robust system estimation for the period 2010-2013. The study uses three proxy variables to measure agency costs. The results show that the equity concentration has no significant impact on agency costs, and the agency costs have no significant impact on firms' performance. In addition, the study shows no evidence to support the agency theory in non-financial firms listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). This study provides a better understanding of the association between equity concentration, agency costs and a firm's performance. (c) 2017, (c) 2017 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

This study investigates the relation of executive cash compensation and gender characteristics of senior executives of Thai listed companies using 1,660 firm-years observations from 2009 to 2013. The findings show that male executives earn more cash compensation than do their female counterparts and that compensation is higher for male CEOs whose educational qualifications were Master's degree or above. Companies with a higher proportion of male executives and with better firm performance (measuredby ROA, ROE, and Tobin's q) pay higher cash compensation. The results conform with the Expectancy theory that male executives receive more compensation than do female executives because of their (expected) abilities to make higher returns to the firm's assets. Other significant determinants are that older and larger firms pay more cash compensation to the executives (Life cycle theory) and that companies with a higher proportion of independent directors (Agency Theory) and higher ownership concentrations (Stewardship theory) offer less compensation.

This paper extends Jensen and Meckling's agency cost theory. A clockwise rotation of their budget constraint represents better performance by agents compared to owners and higher firm values. This extension incorporates Alchian and Demsetz's view of the firm, wherein firm values increase when managers are employed. It is then sub-optimal for owner-managers to directly expropriate non-pecuniary benefits through the firm as in Jensen and Meckling. It is instead Pareto optimal that owner-managers who seek to expropriate non-pecuniary benefits do so using the firm's higher value, and trading it for the non-pecuniary benefits they desire in the open market.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of family control and management in the quality of accounting information in Brazilian companies, with a focus on timeliness. The sample consisted of 72 Brazilian companies and 1,656 observations from 2008 to 2013. The results show that family-controlled companies are quicker to recognize good news related to the price of the respective stock. On the other hand, family managed companies showed low accounting timeliness in relation to recognition of good news. The findings contribute to the agency theory and the literature on family firms and confirm that such companies experience fewer agency problems arising from conflicts between majority and minority shareholders. In addition, the agency conflicts between the management and minority shareholders can be compounded by the recognition of good news not being in family managed firms. (c) 2017 Taylor & Francis.

Corporate Governance systems adequately address problems related to accountability and transparency in developed countries. However, in emerging economies these systems are susceptible to exploitation by self-interest-minded individuals entrusted in managing the organization in some cases, by majority shareholders in other cases and at times by third parties from outside the organization. This exploitation falls under the concept of Agency Theory which emerges as a matter of concern that should be dealt with by Corporate Governance systems. Under the Agency Theory, the author classifies the Agency related problems into three types; "Type One", "Type Two" and "Type Three". All three types emanate from the separation of ownership and decision making complemented by the natural reality of self-interest requiring thus internal mechanisms of control in order to mitigate the Agency problems along with all Agency related costs. The paper then deals with such mechanisms. (c) 2017 by IGI Global.

Purpose: Shareholders and managers can work in a hierarchy in which principals attempt to control the actions of agents to achieve the wealth objective. Alternatively, shareholders and managers can work together as a cooperative team in which shareholders provide financial capital and managers provide human capital. The authors aim to examine the different implications for value creation provided by the two approaches. Design/methodology/approach: By comparing the literature on the value implications of the incomplete contracting framework and control arrangements in principal-agent hierarchies, the authors identify deviations from optimal outcomes and suggest solutions. Findings: The review indicates that a cooperative framework has some advantages over the hierarchical model. The stability of human capital and the relationship between managers and shareholders can be enhanced when shareholders provide capital in increments which vest over time and latitude for renegotiation of agreements is built into contracts. Practical implications: By surrendering control using stock options programmes, managers are free to invest in relationship-specific assets. Shareholders can control the provision of capital by withdrawing investment if insufficient returns are realized, i.e. if stock options do not meet vesting requirements. The market can then be left to do its work. Originality/value: This paper provides an original review of literature on cooperation and hierarchies in the shareholder-manager relationship and proposes solutions to identified deviations from optimal outcomes.

This chapter explores the possible connections between Behavioural Accounting Research and agency theory. To begin, we describe agency theory and its origins. Given our focus on behavioural accounting, we concentrate on how the individual is influenced by accounting processes and reports, rather than on how accounting leads to outcomes based on the aggregate behaviour of market participants. In our view, Behavioural Accounting Research is linked to agency theory by explaining the role compensation, information, contracts and monitoring play in agency theory. A sample of research is used to illustrate how behavioural accounting researchers have employed agency theory in their papers. Finally, possible research directions are discussed.

The paper reviews theories of corporate governance with regard to financial institutions, in particular, the banking sector. The conventional theory underlying corporate governance does not suggest a differential approach to its application among different organisations. While many organisations subscribe to some form of corporate governance, the manner the principles are applied vary from one organisation to another, one sector to another and one country to another. Financial institutions are a special category of corporations because of the various services they provide to the sectors of the economy, their failure of which can be costly to society (e.g. the effects of the Global Financial Crisis, 2007-2009). The negative externalities that can affect households and firms when there is a breakdown in the provision of financial services arguably justify regulation. Thus, the governance mechanisms that safeguard the interests of shareholders in conventional corporate structures might not be adequate in the case of financial institutions. Cognisant that there is little research regarding corporate governance of financial institutions including Islamic banks, this paper reviews contemporary literature on the subject matter and provides further insights.

Corporate entrepreneurship requires senior executives to evaluate proposals for investment and projects from corporate entrepreneurs. Properties of technology make this evaluation difficult, creating a knowledge gap. Whether through opportunism, overconfidence, and overconfidence, corporate entrepreneurs are likely to induce overinvestment in projects, perhaps at the expense of corporate goals. In this paper we analyze this problem using the tools of agency theory, and identify a solution, staged commitment, used and useful in many areas of business. (c) 2018 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

Important corporate governance mechanisms such as ownership concentration and debt used by the large firms can affect firm performance and value in developed markets. The mixed findings - which are non-conclusive in the literature - pertaining to these relationships pose questions about the exact nature of the relationships between these mechanisms and firm value. Moreover, the mixed findings in the literature have resulted in the endogeneity issue of the former becoming central to discussions in corporate governance and corporate finance studies. The research in this book focuses on the dynamic endogeneity issue to investigate whether this issue influences the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm value in the largest Australian firms based on agency theory. The study investigates this issue through three different advanced econometric models and tests based on agency theory: two-way fixed effects (FE) and the two-step system known as the generalised method of moments (GMM). The book concludes that dynamic endogeneity is not a serious issue in influencing the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm value in the largest Australian firms. These models can be applied to other countries for investigating similar corporate governance and finance issues. (c) 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

In general, this research is aimed at providing empirical evidence concerning the analysis of the adoption of IFRS as a moderating variable in the relation of corporate governance with earnings management. In particular, there are two objectives in this research, first, to provide empirical evidence concerning the analysis of the adoption of IFRS as a moderating variable in the relation between the independent of commissioners to the number of board of commissioners and earnings management; second, to analyze the adoption of IFRS as a moderating variable in the relation between the dual position audit committee members and earnings management. The research was conducted on companies listed on the Stock Exchanges of Germany, Denmark, France, and the Netherlands from 2002 to 2013. It primarily employed agency theory. Moreover, it employed primary variables including adoption of IFRS, corporate governance, in particular the proportion of independent commissioners to the board of commissioners, dual positions of audit committee members and earnings management. The test results in this research conclude that: The results of testing of the model of accrual earnings management with the samples of companies listed on the stock exchanges of Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark indicated that the adoption of IFRS strengthened negative relation of the proportion of independent commissioners to the number of board of commissioners with accruals earnings management, so that the hypothesis 1 was acceptable. The hypothesis 2 stating the adoption of IFRS strengthen negative relation between the multi position of audit committee members and accrual earnings management was acceptable.

The aim of this article is to evaluate the relevance of the principal-agent model as a framework for the concession analysis of the Cameroonian railway. Several parameters define this agency relationship: the power delegation from the State principal) to the dealer (agent), the hypothesis of information bias in favor of the agent the existence of a risk sharing mechanism. However, the agency theory is undermined due to the poor definition of the perimeter of the concession. Consequently, there is an increase of agency costs and this paves the way for actors' strategic behaviors.

The business landscape is constantly changing, and such events eventually force organizations to restructure their form of management and control. As companies develop, there is a separation of functions between managers and owners, that is, shareholders cease to exercise the management of companies. With this separation some conflicts arise, among them we have the problems of agency, which is approached by the Agency Theory, where the interests of the managers distance themselves from the interests proposed by the shareholders, in this way the asymmetry of information occurs when the owner owns difficulties to observe all the actions of the administrator, which may be different from those that he himself would have chosen, when not all the parties know all the facts, that is, when the information is incomplete. The agent is directly linked to the day-to-day negotiations of the company, while the principal depends on the information that the agent gives him (NASCIMENTO and REGINATO, 2008). In this context, the Controllership has an important role in reducing information asymmetry caused by the agency problem: it seeks to balance information and thus act as a tool to support managers in decision making. This study aims at provoking a reflection on a possible subordination between Accounting and Administration. The methodology is based on a systematic review with bibliographic, descriptive and qualitative support. The CAPES / MEC journal platform was used, and the researches resulted in 339 articles published in the last 10 years, after analysis, 14 of these were separated for study. It is concluded that the Controllership plays an important role as a tool to support the Administration and the reduction of subordination. (c) 2017.

The study empirically investigates the relationship between corporate governance and the triple bottom line sustainability performance through the lens of agency theory and stakeholder theory. We claim, in fact, that no single theory fully accounts for all the hypothesised relationships. We measure sustainability performance through manual content analysis on sustainability reports of the US-based companies. The study extends the existing literature by investigating the impact of selected corporate governance mechanisms on each dimension of sustainability performance, as defined by the GRI framework. Our approach allows to identify which governance mechanisms foster triple bottom line performance, also revealing that some mechanisms fit only specific dimension(s) of sustainability. The fact-based findings provide support for a new beginning in the theorising process in which the theories must try not only to provide rationale for the impact of corporate governance on sustainability, but also to explain which dimension of sustainability might be more affected. The most important implication for practitioners is the support for sustainability practices, which may be gained through implementation of particular corporate governance mechanisms. The findings contribute also to the improvement of the ongoing standard setting process, in particular as it concerns the in-depth revision of the economic dimension of sustainability carried out under the new GRI framework.

This study develops a combined agency-resource dependence perspective and applies it to the study of interlocking directorates. It suggests that interlocking directorates may exert either a positive or a negative effect on subsequent firm performance, depending on the firm's relative resources, power imbalance, ownership concentration, and CEO ownership. A test on a sample of 145 Italian companies provides support for hypothesized effects. This study suggests that integrating agency and resource dependence theories provides a higher-order explanation of firm performance and helps advance both agency and resource dependence theories.

Research Summary: We investigate whether and how family ownership and management influence firms' internationalization strategies in an emerging economy in which family firms are dominant. Anchoring on the willingness and ability framework and drawing on the socioemotional wealth perspective and agency theory, we theorize how the heterogeneity among family firms in their ownership structures, concentration, and family involvement in management shapes the firms' internationalization strategies. We also theorize how certain contingencies, such as the presence of foreign institutional ownership and family management, moderate the relationship between family ownership and internationalization strategy. We test our predictions by using a proprietary, longitudinal panel dataset of 303 leading family firms from India and find support for most of our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Internationalization has emerged as a dominant strategy for firms in a globally interconnected world. We observe that ownership structure and management have significant bearing on internationalization strategies of family firms, as family owners and managers are more averse to internationalization. Family firms' aversion to internationalize is more pronounced when families can exercise greater control on firms' actions through the combined effect of higher family ownership (primarily through strategic control) and family's participation in management (through strategic, administrative, and operational control). However, certain contingencies, such as the higher ownership of foreign institutions and presence of professional managers, help business families improve their understanding of international markets, reduce the fear of the unknown, and better appreciate the benefits of internationalization, thereby aiding greater internationalization of family firms.

This paper proposes an agency model for headquarters-subsidiary relationships in multinational organizations with headquarters as the principal and the subsidiary as the agent. As a departure from classical agency theory, our model is developed for the unit level of analysis and considers two root causes of the agency problem--self-interest and bounded rationality. We argue that in the organizational setting, one cannot assume absolute self-interest and perfect rationality of agents (subsidiaries) but should allow them to vary. We explain subsidiary-level variation through a set of internal organizational and external social conditions in which the headquarters-subsidiary agency dyad is embedded. We then discuss several agency scenarios reflecting various levels of self-interest and rationality that lead to different manifestations of the agency problem. The proposed framework can inform more relevant applications of the agency perspective in organizational studies and motivate future research. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Based on a large international sample, we examine the effects of CSR on the cost of equity under different levels of investor protection. In countries where investor protection is strong (poor), our results show that the cost of equity falls (rises) when a firm invests in CSR. Our findings are robust to alternative variable definitions, sample selection, analyst forecast bias, and various methodological specifications. We also demonstrate that the investor base channel is able to explain different outcomes regarding the relation between CSR and the cost of equity, and we derive implications for both financial practice and public policy.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the impact of board characteristics on the financial performance of listed firms in Tanzania. Board characteristics, including outside directors, board size, CEO/Chair duality, gender diversity, board skill and foreign directors are addressed in the Tanzanian context by applying two corporate governance theories, namely, agency theory and resource dependence theory. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses balanced panel data regression analysis on 80 firm-years observations (2006-2013) from annual reports, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 key stakeholders. The study uses also a mixed methods approach and applies a convergent parallel design (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011) to integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Findings: It was found that in terms of agency theory, while the findings support the separation of CEO/Chairperson roles, they do not support outside directors-financial performance linkage. With regard to resource dependence theory, the findings suggest that gender diversity has a positive impact on financial performance. Furthermore, the findings do not support an association between financial performance and board size, PhD qualification and foreign directors. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of board-performance link and provides academic evidence to policy makers in Tanzania for current and future governance reforms. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the literature by providing new and original insights that, within a developing setting, extend current understanding of the association between corporate governance and financial performance. This is predicated, also, on the use of uncommon mixed methods approach. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the effects of firm performance and corporate governance on chief executive officer (CEO) compensation in an emerging market, Pakistan. Using a more robust Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation approach for a sample of non-financial firms listed at Karachi Stock Exchange over the period 2005-2012, we find that both current- and previous-year accounting performances has positive influence on CEO compensation. However, stock market performance does not appear to have a positive impact on executive compensation. We further find that ownership concentration is positively related with CEO compensation, indicating some kind of collusion between management and largest shareholder to get personal benefits. Inconsistent with agency theory, CEO duality appears to have a negative influence, while board size and board independence have no convincing relationship with CEO compensation, indicating board ineffectiveness in reducing CEO entrenchment. The results of dynamic GMM model suggest that CEO pay is highly persistent and takes time to adjust to long-run equilibrium. (c) 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Management literature is currently giving growing conceptual and empirical attention to the peculiarity and relevance of entrepreneurial attitudes in family firms, with divergent outcomes. Aiming at concretizing the effects of these attitudes, denoted by the entrepreneurial orientation construct, on family business performance and considering that family dynamics come into play in this relationship, we particularly investigate the impact of control mechanisms and family-related goals. Findings are based on a sample of 180 family firms and show that Proactiveness and Autonomy are particularly relevant to financial performance. Agency-problems avoiding control mechanisms moderate the effect of Innovativeness and Autonomy, while socioemotional wealth (SEW) goals moderate the effect of Risk-Taking, respectively. The usage of these mechanisms and managing SEW goals provide opportunities for a more efficient exploitation of entrepreneurial attitudes. (c) 2017, The Author(s).

This study uses a large sample of Korean firms to examine institutional blockholders' influence on corporate earnings management. The Korean market is an interesting setting to study institutional monitoring because it is dominated by chaebols, which are characterized by ineffective internal governance mechanisms. We find evidence that institutional blockholders deter opportunistic financial reporting, and such activities are the most evident among domestic institutional blockholders. Foreign institutional blockholders, especially those with short-term investment objectives, lead to more discretionary reporting. Our findings are robust to various empirical models and endogeneity checks. Moreover, this study offers new insight into the proximity advantage of domestic institutional investors with regard to monitoring information. It also highlights institutional investors' roles in shaping corporate governance in emerging markets, in which sound corporate governance has become increasingly important for firms' long-term sustainability. One important policy implication is that regulatory authorities should aim to promote institutional investors' participation in these markets. (c) 2017 Academy of International Business.

We complement the resource-based view of the firm with agency theory in order to explore the link between R&D intensity and degree of internationalization of firms affiliated to Indian business groups. Results from the two-stage least squares panel regression estimation indicate research intensity is positively associated with the firm's degree of internationalization. The relationship is strengthened by the concentration of ownership by family and affiliated business group firms, the board of directors' professionalization, the wedge between voting and cash-flow rights, and the board interlocks of professional directors; but weakened by the board interlocks of family directors. Implications are discussed. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Research on corporate social responsibility (CSR) has traditionally focused on managerial discretion and stakeholders' influence. This study extends current research by addressing the effect of family firms and institutional owners on CSR performance, namely, CSR strengths and concerns. Based on stewardship theory and the socioemotional wealth perspective, we propose that family firms are more likely to value CSR performance. Next, drawing from multiple agency theory, we predict that institutional owners, unlike family owners, will influence a firm's CSR performance differently. We tested our hypotheses using a sample of 153 firms from 1994 to 2006 and found general support for our hypotheses. A higher percentage of family owned equity and the presence of a family CEO are found to increase CSR strengths, whereas transient institutional owners have an opposite effect. The presence of a family CEO and founding family are found to reduce CSR concerns. Contrary to our predictions, dedicated institutional owners are positively associated with CSR concerns.

Research Summary: Though research has focused on the ascent and acceptance of female CEOs, the post-promotion circumstances female CEOs face remain unclear. In this study, we focus on a critical post-promotion circumstance: the board chair-CEO relationship. Drawing on the gender stereotype literature, agency theory, and stewardship theory, we posit that firms appointing a female CEO are more likely to adopt a collaboration board chair orientation and less likely to adopt a control orientation. We further predict this effect is attenuated by female board representation. Using a sample of new S&P 1500 CEOs, we find support for our predictions regarding the collaboration orientation but not the control orientation. This research provides some evidence of benevolent sexism in the boardroom, with female directors acting as a countervailing influence. Managerial Summary: Whereas the notion that females encounter a glass ceiling on their path toward CEO is well documented, the conditions female CEOs encounter after promotion are less understood. The relationship between the board chair and the CEO is one important post-promotion condition. Board chairs can focus on monitoring and/or working together with the CEO. We suggest board chairs are more likely to work in close collaboration with female CEOs than with male CEOs. We attribute this to benevolent sexism, which explains that board chairs are more likely to collaborate with female CEOs because they view females as more conducive to, and in need of, this type of relationship. We also suggest this benevolent sexism is less prevalent when there are more females on the board. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect of political connections on earnings quality by simultaneously controlling the firm characteristics; to test whether Pakistani firms' ownership, specifically family ownership, plays a significant role in political connections-earnings quality association; to draw a conclusion about the agency theory in the context of Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was used to examine the influence of political connections and family ownership on the earnings quality of listed firms in Pakistan. The study uses historical data from 238 active non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange during the period of 2009-2015. The final data set comprises more than 1,600 firm-year observations from ten major non-financial industry classifications. To enhance the robustness of the empirical relationship, the study used several proxies of earnings quality in conjunction with robust regression methods and diagnostic checks. Findings: The present study's findings are consistent with the findings of the studies on agency theory previous literature, where politically connected firms have significantly lower earnings quality as compared to non-connected firms. The results also indicate that family firms have superior earnings quality than non-family-controlled firms. Furthermore, family ownership moderates the negative influence of political connections on earnings quality. This implies that family ownership diminishes the costs of political connections and improves the earnings quality of the firm. Originality/value: This study is different from previous research in three respects. First, it examines whether family ownership concentration has a moderating influence on the relationship between political connections and earnings quality. Second, it uses a robust methodology and extensive data set to examine the influence of political connections and family ownership concentration on earnings quality. Further, this study is the first to analyze the nexus between financial reporting quality and the political business environment in the context of Pakistan. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Offering product-service systems (PSS) arguably results in economic, environmental and social benefits but also entails significant challenges related to relational dynamics between the provider and the customer. Although prior studies suggest that adverse customer behaviour during PSS provision is likely, they provide a limited theoretical understanding of the conceptualization of such relational problems and, more importantly, offer few possible ways to address these problems. By applying the lens of agency theory, this study examines PSS provider-customer relational problems and solutions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify agency problems and propose mechanisms to mitigate adverse customer behaviour in PSS provision. Based on a multiple case study approach involving two manufacturing companies, several results are presented. First, we identify and describe two underlying reasons for adverse customer behaviour. These reasons are associated with goal differentiation and monitoring challenges. Second, different agency mechanisms (i.e. sharing, monitoring and trust) are presented as approaches to mitigate the likelihood of adverse customer behaviour. The matching of agency problems with agency mechanisms to mitigate these problems lays the groundwork for developing a framework for agency situation evaluation during the formation and ongoing phases of the PSS agreement. In addition, the choice of agency mechanism is found to be correlated with the maturity and type of customer relationship and can change over time as new customers become known and then become loyal. The proposed framework has major theoretical implications for the PSS literature as well as managerial implications for large manufacturing companies engaged in PSS provision. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of internal corporate governance mechanisms on insurance companies' risk-taking in the UK context. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a panel data of all listed insurance companies on FTSE 350 over the 2005-2014 period. Multivariate regression techniques are used to estimate the effect of internal corporate governance mechanisms on insurance companies' risk-taking. Findings: The results show that the board size and board meetings are significantly and negatively related to risk-taking. In contrast, the results show that board independence and audit committee size are statistically insignificant but negatively related to risk-taking. The findings are robust to alternative measures and endogeneities. Research limitations/implications: The findings have important implications for investors, managers, regulators of financial institutions and effectiveness of corporate governance reforms that have been pursued. Investors may further rely on internal corporate governance attributes to form expectations about risk-taking behaviour. Insurance companies need strong governance, as well as effective accounting and financial reporting standards, to enable proper insights into the company's financial position. Originality/value: This study contributes to the corporate governance literature and creates significant evidence regarding the role of corporate governance in constraining risk-taking behaviour in an industry with significantly complex context.

This paper sheds light on the incongruent findings concerning the relationship between family involvement and firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR). While prior studies have mainly taken the perspective of families' socioemotional wealth preservation, we approach this relationship from the perspective of behavioral agency theory, highlighting the important role played by CEOs' family memberships. Specifically, we posit that family firms are more likely to invest in CSR when their CEOs are members of the controlling families. Furthermore, we examine how family firms can employ long-term incentives to encourage non-family CEOs to act in the interests of the controlling families to preserve SEW and thus enhancing family firms' CSR performance. We tested our hypotheses using hand-collected data of family firms included in the S&P 500 index, in the period of 2003-2010. The empirical findings support our hypotheses that (a) family firms with family members as the CEOs have better CSR performance and (b) family firms tend to provide a high level of long-term incentives to non-family than family CEOs. In addition, long-term incentives strongly motivate CEOs to improve firms' CSR performance, regardless of their family memberships. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

This systematic literature review analyses the determinants and consequences of executive compensation-related shareholder activism and say-on-pay (SOP) votes. The review covers 71 empirical articles published between January 1995 and September 2017. The studies are reviewed within an empirical research framework that separates the reasons for shareholder activism and SOP voting dissent as input factor on the one hand and the consequences of shareholder pressure as output factor on the other. This procedure identifies the five most important groups of factors in the literature: the level and structure of executive compensation, firm characteristics, corporate governance mechanisms, shareholder structure and stakeholders. Of these, executive compensation and firm characteristics are the most frequently examined. Further examination reveals that the key assumptions of neoclassical principal agent theory for both managers and shareholders are not always consistent with recent empirical evidence. First, behavioral aspects (such as the perception of fairness) influence compensation activism and SOP votes. Second, non-financial interests significantly moderate shareholder activism. Insofar, we recommend integrating behavioral and non-financial aspects into the existing research. The implications are analyzed, and new directions for further research are discussed by proposing 19 different research questions. (c) 2018 University of Florida, Fisher School of Accounting

Purpose: This paper aims to provide a twofold empirical comparison: first, a comparison between the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on agency costs proxies and firm performance measures, and second, this comparison was used before and after the 2008 financial crisis, capturing two different economic states. Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression methods were applied to two data sets of non-financial firms incorporated in the FTSE ALL-Share index over the period 2005-2011. Findings: The results provide evidence that not all mechanisms lead to lower agency conflicts and/or higher firm performance. Ownership identity has a significant impact and the role of the governance mechanisms changes with the changes in the economic conditions surrounding the firm. Research limitations/implications: The results lend support to the notion that forcing a certain code of practice on firms to follow could compel them to move away from conflict reduction governance structures. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a comparison of empirical evidence for the impact of board characteristics and ownership identity on agency costs and firm performance by using a comprehensive set of corporate governance mechanisms. This comparison challenges the prior studies that use performance as an indirect proxy for lower agency costs. Additionally, it compares the impact of the governance mechanisms during two different economic conditions. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research Summary: This study analyzes how the divestitures that are impelled by activist investors in their campaigns against public corporations affect shareholder value. Using hand-collected data on the activist campaigns that were launched against and the divestitures that were undertaken by Fortune 500 companies between 2007 and 2015, we find that activist-impelled divestitures are more positively associated with immediate and longer-term measures of shareholder value than comparable manager-led divestitures. These performance differences persist for nearly two years after the completion of these deals. Our results empirically test the idea that firms with agency problems unlock shareholder value when they divest, and support the notion that activist investors fulfill an important external governance function. Our work also opens new research opportunities and offers practical implications as well. Managerial Summary: This study investigates how divestitures that are undertaken at the behest of activist investors affect shareholder value. We find that divestitures that were undertaken under pressure from activist investors are associated with more positive shareholder returns than comparable divestitures that were undertaken voluntarily by managers. These performance differences persist for nearly two years after the completion of these deals, alleviating concerns about the purported short-termism of activist investors. Our findings suggest that activist investors may fulfill an important governance function by inducing managers to undertake strategies that they might not otherwise pursue, thereby unlocking shareholder value.

This study integrates behavioral agency theory with the conditions of willingness and ability to investigate how family ownership and family involvement affect the likelihood of initial international entry, both directly and interactively. A firm's initial international entry--its first expansion into a foreign market--is considered a major, and often risky, strategic action that enables a firm to compete and grow. Among family firms, variance in initial international entry is theoretically explained by the family's willingness and ability to participate. Using survival analysis on data representing 190 different family firms across 10 years, our findings support hypotheses suggesting that family ownership and involvement decrease the likelihood of initial international entry. However, these two forms of family control also act as interactive substitutes in relation to initial international entry likelihood. Our findings provide for a more nuanced understanding of family control heterogeneity in relationship to major strategic actions. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: While there have been extensive empirical investigations of pay-performance sensitivity, the perspective of performance-pay has received less attention to date. While executive compensation is sensitive to firm performance, firm performance is also likely to be affected by executive compensation. Adopting multiple theoretical perspectives, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether executive compensation has a greater influence on firm performance or whether the latter has a greater influence on compensation. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from a five-year period (2010-2014) for Financial Times and Stock Exchange 350 companies, the authors employ a set of simultaneous equation modelling to jointly investigate, after accounting for endogeneity problem, the mutual association of executive compensation and firm performance by employing four control variables (board size, non-executive directors, leverage and boardroom ownership). Findings: The authors find strong evidence for the greater influence of executive compensation on firm performance than the pay-performance framework. This finding supports the tournament theory compared with the agency perspective. Research limitations/implications: Inevitably, there are limitations in a wide-ranging study of this nature that could be addressed in future research. As any empirical study utilising company data, there may be concerns to the effect of survivorship bias and the manner in which companies have reorganised, if there is any, themselves during the period under examination. There are also issues as to missing data, some measures relating to both executive compensation and corporate governance are not provided by the BoardEx database. Practical implications: The study results provide evidence that using the tournament perspective by remuneration committees as a guide for determining executive compensation helps in achieving better performance. This helps in developing appropriate mechanisms for setting executive remuneration. Originality/value: This paper combines an empirical investigation of the frameworks of pay-performance and performance-pay and develops a system of six simultaneous equations to examine the associations between executive compensation and firm performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to integrate conventional corporate governance (CG) mechanisms into the Islamic banking framework in order to examine their impact on Islamic banks (IBs) financial performance (IBFP) within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) context. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a sample of 22 full-fledged IBs operating in the GCC countries over an 11-year period from 2005 to 2015. Using panel data approach, the paper develops an empirical model consists of five CG mechanisms and three control variables. The model parameters are estimated using feasible generalized least squares framework. Findings: The results show that five internal CG mechanisms have statistically significant relationship with IBFP, measured by Q-ratio. Insider shareholding is found to be positively associated with IBFP, while institutional and government shareholdings are found to be negatively related to Q-ratio, the results being consistent with the agency theory, strategic alignment theory and property rights theory, respectively. Moreover, the results reveal that large board size and CSR engagement negatively influence IBFP, once again lending support to agency theory and trade off theory, respectively. The control variables, namely, leverage, size and age are also found to have a statistically significant relationship with IBFP. Practical implications: IBs are urged to ensure transparency in the provision of innovative products fundamentally in contrast to conventional banking products as well as cater to the untapped markets by weaving Islamic values into the existing CG fabric, as a feasible solution to remain competitive. Originality/value: The paper examines the relationship between internal CG mechanisms and financial performance of listed and non-listed full-fledged IBs operating in the GCC countries.

Agency theory emphasizes the role of outside directors in mitigating free cash flow (FCF) problems, such as overinvesting FCF's into negative NPV R&D projects. In this paper we draw on and extend agency theory to argue that the underinvestment of financial slack towards a persistently high R&D-intensity is actually a greater problem for high-tech firms. Specifically, we claim that inside directors play a critical role for the board in safeguarding R&D investment by monitoring the CEO, and mitigating informational asymmetries for independent directors. We test our theory using a panel-data set of S&P 1500 firms in R&D-intensive industries from 1997 to 2007. Our empirical analysis reveals that inside directors positively influence the relationship between financial slack and R&D-intensity, and that their ability to ensure cash holdings are used to preserve R&D matters the most during periods of financial distress.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which chief executive officers (CEOs) deserve the pay they receive both in terms of over and underpayment. Design/methodology/approach: Rather than using the traditional normal distribution view in which CEO performance clusters around the mean with relatively little variance, the authors adopt a novel power law approach. They studied 22 industries and N = 4,158 CEO-firm combinations for analyses based on Tobin's Q and N = 5,091 for analyses based on return on assets. Regarding compensation, they measured the CEO distribution based on total compensation and three components of CEO total pay: salary, bonus, and value of options exercised. Findings: In total, 86 percent of CEO performance and 91 percent of CEO pay distributions fit a power law better than a normal distribution, indicating that a minority of CEOs are producing top value for their firms (i.e. CEO performance) and a minority of CEOs are appropriating top value for themselves (i.e. CEO pay). But, the authors also found little overlap between CEOs who are the top performers and CEOs who are the top earners. Implications: The findings shed new light on CEO pay deservingness by using a novel conceptual and methodological lens that highlights systematic over and underpayment. Results suggest a violation of distributive justice and offer little support for agency theory's efficient contracting hypothesis, which have important implications for agency theory, equity theory, justice theory, and agent risk sharing and agent risk bearing theories. Practical implications: Results highlight erroneous practices when trying to benchmark CEO pay based on average levels of performance in an industry because the typical approach to CEO compensation based on averages significantly underpays stars and overpays average performers. Originality/value: Results offer new insights on the extent of over and underpayment. The findings uncover an extremely large non-overlap between the top earning and top performing CEOs and to an extent far greater in magnitude than previously suggested.

This paper examines the effects of board composition and monitoring on the credit risk in the UK banking sector. The study finds CEO duality, pay and board independence to have a positive and significant effect on credit risk of the UK banks. However, board size and women on board have a negative and significant influence on credit risk. Further analysis using sub-samples divided into pre-financial crisis, during the financial crisis and post crisis reinforce the robustness of our findings. Overall, the paper sheds light on the effectiveness of the within-firm monitoring arrangement, particularly, the effects of CEO power and board independence on credit risk decisions thereby contributing to the agency theory.

Purpose: Agency theory suggests that divergences will occur when a principal, e.g. client, and agent e.g. a project manager, interests are different in the execution of a project. The purpose of this paper is to explore if the agency theory can explain the subtleties integral to the behaviours and relationships between players delivering a public-private-partnership (PPP) in the context of an international development (ID) project. The intra-/interpersonal dynamics include governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and private commercial service providers. The authors develop a conceptual framework and provide evidence from a case study of the testing of a Road Safety Toolkit in Kenya to explore several propositions. Design/methodology/approach: Extant literature identified application of the agency theory, and the development of a conceptual framework. A case study describing an ID project was used to validate the propositions prior to the expansion of a research instrument for data collection in the field. Findings: Through the lens of the agency theory and the limitations imposed by exploring a series of propositions, several insightful conclusions have been derived from the case. ID projects have particular nuisances that make them unique when compared to the majority of commercial applications. An added dimension and level of complexity is a consequence of the PPP incorporating government, NGOs and private corporations. The case exemplified the need for PPP ID projects to build on partner networks to influence and disseminate outcomes. Some agency problems were far less prominent than would normally be seen in a commercial project. Research limitations/implications: The methodologies presented in this paper need to be adapted and practiced in different kinds of ID projects in order to get confirmatory analytical results. The limitations imposed by the use of the single case, whilst drawing insightful conclusions, would necessitate greater testing in the field. Practical implications: Although the problems of the agency theory are well researched in the operations management literature, there is limited application to ID projects and no previous research within the context of a PPP. Therefore, this work is important for greater understanding of the specific issues associated with project delivery of an ID. Social implications: Conflicting goals between principals and agents are common for organisations, which in turn affect inter-relationships on an international footing. The agency theory has had little attention in the project management field, yet is fundamental to relationships and communication. Originality/value: There has been little research that explores the agency theory in the context of a PPP involving governments, NGOs and private commercial service providers, executed as an ID project. This work, therefore, exhibits new and novel findings. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effects of some corporate governance mechanisms and executive compensation on audit fees in an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach: The study population consists of 540 observations and 90 listed companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange during the years 2009-2014. The statistical model used in this study is a multivariate regression model; besides, the statistical technique used to test the hypotheses proposed in this research is panel data. Findings: The changes in the value of a CEO's own firm stock option portfolio, in thousands of rials (Iran's currency), for a 0.01 change in stock return volatility and stock price are defined as Vega and Delta, respectively. The results demonstrated that there is a positive association between audit fees and delta, but not Vega; this means that a fee premium is linked to CEO Delta incentives. The findings show that Iranian companies pay more audit fees when they give managers more rewards. In addition, the results show that there is not a significant relationship between fees resulting from audit risk and Delta and Vega incentives of the board. Inconsistent with agency theory, the authors found that the independence of board members did not have any effect on audit fees. As a final point, the outcomes of the paper demonstrate that managers who invest in companies under their own management do not have any impact on the amount of audit fee. To put it another way, there is not any significant connection between the board ownership and audit fees. Practical implications: This is one of the most important studies that simultaneously surveys the impacts of corporate governance mechanisms and executive compensation in the Iranian audit market. The results of this study will reveal more than the role of corporate governance mechanisms for society and users of financial statements because as tools on the CEO actions, they always have to pay attention to the implementation of corporate principles in the economic entity' operation. Originality/value: The present study has examined the relationship between two cases of corporate governance mechanisms named the board independence and the board ownership with audit fees in a country where, to the authors' knowledge as in most other developing markets, such a relationship has not been a subject of empirical research. Moreover, the use of a two-dimensional measure of executive compensation, namely, Delta and Vega incentives, primarily considering research undertaken in an emerging market, as a valuable contribution may be observed.

The focus of this article is on public-private partnerships (PPPs). The aim is to both theoretically and empirically illustrate PPP agency problems in four PPP stages, as well as to identify potentially relevant solutions to the agency problems. The study employed a longitudinal case study of one PPP in a municipality in southern Sweden. Through an analysis based on interviews, observations, and documents, the study illustrates a number of agency problems faced by PPPs and highlights the importance of resource allocation, stakeholder management, and the creation of a common identity in reducing these problems.

Motivated by agency theory, we explore the effect of independent directors on corporate risk taking. To minimize endogeneity, we exploit the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as an exogenous shock that raises board independence. Our difference-in-difference estimates show that board independence diminishes risk-taking significantly, as evidenced by the substantially lower volatility in the stock returns. In particular, board independence reduces total risk and idiosyncratic risk by 24.87% and 12.60%, respectively. The evidence is consistent with the notion that board independence represents an effective governance mechanism that prevents managers from taking excessive risk. Additional analysis based on propensity score matching also confirms our results. Our research design is based on a natural experiment and is far more likely to show causality, rather than merely an association. (c) 2017 International Review of Finance Ltd. 2017.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of corporate governance, with particular reference to the role of independent directors on boards and audit committees, and media coverage on corporate transparency and disclosure. In addition, the paper also investigates the role of the media on independent directors' behaviours towards corporate transparency and disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the well-developed two-step system generalised method of moments approach on a sample of 99 Pakistan stock exchange (PSX) listed financial firms over the period 2007-2012. Findings: The empirical analysis shows that media and independent directors on audit committees play a significant positive role in line with agenda setting and agency theories in promoting corporate transparency and disclosure. On the contrary, the boards' independent directors are risk-averse and hold the information to protect their reputation. Nevertheless, the study does not find any significant influence of media coverage on independent directors' behaviours in promoting corporate transparency and disclosure. Practical implications: The findings provide some useful insight into cost benefits analysis of media coverage towards an understanding of independent directors' behaviours for promoting transparency and disclosure in financial sector. Moreover, the study findings can be useful for both shareholders and stakeholders in taking decisions about firm activities. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that proposed and tested a multi-level framework for corporate transparency and disclosure practices. In addition, this study is also among the very few studies that use financial sectors as a sample, in particular, and media coverage, specifically, thus adding some value to the limited literature.

Purpose: Board size is an important dimension of corporate governance. The purpose of this study is to propose and test indirect effects of organization size on organizational performance via board size, in the context of industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study's predictions were tested in 288 medium and large organizations listed on the Australian Securities Exchange using archival data. Findings: The findings of this study suggest the following: organization size is positively associated with board size and this relationship is stronger in manufacturing organizations; board size is positively associated with performance and this relationship is conditional on industry; and organization size has an indirect effect on performance via board size, and this indirect effect is also conditional on industry. Research limitations/implications: The results provide some support for the resource dependency theory, agency theory and contingency theory. Practical implications: The findings suggest that directors should take into account the effects of board size and industry to provide a more precise assessment of the board's performance. Originality/value: It predicts and tests the pioneering moderating effect of industry (manufacturing vs services) on the organization size-board size, board size-organizational performance and organization size-board size-organizational performance relationships.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the direct and indirect effect of the existence of risk management on the relationship between audit committee and corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure in Palestine. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilizes a panel data of 31 Palestinian listed companies from 2010 to 2016. It also utilizes structural equation modeling (SEM) model. Findings: The results of SEM model find a significant positive relationship of the existence of risk management, audit committee meeting and audit committee size with CSR disclosure. However, audit committee financial expertise has a significant negative relationship with CSR disclosure. The results also find a significant relationship of audit committee meeting and audit committee financial expertise with CSR disclosure through the existence of risk management. Practical implications: This study is important to policymakers, accounting professionals and shareholders on the extent to which audit committee related to such committee efficiency in monitoring CSR disclosure. Social implications: This study adds to the existing literature by investigating the direct and indirect effect of the existence of risk management on the relationship between audit committee and CSR disclosure in Palestine as one of the youngest market in region that assists to test the validity of agency theory in a young and small emerging market context.

Purpose: This paper aims to discuss and explore the unique agency issues in Islamic banks which give rise to different agency conflicts exist in Islamic banks as compared to conventional banks. In addition, this paper critically examines agency theory in Islamic banking perspective by incorporating Islamic ethical considerations in the principal-agent setting. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper, and the discussions revolve around the review of literature of which important sources have been cited in a way that demonstrates a reasonable understanding of the topic. It attempts to create a discourse around the inclusion of Islamic ethical system in understanding the governance structure of Islamic banks. Findings: This paper concludes that Islamic ethical system embedded in the Islamic banks business activities shapes Islamic banks into organisations that place higher ethical considerations than conventional banks. Therefore, Islamic banks are likely to have less severe agency problems relative to their conventional counterparts. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalisability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications: As the discourse generated by the paper, it can ultimately enhance the understanding of Islamic governance structure in the perspective of agency issues. Social implications: As the discourse generated by the paper, it can ultimately enhance the understanding of Islamic governance structure in the perspective of agency issues. Originality/value: The paper attempts to bring to attention the important aspect of principal-agent relationship within the Islamic banking structures and explain the role of incorporating Islamic ethical system in enhancing the understanding of the principal-agent relationship.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of corporate governance internal mechanisms on tax disclosure in non-financial firms in Malaysia. Managerial ownership and incentive compensation are used as proxies to reflect corporate governance conduct. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses panel data set to analyse 286 non-financial listed companies on Bursa Malaysia for the years 2010-2012. Tax disclosure was gathered from the financial statements, particularly in the consolidated of tax expenses. Tax disclosure was measured using modified effective tax rate reconciling items. Multivariate statistical analyses were run on the sample data. Findings: This study finds that managerial ownership and incentive compensation do not significantly influence tax disclosure. On the other hand, it is found that there are significant positive associations between each of firm size and industry dummy, and tax disclosure. This means that company-specific characteristics are important factors affecting corporate tax disclosure. Research limitations/implications: This study extends the work of previous studies by suggesting that the signalling theory and the agency theory are the main theories concerned with tax disclosure and corporate governance. The authors add an additional appreciation of the contribution of corporate governance from the interested parties' tax disclosure evaluation in the Malaysian environment. Practical implications: The evidence found by this study has important policy and practical knowledge implications for the authorities, researchers, decisionmakers and firm managers. The findings provide them with some relevant insights on the importance of corporate governance practices from the companies' perspectives and contribute to the discussion of who verifies and deduces from tax disclosure directed by companies. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to examine the influence of the corporate governance internal mechanisms on tax disclosure in a developing nation like Malaysia. Although this paper focuses on a single country, it contributes significantly to the debate about tax disclosure in relation to "comply or explain", as suggested in the Code of Corporate Governance. This study shows that companies are trying to avoid as far as possible disclosing tax-related information. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Social Trading platforms combine the trading functionalities of classical online broker services with the communication and interaction features of social networks. Next to following other users' profiles, a main characteristic of social trading platforms is the possibility to follow other users by automatically copying their trades. By being a technologically based financial intermediary that enables individual profit maximization, social trading platforms constitute a contemporary example of financialization. Our empirical analysis of the behavior of traders on a social trading platform provides new insights on financialization related questions regarding the influence of transparency and interaction in delegated investment environments. The disposition effect is a well-studied behavioral bias of investors and traders. Human investors tend to realize returns of their winning positions too early and let unfavorable positions accumulate losses for too long. We find that on social trading platforms the traders' sensitivity to the disposition effect is influenced by the amount of attention they receive from their followers who invested capital into the traders' strategy. These novel insights propose a link between principal-agent theory and the disposition effect induced by transparency mechanisms. We extend the literature on trader-investor interaction channels in social trading networks. The results obtained in a social network environment are of high relevance for regulators who have a strong focus on customer protection and financial services regulation. They also provide guidelines for platform designers, traders, investors and social trading platform operators. (c) 2016 Association for Information Technology Trust.

When citizens are actively engaged in e-government processes as co-creators it leads to e-government development. Citizen participation in e-government is a recent phenomenon where government is seeking more involvement of citizens through different platforms. Whether citizens' participation through social media platforms leads to e-government development has been a debate in literature. In this research study, the authors investigate whether social media usage influences government's role in e-government development. Power distance between government and citizen also plays a role in deciding the extent of e-participation in e-government. In this study, the authors examine the relationship between social media, power distance, citizen engagement and e-government development. Using customer focus theory and agency theory, this study establishes that e-participation initiative by government acts as a mediator in the relation between social media usage by citizen as well as power distance to e-government development.

We study the agency theory by re-examining the effect of financial leverage on firm value. Moreover, we introduce a contingency variable: firm competitive strategy. To do so, we study non-financial firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2007 through 2013, resulting in 2,438 observations. Using the panel data technique, after controlling for firm-specific characteristics and industry differences, we find that leverage has a positive effect on firm value. Going deeper, we find that this effect is stronger for firms that apply a cost leadership strategy, differentiation strategy, or focused strategy. Copyright (c) 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to set a research agenda so that future conceptual and empirical research can improve the understanding of why CEO pay and CEO performance are decoupled. Design/methodology/approach: The paper compiles and adds to many of the explanations provided by this special issue's nine commentaries regarding why CEO pay and CEO performance are decoupled. These explanations were grouped into two categories: economic (e.g. marginal productivity theory, agency theory and behavioral agency model) and social-institutional-psychological (e.g. CEO individual differences and characteristics and CEO-organization interactions). Moreover, new analyses based on additional data were conducted to examine measurement-related explanations for the observed pay-performance decoupling. Findings: Results based on alternative measures of pay and performance confirmed, once again, the existence of pay-performance decoupling. Research limitations/implications: This paper will stimulate research pitting theoretical explanations against each other to understand their relative validity in different contexts. Practical implications: The paper informs ongoing efforts to link CEO pay to performance. Social implications: The paper also revisits the decoupling of CEO pay and firm performance from a normative and value-based perspective (i.e. regarding whether pay and performance should be related). Originality/value: The paper clarifies that the articles in this special issue largely concluded that CEO pay is decoupled from CEO performance. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the effect of family ownership and board characteristics on Earnings Management (EM) in Jordan. This study combines the explanation provided in Agency Theory (Type II) and Socio-Emotional Wealth Theory (SEW) in order to understand how family firms are motivated for EM practices. This study also investigates the effect of board size, CEO duality and board education on EM practices. Using Modified Jones Model (1991), a sample of 43 Jordanian industrial firms listed in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) with a total of (258) firm-year observations for the period from 2011-2016 reveals a significant positive association between family ownership and EM but no evidence is found to support that board size, CEO duality and board education have an impact on EM decisions.

Employee engagement via corporate social responsibility (CSR) involves conflicts of interest between firms, employees, and political institutions. We examined the international transfer of employees of an airline company as a case study of a CSR strategy based on human resource management. From the dual approach of multiple agency theory and a resource-based perspective, we found that by increasing worker mobility costs, the European Union hindered the firm's CSR strategy of employee engagement. This contrasts with the stated aim of the European Union to promote worker mobility. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

This study examines if the effort of financially linked independent (FLI) directors enable firms to reemerge from bankruptcy, a major organizational crisis. Using a sample of 307 bankrupt U.S. firms with instrumental variables regression methodology, I find that the efforts of these directors are critical for firm reemergence. FLI directors' efforts increase the likelihood of reemergence as well as improve access to financial resources. In contrast, I do not find any evidence that non-FLI directors' efforts are associated with reemergence. I also find that resourceful but uninvolved directors are not helpful for firms trying to navigate their way out of bankruptcy. My study highlights (a) the changing nature of roles played by directors in various lifecycle stages, (b) the greater importance of resource provisioning over monitoring during reemergence, and (c) that efforts of FLI directors, and not others director categories, matter for reemergence. Overall, my study extends research that suggests directors' motivation may cause differential firm outcomes and provides evidence that directors do not always put in their best effort on behalf of their firms. This, I suggest, has profound implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

This chapter reviews prior, so far inconclusive, research on the risk behavior of family firms. On the one hand, scholars assume risk-averse behavior of family firms based on agency theory and wealth concentration arguments. On the other hand, scholars predict that family firms are willing to take substantial financial risks to preserve their SEW. By integrating finance, management, and entrepreneurship literature, we show that different underlying definitions of "risk" are key for a better understanding of family firms' risk behavior and subsequent strategic decisions. We provide a conceptual model, highlight gaps in the existing literature, and propose fruitful areas for further research. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

We investigate if agency theory effectively explains agency conflict in the context of a developing country namely, Pakistan. Utilising data from 26 semi-structured interviews, we found that in Pakistan, there is no variation in risk preferences of principals (minority shareholders) and agents (majority shareholders). We also found that remuneration packages and board independence are not effective tools for governing owner managers in Pakistan. Thus, policy makers must shift their focus from soft internal governance mechanisms of appropriate remuneration and board independence. We propose for a rigorous external audit function, and appointment of independent directors and external audit firms by regulator. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd

CEO compensation in family firms is affected by certain corporate governance characteristics, such as the generational stage of the firm (founder or descendant-controlled firms), the level of family involvement on the board of directors (lone or multiple family members sitting on the board) and the family status of the CEO (family or professional CEO). In this paper, we argue that moderating effects arise among these dimensions of heterogeneity. The results show that in firms owned by descendants, the presence of multiple family members is beneficial in lowering family CEO compensation, while the opposite is true in the presence of the founder. Moreover, within founder and descendant firms, the number of family representatives on the board exerts a strong influence on the compensation of family CEOs, whereas it does not affect the compensation of professional CEOs. The results also show that in certain family clusters, CEO compensation is higher than in nonfamily firms, thereby emphasizing that when comparing CEO compensation in family and nonfamily firms, it is important to consider the intersections among the heterogeneity dimensions of the governance of family firms. The findings of the paper contribute to the literature on the governance of family firms by showing that certain family firm types are more effective than others in keeping CEO compensation under control.

Family involvement in corporate governance through ownership, management, and board membership presents a unique dilemma for understanding the strategic impetus and costs of entrenchment decisions. The presence of shared family ties and the family-centered goals of firm principals call to question the applicability of extant agency arguments regarding the nature and antecedents of managerial entrenchment. Exploring this, we develop and test a model of family firm-specific determinants (i.e., family ownership and family's involvement in management and governance) of entrenchment in publicly traded firms by drawing upon principal-principal agency theory. Findings of the empirical analysis of family owned S&P 500 firms suggest family firms are motivated to entrench managers when doing so supports the pursuit of family-centric goals. However, the extent to which entrenchment supports such goals varies at different levels of family ownership. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the doer effect of service failure (SF), good prior experience (GPE) and recovery on overall customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions for multi-agents in tourism service supply chain (TSSC). It specifically focuses on internal and external failure and recovery. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a 2x2x3 between-subjects experimental design with 12 diverse scenarios. It aims to examine the main effects of GPE and the interaction effects of SF and recovery on overall customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions. Findings: The main findings show that consumers do not show favorable behavioral outcomes when they have GPE with an affiliated party. Results of the experiments demonstrate that for hotels, there is no interaction effect between failure and recovery regarding overall customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions; however, for travel agencies, an interaction effect has been found. This indicates that an internal failure (by travel agency) should be recovered internally to increase the behavioral outcomes for travel agency. However, if there is an external failure (by hotel) then the essential thing is providing a recovery. Originality/value: Although the service literature covers failure and recovery in diverse contexts, these concepts are rarely studied from a multi-agent perspective in the service supply chain literature. In such a chain, a failure by a different party may remain unresolved, and this may create a positive effect on another party, if they provide recovery for the failure. This means that the doer of the failure and/or recovery (the party responsible from the failure and/or recovery) may have an impact on behavioral outcomes. However, previous literature has neglected to focus on the important issue of which entity/party performs the failure and/or recovery, and the effect on behavioral outcomes. By focusing on a principal-agent relationship in a TSSC, the study aims to address this research gap. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study illustrates how control-ownership wedge impacts the monitoring role of the corporate board through the quality of audit services in Turkey. Turkey has made essential amendments in the field of external audit in order to enhance the quality of the financial report and integrate its own capital market with that of the EU. It would be of interest to examine the influence of these changes on clients' demand for high quality audit. The agency theory is integrated with the resource dependence theory to show that boards possess distinct incentives and ability to demand high quality audit to monitor management activities. Logistic regression and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) were used for regression estimations. The results indicate that board demographics, cognitive and structural diversity of board of directors, audit committee characteristics and audit quality are complementary and control-ownership wedge weakens the relationship between them which is an unfavorable outcome for minority shareholders. Thus, this study proposes that regulators should increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance in Turkey to accommodate the unique features of wedge firms and provide a protected environment for minority shareholders.

This study investigates the relationship between agency costs and ownership structure for a sample of listed Italian companies to determine the impact of shareholder coalitions on agency costs. Using a balanced panel dataset of 1956 firm-year observations for the period 2002-2013, the results provide evidence that ownership concentration and debt play a limited role in monitoring agency costs, whereas the type of shareholder plays an important role in either mitigating or exacerbating agency costs. Family-controlled firms and coalitions among non-controlling shareholders seem helpful in reducing agency costs. The results suggest that coalitions among non-controlling shareholders both in family and non-family firms reduce agency costs. The findings also indicate that multiple blockholders play a key role as mediators. The paper provides a new perspective on assessing the role of agency costs in a bank-based, civil law country. The results enable one to better understand the impact of blockholders on agency costs and their interactions within family-controlled firms. The results also provide support for both the entrenchment effect and the alignment-of-interests hypothesis. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: This study aims to identify the factors that lead non-financial companies listed in the UK to use an internal audit function (IAF) as a monitoring mechanism. Although the use of an IAF in the UK is voluntary, no prior research has examined the drivers for using one. Design/methodology/approach: Financial and non-financial data were collected from the annual reports of 332 UK non-financial companies listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) Main Market. Univariate tests and multivariate logistic regression tests were used to test the research hypotheses. A theoretical framework based on both agency theory and transaction cost economics (TCE) theory was used to explain the economic factors affecting the use of an IAF. Findings: The study provides evidence that firm size, level of internal risks, agency problem between owners and managers and existence of an effective audit committee are associated with the existence of an IAF. Thus, the need to have strong internal control and risk management systems and to reduce both internal and external agency costs drives companies to have an IAF. These results suggest the importance of IAF as an internal corporate governance tool and the effectiveness of UK governance regulations in monitoring the effectiveness of internal control systems. Practical implications: Given the importance of the IAF's corporate governance role, the study provides some policy implications. Regulators should pay more attention to the issue of maintaining an IAF, especially by large companies, the relationship between the IAF and other governance parties, especially the audit committee, and the disclosure of more relevant information about the IAF's characteristics and practices. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the factors affecting the existence of the IAF within the UK's distinctive regulatory approach of "comply or disclose reasons". Furthermore, it provides a theoretical framework that explains how both the agency theory and TCE theory can interpret the adoption of internal audit.

This article analyses the relationship between CEO succession events and German firms' internationalization processes, which is represented by the degree of internationalization (DOI) growth and internationalization rhythm. Based on a theoretical framework combining elements of agency theory, institutionalism and upper echelons approach, we propose a longitudinal model to examine the relationships of both process variables with the number of CEO changes and succession type (internal vs. external succession), respectively. The results of our study of 102 German firms over 23 years (1990-2012) show an inverted U-shaped impact (no impact) of the number of CEO changes (succession type) on the DOI growth and a positive (negative) monotonic effect on the rhythm of internationalization.

Drawing from agency theory and the attention-based view of the firm, this study extends the understanding of the conditions under which CEO duality is negatively associated with board monitoring in a privately held firm context. Measuring monitoring in terms of board members' involvement in behavioral control, output control, and strategy control tasks (Huse), results show that CEO duality is significantly and negatively related only to the behavioral control task. In addition, we show that this negative effect is contingent on whether ownership is concentrated in the hands of a controlling shareholder as well as the type of controlling shareholder.

The managerial ownership and its impact on financial decisions such as cash holding, and capital structure have been the subject of debate of corporate governance literature. The main objective of this study is to investigate the impact managerial ownership places on financing and cash holding decisions. In addition to that, the currents study is also offering an interesting insight on the issue of simultaneity of financing and cash holding decisions and also will discuss that how the interdependence changes as the level of managerial ownership changes. This study examines the data of 60 companies listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange over the period from 2013 to 2017. To trace the endogeneity, we have employed the Wu Hausman test. It evident from the results that the p-value of both models is significant, which confirms the endogeneity between cash holdings and capital structure decisions. In both models, the managerial the leverage and cash holdings are in positive relation. The MO appears in a non-linear relationship with both cash holding and capital structure decisions of textile firms. The results of the study are also providing support to agency theory, pecking order theory and signaling theory. (c) 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact that PhD scientists serving on the board of directors of firms conducting hard science have on the R&D-based innovative performance of the firm. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are built upon extant theory, and they are tested using two-stage least squared regression that control for the endogenous nature of board composition. Results are robust to alternative specifications. Findings: This analysis shows that firms with higher numbers of PhD scientists on the board generate superior innovative output and more efficient monitoring; PhD board members with denser professional networks are more valuable as board members. Practical implications: This paper provides practical advice to innovative firms on how to create a governance process that simultaneously improves monitoring and boosts the innovative performance. Originality/value: This study is the first one to suggest that innovative firms can improve R&D monitoring and boost innovative output at the same time, and the first to investigate the role that PhD scientists can serve on the board of firms engaging in hard science.

This article fills a technical-scientific gap that currently exists in the Brazilian literature on corporative fraud, by combining the theoretical framework of agency theory, of criminology, and of the economics of crime. In addition, it focuses on a sector that is usually excluded from analyses due to its specific characteristics and shows the application of multinomial logit panel data regression with random effects, which is rarely used in studies in the area of accounting. The aim of this study is to investigate the occurrence of corporative fraud, as well as cases of fraud in Brazilian banking institutions, by using detection variables related to the Cressey fraud triangle. Research into fraud and methods of detecting fraud has grown in management literature, especially affer the occurrence of various corporative scandals in the 1990s. Although regulatory agencies have increased their investments in monitoring and control, fraud investigations and convictions are still common in the day-to-day administration of banks, as can be seen in the Brazilian Central Bank and the National Financial System Resource Council's databases of punitive proceedings. We believe that this article will have a positive impact in the area of accounting sciences, since it involves corporative fraud in a multidisciplinary form and because it provides the incentive to use a quantitative tool that can help increase the development of similar studies in the area. This study tested the theory that the dimensions of the fraud triangle condition the occurrence of corporative fraud in Brazilian banking institutions. Thirtytwo representative variables of corporative fraud were identified in the theoretical-empirical review, which were reduced to seven latent variables by the principal component analysis. Finally, the seven factors formed the independent variables in the multinomial logit models used in the hypothesis tests, which presented promising results.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the relationship between board composition and firm corporate social responsibility (CSR) scores of the top 30 listed companies in Australia, France, UK and USA. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 120 publicly listed companies covering a 10-year period from 2006 to 2015, the authors examine this relationship in a dynamic modelling framework, which controls for potential sources of endogeneity. Findings: The authors find that board composition appears to have no effect on large firms' CSR scores. This finding remains robust when they used out-of-sample analysis and is consistent with the perspectives of agency theory stakeholder theory and institutional theory. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it fills an important gap in literature on CSR and corporate governance, as less is known about how board composition affects social activities. Second, this study controls endogeneity and sample selection bias which are main econometric problems in CG and CSR studies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

For decades, the economic theory of the firm referred to as agency theory has dominated business research and education in the United States. Although agency theory has been influential in accounting, finance, and managerial economics, it lacks informal and nonfinancial controls. Douglas E. Stevens resolves to enhance this theory through the incorporation of social norms. Drawing on historical context related to the firm, the theory of the firm, and social norm theory related to the firm, he demonstrates the importance of social norms in the formation and development of free-market capitalism and the firm. He also describes the latest theoretical, experimental, and archival evidence to exhibit the growing body of research that incorporates social norms into the theory of the firm. These foundations enable Stevens to create a comprehensive roadmap of agency theory that will have strong implications for practice and public policy. (c) Douglas E. Stevens 2019.

We study the organizational impact of internal control systems, by examining 1,593 firms with 15,606 executives over 2002-2010. We find that internal control systems explain a significant amount of executive and, in particular, CFO compensation, after controlling for other governance, executive personal characteristics, firm, and macroeconomic determinants of pay. Moreover, the negative relationship between pay and internal control systems suggests that executives operating in firms with ineffective internal control systems earn greater compensation. The results of the longitudinal analysis suggest that firms with ineffective internal control systems have greater agency problems and, consequently, greater levels of executive compensation. The CEO pay shows a nonsignificant relationship with internal control systems. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Background: The executive directors of a company are the agents of the shareholders and should manage the company in the best interest of the shareholders, not only for personal gain. It is therefore important for companies to ensure that they implement remuneration policies which will result in motivated employees who will execute decisions and actions which are in the best interest of the shareholders. However, it is widely acknowledged that the relationship between company performance and executive remuneration is weak. This implies that executives are still rewarded excessive remuneration regardless of the performance of their companies. Aim: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a relationship exists between the performance-based remuneration of executive directors and the financial performance of South African companies. Setting: The study was conducted in South Africa, specifically on companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Methods: The study design was quantitative and made use of a Pearson correlation and generalised least squares regression with bootstrapping at a 95% confidence interval to analyse the relationship between executive director remuneration and the financial performance of 42 companies in the consumer goods and services industry of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) from 2006 to 2015. Results: The study established that the remuneration policies in place for South African executive directors within the consumer goods and services industry seem to be affected by the share price of the company. Conclusion: In the South African environment, executive director remuneration is thus not directly related to profitability or company size, as was the case in some earlier studies. The link between executive director remuneration and share performance may be an indication that remuneration policies are based on the share price and are thus directly connected to the principle of shareholder wealth maximisation.

This paper investigates the influence of corporate governance on the performance of modern Chinese firms. Prior studies were inconclusive about the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. Little research investigates the performance implications of board structure in the post-institutional-transition era in China. Based on agency and resource dependence theories, this paper examines the impacts of board composition and leadership structure on the performance of Chinese manufacturing firms that went public on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges in 2010. The findings show that separating the posts of CEO and chair promotes better performance. However, appointing a larger proportion of outside independent directors to the board insignificantly affects performance. This research provides partial support for agency theory and extended insights into corporate governance in emerging economy firms. Copyright (c) 2017 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The authors propose and empirically test a causal model to understand how the availability of fair-trade information and consumer knowledge about this issue affect consumers' attitudes and intentions toward fair-trade products. The model is built upon the attitude-behavior paradigm and the premises of agency theory. It is tested through structural equation modeling with a sample of 292 Spanish consumers. The findings are that consumers do not have good knowledge about fair trade and that this is significantly determined by the lack of information about this in the market. It is also observed that consumers' perceptions about the availability of fair-trade information have negative effects on their concern about this issue and that such information as is available is not effective in reducing consumer skepticism. The research represents an extension of previous fair-trade literature because the role of information and communication in improving consumer attitudes and buying intentions has rarely been explored in the case of ethical products.

Background: There is a growing need for hospital supervisory boards to support hospital management in different areas, including (financial) monitoring, resource provision, stakeholder relationships, and strategic decision-making. Little is currently known about how boards' emphases on these various governance objectives contribute to performance. Purpose: Using a dominant logics perspective, this article aims to detect the governance logics that hospital boards emphasize, to determine whether there are distinct clusters of hospitals with the same sets of emphases, and to show how cluster membership relates to board characteristics and financial performance. Methodology: Using factor analysis, we identify latent classes of governance objectives and use hierarchical cluster analysis to detect distinct clusters with varying emphasis on the classes. We then use multinomial regression to explore the associations between cluster membership and board characteristics (size, gender diversity, and occupational diversity) and examine the associations between clusters and financial performance using OLS regression. Results: Classes of objectives reflecting three governance theories - agency theory, stewardship theory, and stakeholder theory - can be distinguished, and hospitals can be divided into four clusters based on their board's relative emphasis on the classes. Cluster membership is significantly associated with board characteristics. There is also a significant association between cluster membership and hospital financial performance, with two of three groups performing significantly better than the reference group. Conclusion: High performance in hospitals can be the result of governance logics, which, compared to simple board characteristics, are associated with better financial outcomes. Practice implications: Hospitals can influence the emphasis placed on different governance objectives and enhance organizational success by creating boards that are small enough to be effective yet diverse enough to profit from a wide variety of expertise and experience.

In a study of life science firms, we find that, in accordance with predictions drawn from agency theory and behavioral agency theory, CEO stock ownership is negatively associated with licensing while CEO stock options are positively associated with licensing. Furthermore, by combining theoretical insights from the capabilities literature with both agency theory and behavioral agency theory, we predict that a key measure of capabilities in the licensing context--a firm's alliance experience--significantly influences the ways in which CEO equity incentives impact licensing. More specifically, we find that, in accordance with our theoretical predictions, alliance experience positively (negatively) moderates the relationship between CEO stock ownership (CEO stock options) and licensing. Our study contributes to the wider literature on the determinants of licensing by examining whether licensing is sensitive to CEO equity incentives. We also extend the capabilities literature on licensing by examining the contrasting influences of a firm's alliance experience on the relationship between CEO equity incentives and licensing. Our findings also inform behavioral agency-based research on the effects of equity incentives by highlighting the usefulness of a capabilities perspective in augmenting our understanding of the behavioral role of CEO equity incentives.

Purpose: Based on the findings of Aguinis et al. (2018) that only a few executives are properly compensated, the purpose of this paper is to examine potential causes and consequences of CEO overpayment and underpayment. Ineffective compensation of the CEO represents a governance failure by the board of directors. Better understanding the reasons for such failures may help boards to correct their processes and to enact more effective governance. Boards must look beyond the normally constrained focus of agency theory to examine executive characteristics and motivation. Thus, tailoring compensation plans and governance to the executive and organizational context requires attention to a broader set of theoretical notions. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Aguinis et al. (2018) work, this paper conceptually identifies and explains the causes and consequences of CEO overpayment and underpayment along with their implications for governance and future research. Findings: This paper identifies potential reasons for CEO overpayment and underpayment. For example, in addition to poor hiring decisions and inadequately designed compensation plans, CEO overpayment can occur because of executive hubris and greed. Alternatively, CEO underpayment may occur because of a poorly designed plan, inadequate information about the external labor market and the executive's interests in non-pecuniary benefits (e.g. socio-emotional wealth, altruism). Without proper monitoring and oversight by the board, firm performance commonly suffers. Originality/value: This work extends our understanding of why CEOs may be overpaid (e.g. hubris, greed) and why some executives may accept underpayment (e.g. desire for non-pecuniary benefits from SEW or altruism). This paper explains the consequences of ineffective corporate governance practices that allow inefficient CEO compensation. Finally, this paper explores several contingencies that can affect the governance practices and research needed to enhance our knowledge of this important area. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) exhibit a wide variety of ownership structures but most are entrepreneurially controlled by founders or families. We investigate the relation between REIT ownership/control and REIT valuation. Using proxy data from 1994 through 2007, our analysis shows that, consistent with the incentive alignment prediction of agency theory, founder/family REITs, on average, have a higher valuation than non-founder/ non-family REITs. This result is driven by first-generation family and lone-founder REITs. Our results are also consistent with the entrenchment prediction of agency theory: limits on private benefits of control could lead to higher REIT valuation when founders/families do not occupy both board chairman and CEO positions.

Relying on two years' observations of 74 United Arab Emirates (UAE) listed firms, we examined the association between governance mechanisms (board size, audit committee, percentage of independent non-executive directors, external auditor, firm leverage and product market competition) and agency costs while controlling for firm size and industry type. We also utilised four different proxies to measure agency costs (asset utilisation, audit fees, expenses ratio and free cash flow measures) to test whether the effect of product market competition on agency costs is substitutive or complementary to internal governance mechanisms. The results show that the percentage of independent non-executive directors and type of external audit significantly influence proxies of agency costs when product market competition is factored out. However, this effect disappears when regressions include product market competition, suggesting that the competitive position of a firm has a substitutive effect to internal governance mechanisms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the impact of ownership structure on firm valuation and performance across different geographical regions within mainland China. Design/methodology/approach: The authors classify China in six geographical regions and use cross-sectional data of companies with A-shares listed on domestic stock exchanges in China for the year-end 2015. Using data from CSMAR and Wind database, they use multivariate regression technique and analytically compare the consistency of relationship between operational variables of ownership structure with corporate performance and evaluation. Findings: The authors find that institutional ownership and state ownership negatively affect market valuation throughout various geographical regions of China. Further, in East, Northwest, South Central and Southwestern parts of China, managerial ownership and concentration of shareholding among top ten shareholders positively influence return on equity (ROE). Interestingly, institutional shareholding negatively affects return on assets (ROA), while institutional ownership has a neutral effect on profitability margin in Northeast China. Although in northern part of China, this relationship is slightly positive. In East China region, state ownership and ownership concentration are directly proportional to profitability margin. Practical implications: As some of the findings exhibit weak state of market efficiency in some regions, the study may also be useful in identifying arbitrage opportunities across different regions. Moreover, this study suggests that regions with the same business environment and conditions anywhere around the globe invite same or similar ownership structure for better firm performance and valuation. Originality/value: The study provides unique understanding of relationship between ownership structure, market valuation and firm performance in various parts of China and will be an addition to the relevant literature. Given a change in company's ownership structure and considering its region of incorporation, this study will help investment analysts in assessing performance and market valuation of the firm.

Boards sometimes cut a CEO's pay following poor performance. This study examines whether such CEO paycuts really work. We identify 1,496 instances of large CEO paycuts during the period 1994-2013. We then create a propensity-score-matched control group of firms that did not cut their CEOs' pay and employ a difference-in-differences approach to examine the consequences of paycuts. Our results show that, following a paycut, CEOs are likely to engage in earnings management in an attempt to accelerate improvement in the reported performance and to achieve a speedier restoration of their pay to pre-cut levels. Further, we find that improvement in long-term performance after a paycut occurs only for those firms with lower levels of earnings management after the paycut. Finally, we show that paycuts are more likely to lead to unintended value-destroying consequences in the absence of high institutional ownership or when the CEO is sufficiently entrenched, thereby impairing the effectiveness of internal monitoring by boards.

Drawing upon the resource-based view and agency theory, this study examines the effects of human resource management and the innovative capabilities of nonfamily members on the performance of family businesses. The results show that training and innovative capabilities influence performance, while strategic planning strengthens the relationship between human resource policies and performance. Moreover, family businesses with weak governance practices can initially benefit from innovation, but they must enhance their governance to sustain growth in performance. Family businesses should focus on the selection and training of nonfamily members to increase their innovative capabilities and enhance their performance. (c) 2018, (c) 2018 Taylor & Francis.

Debt-ridden corporate growth and increased vulnerability was one of the causes of the 1997 financial crisis in Korea. Introduction of the outside director system has been the core part of the board reforms following the crisis. Our estimation using instruments obtained from a natural experiment illustrates that outside monitoring has (i) improved capital structure of firms even when we control for the leverage regulation effect, (ii) enhanced compliance with leverage regulation and thus reduced business risks, and (iii) reduced excessive growth and excessive investment more consistently for the top 10 largest chaebols than non-chaebol firms and smaller sized chaebol affiliates. Our results shed some light on why existing studies report the positive effect of outsiders on firm value and add value to existing agency theory by illustrating that the effect of improved governance on capital structure could be non-linear.

This article aims at studying the influence of boardroom attributes on access to leverage in the French context. The empirical findings lead to several interesting results. They reveal a negative relation between the number of female directors on the board and the total and long-term leverage ratios. Due likely to the risk aversion of women, firms with more gender-diverse boards appear to use less levels of debt. This is consistent with the pecking order theory. The results also show that the size of the board, the frequency of its meetings and the average age of its independent directors positively affect the leverage ratios. They are coherent with the disciplinary role of the board stipulated by the agency theory. (c) 2018.

The chief information officer (CIO) is responsible for bridging the gap between two critical domains--technology and business, making the CIO's job uniquely different from other executives. As digital technologies become increasingly important to firms' competitive success, boards of directors and senior executives seek to align the CIO role with overall firm's objectives. Agency theory suggests that one way to create the alignment between an executive's efforts and firm performance is to implement appropriate equity compensation incentives (i.e., those resulting from stock and stock options) tying the executive's wealth to firm value. To date, research does not address what factors a firm should consider when designing CIO incentives and how these incentives influence firm performance. To address this major gap, we examine both the antecedents and performance consequences of CIO equity incentives. We assess organizational, environmental, and individual factors that influence CIO equity incentives and find that environmental and organizational factors are more important than individual CIO characteristics in the determination of CIO equity incentives. We also find that firms that create higher CIO equity incentives realize greater subsequent accounting and market performance. Our research contributes to the IT personnel literature by showing how firms can use compensation policies to leverage the CIO role to enhance overall business performance. (c) 2018

Prior agency-theory research has presented conflicting findings regarding the importance of board monitoring in motivating R&D. We reinvestigate this literature by examining the value monitoring exerts in abating both the agency costs of underinvestment and overinvestment in R&D. We argue that monitoring that relies on board independence has both benefits and costs associated with promoting R&D. While we assert that intense monitoring by the board heightens underinvestment in the US context, it can also provide discipline over a firms free cash flows. We test our theory using a longitudinal panel data set consisting of a cross-section of S&P 1500 US-firms between 1997 and 2007. On average our study finds inside directors increase overinvestment in R&D, but facilitate better resource allocation when a firm has rich growth opportunities. Also, while too much emphasis on outside directors heightens underinvestment in R&D, a more independent board encourages better resource allocation when firms have high free cash flows that need to be paid back to owners. Thus, our results suggest a more inclusive perspective of agency-theory can help managers make better R&D investment decisions. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Our study investigates whether agency costs arising from organizational structure in terms of the number of investment layers which connect the parent firm and its lowest-tiered subsidiaries within the corporate pyramid are associated with the value of cash holdings. Using a sample of Taiwanese publicly traded firms, we find that a change of a dollar in cash holdings is associated with less than a dollar change in market value. In line with our expectation, we find that the marginal value of cash decreases with the number of investment layers, supporting the agency theory of excess cash holdings. We also find that the negative association between the number of layers and the value of cash holdings is stronger for firms with high deviation between cash flow and voting rights and for family-controlled firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether real estate companies manipulate their earnings through the brokerage fee across ownership expropriation or not. Design/methodology/approach: This study considers Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange listed real estate firms to investigate how the brokerage fee in the real estate industry might affect the earnings management of firms across its ownership expropriation. Using annual report data, the authors investigate the associations over a panel for the period 2008-2012. Robust panel regression is used to divulge the probability values with reference by probit regression. Findings: Overall, the results show that high brokerage fees would drive more events of earnings management and that, generally, the ownership concentration among Malaysian real estate firms significantly affects the earnings management of the firms. Practical implications: This study shows that firm profitability and brokerage fees enhance the probability of firm's earnings management. A low brokerage fee would reflect low revenue to the company. Therefore, management would opt to manipulate earnings in order to overstate earnings, which garners more interest from investors. Originality/value: Real estate values in Malaysia have climbed steadily over the years due to a combination of reasons giving companies a higher brokerage fee. Earnings management has become a big issue for property investors. The study demonstrates the relationship between earnings management and brokerage fee across ownership expropriation which can be considered by shareholders in their own strategic planning and investors in their own investing.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between monitoring mechanisms namely, board and audit committee effectiveness, foreign and domestic institutional ownership and competition with voluntary disclosure of intellectual capital (IC) among listed banks in the Gulf Co-Operation Council (GCC) region. The content analysis was used to analyse IC disclosures of 137 listed GCC banks. A regression model is utilized to analyze the data. The results suggest that the monitoring mechanisms have significant relationship with the quantity of IC information disclosed. The findings contribute to support agency theory by indicating that corporate governance mechanisms and corporate voluntary disclosure can be used strategically by considering the mechanisms as a bundle since they work complimentary to reduce agency conflicts. In addition, the finding also suggests that foreign institutional ownership have more monitoring capacities than domestic institutional investors in relation to IC disclosure.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the contrasting moderating effect of a firm's exploration on the relationship between the two types of long-term incentives (stock options/stock ownership) for the chief executive officers and a firm's long-term performance. Even though the two types of incentives are designed to improve long-term performance, the degrees of impact on long-term performance differ. Based on behavioral agency theory, this study theoretically and empirically examines the role of a firm's exploration on the above relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study used three archival sources to obtain data on stock options, stock ownership, patents and exploration, financial measures, and others. Based on a sample of 1,963 firms in various industries from 1995 to 2006, this study tested the moderating effect of a firm's exploration on the relationship between stock options/ownership and a firm's performance. Findings: This study reveals the contrasting moderating effect of a firm's exploration on the relationship between stock options/ownership and a firm's long-term performance: a positive moderating effect on the relationship between stock options and performance and a negative moderating effect on the relationship between stock ownership and performance. In addition, empirical evidence was added on the inverted U-shaped relationship between stock ownership and a firm's long-term performance. Originality/value: There is little research on a firm's internal characteristics that strengthen or weaken the effects of stock options and stock ownership on firm performance. This study demonstrates the differential moderating effects of exploration on the relationship between stock options/stock ownership and long-term performance. Such effects of exploration come from the different risk features of stock options and stock ownership. The key implication is that stock options could be more effective than stock ownership to enhance a firm's long-term performance when a firm has a strong exploration orientation.

This paper explores the Shareholder Value (SHV) ideology as a social construction process marked by a reorganization of the business Management discourse as of the 1970s, after the institutionalization of the Agency Theory formulations. Such social construction can be explained according to the Bourdieusian notion of an organizational field portrayed in terms of a social subsystem, structured under diverse forms of capital, handled by each actor present in the organizational field construction here identified. These actors' engagement to the SHV field construction legitimized a new set of shared values and beliefs, materialized within Value Based Management (VBM) as of the 1990s, celebrating a new way of perception, experience, and acting in firms under such an ideology. Therefore, despite the anti-managerial impulse of the SHV ideology, as of the 2000s, a new social arrangement within the organizational field revealed the emergence of the Celebrity CEO, whose performativity of managerial actions simultaneously unveils the potential of the Management field to reinvent, as well as the symbolism associated with the SHV ideology.

Different institutional features have been found to affect capital structure decisions, but their connections to corporate finance theories are not always clear. This study aims to assess the predictive power of the agency and pecking order theories in two distinct information environments. The strategy is to compare two similar groups of property firms listed on the Mainland and Hong Kong stock exchanges respectively. Both groups operate in the Mainland property market and are subject to the same tax code, but the degrees of transparency and integrity of the stock markets are weaker for the Mainland-listed firms. We find that factors related to agency conflicts and information asymmetries exert a stronger influence on the capital structure decisions of Mainland-listed firms than on those of the Hong Kong-listed firms. This is confirmed by a test of the agency theory using such corporate governance factors as managerial shareholding and shareholding concentration and by a test of the pecking order theory using an error correction model. A further test on the increments of R-squared in the regression models shows that variables derived from the two theories better explain the variations of the capital structure of Mainland-listed firms than those of Hong Kong-listed firms.

Drawing on agency theory, we explore how 30 employees defined ownership effectiveness in a 100 % employee-owned Canadian-based firm. Using a qualitative case-study, remarkable similarities were found in the factors employees themselves believed contributed most to ownership effectiveness. Despite differences in job roles, employees emphasized confidence in the ownership program, participative decision-making, ownership identity, and their organization as a family unit. In light of these findings, we discuss how a broader conceptualization of employee ownership effectiveness can be applied for a more comprehensive understanding of how such programs may develop and manifest.

Announcements of open market repurchase programmes have recently become common not only in the United States but also in many other, less developed countries. The aim of the paper is to examine the market reaction to share repurchase announcements and to investigate the reasons for the market reaction. There is a good deal of research referring to the share repurchases, even in Poland, the originality of our approach is that we conducted our research on an alternative system of trading to the Warsaw Stock of Exchange, namely NewConnect. NewConnect is dedicated to young, small and innovative companies. We found it extremely interesting that such companies in need of external financing take the decision to distribute cash and implement share repurchase. The data was collected for 64 share repurchase announcements over the period 2007-2016. In this study cumulative average abnormal returns are applied to identify the market reaction. To investigate the factors which drive investor behaviour we applied the regressions model. We employed some explanatory variables describing the agency theory and signalling hypotheses: relative payout, market to book ratio, operational cash fl ow, and debt ratio. We found that cumulative average abnormal returns around the share repurchase date are significant at standard levels of confidence in all the analysed event windows. The results of the multivariate and univariate regression analyses do not support the undervaluation hypothesis, as we expected. (c) 2018, Technical University of Liberec. All rights reserved.

Purpose: While investment decisions may be financial decisions, there is a growing recognition that they are also often non-financially based decisions. The purpose of this study is to report findings focused on the project selection stage of capital budgeting, which has the objectives of exploring for: the relative degree of emphasis decision makers attach to a financial and non-financial orientation in capital budgeting; and the role, if any, that two agency theory variables have on the relative degree of emphasis: a personal incentive for project go-ahead and monitoring of project outcomes through a post-audit. Design/methodology/approach: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are used and framed in a between-subjects 2 (personal incentive) x 2 (monitoring) design. DCEs are well-suited to research questions which examine some tension between competing alternatives. For example, trade-offs involving the relative degree of emphasis decision makers attach to a financial and non-financial orientation in capital budgeting. Findings: In the absence of a personal incentive and monitoring, decision makers attach a significant degree of emphasis to cash inflows and cash outflows, both financial factors, and one strategic non-financial factor being improvement in the position of the firm vis-a-vis competitors in capital budgeting. However, when decision makers receive a personal incentive from project go-ahead, they attach a lower degree of emphasis to cash outflows. Alternatively, when there is monitoring through a post-audit and a personal incentive, decision makers attach a higher degree of emphasis to cash outflows. Practical implications: Decision makers attach a significant degree of emphasis to only a relatively narrow band of attributes in making a capital budgeting decision, which is true in both the absence of and in the presence of the agency conditions. There is also little support for the view that there is any higher degree of emphasis attached to a financial orientation vis-a-vis a non-financial orientation. A particularly important finding relates to the overarching goal of monitoring through a post-audit. One view is that it should foster more accurate forecasting by making forecasters aware that their efforts will be reviewed. However, the findings of this study appear to be more supportive of a view that post-audits might lead agents to become more conservative or even shy away from projects. Originality/value: The study makes contributions to the growing field of research which has the objective of exploring for the relative degree of emphasis decision makers attach to a financial and non-financial orientation in capital budgeting. In particular, it extends the prior research through its investigation of the role that two agency theory variables play in the relative degree of emphasis decision makers attach to a financial and non-financial orientation: a personal incentive for project go-ahead and monitoring of project outcomes through a post-audit.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the effect of French family control on the cash flow sensitivity of cash (CFSC). It also investigates the moderating effect of board of directors' features on this relation. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of French-listed companies from 2012 to 2014, the authors use GLS regression models on panel data estimated with robust standard errors, clustered at the firm level. Findings: The results show that family control is positively associated with the CFSC. This finding suggests that families are likely to hold more cash out of their cash flows for entrenchment and expropriation purposes. A further analysis shows that board size, independence and the two-tier board structure negatively affect the CFSC in family firms. Board efficiency is then a guarantee of minority shareholders' interests against family expropriation risks in France. Research limitations/implications: These findings suggest that French family firms are likely to expropriate minority interests by extracting rents through their cash holding behavior. However, in the presence of high-quality board features, the relation turns negative, suggesting that the quality of the board is an efficient corporate governance device that is likely to monitor family corporate decisions. Originality/value: This paper extends previous research by investigating the moderating effect of board features on the relation between family control and the CFSC. The research provides a metric for agency problems that is the sensitivity of cash to cash flows and offers theoretical support for the agency argument of hoarding cash.

The paper is written as an empirical test on the indirect effect of Commissioner Board Monitoring on firm performance through environmental performance as mediation variable. Research sample is non-financial firms that participate into Performance Assessment Program (PROPER) and that also list at Indonesian Stock Exchange. Commissioner Board Monitoring consists of few attributes such as: Commissioner Board Size, Independent Commissioner Board, and Commissioner Board's Frequency of Meeting. Environmental performance is measured with the use of PROPER by the Ministry of Life Environment and Forestry for Indonesian Republic. Firm performance is proxied with Return on Asset (ROA) and Tobin's Q. Research gains some results. Commissioner Board Monitoring has a positive effect on both environmental performance and firm performance. Environmental performance has a positive effect on firm performance. Commissioner Board Size has an indirect effect on firm performance through environmental performance. All these findings support agency theory and stakeholder theory. Any firms attempting to maximize performance shall balance the interest of shareholder (firm owner) and stakeholder. (c) 2018, ASERS Publishing. All rights reserved.

This paper examines the determinants of base pay and total incentive compensation packages of CEOs of biopharmaceutical firms that have recently gone public, and whether human capital and agency factors affect the market's response to the initial public offering. We find that in terms of net proceeds, the IPO market appears to reward the firms that have founder-CEOs and CEOs with higher incentive compensation. CEOs with prior venture capital experience are associated with receiving higher incentive compensation, while CEOs with a greater ownership interest in the firm receive lower incentive compensation but higher salaries. CEOs of firms with a greater percentage of insiders are associated with lower salaries. The results should add to our understanding related to human capital and agency theories, as well as help firms and investors better understand and structure CEO compensation.

Leveraged buyouts (LBOs) are corporate restructuring transactions involving the transfer of whole companies or company divisions to new owners. This chapter reviews the agency and entrepreneurship perspectives of LBOs and outlines arguments concerning their impact on jobs and wages. The seminal work of Jensen provides an agency theory perspective through which LBOs have traditionally been understood. The entrepreneurial perspective is the impact of the LBO governance structure and the role that private equity (PE) firms play in their interaction with portfolio firms. While the theoretical perspectives provide an academic framework for understanding the impact of LBOs on jobs and wages, the nature of the PE business model has also received attention for how it impacts on jobs and wages. Davis et al. conduct one of the most comprehensive studies to date by analyzing the employment effects of PE-backed LBOs at both establishment and firm levels.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine whether external monitors (auditors and analysts) constrain earnings strings, an indicator of earnings management, and whether this monitoring is more effective after the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), given the emphasis of SOX on improving auditing, financial reporting and the information environment. Design/methodology/approach - Agency theory establishes the premise between external monitoring and earnings strings. Auditor tenure and number of analysts following provide measures for external monitoring quality. Using prior research, empirical models explaining the presence of an earnings strings and earnings strings trend are developed to test the hypotheses. Findings - Pre-SOX, extreme auditor tenure, indicating lower quality external monitoring, is associated with greater earnings strings trend, and analyst coverage is associated with increased likelihood of earnings strings and greater earnings strings trend consistent with analyst pressure on management. More effective auditor and analyst monitoring occurs post-SOX in terms of reduced likelihood of earnings strings and earnings strings trend. Originality/value - The authors provide evidence on how elements of external monitoring are associated with increased earnings strings pre-SOX. Further, they contribute to the debate on the impact of SOX on external firm monitoring and the overall financial information environment. By focusing on earnings strings, the outcome of earnings management, the authors provide a unique understanding of external monitoring that also provides insight on the overvaluation of equity and ultimate destruction of firm value. The evidence demonstrates how regulation has contributed to an improved financial reporting environment and external monitoring. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited

The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of minority shareholders' rights on client's demand for audit quality. Specially, this paper investigates the impact of shareholders' with at least 10% holdings on clients' demand for audit quality. The sample consists of the top 100 listed firms on the Borsa Istanbul (BIST) for 2014 and 2015. The result is aligned with the suggestions of the agency theory that shareholders with at least 10% holdings increase clients' involvement with audit quality. The results propose direction for future studies on the role of shareholders to monitor management behavior. This paper calls for future studies in the area of accounting and finance to operationalize a new measurement of Type II agency cost in order to better understand the agency conflicts and the state of the shareholders on the BIST.

We study the role of corporate governance on the Intellectual Capital disclosure strategy of listings firms under different perspectives (agency and signaling theories). Previous literature has shown different competing arguments regarding how governance might affect the level of IC disclosure and also none of the contributions is focused on IPOs. Depending on the theoretical framework, governance and corporate disclosure may be complementary (agency theory) or substitutive (signaling theory) for accountability. If they are complementary, agency theory predicts that the adoption of better governance mechanisms will strengthen the internal control of companies so that a greater extent of discretionary disclosure is expected. If the relationship is substitutive, drawing on signaling theory, we expect that issuers use corporate governance as a signal and accordingly reduce the amount of burdensome IC information that is given to investors in the listing prospectus. Therefore, this study aims to better understand which theoretical framework is best at interpreting the observed IC disclosure policies of listing firms. To this end, we test a series of hypotheses on a sample of 70 Italian firms that went public between 2004 and 2014. A series of six IC disclosure indexes are employed in a multivariate analysis in order to disentangle the specific effect that each corporate governance variable might play over a variety of IC information that is disclosed into the listing prospectus. Our results reveal that, according to the signaling theory, good governance mechanisms are substitutive to the IC disclosure and the results are consistent across the different IC categories that are here considered. This study has practical implications which contribute to the understanding of managers' decision processes with respect to the choice of multiple signals, and it also suggests a possible interpretation of the low propensity of listing firms to disseminate longer than necessary discretionary information.

The family business is an economically relevant worldwide phenomenon. It is widespread in every industry and it takes diverse legal forms, ranging from micro, small and medium sized firms to large public companies. Its economic relevance frequently impacts more than half of the national GDP and it becomes an essential source of employment. After, presenting some facts and figures about the family business around the world, this chapter shows the two main approaches used to define a family firm, namely the essence and component approaches. We thus review more than 180 definitions of family firms and organise them within a table according to the following three main criteria: (1) Percentage of ownership held by the family, (2) Members of the family involved in management and control positions, and (3) Generational stages of the family firm. The intersection of these three criteria gives rise to other four groups of family firm definitions, theoretically proving the multidimensionality of the phenomenon. We then review the studies on family business and accounting and discuss the main theoretical framework used, with a specific focus on the transition from a mainly agency theory-based literature to the derived socioemotional wealth theory. Finally, this chapter pinpoints some early conclusions on the family business providing a bridge with the ensuing chapter stressing the relations between family firms and accounting choices.

This chapter begins the discussion about earnings quality in family firms. It examines whether family firms differently manage their earnings compared to non-family firms. We show that both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective, prior research documents show that family firms manage less their earnings relative to non-family firms. Nonetheless, we also look at deviations from these results, mainly due to the differences in the institutional environment, and/or in the management structure. Moreover, there has been a shift from the agency theory to the socioemotional wealth theory to explain family firms' decisions with regards to earnings management. We conclude this chapter by suggesting future avenues for research, in particular in terms of theoretical framework and research design. The discussion about earnings quality continues in Chap. 4, where we investigate accounting conservatism in family firms. (c) Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

Purpose: Country comparative studies especially in Africa on public procurement reforms toward financial control and accountability of public expenditure are limited. Meanwhile, these kinds of studies have potential for providing useful insights on how value for money through public procurement is being ensured across Africa. This paper attempts to provide this. The purpose of this paper is to highlight several policy recommendations for public management aimed at improving public procurement and public financial management (PFM) systems in Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a qualitative case study using secondary data drawn from Global Integrity Index (GII) of the Transparency International and the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessments databases to investigate variables that influence public procurement practices in three purposively selected African countries. The comparative approach for presenting some of the experiences of countries in public procurement methods is used in this paper. Findings: The findings suggest three main variables, namely, government structure and economic variables, complicated by socio-cultural values interact to influence public procurement and PFM systems in the case study countries. Research limitations/implications: Data for the GII indicators used were only available from 2013, which restricted the discussion of those indicators to a short span (2013-2015). Social implications: The socio-cultural milieu within which public procurement takes place has implications for how governance structures function to deliver value-for-money public procurement. Originality/value: This study adds value by comparing three countries within Africa to reveal common variables which influence public procurement and PFM systems.

Private equity (PE) leveraged buyouts (LBOs) are financial transactions through which an acquirer buys a controlling stake in a company using a substantial amount of debt, with the objective of selling it after a few years for a profit. This chapter discusses how the literature has focused mostly on technological innovation, paying relatively less attention to managerial innovation. It demonstrates the different theoretical frameworks to analyze LBOs and the extent to which the empirical literature supports their predictions. Two main theoretical frameworks link LBOs to the performance in general - and the innovation in particular - of target companies: agency theory and strategic entrepreneurship theory. The agency theory of LBOs stems from the seminal works on the relationship between shareholders and managers. The second theoretical framework that can be used to describe the impact of LBOs on innovative activity is strategic entrepreneurship theory.

Dividend Policy is one of the most re-searchable topics in the area of Corporate Finance. Numerous Hypotheses and empirical researches have been done to explain the dividend policy of firms. The most popular is Lintner model (1956), which suggests on previous year dividend and Earnings per share as significant determinants of dividend policy. The pertinent question arises is why some firms pay regular dividends when dividends can be sacrificed for growth and financial stability. The Agency theory highlights the conflict between promoters and managers for dividends over surplus utilization. The Life cycle theory suggests that mature firms tend to ensure regular dividend payout compared to younger firms. Under this context the present paper investigates the Managers Remuneration to ensure dividend stability while maintaining Investment and Financing decisions. The results show that mean of past dividend, managerial remuneration, firm size, return on net worth, firm maturity and debt to equity are the significant variables that influence the regular dividend paying behavior of the Indian firms. However the firm growth, quick ratio, promoter holding and cash earnings per share are not found to be significant determinants of regular dividend of Indian firms. This paper contributes to the literature on dividend policy for Indian firms who are maintaining stable dividend policy. (c) Allied Academies.

The relation between firm performance and shareholding is a critical issue in corporate governance. In this paper, we examine if significant associations exist between firm performance and (1) directors' shareholdings or (2) directors' family shareholdings among Taiwanese listed firms. After addressing for possible endogeneity and controlling for firm specific variables, we find a positive association between executive director's shareholding and firm performance. Consistent with incentive effect in agency theory, this result indicates that executive directors have incentive to maximize firms' value. Also, we find that executive directors' family shareholding is positively related to firm performance, which implies that executive directors may be motivated by their family members to improve firm value. The results also imply that the majority-minority agency problem can be mitigated when director's family welfare is at stake. In addition, we divide research sample into subsets to accommodate the effect of mandatory independent director regulation in Taiwan since 2007. (c) 2018, International Journal of Financial Research.

This study aims to examine the relationship between gender diversity and real estate companies' performance in Malaysia, whereby in 1985, the Government of Malaysia formulated a National Policy on Women as a guide for women's participation. Panel data analysis was used to examine the gender diversity and real estates' performance in an unbalanced panel of 549 observations for the years 2012-2015. The authors utilised an agency theory to inform the discussion of this paper's findings. This study finds that the woman directors in the real estate companies are dominated by family-companies. The existence of block holders enhances the firm governance by monitoring the board activities which in turn increase their effectiveness and efficiency that lead to a higher firm performance. Both the managerial ownership and the institutional investors are significant in determining the firm's performance. The reason may be due to higher ownership controlled by managerial and investor which makes them have a say in a company and try to pursue their objectives rather than the stakeholders' interests. The findings have contributed to the body of knowledge especially on the women participation in Malaysia, and their contributions. Gender diversity does not destroy the firm performance; in fact, Malaysian companies should focus on the right combination of men and women on the board, rather than the presence of at least a woman on a board of directors. The findings outlay the scenario of women's involvement in the real estate companies in Malaysia. There is a positive direction for women's involvement in the board, but it is still a long way to go. Very limited studies delved on gender diversity and real estate companies in Malaysia, even though there is a policy by the Government on women involvement in Malaysia. (c) 2018.

We want an economy that generates stable and equitable growth - or what I call 'sustainable prosperity'. We want productivity growth that makes it possible for the population to have higher living standards over time. We want an equitable sharing of the gains from productivity growth among those whose work efforts and financial resources contribute to that growth. And we want sufficient job stability to enable workers to remain in productive employment for some four decades at work while providing them with enough savings to ensure adequate incomes over some two decades of retirement. We need innovative enterprise to achieve sustainable prosperity. Innovation, defined as a higher-quality product at a lower unit cost than had previously been available, generates the productivity that underpins stable and equitable growth. The innovative enterprise is the linchpin of investment in productive capabilities through the interaction of households, governments and businesses - or what I call 'the investment triad. In this essay, I outline the Theory of Innovative Enterprise (TIE) as a conceptual framework for analysing how an economy can achieve sustainable prosperity. TIE transforms our understanding of how the economy functions and performs. TIE exposes the absurdity of the neoclassical economics concept of 'perfect competition', taught to millions of students every year, which posits that the unproductive firm is the foundation of the most efficient economy. I put forward TIE as a relevant and rigorous replacement for neoclassical theory. TIE can explain how the US economy (as a foremost example among the rich nations of the world) displayed a tendency toward stable and equitable growth in the immediate post-World War II decades but then, from the last half of the 1970s, entered into an era of unstable employment, inequitable income, and sagging productivity. Driving this epochal change was the transformation of the dominant regime of corporate resource allocation from 'retain-and-reinvest' to 'downsize-and-distribute'. Under a retain-and-reinvest regime, companies retain corporate revenues and reinvest in productive capabilities, including those of the labour force, that can generate innovative products. Under a downsize-and-distribute regime, senior corporate executives - incentivised by stock-based pay and pressured by financial predators - focus on downsizing the labour force (laying off workers, cutting their pay, neglecting training) and distributing corporate revenues to shareholders in the forms of cash dividends and stock repurchases. The corporate proclivity to downsize-and-distribute has become so extreme in the United States that it can now be termed the (largely legal) looting of the business corporation. It bears prime responsibility for the extreme concentration of income among the very richest households and the ongoing erosion of middle-class employment opportunities. Legitimising this looting of the business corporation is the neoclassical theory of the market economy and its particular 'agency theory' application, with its mantra that, for the sake of economic efficiency, business enterprises should be run to 'maximise shareholder value' (MSV). In this essay, I explain why, far from being a theory of value creation, MSV is an ideology of predatory value extraction. I conclude by arguing that the eradication of MSV ideology is a necessary condition for enabling an economy's business enterprises to contribute to, rather than undermine, the achievement of sustainable prosperity. To provide us with a rational intellectual foundation for specific policy proposals to stop the looting of the business corporation - including a ban on stock buybacks, radical changes in incentives for senior corporate executives, representation of workers and taxpayers on corporate boards, and reform of the tax system to support the investment triad - I call for innovation theory to replace agency theory in our conceptualisation - and teaching - of how a successful economy operates and performs.

We develop a philosophical perspective on the moral obligations of managers, which we call agent morality, by examining the moral implications of agency theory. Our view is grounded in noninstrumental ethics, which we argue is logically superior to instrumental ethics. We show that the principal-agent model of the firm, once properly considered, requires that managers fashion business policies with reference first to certain moral duties and second to shareholder wealth.

This paper focuses on the practical coexistence of agency and stewardship theories. By analysing the three dimensions of government structures, compensation schemes, and monitoring activities, we show that this coexistence is possible due to several situational factors. Using field research data, we examine the causes of this coexistence and the effects it has on the efficiency and effectiveness of corporate governance, and question the practical sustainability of this dualism. We conclude that coexistence is possible but is unsustainable, and it would be wrong to support such a situation for a long period of time. We discuss paths of potential action and their implications for key stakeholders. (c) 2018, University of Belgrade.

In this paper, we argue that a duality of language exists in financial economics in that branch of the agency theory literature that is called signaling, signaling theory, and the signaling principle of finance. We show that the signaling contention violates rudimentary rules of logic. Yet, the duality of language, in the framework of semiotics, opens new avenues of inquiry. During the Passover holiday, a rabbi sits on a bench in a public park, eating a piece of matzo (unleavened bread). Sharing the bench with him is a blind, homeless person. The rabbi feels sorry for the poor man, and, to do a mitzvah (worthy deed), he breaks off a piece of the matzo and gives it to the man. The blind man runs his fingers across the piece several times and finally exclaims, "Who wrote this nonsense?". (c) George M. Frankfurter and Elton G. McGoun 2002.

Purpose: This study aims to reconcile some of the conflicting results in prior studies of the board structure-firm performance relationship and to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of agency theory in the specific context of Italian corporate governance practice. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a dynamic generalised method of moments on a sample of Italian listed companies over the period 2003-2015. Proxies for corporate governance mechanisms are the board size, the level of board independence, ownership structure, shareholder agreements and CEO-chairman leadership. Findings: While directors elected by minority shareholders are not able to impact performance, independent directors do have a non-linear effect on performance. Board size has a positive effect on firm performance for lower levels of board size. Ownership structure per se and shareholder agreements do not affect firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by reconciling some of the conflicting results inherent in the board structure-performance relationship. Firm performance is not necessarily improved by having a high number of independent directors on the board. Ownership structure and composition do not affect firm performance; therefore, greater monitoring provided by concentrated ownership does not necessarily lead to stronger firm performance. Practical implications: This paper suggests that Italian corporate governance law should improve the rules and effectiveness of minority directors by analysing whether they are able to impede the main shareholders to expropriate private benefits on the expenses of the minority. The legislator should not impose any restrictive regulations with regard to CEO duality, as the influence of CEO duality on performance may vary with respect to the unique characteristics of each company. Originality/value: The results enrich the understanding of the applicability of agency theory in listed companies, especially in Italy. Additionally, this paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of research evidence of agency theory studies. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Environmental research has usually highlighted that the existence of slack resources in an organization helps allocate investment to innovative initiatives. However, the existing literature has paid very limited attention to how slack resources can influence the effects of focused and diversified innovations in different ways. Agency theory scholars claim that a manager's first preference when confronted with discretionary resources will not generate positive investments for the firm, but their own opportunistic preferences. The differences between focused and diversified environmental innovations allow us to gain a better understanding of the financial impact of being focused and how slack resources matter in this context. We analyze a longitudinal sample of 5845 environmental patents from the 75 largest companies in the electrical components and equipment industry worldwide. Our results show that high levels of slack resources reduce the existing positive relationship between focused environmental innovations and a firm's financial performance. These results contribute to delineating the theoretical and empirical implications of focused versus diversified environmental innovations and extend the literature on ethical dilemmas concerning managers' use of slack resources in the firm.

In this article, we review recent literature (79 articles) on the impact of corporate governance on corporate tax avoidance. Applying a stakeholder-oriented view, we find that various aspects of corporate governance, such as incentive alignment between management and shareholders, board composition, ownership structure, capital market monitoring, audit, enforcement and government relations, and other stakeholders' pressure have a strong influence on corporate tax avoidance. Findings indicate that effective corporate governance mechanisms steer tax avoidance at its firm-specific optimal level. The classical principal-agent theory, however, fails to fully explain corporate tax avoidance as an outcome. Investigating the determinants of corporate tax avoidance requires a more comprehensive approach taking into account corporate governance institutions and all stakeholders relevant to the firm. We show that corporate governance institutions not only have the potential to increase tax avoidance, making firms more profitable, but also to limit tax avoidance to a level where the arising risks do not outweigh the benefits.

Purpose: This study aims to link environmental disclosure quality (EDQ) to firm performance and examine the moderating role of board independence in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on agency theory and stakeholder theory, the authors developed and tested hypotheses using original survey data from 720 firm-year observations collected from 120 Iranian companies over six years between 2011 and 2016. In this paper, they conducted static and dynamic panel data analysis. Findings: After correcting for endogeneity bias, the results showed that there is a significant positive relationship between EDQ and firm performance. The results also showed that board independence significantly reinforces the positive effect of EDQ on performance, and firms with more independent board members are involved environmental disclosure for improved performance. This is consistent with agency theory, which posits that a more independent board of directors can better monitor the CEO and reduce incentives for pursuing personal interests, which in turn improves performance. The results are robust after performing sensitivity tests. Research limitations/implications: This paper takes the perspective of corporate governance to empirically examine the effect of EDQ on firm performance. This study makes a contribution to the literature by showing that board independence moderates the effects of EDQ on firm performance. Practical implications: The evidence supports the emphasis that recent policy statements have put on increasing the number of independent directors on corporate boards. This study offers insights to policymakers interested in enhancing the monitoring role of corporate boards. Originality/value: The study adds value to the understanding of the effect of the EDQ on performance and how board independence influences this relationship, particularly in an emerging economy like Iran.

Using a sample of 22,839 US firm-year observations over the 1991-2012 period, we find that high CSR firms pay more dividends than low CSR firms. The analysis of individual components of CSR provides strong support for this main finding: five of the six individual dimensions are also associated with high dividend payout. When analyzing the stability of dividend payout, our results show that socially irresponsible firms adjust dividends more rapidly than socially responsible firms do: dividend payout is more stable in high CSR firms. These findings are robust to alternative assumptions and model specifications, alternative measures of dividend, additional control, and several approaches to address endogeneity. Overall, our results are consistent with the expectation that high CSR firms may use dividend policy to manage the agency problems related to overinvestment in CSR. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Stewardship theory is a popular alternative to agency theory for studying family firm governance. Despite its contributions to management and family business studies, stewardship theory's assumptions limit its realism and relevance. Using agency theory as a standard of comparison, I discuss stewardship theory's model of man and its assumptions concerning goal alignment and control systems. I also discuss stewardship theory's lack of assumptions about bounded rationality and pre-employment situations since the neglect of those issues reduce its realism and relevance. Based on this discussion, I argue that to increase its realism and relevance, stewardship theory's assumptions should be revised. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This study examines the impact of CEO duality on firms' internal capital allocation efficiency. We observe that when the CEO is also chair of the board, diversified firms make inefficient investments, as they allocate more capital to business segments with relatively low growth opportunities over segments with high growth opportunities. The adverse impact of CEO duality on investment efficiency prevails only among firms that face high agency problems, as captured by high free cash flows, staggered board structure and low board independence. Depending on the severity of the agency problem, CEO duality is associated with a decrease in industry-adjusted investment in high-growth segments of 1% to 2.1% over the following year, relative to that in low-growth segments. However, CEOs' equity-based compensation curbs the negative effect of CEO duality on internal capital allocation efficiency. Overall, the findings of this study offer strong support for the agency theory and postulate the internal capital allocation policy as an important channel through which CEO duality lowers firm value in diversified firms.

The internationalization of firms has led to boards becoming more international as well. In this study, we investigate the consequences of board internationalization. In particular, by drawing on research on language and board dynamics, we identify theory-based reasons why board internationalization could increase, or decrease, earnings management practices. We use agency theory, stressing how board internationalization may positively or negatively affect monitoring quality of boards. Next to agency theory, we use theories explaining how language differences in the boardroom complicates communication and how differences in language structures (referred to as linguistic relativity in the literature) affect directors' perception and detection of earnings management practices. Using a sample of 3249 firm-year observations representing 586 non-financial listed Nordic firms during 2001-2008, we find that the presence of non-Nordic foreign directors on the board is associated with significantly higher levels of earnings management. Our analysis indicates that this effect is driven by language-related factors, as well as by the level of foreign board members' accounting knowledge. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd

This study empirically investigates the interrelationship between pay and performance of CEOs/board of directors in an emerging market, Pakistan. The study uses GMM approach to account for the problem of potential endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity that arises due to the potential reverse causality (pay and performance)for a sample of non-financial firms listed in the KSE over the period of 2009-2016. This study provides evidence that the pay-performance framework supports the agency theory whereby CEOs/board of directors are compensated for their prior level of market-based performance. In addition, it weakly supports the notion of the steward/tournament theory. Thus, CEOs/board director's remuneration is highly persistent and takes time to adjust to long-run equilibrium.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend the understanding and application of interactive ties creating value through board characteristics, ownership concentration and firms' performance by using a contingent theoretical-based framework based on the amalgamation of resource dependence theory, stakeholder theory, agency theory, stewardship theory and institutional theory in a country with weak political environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study includes a sample of an unbalanced panel of 309 non-financial sector firms listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) from 2005 to 2016. In order to address the issue of unobserved heterogeneity, simultaneous and dynamic endogeneity, the current study employed the technique Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data estimation under assumptions of GMM (Arellano-Bond, 1991). Findings: The empirical results suggest that the presence of concentrated ownership moderates and helps to overcome the agency problems through different governance mechanisms (such as board size, independent directors and CEO duality). The larger boards are found to be beneficial whereas the higher representation of independent directors in the board is found to be detrimental for Pakistani firms. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study are, first the current study has analyzed public-listed firms from the non-financial sector, and second the study has only focused on the financial aspect of the performance. The future research could include other proxies of corporate governance and ownership structure such as board diversity and meetings, audit committee and managerial ownership, etc. Practical implications: The research also helps Pakistani policy makers in numerous ways. First, the current study confirms the monitoring and expropriation effect of ownership concentration in corporate governance and performance mechanism. Thus, the Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) should make such policies which protect the corporate board against the influence of concentrated ownership so that the interests of the minority shareholders are protected. Second, SECP should ensure that all the listed firms declare a comprehensive profile of their directors (such as academic qualification, age and experience) in their annual reports for the better understanding of the governance-performance mechanism. Originality/value: The current study augments the emerging body of literature on corporate governance and firm performance mechanism through the amalgamation and testing of existing theories in an emerging economy like Pakistan by using wider and newer data set.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between earnings management and the efficiency of French firms' investments. It also investigates the moderating effect of board of directors' features on this relation. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a sample of French listed companies from 2011 to 2015, i.e. 435 firm-year observations. The authors use the instrumental variable method based on 2SLS models. Findings: The authors show that there is a negative relationship between earnings management and investment efficiency. This finding supports the theoretical perspective of the agency theory, as the propensity of firms to engage in earnings management practices is associated with high managerial opportunistic behavior and asymmetric information issues, leading to the problem of under and overinvestment. The findings also show that board size, independence and gender diversity are positively associated with investment efficiency. These board features moderate the relationship between earnings management and investment efficiency suggesting that earnings quality plays a more prominent role in guiding managers to choose the right investments when the corporate governance environment is strong. Research limitations/implications: The negative relationship between earnings management and investment efficiency suggests that firms with lower earnings quality are exposed to high information asymmetries. They are then more likely to deviate from their expected level of investments. In addition, the results highlight the importance of corporate financial transparency and board monitoring to reduce agency costs and ensure the efficiency of corporate investments, particularly in a setting where investors' interests are poorly protected. Originality/value: This paper is the first to the best of the authors' knowledge to examine the effect of earnings management, a metric for earnings quality, on the corporate investment efficiency in France. Besides, they extend previous literature by investigating how board features are able to monitor managerial actions and decisions and therefore to moderate the effect of earnings management on investment efficiency.

Interlocking directorates, in which companies are linked by the directors that serve on their boards, exist globally. It is an expression of hegemonic power exercised by the elites of a society, and has been studied with great interest by organizational sociologists, management scholars and financial economists. The interest emanates from the effect that interlocks have on wealth creation and distribution, and from the perspective that interlocks can tell us how elites in a society are networked. Although diverse theoretical perspectives have informed the research on interlocking directorates, this review shows that the Anglo-American perspective dominates. This dominance is notable not only in the volume of Anglo-American studies, but also in theories employed by international studies. For example, most international studies use agency theory to investigate the welfare implications of interlocks, but many countries do not use the Anglo-American legal regime, which is the basis for agency theory. This paper expands the theoretical basis of the review to include class hegemony and resource dependence, to articulate better the causes and consequences of interlocks in the international context. The paper also extends theory by showing that institutions have an important influence on interlocks, so that the latter can be welfare-depleting in one institutional setting, while welfare-enhancing in another. The review concludes by discussing the implication for future research. (c) 2018 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The extant literature reports mixed and inconclusive findings concerning the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance. To provide incremental insight, this paper aims to investigate whether the bi-directional relationships among managerial ownership, board independence and firm performance are determined. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a data set consisting of 9,302 firm-year observations of Australian listed companies during 2005-2015 and a three-stage least squares simultaneous equation model to test the bi-directional relationships. Findings: The results indicate that both managerial ownership and board independence inversely affect firm performance and vice versa. In addition, board independence is negatively correlated with managerial ownership and vice versa. Practical implications: The convergence-of-interests hypothesis can be achieved by manipulating managerial ownership through making contingent payments. Board independence, as a voluntary regime in Australia, can provide additional flexibility to corporate decision makers. Originality/value: This study provides additional evidence by using the convergence-of-interests hypothesis vis-a-vis the entrenchment hypothesis to examine the relationship between managerial ownership and firm performance, and tests the association of board independence and firm performance using the explanation of agency theory vis-a-vis stewardship theory.

Purpose: This paper aims to demonstrate how financial leverage impacts firm investment and the extent to which this relationship is conditional on the level of information asymmetry as well as growth. Design/methodology/approach: The paper relies on data from 2,403 Indian firms during the period 1995-2014, generating a total of 19,544 firm-year observations. Analysis is conducted by using various panel econometric techniques. Findings: Drawing insights from agency theories, the paper uncovers that financial leverage is negatively and significantly related to firm investment. It is also observed that the impact of financial leverage on firm investment is significant for high information asymmetric firms. Finally, the paper shows that the relationship between leverage and firm investment is significant for low-growth firms. However, no significant relationship is found between leverage and investment for high-growth firms. Originality/value: This paper provides fresh evidence on the leverage-investment nexus and, to the authors' knowledge, it the first paper to examine the extent to which this leverage-investment relationship is driven by the level of information asymmetry.

The effectiveness of monitoring and incentive alignment as mechanisms for controlling agency costs have been explored separately and in combination, with monitoring substituting for weaknesses in incentive alignment and vice versa; this equates to positive substitution when describing how monitoring and incentive alignment interact to influence shareholder agency costs. We draw upon behavioral agency theory and findings from finance research to offer further theoretical insight into how these mechanisms interact to influence agency costs. Our results suggest that CEO earnings management aimed at preserving their equity wealth (an incentive alignment mechanism) is accentuated by higher levels of concentrated institutional ownership, thereby imposing agency costs on less informed investors. Thus, in addition to being substitutes in controlling agency costs, as previously suggested, monitoring may accentuate the perverse effects of incentive alignment, equating to negative reinforcement, rather than positive substitution. Yet this effect is negated in the absence of CEO power due to dual occupation of the board and CEO roles. We discuss implications of these findings for theory and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

The negative association between risk and return is paradoxical because risk-averse managers should only expose themselves to higher risk for higher returns. The paradox is resolved, however, if we recognize that risk-averse managers may be taking decisions that pose risk for shareholders and not for their own careers. We draw on the career concerns literature to explain why decisions that pose risk to shareholder returns can enhance managerial careers. We provide evidence that the risk-return paradox is exacerbated by agency problems that contribute to career concerns (i.e., CEO career horizon), and mitigated by various governance mechanisms that curb the agency problem by aligning managers with shareholders (such as monitoring by the market for corporate control, large block owners, institutional owners, vigilant board, and CEO incentive alignment). Our study sheds light on the role of career concerns and corporate governance in resolving the risk-return paradox. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Ownership structure has been identified as a critical governance component due to its effect on firm performance. Within ownership structure, issues of institutional shareholders, cash flow rights of controlling owners, and ownership discrepancy have not been examined in the tourism sector. The current study uses listed tourism firms in Taiwan to empirically examine how these three variables influence firm performance. Results show a positive effect on return on assets and Tobin's Q from the presence of institutional shareholders and cash flow rights of controlling owners. Ownership discrepancy has a negative effect on Tobin's Q. The present results can make contributions to agency theory and principles for good governance. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Sustainability-oriented CEO compensation is being widely discussed among policy makers, corporate practice, and academia. To date, management literature has yielded a growing body of empirical results on the determinants and effects of sustainable CEO compensation. Primarily, empirical studies analyze whether and to what extent sustainability-related issues determine the design of sustainable CEO compensation and how sustainability-oriented CEO compensation impacts corporate performance. However, the scattered nature of this research field has impeded an overarching empirical substantiation of the arguments in favor or against a sustainable CEO compensation. This structured literature review addresses this gap by analyzing 37 empirical studies on the key determinants and effects of sustainable CEO compensation. Using a multi-level analysis, we contribute to the discussion on sustainable CEO compensation by systematically identifying the central empirical insights and methodological and content-related foci within this research area. In summary, this review provides regulators, boards, management, investors, and other stakeholders with academic evidence on the determinants and effects of sustainability-oriented CEO compensation design. In addition to critically reflecting on the current state of research, we recommend paths for future research on sustainable CEO compensation. (c) 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Using the behavioral agency model, we analyze how two compensation design characteristics, pay-performance sensitivity and duration of CEO compensation (taking into account multiple vesting periods), affect corporate social performance. We find that the performance sensitivity of CEO pay is negatively associated with poor social performance but also negatively affects strong social performance. These results suggest that pay-performance sensitivity increases the relevance of potential negative consequences of poor social performance. However, the 'insurance' benefits of strong social performance may also become less relevant. With respect to the duration of CEO compensation, we find that it reduces poor social performance. This finding confirms arguments that a long-term compensation time horizon increases the perceived threat that the negative effects of poor social performance will become visible. With our findings, we integrate behavioral agency theory with the traditional stakeholder views. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The prime objective of this study is to investigate the legitimate role of corporate boards and corporate social responsibility on the performance of Malaysian listed companies during 2006-2017. Elements of corporate boards include board size, board independence and board diversity, whereas corporate social responsibility (CSR) dimensions constitute marketplace, environment, community and workplace. Both accounting-based (return on assets [ROA], return on equity [ROE]) and market-based (earnings per share [EPS]) performance measures have been employed for measuring performance. Pooled ordinary least squares method (OLS) and multiple regressions are used to estimate the dataset. Findings reveal larger board size and higher board independence positively affect firm performance and significantly legitimise the board role in firms. However, the presence of women on Malaysian corporate boards does not legitimate the performance due to their lower percentage on board, hence insignificantly affecting firm value. Additionally, out of four CSR dimensions, only marketplace is positively and significantly related to EPS and negatively and significantly related to ROA. Conversely, environment, community and workplace are insignificantly related to all performance measures, leaving firms in a questionable legitimate state. This study embraces support from agency theory, resource dependence theory, legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory. However, this research raises questionable insights for regulatory bodies and academicians in the form of corporate legitimacy. (c) 2019 Institute of Public Enterprise.

Much of the management compensation literature focuses either on the level and structure of executives' pay or the pay-for-performance sensitivity in a set of corporate governance structure in the Western economies. In this study, we examine the interactive effect of executive compensation, firm performance and corporate governance in different institutional and governance settings of an emerging market economy. Capturing monitoring and incentive alignment aspects as suggested in agency theory, we argue that in a markedly different executive compensation system in Thailand, the interrelationships between executive compensation, firm performance and corporate governance would exhibit some similarities to those found in developed economies. While there remains sparse research on how these relationships operate in Thailand, using data for 432 publicly listed Thai firms between 2000 and 2011, we find evidence of a reciprocal positive significant relationship between compensation and performance, as well as between corporate governance and performance. However, a reciprocal relationship is not found between corporate governance and compensation, which shows a mono-directional positive significant relationship running from corporate governance to compensation. These findings show similarities with those of developed economies and provide support for the need for an effective governance system to determine optimal executive compensation that will enhance firm performance and value. Our findings thus add some potentially noteworthy dimensions to the compensation literature that are especially important to policy makers and other stakeholders, and aiming to shape an optimal governance system in the emerging markets around the world.

Research Question/Issue: Although there is no unified theory that can explain the relationship between CEO power and corporate risk, the empirical evidence generally finds a positive association. This study argues that market competition and corporate governance play critical roles in influencing this relationship. Research Findings/Insights: Using a large panel of nonfinancial U.S. corporations for the period 1992-2015, I find that CEO power is positively associated with total and idiosyncratic measures of risk. However, this positive association remains significant only when market competition is high or corporate governance is strong. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The research design of this study combines the predictions of agency theory, the behavioral agency model, and prospect theory to further our understanding of the relationship between CEO power and corporate risk, including consideration of how competition and corporate governance influence this relationship. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The empirical evidence presented in this study can help boards to more accurately gauge when CEO power is most beneficial in terms of optimal levels of corporate risk and to better understand the relationship between power and risk. The results suggest that boards should grant more power to their CEOs when their firms operate in high-competition markets or have strong corporate governance in place. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Following the agency theory, this paper contributes to the literature on board independence as a mechanism to mitigate agency costs by investigating the impact of independent minority directors on firm value in a principal-principal setting. Independent minority directors might alleviate agency costs associated to the risk of self-dealing transactions and, in turn, increase firm value. However, since non-controlling shareholders are also self-interested, particularly for firms characterized by strong uncertainty about future financial results and high information asymmetry, independent minority directors might negatively impact firm value by creating frictions within the board, increasing the risks of potential hold-ups by minority shareholders and limiting the ex-ante incentives of the block-holder to undertake profitable idiosyncratic investments. By examining a sample of Italian listed companies, we find some evidence about a positive relationship between the proportion of independent minority directors and firm value. Although weaker, a positive relationship between the proportion of independent minority directors and firm value is also found for firms characterized by high information asymmetry and--therefore--exposed to the risk of opportunistic actions by minority shareholders against the dominant shareholder. Our results shed new light on the relationship between board composition and firm value in a concentrated ownership setting, revealing the role played by independent minority directors in mitigating agency costs.

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been subjected to considerable public debate. In particular, this debate has concerned PPP financing and its implications. Using insights from agency theory, this study aims to develop a theoretical understanding of PPP financing. The following research question is investigated: How does the privatization of financing decrease or increase agency costs in social infrastructure PPPs? A comparative case study consisting of four Norwegian PPP projects with different financial configurations is undertaken. The findings suggest that the private sector is risk averse, increasing the cost of capital. In addition, private financing does not seem to have the intended incentive effect.

Purpose: As the primary decision makers, chief executive officers (CEOs) play pivotal roles in firm innovation. However, little is known regarding how CEOs influence the exploitation and exploration paradox. To advance theory and research, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the joint effects of CEO tenure and CEO-chair duality on a firm's shifting emphasis between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes the approach of a longitudinal sample of 81 US pharmaceutical firms. Findings: As CEOs' tenure advance, their firms' percentage of exploitative innovation increases. Furthermore, non-duality (separation of board chair and CEO) further strengthens the positive relationship between CEO tenure and the percentage of exploitative innovation. Research limitations/implications: This study integrates upper echelons theory and behavioral agency theory to juxtapose the effects of CEOs on technological innovation. This study extends knowledge of strategic leadership and innovation by showing that CEOs influence the balance between exploitative and exploratory innovation. Furthermore, this study also contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating that monitoring vigilance could inhibit capable CEOs from pursuing more exploratory innovation. Practical implications: Boards of directors should allow CEOs to have greater discretion over innovation, and vigilant monitoring and control may force CEOs to focus less on exploration. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies that explicitly investigate how CEO influences a firm's emphasis on exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation.

This analysis considers the dimensions of financialisation of the international economy and how this has produced a more intensive and integrated mode of accumulation. With the increasing translation of Anglo-American listed corporations into financial entities, how the dominant shareholder primacy mode of corporate governance has served to compound inequality is examined. The damaging impact of maximising shareholder value is investigated, both in terms of the long term prospects of corporations, but also in aggressively producing increased inequality in the economy and society. Finally the ultimate paradoxical outcome of agency theory and shareholder value is highlighted as the explosion of executive reward in the last two decades in the Anglo-American countries. Finally the possibilities for reform and change towards more responsible and equitable approaches are considered. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the impact of two monitoring mechanisms: family ownership (FO) and financial reporting quality (FRQ) on investment efficiency (IE) over the period of 2007-2014 for listed firms on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ two-dimensional pooled OLS cluster at the firm and year level, two-stage least square regression and feasible generalized lease square regression regression methods. Findings: The findings suggest that higher FRQ and FO are associated with higher IE. Further, the authors report that higher FRQ and FO mitigate over- and under-investment. The impact of FRQ on IE is stronger (weaker) for family-controlled businesses. The results for these particular estimates are robust for alternative estimation techniques and measures of FRQ and FO. Originality/value: The study draws on both agency and behavioral agency theories and therefore contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, the authors examine a relationship between FRQ and IE. Second, the authors test the impact of FO on IE. Third, the authors test the moderating impact of FO on the relationship between FRQ and the IE of family and non-family firms in relatively less regulated emerging market.

This article presents a partial survey of the literature of the burgeoning area of cultural finance with a view of how respective investigations and results are explicitly or implicitly framed in relation to either normative institutionalism or intended rationality. Studies are examined by comparing national culture as influencing financial systems either by shaping the norms of behavior and concomitant logic of appropriateness, or, alternatively, shaping environments so as to impact the incentives for differing actors to maximize their utilities. For the cultural dimensions of the Hofstede framework, suggestions are made regarding deploying future studies within an intended rationality or normative institutionalism framework. This taxonomy also highlights the role of national culture with respect to transaction costs and agency costs, and is relevant to many cultural finance studies. The developing area of cultural finance can benefit from examining investigations, results, and discussions with regard to the contrasting perspectives of normative institutionalism and intended rationality.

Corporate boards are responsible for ensuring that managers enact policies that are in shareholders' best interests, and managers are responsible for implementing strategies that are not only profitable but also responsive to changing legal and societal demands and the resource needs of the firm. In this paper, we use the theoretical lenses of corporate social responsibility (CSR), the resource-based view, and agency theory to investigate the relationship between corporate governance structure and the implementation of supportive lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) policies. We analyze 10,233 firm-year observations and 1,594 unique firms, and our results demonstrate that LGBT-supportive policies are positively associated with firm performance. We also offer new insight into why not all firms adopt such policies. We exploit the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as an exogenous shock that increased board independence, and our difference-in-difference estimation shows that firms forced to raise board independence in 2002 were less likely to invest in LGBT-supportive policies. Results suggest that human resource management (HRM) policies can be guided by CSR and resource-based views in the pursuit of wealth maximization, but agency conflict may also be a concern for external majority boards. We discuss implications for HRM research practice and corporate governance regarding LGBT policies in organizations. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Purpose: The issue that revolves around corporate governance and corporate environmental reporting (CER) has always been an essential element deliberated upon globally. A good corporate governance mechanism instills an investor's confidence and ensures a transparent process that facilitates more disclosures and quality reporting. Precisely, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between corporate governance variables, namely, board size, board independence, board meeting (BM), risk management committee composition and CER in Nigeria. This study utilized the data obtained from the annual reports of 24 non-financial public listed companies in the Nigeria Stock Exchange comprising three sectors, namely, industrial goods, natural resources and oil & gas for the period of 2011-2015. The model of this study is theoretically based on agency theory. In analyzing data, this study utilized panel data analysis. Based on the Hausman test, the random effect model was used to examine the effect of predictors on CER. The result indicates a positive significant relationship between board independence and CER. Similarly, a positive significant relationship between BM and CER is revealed in the study. However, there is no significant relationship between other hypothesis variables and CER. Finally, the study provides suggestions for future research and several recommendations for regulators, government and accounting professional bodies. Design/methodology/approach: The data was analysed using statistics. Findings: The result indicates a positive significant relationship between board independence and CER. Similarly, a positive significant relationship between BM and CER is revealed in the study. However, there is no significant relationship between other hypothesis variables and CER. Originality/value: There are no prior studies linking risk management committee with CER. (c) 2018, Usman Shehu Aliyu.

Purpose: In order to deepen our knowledge of governance of family firms, the purpose of this paper is to focus our attention on the relation between family owners who are members of the board of directors and firm performance. Also, this study sheds more light on how the generation in charge of the family firm affects that relationship, as generational involvement may be a unique predictor of governance behavior in these firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors applied a cross-sectional ordinary least squares regression model to test the hypotheses on a sample of 313 non-listed Spanish family SMEs. The authors suggest the possibility of a non-linear relationship between the percentage of ownership by family members of the board of directors and firm performance, and specifically, the authors propose an S-shaped effect that implies two breakpoints. Findings: The authors find not only that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists, but also an S-shaped relationship between family board members' ownership and firm performance in family SMEs. Nevertheless, the results are different in comparing first-, second- and later-generation family firms. Originality/value: This is one of the few empirical studies that examine the relationship between family board ownership and firm performance in the context of non-listed family SMEs. The authors consider that the influences of family directors on the board of directors as well as the concentration of family ownership on the board of directors are worth studying in non-listed family SMEs. Moreover, previous studies have focused mainly on large listed family firms but not on unlisted ones. (c) 2019, Amaia Maseda, Txomin Iturralde, Gloria Aparicio, Lotfi Boulkeroua and Sarah Cooper.

Franchising is a growth vehicle that helps firms scale their operations. Yet, the performance implications of franchising remain inconclusive. To solve this conundrum, we contend that firm-specific attributes lead to an optimal level of franchising and that the deviation from that optimal level has important firm-level consequences. Using a sample of 64 publicly listed restaurant firms that franchise in the United States, our study integrates the risk sharing perspective with resource scarcity and agency theories to show that a failure to adhere to these theoretical prescriptions can be a financially risky proposition. For restaurant firms that franchise, our results highlight the importance of maintaining an optimal mix of franchised and firm-owned outlets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Based on both institutionalized agency theory and meso-level theory, this study examines corporate governance disclosure in an audit firm's transparency report (TR) and whether more disclosure is associated with (a) the audit function of the country in which it is disclosed; (b) high levels of investor confidence in public interest entities (PIEs) shown in the portfolio of the audit firm; and (c) increased competition within the audit market. Research Findings/Insights: On the basis of content analysis, different measures of a corporate governance disclosure index (CGDI) are calculated for a sample of 122 auditing firms from 10 European countries over the period 2010-2012. Despite attempts at harmonizing audit practice across the EU, results confirm the role of institutional context in explaining differences among European countries. Moreover, while the CGDI reveals that the TR does improve investor confidence, no evidence was found that the new disclosure requirement unsettled audit market concentration. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Results support arguments of the institutionalized agency theory that audit firms' corporate governance disclosures depend on both firm- and country-level factors. Moreover, the interplay between these macro and meso factors explains the information asymmetry reduction that exists between auditors and shareholders, thus improving micro-level investor confidence. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The study provides an analysis of audit firm transparency based on the information disclosed in mandatory TRs. Policymakers and practitioners may benefit from the knowledge of items included in the TRs expected to impact on investor confidence. It also proposes the use of the TR for achieving market competition strategies, although it may be inefficient. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: Based on the agency theory and risk management perspective, this study aims to examine the relationship between CEOs' pay schemes and corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities in the restaurant industry. Specifically, the authors propose that CEOs with a higher proportion of equity-based compensation (EBC), which induces a greater propensity for risk-taking, are prone to indulge less in CSR. In addition, the authors investigate how institutional ownership moderates the proposed main relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study performs two-way fixed-effects models and clustered standard errors to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results of the panel analysis show a significant negative effect of CEOs' EBC on CSR. Also, the authors found a significant positive moderating effect of institutional ownership between CEOs' EBC and CSR. Originality/value: Given the lack of empirical studies that incorporate both agency theory and the risk management perspective, and given the importance of understanding the determinants of restaurant firms' CSR activities, this study expands upon the existing literature by showing the relationship between CEOs' compensation schemes and restaurant firms' CSR activities.

By investigating the effect of earnings quality (EQ) on corporate social disclosure (CSD) in the context of Vietnam, this study tests whether firms uphold managerial opportunism based on the agency theory or social responsibility based on stakeholder theory. It also tests the moderating effect of state and foreign ownership on the relationship between EQ and CSD. This study finds that the long-term perspective argument dominates in the relationship between EQ and CSD, indicating that EQ is positively and significantly associated with CSD. The study also finds that the increasing proportion of shares held by the government in firms weakens the relationship between EQ and CSD. (c), Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Despite the extensive body of literature that aims to explain the phenomenon of consumer scams, the structure of information in scam relationships remains relatively understudied. The purpose of this article is to develop an agency-theoretic approach to the study of information in perpetrator-victim interactions. Drawing a distinction between failures of observation and failures of judgment in the pre-contract phase, we introduce a typology and a set of propositions that explain the severity of adverse selection problems in three classes of scam relationships. Our analysis provides a novel, systematic explanation of the structure of information that facilitates scam victimization, while also enabling critical scrutiny of a core assumption in agency theory regarding contract design. We highlight the role of scam perpetrators as agents who have access to private information and exercise considerable control over the terms and design of scam relationships. Focusing on the consumer scam context, we question a theoretical assumption, largely taken for granted in the agency literature, that contact design is necessarily in the purview of the uninformed principal.

Purpose: Corporate governance is a crucial factor when considering excessive corporate risk-taking. Since corporate boards play such an important role in corporate governance, the purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the impact of board composition and further board characteristics on excessive corporate risk-taking. Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates listed firms from Germany and the USA from 2004 to 2015 based on data from Thomson Reuters Data Stream. The authors apply the fixed effect and random effect estimation method to demonstrate the impact of board composition on corporate risk-taking. Findings: This study provides empirical evidence that an increase in the proportion of independent directors is associated with less corporate risk-taking. These effects are stronger among German firms. Lastly, the effects of board size and audit committee effectiveness (AUCE) on risk-taking have mixed results. Research limitations/implications: The results favor continued efforts to strengthen the composition of corporate boards and improve the effectiveness of audit committees to curb unhealthy corporate risk-taking. The recommendations from the research will provide regulators and corporate management with the necessary information needed to design an appropriate independent board structure, and board size (BOSI). The research will, furthermore, fortify the indispensability of financial experts on audit committees. Originality/value: This study contributes to the agency theory debate with these findings. Stronger board independence enables a better monitoring of the CEO, which leads to decision making based on a more appropriate level of risk. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Effective use of human resources is important for the profitability and governance of family firms. In a study of the human resource management (HRM) practices of US Hispanic family firms, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the implications of agency and stewardship governance. Design/methodology/approach: To better understand HRM practices in US Hispanic family firms, the authors present findings from 169 US firms to hypothesize the extent of HRM development in Hispanic family firms (n=70) vs non-Hispanic family firms (n=99). Findings: Results indicated that HRM practices in Hispanic family firms are less structured than those of non-Hispanic family firms; however, when Hispanic family firms effectively use HRM practices, they will have greater financial success. Originality/value: Therefore, the results suggest that Hispanic family firm leaders display relatively low agency governance and high stewardship governance. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We examine whether compensation committee existence (CCX) and compensation committee effectiveness (CCE) are associated with CEO pay-performance alignment, using data drawn from a sample of Australian listed companies. We find that compensation committee existence and effectiveness are positively associated with CEO pay-performance alignment. Further, our results show that the relationships hold for the pre- and post-GFC (Global Financial Crisis) periods but not for the crisis period. This evidence supports the prospect theory argument that in times of macroeconomic crisis, uncontrollable factors external to the firm constitute a firm's reference point for making executive remuneration decisions. These results are robust to alternative measures of firm performance and CEO cash compensation as well as tests of endogeneity. Overall, our evidence suggests that compensation committees contribute to addressing agency problems pertinent to contemporary corporate governance practices. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the impact of board-CEO friendship ties on firm value and explores potential channels through which changes in firm value may be conveyed, based on a sample of 1696 publicly listed firms in U.S. over the period of 2000-2014. The study reveals that board-CEO friendship ties have a negative and economically meaningful impact on firm value, as measured by Tobin's Q and Total Q. Regarding potential channels of firm value, we show that the negative influence of board-CEO friendship ties on firm value is reduced in firms with greater board advising requirements but intensified in firms with higher board monitoring needs. We also find social ties tend to destroy firm value whereas professional ties do not. Our results are robust to endogeneity concerns, and after controlling for board-CEO professional ties.

Purpose: Prior studies suggest that most expropriation of firm's resources is conducted through related party transactions (RPTs). Based on the conflict of interest view, related parties opportunistically use their authorities to expropriate firms' resources for their own benefits via RPTs subsequently increasing agency costs and reduce firm value. One important monitoring system suggested by agency theory to reduce the agency problem is corporate governance (CG). CG monitors firm's performance to align the interests of those who control and those who own the residual claims in a firm. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the moderating effect of CG characteristics on the relationship between RPTs and firm value. Design/methodology/approach: In order to clarify the distinct effect of RPTs, this study categorises RPTs into two groups including beneficial and detrimental RPTs (DRPTs). Applying "proportionate stratified random sampling", this study covers a panel of 271 firms listed on Bursa Malaysia over the period of 2009-2011, using a moderated multiple regression model. Findings: This study documents that firm value is positively associated with beneficial RPTs (BRPTs) and negatively related to detrimental RPTs (DRPTs). In addition, results show that divergence can intensify the negative relationship between DRPTs and firm value. Findings support the necessity for more scrutiny by regulators, policy makers and standard setters to monitor the conflict of interests in RPTs and restrain the power of related parties to protect the firm's wealth by introducing stricter regulations for RPTs and improve CG practices especially to monitor RPTs in order to limit the opportunistic behaviour of related parties. Research limitations/implications: Research implications have been presented in Section 10. It has also been summarised in practical implications and social implications sections. Practical implications: The findings of this study indicate that investors, creditors and policy makers should not consider all RPTs as harmful transactions and it seems necessary to categorise RPTs into different groups including transactions which are detrimental and transactions which are beneficial to the firm. Social implications: The findings of this study support the necessity for more scrutiny by regulators, policy makers and standard setters to monitor the conflict of interests in RPTs. They should restrain the power of related parties to protect the firm's wealth by introducing stricter regulations for RPTs and improving CG practices especially to monitor RPTs in order to limit the opportunistic behaviour of related parties. Originality/value: This study contributes to the RPTs literature by showing that the effect of RPTs on firm value depends on the types of RPTs, and market participants allocate different values to different types of RPTs. Therefore, to fill the gap and clarify the distinct effect of RPTs, this study categorizes RPTs into two groups including beneficial and detrimental RPTs. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We examine the effects of a franchisee's size, distance from headquarters, and local competition on voluntary compliance with corporate brand-building initiatives at the outlet level. Specifically, we consider compliance with a corporate social responsibility effort to solicit charitable donations at the time of retail checkout, measuring compliance performance as the amount of donations received at each outlet. Our analysis utilizes an objective, longitudinal sample of 777 franchised outlets in a national quick-service restaurant chain. Surprisingly, we find that distance from headquarters is positively related to compliance; we relate this finding to recent, extant research on geographic distances and franchisee behaviors. We find the beneficial effects of larger, multiunit franchisees are mitigated as franchisees' geographic distances from headquarters increase; we relate these findings to horizontal agency within franchising systems. We further find that franchised outlets in more competitive markets comply less with brand-building initiatives, even less so when part of a larger franchisee network. Our results underscore the important moderating role franchisee size plays in outlets' compliance, which we link back to extant perspectives on agency theory. Supplemental analyses consider tensions between compliance and operational efficiency, as well as effects of hypothesized factors on another mandatory form of compliance.

We advance behavioral agency theory by exploring the influence of mood or "affect" on the behavioral consequences of stock option incentives. Drawing on insights from psychology and behavioral decision theory, we describe how affect influences agent risk behavior. We argue that positive affect amplifies both the extent to which executives reduce strategic risk taking in response to risk bearing and engage in strategic risk taking in response to incentives for further enrichment. Building again on the psychology literature, we describe how CEO accountability attenuates the influence of affect on CEO risk behavior in response to stock option incentives. We test our expectations in a longitudinal data set of CEO stock option incentives, affect, and strategic risk taking by U.S. firms. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Why do we use the term 'corporate governance' rather than 'corporate direction'? Early British joint stock companies were normally managed by a single 'governor'. The 'court of governors' or 'board of directors' emerged slowly as the ruling body for companies. By the nineteenth century, however, companies were typically run by directors while not-for-profit entities such as hospitals, schools and charitable bodies had governors. The nineteenth century saw steady refinement of the roles of company directors, often in response to corporate scandals, with a gradual change from the notion of the director as a 'representative shareholder' to the directors being seen collectively as 'representatives of the shareholders'. Governors in not-for-profit entities, however, were regarded as having broader responsibilities. The term 'governance' itself suggests that corporate boards should be studied as 'political' entities rather than merely through economic lenses such as agency theory. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

The so called "dividend puzzle" has prompted many researchers to examine industry-specific factors in order to explain the dividend behaviors of various industries. However, due to the unique differences in characteristics between franchise and non-franchise restaurants, it may not be appropriate to view the restaurant industry as one entity displaying homogenous dividend behaviors. In this regard, this study investigated the role of franchising in explaining the dividend behaviors of the restaurant industry. The results of this study demonstrate that the dividend behaviors of franchise restaurants are a function of the size of institutional holdings and prior dividend payments, while those of non-franchise restaurants depend on the degree of growth opportunity and financial leverage. The findings further imply that franchise restaurants with higher free cash flows and the resulting information asymmetry closely follow agency theory and signaling theory, whereas non-franchise restaurants with insufficient internal cash strictly follow the pecking order theory.

This paper investigates how foreign ownership shapes bank information environments. Using a sample of listed banks from 60 countries over 1997-2012, we show that foreign ownership is significantly associated with greater (lower) informativeness (synchronicity) in bank stock prices. We also find that stock returns of foreign-owned banks reflect more information about future earnings. In addition, the positive association between price informativeness and foreign ownership is stronger for foreign-owned banks in countries with stronger governance, stronger banking supervision, and lower monitoring costs. Overall, our evidence suggests that foreign ownership reduces bank opacity by exporting governance, yielding important implications for regulators and governments.

Research Question/Issue: Concentrated ownership is more the rule than the exception in weak institutional environments, and the absence of external control mechanisms, leading to ineffective legal enforcement, intensifies principal-principal agency issues. Our study examines how the structuring of the corporate board plays a vital role in informing foreign investors about the risk of being expropriated, which affects their decisions to make equity investments in firms in weak institutional regimes. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of large listed Indian firms in the period 2010-2014, we hypothesize that the presence of affiliate directors on the board has a negative impact on foreign investments. Likewise, the presence of controlling owners-directors on the board together with chief executive officers' additional directorial positions has an inverted U-shaped impact on foreign investments. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By making use of agency theory and focusing on the importance of foreign financing, our study highlighted the factors that deter foreign investors from providing capital to firms in weak institutional regimes. The use of this theoretical perspective, by emphasizing the differences in agency problems prevalent in strong versus weak institutional regimes, further suggested that examination of the structure of corporate boards is an important way to detect and gauge the potential for expropriation in countries suffering from weaknesses in investor protection. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our study has important implications for corporations operating in markets suffering from a legal environment that offers little investor protection. Investors are less prone to invest in these countries, as the risk of expropriation by dominant shareholders means they cannot be sure of actually getting the putative return. Our work shows how corporations can structure their boards effectively to convince investors that they face less danger of expropriation and so attract foreign capital. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Governance theories impact how corporations are run, which in turn impacts societal well-being. This dynamic is commonly accepted, as evidenced by the flood of articles exploring the links between corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (e.g., Hong et al. in J Bus Ethics 136:199-213, 2016). This article supplements current corporate governance theories with Catholic social thought (CST) to address burgeoning societal issues such as the increasing trust gap, income inequality (the compensation gap), and an overemphasis on financial compensation as the primary way to motivate senior managers. The authors propose a shift away from agency theory and stakeholder theory, both of which, with their limited depictions of the motivations of managers, have contributed to excessive executive compensation. Instead, the authors develop an alternative--justice stewardship theory--which integrates organizational justice theory, the principles of stewardship theory, and the insights of 150 years of CST.

Agency theory argues that pay for performance alleviates the conflict of interest between managers and shareholders. Furthermore, the literature finds that institutional monitoring tends to promote the performance-pay linkage, thus aligning the two parties' incentives. We find that executive compensation rigidity is negatively and significantly associated with firm value. Moreover, ownership by long-term institutional investors reduces the pay rigidity of top managers in underperforming firms, thus decreasing the value-destroying effect of the rigidity. Overall, these results reaffirm the role of institutional monitoring in mitigating managerial rent extraction. (c) 2019 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association

This study aims to examine the direct and moderating effects of the chief executive officer's (CEO) decision horizon and the board governance on a firm's entry into new technological fields, respectively. In a sample of 1727 firm-year observations for 156 Taiwanese firms in the semiconductor and optoelectronics industries for the period of 2003-2014, we found that the longer the CEO decision horizon, the more eager the focal firm is to enter new technological fields. Such a relationship is also strengthened by board power characterized by boards dominated by more outside directors, but weakened by board homogeneity of industry background. The configurational analysis further reveals that board homogeneity outweighs board power in reducing the positive influence of the CEO decision horizon on technological entry. This study not only contributes to the behavioral agency theory by infusing and testing CEO decision horizon to enhance predictions of the incidence of entering into new technological fields, but also reveals the contextual influences of board governance on executive risk taking. In addition, this study cautions against drawing a simple governance solution in support of a firm's technological entry. We point out different governance arrangements in which the CEO decision horizon will encourage more active technological entries in an environment of incessant changes. (c) 1988-2012 IEEE.

We examine the relationship between disproportionate insider control, enabled through dual-class share structures, and the demand for audit quality. Using a comprehensive hand-collected sample of U.S. dual-class firms, we find that, consistent with outside shareholders' increased demand for external monitoring, as well as selfbonding by entrenched insiders, disproportionate insider control is positively associated with the propensity to hire a Big 4 or industry specialist auditor, auditor independence, and audit fees. Corroborating a self-bonding explanation, additional analyses show that audit quality mitigates the negative association of disproportionate insider control and firm value. In expanded analyses, we also investigate the separate effects of insider voting and cash flow rights on the demand for audit quality in dual-class firms. Consistent with general agency theory, we find a decreased (increased) demand for audit quality from incentive-alignment (entrenchment) effects of ownership.

This chapter provides a critical narrative literature review with the aim of answering the following research question: What are the main theoretical perspectives in the academic literature on integrated reporting? We analysed the academic papers published on international accounting and finance journals from January 2000 to September 2017, focusing on 62 articles that explicitly refer to one or more theories. We found that 28 different theories are mentioned and the most used are stakeholder theory, institutional theory, legitimacy theory, impression management theory, and agency theory. We also presented an embryonic draft of a conceptual model, structured in four components: theories of the firm, purposes and users, types of integrated reporting, and value creation and distribution. We deem that this draft should be developed in future research to achieve a comprehensive conceptual model, inclusive of all explored theories and able to support future academic research, practice, and policies.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the relationship between board interlocks and monitoring effectiveness for listed German companies in a context of risk governance. While agency-theory and resource-dependence-theory suggest a positive association between board interlocks and monitoring effectiveness, reasons such as limited temporal resources of busy board members may suggest a negative association. Design/methodology/approach: By using panel data regression, the authors examined the association between board interlocks and monitoring effectiveness, which was approximated by excessive management compensation, pay-for-performance-sensitivity and CEO turnover-performance-sensitivity. The data set comprises 3,998 directorships for 132 listed German companies covering the period 2015-2017. Findings: The authors find that board interlocks are associated with not only a more excessive management pay and less performance-sensitive turnover but also a higher pay-for-performance-sensitivity. Originality/value: The study examines the impact of multiple directorships based on a German panel data set that includes both multiple appointments of members to national supervisory boards and all other appointments to national and international executive and supervisory bodies. The authors compile three measures to operationalize monitoring effectiveness. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Prior research in agency theory views outside directors as being mostly extrinsically motivated by the potential for financial rewards, and as such stresses the value of using director stock options and equity to incentivize outside directors to pursue strategic risks. We draw on and extend agency-theory by arguing that outside directors are primarily intrinsically motivated, and therefore excessive emphasis on pecuniary rewards and punishments can ironically subvert a director's motives away from strategic risk-taking. In particular, we claim that more important than extrinsic rewards and government regulations is creating a secure environment for directors so that they may exercise their fiduciary duties without fear of litigation. We test our theory on a sample of 196 S&P 500 firms from 2005 to 2015 and find that the pressures imposed on the board through external regulations and controls can often backfire and result in outside directors signing off on less risky expenditure. A strong implication of these findings is no real substitute exists to creating a safe environment for directors, where they have the freedom to pursue the long-term interests of the principals, even if this goes against the short-termism of capital markets.

We investigate private firms' ability to identify and replace poorly performing managers across countries. We document three main findings. First, private firms are more likely to retain poorly performing managers in countries where legal institutions that protect minority investors are weak. Second, private firms are more likely to retain poorly performing managers than public firms only in countries where governance mechanisms inherent in public equity markets limit managerial entrenchment in public firms. Third, private firm managers are less likely to be replaced even when poor performance continues for relatively long horizons. Overall, our findings provide new evidence on the potential vulnerability of minority shareholders in private firms. (c) 2019, Academy of International Business.

This paper examines the relationship between leverage, debt maturity and firm performance, employing a large panel of Chinese non-financial listed firms. The corporate finance literature widely recognizes that the debt and maturity structures are important mechanisms for addressing agency problems in modern corporations. We applied the system GMM estimator to control for endogeneity concerns in the study. We found positive associations between leverage and the proportion of long term debt, and between leverage and firm performance. Our results indicate that leverage and its maturity structure are important determinants of the profitability of Chinese listed firms. Our research has significant policy implications as it suggests that, since China's financial system is dominated by a large banking system, lenders (mainly banks) may extend more long term credit to the more productive private sector, which helps to improve performance of these firms. The findings of this study imply that the Chinese government's efforts to improve the governance of its banking system have been successful in enhancing efficiency and prudence in banks' lending and monitoring behavior.

This article develops and empirically tests a predictive model for audit of fraud detection with practical applications for audit operations. By analyzing real-life accounting data, the proposed model can identify anomalous transactions and directly focus on exceptions for further investigation in real time, thus offering a significant reduction in manual intervention and processing time in audit operations. Our approach is a highly desirable supplement to the existing rule-based models, given the growing use of information technology for analytics in auditing. The proposed approach is based on classification. Following the tenets of the principal agency theory, we discuss how our approach can help to reduce monitoring and contracting costs, disincentivize fraud, improve auditor efficiency and independence, and increase audit quality. We contribute to the current literature by discussing the implications of data-driven audit on the moderating role of auditors in principal-agent relationships and providing practical insights into the operational aspects of financial reporting and auditing, modeling of fraud-detection classification models, and benefits, barriers, and enablers of implementing data driven audit in companies.

Although the link between managerial ownership and firm performance is often explained in relation to a firm's risk-taking behavior, little is known about how managerial ownership affects corporate risk-taking in industries characterized by high financial and operational risks, like the restaurant industry. To understand this important and understudied link, our study draws upon agency theory to examine the relationship between managerial ownership and franchising, typically a risk-reduction strategy of restaurant firms. Our results from panel data analyses using a sample of 962 firm-year observations show that managerial ownership is negatively associated with degree of franchising. Further, we find that after considering the scope of managerial discretion, there is a U-shaped relationship between managerial ownership and degree of franchising such that the degree of franchising decreases as managerial ownership increases up to a certain level, but then increases in tandem as managerial ownership increases to higher levels. Our results indicate that there is an optimal level of franchising associated with managerial ownership, implying that owners can influence their firms' risk-taking behavior by setting target managerial ownership goals and designing effective incentive contracts.

The Problem: Agency theory has been empirically studied in other fields of study such as economics, political science, sociology, and management. Although a proposal for inclusion of agency theory to test training and development outcomes was made in human resource development (HRD)-related publications, little research has been conducted and published in HRD-related literature. The Solution: This review of agency theory offers a description of the elements and factors associated with the principal-agent relationship that have been theorized and empirically tested in other fields of study. Much of the theoretical implications are transferable to HRD. The principal-agent relationship should be empirically tested in HRD situations and interpreted through an HRD lens. The Stakeholders: The review of the principal-agent relationship in other fields is expected to benefit HRD researchers, practitioners, principals, and agents in organizations by providing insight into the orientation, elements, and influence of principal-agent relationships.

Purpose: This study aims to develop a conceptual model and assess the extent to which pre-, during- and post-employment HR security controls are applied in organizations to manage information security risks. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual model is developed based on the agency theory and the review of theoretical, empirical and practitioner literature. Following, empirical data are collected through a survey from 134 IT professionals, internal audit personnel and HR managers working within five major industry sectors in a developing country to test the organizational differences in pre-, during- and post-employment HR security measures. Findings: Using analysis of variance, the findings reveal significant differences among the organizations. Financial institutions perform better in employee background checks, terms and conditions of employment, management responsibilities, security education, training and awareness and disciplinary process. Conversely, healthcare institutions outperform other organizations in post-employment security management. The government public institutions perform the worst among all the organizations. Originality/value: An integration of a conceptual model with HR security controls is an area that is under-researched and under-reported in information security and human resource management literature. Accordingly, this research on HR security management contributes to reducing such a gap and adds to the existing HR security risk management literature. It, thereby, provides an opportunity for researchers to conduct comparative studies between developed and developing nations or to benchmark a specific organization's HR security management.

The paper aims to evaluate the combination of strategies that influence the success of New Technology Based Firms (NTBFs) located in isolated areas with resource constraints. We utilize the Kauffman Firm Survey to construct a subset of 224 firms operating in primary metal manufacturing industries and who are located in non-thriving areas. We focus on the impact of technological strategy, in the form of Inward Technology Licensing (ITL), combined with financial strategy, in the form of increased financial slack. Using a negative binomial-specification technique to model these relations, we find that ITL positively impacts internal innovation in the firm and this relation is strengthened by the presence of greater financial slack. This positive impact of financial slack supports the behavioral theory of the firm rather than agency theory in that financial slack enables further innovation rather than stifling it. This research confirms the importance of resource acquisition, suggesting that entrepreneurs may utilize external sources of knowledge in an effort to build a favorable situation when facing the challenges of location. Finally, by presenting evidence showing the compatibility of a financial strategy with a knowledge strategy (ITL), this study emphasizes the importance to entrepreneurs of choosing the proper combination of varying strategies.

Scholars have long studied drivers of entrepreneurial behavior among established firms. Yet little is known about how individual factors shape a firm's choice to pursue entrepreneurship. We draw on behavioral agency theory to explore the role of equity incentives in driving corporate entrepreneurship. Our findings suggest CEOs avoid corporate entrepreneurial behaviors as their option wealth increases. However industry dynamics also prove to be an important contingency when predicting the effects of both restricted stock and stock options on the likelihood that the CEO engages in corporate entrepreneurship. Our findings provide a theoretical platform for predicting dimensions of entrepreneurial behavior and highlight effects of CEO equity ownership.

This study confirms that a firm's size in the previous year significantly increases board of director compensation in the current year, while the number of directors and the firm's capital expenditure significantly decrease it. On average, 31.2% of restaurant firms overcompensate their board of directors, while 33.8% pay less than the expected amount of compensation to their board of directors. However, contrary to public concern, this study argues that the amounts of over- and under-compensation are negligible in proportion to the directors' total compensation, and thus the issue of over- and under-compensation may not pose a serious problem in the restaurant industry. In particular, the amount of overcompensation has a positive effect on firm growth and capital investment, but does not substantially decrease firms' operational and financial performance. The amount of overcompensation can even have a positive influence on financial performance, although the effect is not statistically significant. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Studies in developed economies show that family-owned non-financial firms outperform others, explained by agency theory and protection of family capital. Findings in emerging economies are equivocal, while studies of family domination and banks' performance are scant. This paper examines the profit-performance of family-dominated banks in Bangladesh under competing hypotheses of bank-market structure. Using panel estimation, we model the profit-performance of banks and show that the principal drivers are costs, efficiency and non-performing loans. Family-dominated banks are less efficient and less profitable. The sources of weaker performance are higher non-performing loans and higher costs, with indirect evidence of poor corporate governance.

Scholars argue that the agency theory has some limitations as the sustaining theory of governance. It is its inability to distinguish the wider stakeholder influencing forces effecting on organisations. This paper delivers a concise picture incorporating other management-based theories to supplement agency theory in distinguishing the wider stakeholder influencing forces as well as the consequential extended governance standard it creates. Yet, for developing the theory building approach it has reviewed and critically examined the existing literatures. Furthermore, a circumstance is built to assimilate four existing theories that supplement each other to distinguish the wider stakeholder influencing forces. Finally, further studies have been recommended to certify the approach with wide-ranging real life institutional settings.

This study investigates firm characteristics that may affect the IAF's quality characteristics: size, independence, methodology, and competence. Its motivation is that a firm's agency and economic costs can affect its way to invest in the IAF quality. In this study, a postal questionnaire survey was sent to the head of internal audit (HIA) in 213 UK non-financial companies with in-source IAF, and archival data were collected from the respondent companies' annual reports. The study found that a firm's size and the proportion of cash flows from its operations are positively associated with the IAF's quality characteristics, a suggestion that a high quality IAF is an important way of compensating for the direct loss of control and of managing internal agency risks. In addition, it found evidence that having a high quality IAF is a costly process; the level of debt had a significant negative association with the IAF's quality characteristics. Furthermore, the supporting OLS regression revealed a positive significant association between the effectiveness of the audit committee and the quality characteristics of the IAF. This study has important implications for both practice and future internal auditing research and provides a composite measure that can be used to assess IAF quality.

The dividend puzzle remains an interesting subject especially in emerging markets where agency problem is severe. This study examines the issues by assessing the large shareholders controlling interest in manager owned firms and corporation owned firms. A sample data of 762 Malaysian public listed firms covering the period from 2008 to 2014 are examined. The results show a statistically significant non-linear relationship between the largest shareholder (LO) and dividend payout for manager owned (MO) firms. MO firms reduce dividend distribution according to assets and revenue when the largest shareholder's controlling stake is low. However, at a higher level of controlling stake, MO firms increase dividend distribution, irrespective of firms share prices, assets and revenues. The study shows that corporation owned (CO) firms do not associate significantly with the dividend payout, but MO firms pursue different types of dividend distribution policies. Lastly, there is a need to improve the role of the second largest shareholder as a governance mechanism. (c) 2019, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a bandwagon effect of special dividends in United States industries. Specifically, we investigate whether the predictions of the information-signalling hypothesis or the agency theory account for the special dividend behaviour at the industry-level. Out of a broad sample of publicly listed firms in the US market, our results show that rival firms in concentrated industries follow other firms' special dividend announcements. The intra-industry effects of special dividend events indicate positive contagion effects on a rival firm's abnormal returns. Our findings lend credence to the information-signalling hypothesis, rather than to agency theory. This is because special dividends act as signals to convey information to the market on the sustainability of growing industry-wide earnings. The propensity to follow occurs because of industry homogeneity: comparable firms aim to validate the industry signal. (c) 2019

Purpose: Motivated by agency theory, this paper aims to explore the impact of bank diversification and bank independency on the likelihood of bank failure. The effects of corporate governance (ownership and board structures) are also examined. Design/methodology/approach: Logistic regressions are used to explore the role of corporate governance on bank failure risk. This sample covers 608 banks from eight European countries. Findings: The results suggest that the well-documented finding that diversification and bank independency may increase bank failure risk does not persist under strong corporate governance mechanism. Thus, to reduce the bank failure risk, diversification should be strongly monitored by the management to avoid excessive risk-taking by shareholders. Originality/value: The approach used in this study differs from that used in previous studies from certain perspectives. First, unlike most previous studies that focused on the relationship between bank performance and bank diversification, the impact of income and asset diversification on bank failure is tested. Also, the impact of a combined effect of diversification and corporate governance variables on bank failure is tested. This allows the control for different ownership and board variables as factors that would potentially affect the likelihood of bank failure. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Random (GLS) and fixed (LSDV) effects models were applied in identifying the insignificant positive effects of CEO duality into microfinance sustainability and the negative effects on outreach of the poor. Results indicate that the structure of board leadership, have positive effects on the sustainability performance of microfinance but have negative effects on outreach performance. The findings contribute to the microfinance governance literature on board leadership and its effects on the dual performance of microfinance.

Emerging from the agency theory, corporate governance is the practice of ensuring a corporation conducts itself accountably, fairly and openly in all its dealings. The achievement of corporate performance relies on the mechanism efficiency of Corporate Governance both internally and externally. This study is intended to review the Canadian legal and practical landscape related to corporate governance and its external and internal mechanisms. One of the main goals of corporate governance is to ensure a company's executives are managing the finances effectively and that they always act in the best interest of stakeholders. Canada passed a law in 2003 to strengthen corporate governance. Based on the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), this Canadian law aims to create confidence in the Canadian market and protect investors from corporate scandals. Corporate governance mechanisms can be divided into internal and external mechanisms. The internal mechanism is essentially derived from the board of directors and its committees whereas the external mechanism is derived from laws and regulation, capital market, corporate control market, stock holders (ownership structure), and investor activities. The balance and effectiveness of the corporate governance mechanisms can create a better corporate financial performance. (c) 2019 The Authors.

We empirically investigate the largely unexplored relationship between corporate top management teams (TMT) and CVC unit managers. Doing so, we provide new insights into the interplay between TMT decisions and CVC managers' behaviour and how agency conflicts between them influence the survival of CVC units. Using a proprietary dataset of 64 CVC units we apply fsQCA in order to identify the interrelatedness, causal asymmetry and equifinality of agency-related conditions leading to survival. We relativise former literature by demonstrating that financial incentivisation of CVC managers need to be complemented by additional factors to impact the survival of CVC units. Further, we conclude that the decision-making autonomy of CVC managers seem to work as a form of non-financial incentive. Finally, we demonstrate that the configuration of providing strategic support, investing with high strategic proximity, and non-autonomously acting CVC managers is related to non-survival of the CVC unit.

Ownership structure proves to be one of the major factors affecting company accounting and market-based performance. The current study explored the direct ownership structure characteristics-performance relationship, with the former including government ownership, foreign ownership, and institutional ownership. The target sample of the study comprised of Omani non-financial firms examined in a three-year period. In addition, the study explored the moderating role of audit quality on the relationship between ownership structure and ROA, while considering the role of leverage as a control variable. The OLS regression was adopted to examine the direct government, ownership, foreign ownership and institutional ownership relationship with ROA, whereas the Hierarchical Multiple Regression was adopted to examine audit quality role as a moderating variable on the direct relationships. The obtained results revealed a significant and positive relationship between government ownership and foreign ownership and ROA, but an insignificant one between ROA and institutional ownership. The results also did not support the examined moderating role of audit quality on the above direct relationships. Towards the end, the study enumerated recommendations for future work. (c) 2019 KIIE

This study investigates the impact of insider-ownership of publicly traded firms on their performance, cost of debt (COD) and cost of equity. We use a sample of 104 non-finance listed companies of Pakistan for the period from 2006 to 2016. Our study is conducted in Pakistan as a developing country in which insider-ownership is dominant, and a weak external corporate governance mechanism increases the payoffs from insider-ownership. We use feasible generalized least square (FGLS) regression methods to examine these hypotheses. Based on agency theory, we find that insider-ownership enhances firm performance. Furthermore, our results show that insider-ownership reduced the COD and equity. Higher ownership decreases the opportunistic behavior of insiders. It also reduces the creditor's perception of the likelihood of default on loan payments and reduces agency issues among shareholders. The insider will invest in positive NPV projects which will help maximize shareholders' wealth and minimize the COD. Similarly, the relationship between insider-ownership and cost of equity is significant but negative. Supporting the convergence of interest increase in ownership helps in aligning the goals of managers and stakeholders whereby the insider will focus on value creation by minimizing equity cost.

The financing decision among technology-based firms has become a significant issue around the globe, with the core concern to be that such firms may encounter financing limitations that could bar their growth ability. Using 92 technology-based firms observations from 2009-2012 and employing ordinary least square (OLS) regression, this study finds that there is a significant and positive relationship between board of directors' effectiveness and capital structure, and there is an inverse significant relationship between information asymmetry and capital structure. This indicates that technology-based firms having a robust board of directors minimise agency conflicts by mandating that managers, use more debts to be consistent with the interest of the shareholders. This is consistent with the agency theory where the obligation of interest payments that stem from the debt use assists in resolving the free cash flow issue. Further, the inverse relationship with information asymmetry shows that technology-based firms go through financing limitations owing to the asymmetric information that prevent their growth and development ability.

This chapter analyses the relationship between ownership structure and leverage, providing an integrated theoretical approach that combines traditional financial theories, agency theory, and recently developed theories relating to non-financial preferences. The results show that, after controlling for endogeneity, being a family firm has a positive effect on the propensity to incur debt. These findings add to the existing body of literature and underline the need for a multi-theoretical approach when explaining the capital structure of family firms. The authors apply panel data methodology to control for individual heterogeneity of family firms. The chapter uses a sample of Spanish firms operating in the tourism industry. (c) 2020, IGI Global.

Research Question: This is an investigation of board independence to determine whether management shares information with the board, or withholds information to retain autonomy. A key contribution is to examine the interaction of institutional ownership with the main test variables to determine whether institutional governance influences the information environment as board independence is increased. Research Findings: The results show that information asymmetry decreases internally and increases externally as board independence increases, yet institutional ownership appears to moderate or reverse this relationship. The following variables are used to explain why managers of firms are likely to have more information than outsiders: sticky SG&A costs, bid-ask spread, and forecast error. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The desired oversight from independent board members appears to be associated with reduced transparency between the firm and investors. Information sharing is lower for increased board independence when the firm's ownership is less sophisticated. Practitioner/Policy Implications: These findings suggest that requiring increased board independence may reflect reduced transparency for firms with less institutional ownership. Further research should be conducted on the influence of institutional ownership on board member selection, and the relationship between management and board members appointed with institutional support.

Integrated reporting is the latest novelty in the corporate reporting field. It is a tool capable of better representing the capacity of companies to create value over time. In recent years, attention to this new reporting tool has grown in both professional and academic fields. However, despite past research that has analysed many aspects of integrated reporting, the integrated reporting quality and its determinants are still little explored. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing the effect of board characteristics on integrated reporting quality according to an agency theory approach. The findings, based on a sample of 134 international firms, show a positive relationship between the size, independence, diversity, and activity of a board with integrated reporting quality. This study contributes to enriching literature in this area in various ways. First, it broadens the scope of application of agency theory; second, it identifies further internal determinants of integrated reporting quality. This is the first study that analyses the impact of the characteristics of a board as a determining factor of integrated reporting quality. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

Drawing on the agency theory perspective and following the recent calls to contemplate multiple dimensions of diversity simultaneously, this study intends to empirically investigate the effects of board diversity as a multifaceted phenomenon, specifically nationality and gender diversity on the extent of corporate sustainability performance in a developing country, namely, Palestine over the period 2013 to 2018. Empirical evidence on the connection between board diversity and corporate sustainability performance from countries influenced by cultural and traditional terms is remarkably limited. This study handled this research gap and went beyond the narrow and pre-conceived perspectives. Thereby, contributes theoretically and practically to the corporate sustainability literature by providing in-depth insights about board diversity and corporate sustainability-related activities as paradigmatic evidence from a developing country with an exceptional cultural environment of business. The ambiguous findings are often deemed a consequence of endogeneity problem. Therefore, to provide a thorough and profound analysis, two-step system GMM are performed. Additionally, our findings are robust since four proxies for nationality and gender diversity are employed. The results unveiled that corporate sustainability-related actions are positively and insignificantly affected by nationality and gender diversity. This weak nexus between the two mechanisms is widely attributed to so-called geographically proximate cultures and gender discrimination in the workplace. These empirical results provide a useful and multidimensional insights for regulatory parties, companies, and different groups of stakeholders to promote the link between board diversity and corporate sustainability beyond the current boundaries.

Integrated reporting (IR) is used to demonstrate a firm's capacity to create value in the short, medium, and long term. It can better represent existing relationships between the company and its stakeholders, with a particular focus on investors. Attention to IR has grown considerably in recent years. However, studies on the determinants of IR quality are still limited. This study aims to bridge this literature gap by being the first study to analyse the role of ownership structure in IR context. To this end, it uses agency theory and is based on a sample of 152 international companies that have adopted IR. The results indicate a positive effect of institutional ownership and a negative effect of ownership concentration, managerial ownership and state ownership on the quality of integrated reports. These results are also consistent with the level of alignment of integrated reports with the <IR> framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study that analyses the role of ownership structure in the IR policies. (c) 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Research question/issue: Using a multitheoretic view of boards, this study examines the impact of boardroom gender diversity (BGD) on voluntary intellectual capital (IC) disclosure in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses in China--the world's second-biggest economy, which is moving from a planned economy to a market-oriented one. Furthermore, this study also investigates the impact of family ownership on the relationship between BGD and IC disclosure in the Chinese environment, which is characterized by less-developed corporate governance mechanisms. Research findings/insights: Based on a comprehensive content analysis of Chinese IPO prospectuses between 2009 and 2017 and measuring disclosure index at 78 dimensions under six broad categories of IC, the empirical results document (a) a significant positive relation between BGD and IC disclosure--in line with resource dependence theory, (b) a significant negative impact of female independent directors on IC disclosure--opposite to agency theory predictions, and that (c) the BGD-IC disclosure relationship is generally stronger for firms with two or more women on boards--in line with critical mass theory in China. Finally, this study also reveals that family ownership has adverse impacts on the BGD-IC disclosure relationship. These results are robust to a battery of sensitivity analyses. Practitioner/policy implications: This study provides positive capital market implications of BGD through enhanced IC disclosure in IPO prospectuses. In doing so, the study has important implications for regulators and top management teams in devising policies concerning female representation on boards and voluntary disclosure of IC to inform the market participants of the true value of the company.

Purpose: This study aims to analyse the role that the chief executive officer (CEO) has on integrated reporting (IR) adoption and whether this role is moderated by incentives to promote corporate transparency, including information asymmetry problems and financial constraints. IR represents the last frontier of corporate disclosure and aims to represent, through the annual integrated report, the ability of an organization to create value over time. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on 10,819 observations (an unbalanced data panel of 1,588 firms for the period 2009-2017). A logistic regression model is used to examine the association between CEO power and disclosure of an integrated report. Findings: The results show that CEOs with greater power oppose the disclosure of integrated information, and this behaviour is not modified by firms' incentives. Furthermore, greater growth opportunities increase CEO opposition to disclosing integrated information on the creation of value, perhaps as a consequence of the possible use of it by competitors. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature. First, it expands the scientific debate on the topic of IR. Second, it extends the application field of agency theory, which is seldom used to explain the phenomena related to IR. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Intellectual capital is an important tool for strengthening a firm's competitive advantage and helping it achieve its medium- and long-term financial objectives. Currently accepted accounting principles do not outline strict rules and regulations for intellectual capital disclosure. However, the advent of integrated reporting offer firms an innovative tool to disseminate this information. Although previous research has analysed the intellectual capital found in integrated reports, no studies have analysed the board of directors' role in intellectual capital disclosure policies. This study uses agency theory to analyse the effect of board characteristics on intellectual capital disclosure quality (ICDQ) in the context of integrated reporting. To this end, it develops a new scoring system to measure ICDQ. The results, based on a sample of 130 international firms operating in different sectors, show a positive relationship between board size, independence, diversity and activity with ICDQ.

Purpose: Motivated by the agency theory, this study aims to empirically examine the nexus between board attributes and a firm's financing decisions of non-financial listed firms in Palestine and how the previous relationship is moderated and shaped by the level of gender diversity. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis on a panel data was used. Further, we applied three different approaches of static panel data "pooled OLS, fixed effect and random effect." Fixed-effects estimator was selected as the optimal and most appropriate model. In addition, to control for the potential endogeneity problem and to profoundly analyze the study data, the authors perform the one-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. Dynamic panel GMM specification was superior in generating robust findings. Findings: The findings clearly unveil that all explanatory variables in the study model have a significant influence on the firm's financing decisions. Moreover, the results report that the impact of board size and board independence are more positive under conditions of a high level of gender diversity, whereas the influence of CEO duality on the firm's leverage level turned from negative to positive. In a nutshell, gender diversity moderates the effect of board structure on a firm's financing decisions. Research limitations/implications: This study was restricted to one institutional context (Palestine); therefore, the results reflect the attributes of the Palestinian business environment. In this vein, it is possible to generate different findings in other countries, particularly in developed markets. Practical implications: The findings of this study can draw responsible parties and policymakers' attention in developing countries to introduce and contextualize new mechanisms that can lead to better monitoring process and help firms in attracting better resources and establishing an optimal capital structure. For instance, entities should mandate a minimum quota for the proportion of women incorporation in boardrooms. Originality/value: This study provides empirical evidence on the moderating role of gender diversity on the effect of board structure on firm's financing decisions, something that was predominantly neglected by the earlier studies and has not yet examined by ancestors. Thereby, to protrude nuanced understanding of this novel and unprecedented idea, this study thoroughly bridges this research gap and contributes practically and theoretically to the existing corporate governance-capital structure literature.

Purpose: The purpose of this research is to examine whether board gender diversity reduces the agency costs of firms in the context of Chinese listed firms. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a large sample of 23,340 firm-year observations of Chinese listed companies during 2004-2017. The authors use ordinary least squares regressions as the primary methodology with a wide range of methods to control for endogeneity and to check robustness, including the fixed-effect method, instrumental variable approach, lagged gender diversity measures, propensity score matching, Blau index, Shannon index and industry-adjusted measures of agency costs. Findings: The evidence reveals that the participation of female directors in corporate board reduces agency costs, which correlates with conflicts of interest. Moreover, gender-diverse boards are more effective in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), in which agency issues are more severe. Female directors also provide better monitoring roles in more-developed areas. Finally, corporate boards that have a critical mass of female directors have a greater tendency to reduce agency costs as compared to their token participation. Overall, all findings support the validity of agency theory. Practical implications: This study shows the economic benefit of female directors in the boardroom by reducing agency costs and by improving firms' governance structure. Regarding the government, which is gradually introducing board gender diversity policies, this study provides valuable pragmatic information for Chinese regulators on this issue. Originality/value: This study extends the literature by providing evidence that gender diversity in boardroom matters for shareholders' wealth maximization. It provides novel evidence that a critical mass of female directors is more effective in reducing agency costs compared to a single female on the board, and that the effect of gender diversity varies in relation to ownership structure and region.

Directive 2014/95/EU (the EU Directive) requires large companies to disclose information on the way they operate and manage social and environmental challenges, thus shifting the disclosure of non-financial information (NFI) from the voluntary to the mandatory realm. Building on the idea that regulatory changes can shape stakeholder expectations, we hypothesized that legitimacy (agency) theory's ability to predict NFI disclosure after the implementation of the EU Directive, and hence after NFI disclosure became mandatory, would decrease (increase). By relying on a hand-collected data set measuring NFI disclosure, we have found that legitimacy theory maintains its predictive ability in the new mandatory setting, while agency theory's predictive ability partially increases.

The discourse of corporate sustainability performance (CSP) has created an increasing motivation for companies to improve their competitive advantage. This study examines the drivers leading to a high level of CSP within non-financial Turkish companies listed in the Borsa Istanbul Sustainability Index. Drawing on both stakeholder and agency theories, we formulate a set of hypotheses that link CSP with ownership structure, board diversity, and firm-specific characteristics. Based on logit and probit models, the empirical results tend to confirm the positive influence of foreign and institutional ownerships in shaping CSP and indicate that CSP is positively linked with board size and the proportion of independent board members. Further, the findings show that companies with a leading level of CSP have a lower return than companies with mediocre CSP based on a market-based measure, Tobin's Q. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to the existing capital structure and board structure literature by examining the relationship among corporate governance, ownership structure and capital structure. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a panel data of 595 firm-year observations from a unique and comprehensive data set of 119 Chinese real estate listed firms from 2014 to 2018. It uses fixed effect and random effect regression analysis techniques to examine the hypotheses. Findings: The results show that the board size, ownership concentration and firm size have positive influences on capital structure. State ownership and firm profitability have inverse influences on capital structure. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that better-governed companies in the real estate sector tend to have better capital structure. These findings highlight the unique Chinese context and also offer regulators a strong incentive to pursue corporate governance reforms formally and jointly with the ownership structure. Finally, the results suggest investors the chance to shape detailed expectations about capital structure behavior in China. Future research could investigate capital structure using different arrangement, conducting face-to-face meetings with the firm's directors and shareholders. Practical implications: The findings offer support to corporate managers and investors in forming or/and expecting an optimal capital structure and to policymakers and regulators for ratifying laws and developing institutional support to improve the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms. Originality/value: This paper extends, as well as contributes to the current capital structure and corporate governance literature, by proposing new evidence on the effect of board structure and ownership structure on capital structure. The results will help policymakers in different countries in estimating the sufficiency of the available corporate governance reforms to improve capital structure management.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate governance of Oman's financial sector companies. Intellectual capital has been found to successfully contribute to the economic wealth creation of firms in germane literature. Unfortunately, financial statements do not necessarily capture and reflect the contributions of intellectual capital, thereby leading to an information asymmetry between companies and users of financial statements. The research also investigates the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital efficiency across various financial subsectors. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports available on Muscat Securities Market for 31 listed financial sector companies for the period 2012 to 2016 and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Intellectual capital is measured using Pulic's efficiency measure of value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). Corporate governance individual components such as board characteristics, audit committee characteristics and ownership structure are presented as independent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that board size and frequency of audit committee meetings have a significant association with the intellectual capital efficiency of Oman's financial sector. VAIC and human capital efficiency of banks are also significantly influenced by most of the corporate governance mechanisms; however, other subsectors do not report such findings. Corporate governance of banks in comparison to other subsectors effectively engages in utilizing the potential of intellectual capital efficiency. Agency theory and resource dependency theory find limited support as a result of this study. The GMM results are not robust to the alternative instruments. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small as the study is limited to the listed financial sector of Oman. Future studies can be extended to include all of Oman's or GCC's listed companies. Additionally, the intellectual capital is measured using the construct of VAIC which suffers some limitations and can be overcome using other tools such as content analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that Oman's regulators can create an awareness strategy on highlighting the importance of intellectual capital for companies (board of directors and managers), investors, debtors and creditors. Further, Oman's Capital Market Authority and Muscat Securities Market need to strengthen the regulations related to intellectual capital. Originality/value: This study extends intellectual capital and corporate governance literature by presenting the research outcome for Oman's financial sector. It is useful for Oman's financial sector companies to direct corporate governance measures for driving value creation of firms through the management of intellectual capital efficiency.

In this paper, we argue that corruption is likely to increase agency costs of equity, hence shareholders have higher incentives to control managers. When corruption is higher, firm managers need to use firm resources to make unofficial payments and they tend to take this opportunity to expropriate shareholders. Consequently, shareholders recognizing this risk need to force managers to pay more dividends in order to mitigate the agency problem. This paper examines the effects of corruption on dividend decisions in the light of agency theory. With a sample of 205,316 observations from 47 countries, we find that corruption is positively related to both the decision to pay dividends and payout ratio. Moreover, this relationship is stronger under strong creditor protection. (c) 2019 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois

This study examines the relationship between corporate non-financial disclosure ratings, the Italian Legislative Decrees 231/2001 and 254/2016, and three outcomes of Italian listed firms: performance, risk and agency cost. Based on stakeholder-agency theory, this study conceptualizes the role of firms' non-financial disclosures in reducing asymmetric information and agency costs between managers and broad stakeholders. Utilizing the Standard Ethics Rating (SER) as a measure of firms' non-financial disclosure rating, this study finds that SER ratings are positively related to firm value and are negatively related to firms' risk and agency costs. This study also provides evidence that the adoption of Italian Legislative Decrees 231/2001 and 254/2016, along with external verifications from the SER of firms' non-financial disclosure, has a positive impact on firm outcomes. Corporate managers and investors should recognize the value added from regulations that foster non-financial disclosures and ratings issued by an independent rating agency (e.g., Standard Ethics) as they both enhance firm performance and reduce risk and agency costs.

Purpose: This study aims to draw on the resource dependence theory to synthesize the conflicting arguments as well as commonalities of the agency and stewardship perspectives on the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 212 large-scale publicly listed companies representing 20 sectors in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings: The research results based on all of 212 publicly listed companies in Sri Lanka show, in support of the agency theory, that CEO duality exerts a negative effect on firm performance when the CEO is equipped with additional informal power. Conversely, CEO duality exhibits a positive effect on firm performance when board involvements are high, a finding that supports the commonalities of the agency and stewardship theoretical perspectives. Practical implications: By examining the governance practices and concepts in an Asian developing economy, this study provides insight into the power dynamics between the CEO and the board of directors in managerial contexts that are largely different from those in western countries. Originality/value: This study expands the theoretical underpinning of corporate governance research by identifying the performance implications of CEO duality within the broad context of the resource provision of the board of directors and the informal power of CEOs.

We identify the theories behind the measures and provide a framework which organises the measures of investment efficiency into three groups: those based on neoclassical theories, agency theory and real options theory. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of each type of measure are discussed, allowing researchers to compare and then ascertain the most appropriate measure for their research purpose and research context.

The effectiveness of the well-known corporate governance practices may not be universal due to fundamental differences in the environments under which firms operate. By using hand-collected data from all the non-financial firms listed on the unexplored East African frontier markets (i.e., Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda), we examine the effect of board characteristics on the performance of firms. Our results show that board size has a negative and significant effect on firm performance. The presences of foreigners and civil servants on the board play positive roles on financial performance, where the agency and resource dependence theories apply. Further, we find that board members with higher education also contribute to firm performance. These findings still hold when we consider the 2008-2009 financial crisis period. Overall, we show that in a business climate where ownership is largely dominated by few shareholders, the conventional governance mechanisms do not work effectively. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the impact of chief executive officer (CEO) duality (a chief executive operating chair of board and leader of a firm) of newly privatized Vietnamese firms on the level of corporate entrepreneurship; this understanding is used to throw light on the extent to which a position of strategic agility is achieved. Specifically, does CEO duality enable firms to keep consistent with their vision, while remaining flexible in their business model? Data from a survey of 114 CEOs of board and top management team members in privatized firms in Vietnam were collected and examined through a combination of agency theory and stewardship theory. The research finds that CEO duality does not necessarily lead to a higher degree of entrepreneurial activity in privatized Vietnamese firms. The results have policy implications for shaping corporate governance and management implications for firms striving to be competitive, in ways that advance corporate entrepreneurship in economies such as Vietnam that are both emerging and pursuing privatization.

We examine the relationship between corporate cash holdings and promoter ownership for a sample of Indian non-financial firms. Consistent with the arguments of the 'efficient monitoring hypothesis', our results broadly suggest that promoter ownership is negatively associated with cash holdings, thereby highlighting the role of large owners in preventing cash accretion in an emerging market context. Indicating prominent influence of corporate ownership on cash management, we find that corporate non-promoter ownership is also negatively related with cash holdings. With regard to promoter ownership of foreign entities, our results suggest that cash holdings share a U-shaped relationship with ownership of foreign promoter corporations. In addition, our findings provide weak evidence to support a more pronounced negative association between cash holdings and promoter ownership for group-affiliated firms as compared to non-affiliated firms since the former faces lower financial constraints on account of access to internal capital markets. Finally, we perform long-term effect analysis in order to reinforce robustness of our results. (c) 2020

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effects of board characteristics, audit committee and risk management on corporate performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 31 Palestinian non-financial listed companies from 2010 to 2016, this study uses a generalized least square method. Findings: The results show that the effects of board ownership, board independence, audit committee meeting, audit committee size, audit committee financial expertise and risk management are positive and significant on corporate performance while the effects of chief executive officer duality and audit committee size are negative and significant on corporate performance. Practical implications: The results of this paper are important to policymakers, shareholders and directors of companies to make appropriate choices about the board, audit committee characteristics and risk management to protect the interest of different stakeholders, increase the flow of capital and foreign investment into non-financial companies. Social implications: This paper fills a gap in the corporate governance literature by investigating the effects of board characteristics, audit committee and risk management on corporate performance in Palestine as one of the youngest stock exchanges in a region that assists in testing the validity of agency theory in a young and small emerging market context. Originality/value: This paper is the first to investigate the effects of board characteristics, audit committee and risk management collectively on corporate performance in Palestine as prior research on these topics has been investigated separately.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption and corporate governance attributes increase the management earnings forecasts' accuracy disclosed in prospectuses for French Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on cross-sectional regression explaining the absolute forecast errors by using 45 French firms that made IPOs between 2005 and 2016 in two French financial markets: Euronext and Alternext. Findings: In agreement with the agency theory and the signaling theory, the authors find that the IFRS adoption and the effective corporate governance, proxied by the board characteristics, increase the accuracy of management forecasts. As a result, this latter gives a credible signal in constructing and sustaining shareholders' trust on the transparency and the reliability of such financial information. Research limitations/implications: It is plausible that the limited size of the sample represents a limitation of this study. Another limitation is that no other corporate governance attributes such as board meeting frequency, audit committee measures and ownership structure are used. Practical implications: Shareholders can take benefit from management forecasts accuracy to structure their investment portfolios efficiently to allocate their funds more effectively and mitigate the costs of adverse selection that they have to face. Furthermore, the authors expect the findings to be interesting to IPO firms, as this study highlights the efficiency of larger and independent boards in decreasing managerial discretion, increasing disclosure quality and supervising management. The results could encourage GAAP-adopters countries to move toward IFRS, as this research reinforces the role of IFRS in enhancing the quality of financial disclosure by offering the required information for shareholders. Originality/value: This study is important because the potential investors should assess management earnings forecasts accuracy before they consider it when evaluating IPO firms. Also, this paper has some implications for the financial market. It is recommended that future investors pay more attention, when assessing the accuracy of management earnings forecasts, to the accounting regulations of the financial reporting along with the corporate governance mechanisms. Moreover, this study could incite French regulators to revise the AFEP-MEDEF code. Under this code, it could insist that larger and independent boards are more effective in performing their governing roles than smaller boards. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We examine the impact of CEO duality on firm performance using the life-cycle theory approach. The data is balanced and covers over the period 2012-2018 for 442 publicly listed firms in Vietnam. The findings from system generalized method of moments (GMM) method indicate that CEO duality had a positive effect on firm performance in growth stage and had a negative effect on the mature stage of the firm's life-cycle. These results are supported by stewardship theory which argues that CEO duality may be good for firm performance in the growth stage due to the unity of presented command. In contrast, agency theory shows CEO duality is bad for firm performance in the maturing stage since it compromises the monitoring and controls the behavior of the CEO. Also, this study shows that there was a difference between state shareholders and director from outside of the company affecting the firm performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of royal family members on firm performance of publicly listed companies in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: Using 491 firm-year observations of non-financial publicly listed firms in Saudi Arabia's stock market between 2009 and 2013, the study employs, besides others, the advanced econometric technique GMM-system estimator. This allows the dynamic nature and control of the endogeneity problem to be accounted for in corporate governance and firm performance. Findings: The main result is that the attendance of royal family members at board meetings negatively influences firm performance but does not have an influence on firm value. The results also show that firms with many independent royal family members on the board of directors have better firm performance and firm value. In addition, firms with a high number of royal family members presenting on the board have better firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study offers guidance to assist the further investigation of the SA Royal Family's BoD membership either in SA or in other monarchy countries. It is interesting to compare these results in order to further understand the different effects that the Royal Family's BoD membership have in such countries. This study's results suggest that independent members of SA's Royal Family on the BoD have some influence on firm performance in both the short and long term. Thus, policymakers should encourage the members of SA's Royal Family to become more involved in firms' BoDs. Practical implications: This study offers guidance for further investigation of royal family members in the region or in other monarchy countries. It will be interesting to compare these results. The study suggests that royal family members on the board have a partial influence on firm performance, especially the independent ones. Thus, the policymakers should encourage more involvement of independent royal family members on the board. Social implications: Foreign and minority investors, who invest in SA's publicly listed firms, should note that when independent members of SA's Royal Family are on the BoD their investment will benefit from the reduced risks and uncertainty. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study undertaken to investigate empirically the influence a royal family's presence on the board of directors has on firm performance. This study is based on both theories, namely the agency theory and resource dependence theory. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study aims to investigate the relationship of board quality, audit quality and audit report lag on firm performance of manufactured Saudi's listed companies. The framework of the study is developed based on the predictions of agency theory and resource dependence theory that board quality, audit quality and audit report lag are associated with the firm performance. This study used 180 observations for the periods ranging from 2015 to 2017. The board quality is measured by two independent variables; board size and board meetings, audit quality is measured by the auditor brand name, the audit report lag is measured by the year-end to the date of the auditor's report, and firm performance is measured by the ROA and ROE. Using the pooled OLS Regression, the results show that out of four hypothesized independent variables, only audit quality has a significant and positive association with firm performance and audit report lag has a negative and significant association with firm performance. Importantly, the study suggests that regulators, especially Saudi stock exchange, should mandate companies to disclose all relevant information related to board and audit in a transparent and timely manner, and increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance practices. For companies, this study proposes that they should emphasize more on enhancing the role and the quality of their board of directors and the audit quality issues, as this enhancement may positively influence their performance.

Michael Jensen made a name for himself in the 1970s-1990 s with his 'agency theory' and its application to questions of corporate governance and economic policy. The effects of his theory were acutely felt in the pedagogics of business studies, as Jensen lent his authority to combat all attempts to integrate social considerations and moral values into business education. Lately, however, Michael Jensen has come to defend quite a different approach, promoting an 'integrity theory' of management learning. Jensen now rather aspires to empower students to give authentic expression to their personal values in their professional lives, and he sees the main function of management studies in assisting them in this effort. This article reconstructs the transformation of Jensen's outlook, drawing on Jensen's theories as an exemplar of wider trends in the current literature on management learning, away from a decidedly 'mechanistic' and towards a more 'humanistic' pedagogy of management. Jensen's case serves to highlight developments that might make for better preconditions for the appreciation of business ethics on part of business students. On closer inspection, though, it appears that his remaining within a positivistic framework ultimately impedes the kind of progress Michael Jensen envisions for business studies.

Corporate voluntary disclosure becomes a burning issue in the literature of accounting throughout the last two decades. The study aims to explore the most crucial determinants that influence corporate voluntary disclosure in a transition economy. A cross-sectional study based on the pharmaceutical and chemical companies listed in the Dhaka Stock Exchange is conducted to reconnoiter the crucial determinants affecting the voluntary disclosure. Based on the agency theory, stakeholder theory, and previous literature, the determinants are selected. An unweighted disclosure index is used to measure the extent of voluntary disclosure; after that, a multivariate analysis is steered to reconnoiter the key determinants of voluntary disclosure. It is found that firm leverage and firm liquidity are the key determinants that significantly influence the corporate voluntary disclosure in a transition economy. In contrast, no significant positive association is found between voluntary disclosure and board size. In additon, it is also found that market category significantly influences voluntary disclosure with an inverse direction. This study has important implications for both the corporate people and the regulatory bodies of the transition economy. The study also helps various stakeholders of the transition economy - Bangladesh, in designing their strategies regarding the most significant determinants of voluntary disclosure.

This meta-analysis takes stock of 121 C.E.O. pay studies published between 1998 and 2018 with the objective of identifying the main drivers of C.E.O. pay from a global perspective and contributing to the agency vs managerial debate on this ground. The meta-results disclose a positive C.E.O. pay-performance correlation (the highest correlation coefficient corresponds to Earnings per share with a 34%) as the agency theory prescribes and the governance policies promote. However, firm size still predominates as the main driver of C.E.O. pay (correlation coefficient is around 44%) according to managerial premises. Moreover, our results reconcile both approaches because results of the meta-regressions suggest that larger companies and more independent boards strengthen the pay-performance association. Additional analyses of moderating factors on C.E.O. pay forces do not provide robust conclusions, though, they suggest: (1) weak impact, if any, of both the Cadbury Report and the S.O.X.; and (2) lack of homogeneity in the banking industry despite its specific regulation.

Purpose: Drawing upon agency theory, this study aims to assess the value relevance (VR) of accounting information released by non-financial firms listed on the Kuwait stock exchange for the period of 2015-2018. Also, the influence of institutional ownership level and other explanatory variables, namely, book value per share, earnings per share, growth in assets and changes in financial leverage on share prices is examined. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, the Ohlson (1995) model is extended. This study uses panel data analysis and applies appropriate statistical techniques to measure empirical relationships. Findings: The results show that the VR of accounting information released by the Kuwaiti non-financial listed firms varies over the period of 2015-2018. Book value and earnings have significant and positive effects on share prices. In recent years, the VR of book value information has been growing, while that of earnings information has been declining. Institutional ownership level has a significant and positive influence on the VR of accounting information released by the Kuwaiti non-financial listed firms. The findings confirm a positive power, signalling growth in assets regarding the share prices. However, no significant relationship between changes in financial leverage and share prices is found. Practical implications: The findings of the study provide evidence of the linkage between VR and institutional ownership level, which promotes the understanding of the influence of institutional investors on a firm's market value. Empirical evidence from Kuwait will have international implications and can serve as a guide for accounting researchers studying other emerging markets. Capital market regulators can provide guidelines in the form of information characteristics and elements of financial statements that need improvement. Finally, the findings assist non-financial listed firms to enhance the quality of accounting information by identifying the strengths and weaknesses in their financial reports. Originality/value: This study extends the previous literature by investigating a relatively new set of data in more depth than that has been examined by prior research, which focusses on the relationship between accounting information and the firm's market value.

This paper explores the development and articulation of the agency and stakeholder theories of the firm and their corresponding logics of shareholder wealth maximisation and stakeholder interest optimisation. We note how these two perspectives have been viewed as diametrically opposite normative, instrumental and descriptive theories, despite efforts by some authors to find common ground. Each has served as a basis for firm governance. We explore the relationship of the agency and stakeholder theories to the conceptualisations of the roles of boards of directors, and how both theories hold value in understanding two board functions/roles: control/monitoring roles and service roles (which covers both resources and strategy).

After the emergence of financial scams like Enron, WorldCom and Toshiba, the researchers have emphasized the significance of the audit committee (AC) in curtailing the earnings management (EM). The role of the AC in financial reporting has received significant attention in accounting research because it offers information to shareholders for investment decision making. Researchers have examined whether AC characteristics mitigate managers' EM practices. Whereas there is a scarcity of research that investigates the association among ACs and impression management (IM). The objective of this research is to examine the relationship between the AC characteristics and IM practices in the chairman statement of the Malaysian companies We used IM as the measure for financial reporting quality (FRQ). Secondary data is utilized that is obtained from the annual report and Thomson Reuters Database. The sample of this study comprises companies listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia in 2017-2018. Interestingly, this research findings identify that AC independence has a significantly negative relationship with the level of IM measured on the basis of qualitative scores (IMSC1) and quantitative scores (IMSC2). The findings of this research supported the agency theory because it argues that strong internal governance monitoring mechanisms improve the FRQ and decrease the IM. AC meeting has a significant positive association with the level of IM based on qualitative scores (IMSC1). This result does not support the argument that increasing number of ACs meetings results in reduced IM and enhanced FRQ. Also, the AC meeting has no relationship with the level of IM in the quantitative scores (IMSC2), whereas IM and AC size has no association with AC financial experts. This result may not support the argument of the agency theory that AC size, meeting and financial experts significantly enhances the FRQ. Findings of the study may enable regulatory bodies and policymakers to devise policies and strategies to improve the credibility of financial statements in Malaysia. Future studies may consider the effect of other AC characteristics, like AC quality, AC members' ownership and AC members' remuneration on IM. (c) 2020, (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the most significant profitability determinants of the manufacturing companies in Indonesia. Design/Methodology/Approach: Several independent variables examined for their influence on profitability were working capital, firm size, firm growth, capital structure, and non-debt tax shields. The sample of this study were manufacturing firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2010 to 2017. The number of samples were 350 manufacturing companies. Findings: The results of this study indicate that working capital, firm size and firm growth were positively related to profitability. Meanwhile, capital structure and non-debt tax shield did not affect profitability. The findings of this study were consistent with the pecking order theory and the financial agency theory. Practical implications: This study implies that managers need to adjust their investment needs with the profitability that has been achieved and the total assets of the company, and to maximize the value of the company by managing current assets so that the rate of the return on marginal investment is equal to or greater than the cost of capital used to finance the current assets. Furthermore, financial managers must be able to determine essential investment objectives by maximizing the use of assets and fixed assets which are expected to make the company to enjoy the sales growth in the future. Originality/Value: Although this study organically builds upon recent studies about the firms' profitability, it conducted in the new administrative setting in Indonesia, which is the Widodo's administration. Widodo's administration supports the manufacturing industry to be able to compete globally. (c) 2020 International Strategic Management Association. All rights reserved.

We examine whether the proportion of CEO inside debt holdings (pension and deferred compensation) to stock holdings benefit both shareholders and debtholders by relating CEO inside debt to a firm's dividend payout policies. Based on the positive association of CEO inside debt and the propensity and the size of the dividend payout, we find that firms paying their CEOs with large inside debt present the lower cost of debt and default risk, and these benefits transfer to better firm performance and valuation. Moreover, we find that CEO inside debt is related to superior firm performance only in dividend-paying firms. Dividends tend to increase when firms with high agency costs of equity use inside debt. We conclude that dividends serve as a channel through which CEO inside debt compensation mitigates both agency costs of debt and agency costs of equity.

This study investigates the impact of the asset-light strategy on dividend policy using a sample of large international publicly-listed companies (399 firm-year observations) operating in the hotel and restaurant industry over the 2006-2018 period. Taking the perspective of agency theory, we posit that the asset-light strategy in conjunction with significant growth is a context in which high agency conflicts arise. Using Tobit and OLS models, our results indicate that adopting an asset-light strategy only impacts dividend policy for firms with high growth. More interestingly, the positive impact of the asset-light strategy on dividend payouts occurs for firms with substantial growth if institutional ownership is low. In such situations, significant potential agency conflicts (due to high free cash flows) coupled with the lack of monitoring from institutional investors lead firms to use dividends as a monitoring tool. Finally, a change analysis supports our main findings. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

This study tests the catering theory and explores the main determinants of dividend payments across a sample of eleven emerging countries. There is evidence of catering to investor sentiment for dividends in Middle Eastern and North African countries. Dividend payers are mature, profitable, large firms with lower growth opportunities, and high dividend premiums, which supports the catering, lifecycle, and agency theories. Catering behavior persists even after controlling for the effect of Arab Spring. Difference-in-difference analysis shows that countries highly affected by the political transition period are less likely to pay dividends in the post-Arab Spring period than less affected countries. Catering decreases significantly in the post-Arab Spring period as compared with during- and pre-Arab Spring periods, suggesting that investors prefer that managers retain earnings to reinvest and grow during unstable economic conditions. Furthermore, catering persists in countries with high corruption levels and poor legal quality to reduce agency cost, and substitute for weak legal systems with poor enforcement of laws.

The governance of non-profit organisations is complex, as these organisations are not only intended to create value for third parties but also dependent on their donors. When the donor is a for-profit firm, it may be challenging to align and balance the firm's for-profit interests and the non-profit organisation's social aims. The board of directors has the main responsibility for supporting and monitoring managers' decisions so that all perspectives are considered, but doing so requires appropriate information about stakeholders' expectations. Adopting the agency theory perspective, this study focuses on corporate governance in corporate foundations (CFs), a type of non-profit organisation with a private firm as its founder and main donor. We hypothesise that bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between CFs and their founder firms, which are the main donors and consequently the main stakeholders, can increase the involvement of the board of directors, thereby leading to higher organisational effectiveness. We argue that the implementation of bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm can strengthen corporate governance and provide the board of directors with the information needed to be more involved; such implementation fosters organisational effectiveness because it aligns the profit-oriented objectives of the founder firm and the social-oriented objectives of the CF. By analysing data from interviews of 188 CFs from six European countries, we aim to contribute to the debate on the role of corporate governance in non-profit organisations under the agency theory perspective. We provide evidence that the implementation of coordination and bureaucratic control mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm gives the board more information and leads to higher board involvement, thereby minimising agency issues and fostering organisational effectiveness.

Purpose: This study aims to find the determinants of the capital structure of Islamic banks in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC). The uniqueness of the case of Islamic banks stems from the fact that they are not only subject to the supervision of financial regulatory bodies that organize the banking sector (e.g. central banks) but also subject to the guidelines of Shari'ah law governing their financial transactions, products and contracts. Such characteristics are expected to have an impact on the capital structure decisions of Islamic banks compared to their conventional counterparts. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the research purpose, an empirical model was constructed to describe the relationship between leverage and the independent variables. The empirical model was tested through multivariate regression analysis using a panel data approach of 12 Islamic banks in the GCC for the period 2005-2014. Three types of regression analysis were used as follows: ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed-effect and random-effect regressions on panel data. Findings: The research findings show that the leverage of Islamic banks in the GCC is positively related to size of the firm (SIZE) and growth opportunity (GROWTH); and it is negatively related to profitability of the firm (ROA), tangibility of the firm's assets (TANG) and financial market development (MRKT). The results indicate that larger Islamic banks tend to be relatively more diversified with higher credit ratings, which lower their cost of funding and relatively increase its profitability and the bank's customer/depositor base. The results also show that higher profitability ratios indicate relatively more internal funds to cover future investments, which leads to less reliance on external funds in the form of debt and/or equity. However, the higher the growth opportunities of Islamic banks, the faster the depletion rate of internal funding, and the more external debt financing is acquired to cover the expansion plans. In addition, the results show that in developed financial markets, savers tend to purchase less traditional depository products, and they prefer to invest directly in the financial markets to avoid higher commissions. The results are in line with the pecking order theory, which states that Islamic banks in the GCC tend to prefer sources of funds that have the least transaction cost and reveal minimal information to competitors. Hence, bank management resort to internally generated funds by its operations rather than acquiring external funds. Furthermore, the results are weakly explained by the agency theory, which states that as the firm assets become more tangible, the required monitoring cost is reduced; and hence, shareholders will have less tendency to raise more debt for the purpose of sharing the monitoring cost with debt holders. Research limitations/implications: This research study contributes to the theory of capital structure in re-validating the findings of a previous theoretical and empirical study on capital structure in the GCC and abroad. It helps understand the capital structure of Islamic banks in comparison with financial and non-financial firms. Future research is recommended in several areas. In terms of the methodology, it is recommended to conduct the research topic surveying management and financial executives of Islamic banks in the GCC; this will validate the results using a triangular approach supported by the findings of this paper. It is also recommended to apply the research methodology in other parts of the world where Islamic banking exists. Finally, as studies on the capital structure of financial institutions and other regulated sectors are rare, it is recommended to intensify research effort in these sectors to strengthen our knowledge of capital structure. Practical implications: From a practical perspective, this research bridges the gap between theory and practice in many aspects. The findings can serve Islamic bank executives as guidelines to understand the market and competitive reaction in response to capital structure decisions. On the other hand, research analysts and equity holders can use the findings in their debt and equity research valuations, assessment of the size of dividends and profit distributions, and to make more informed decisions to buy/sell financial securities. Furthermore, the findings help regulatory bodies to issue informed regulations in relation to capital adequacy ratios, reserve requirements, provisions and payout decisions to achieve policy intended purpose. In addition, organizations that are responsible for setting accounting and audit standards for Islamic banks will learn more about the industry practice; and hence, be able to pass practical standards. Moreover, the findings realize the recommendations of international financial regulatory bodies, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) and other concerned organizations that emphasize the importance of further understanding of financial institution practices, to enable more effective formulation of risk management techniques, which may prevent future financial crisis. Originality/value: This paper was amongst the few research studies conducted on determinants of capital structure in the GCC and specifically on the Islamic banking sector.

In this study we examine the effect of boardroom social capital, defined as the aggregate benefits from the social networks of outside directors, on director compensation. Using a large panel of nine thousand firm-year observations for the period 2007-2013, we find that boardroom social capital is positively priced. Further analysis shows that firms pay a premium for networked directors. Firms that have suffered adverse events such as a bad merger, performance declines, or dividend cuts, pay a higher connection premium. We determine that well-connected directors perform important board roles and hold multiple directorships. Overall, our results are consistent with an efficient contracting explanation for boardroom pay. (c) 2019

Corporate governance plays a decisive role in the financial performance a firm. While the majority of the firms in China and India are owned a managed by its promoters, the present study attempts to examine the impact of ownership structure and board characteristics on firm value for these two economies. The study employs panel data methodology with industry and time fixed effects on a sample of 1,042 firms listed in National Stock Exchange India and 450 firms listed in Shanghai Stock Exchange of China. The study finds promoter ownerships to positively impact a firm's value creation process, while institutional investors exert a negative influence. Although CEO duality enhances firm value in China, the results show otherwise for Indian firm Additionally, while board independence is positively correlated to firm value India, it has a negative effect on firms in China. Finally, the study finds that larger board size contributes favorably toward better decision making. (c) 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited

Family business literature shows that family and nonfamily firms differ with respect to their financial reporting decisions. However, although the literature on financial reporting in family firms has developed over the last ten years, it is mostly oriented towards earnings management and management control issues. Given the specific characteristics of family firms in financing and governance, do their published accounting data have less value relevance for public investors than in the case of non-family firms? How do family firms differ from one another on this issue? While different theoretical perspectives have been used to tackle this problem, two main theses based on agency theory were the most frequently called upon. In fact, the views of interests' alignment and entrenchment are competing in explaining the differential quality of family and non-family firms accounting numbers. This paper draws on this theoretical lens and contributes to filling this research gap by conducting a comparative analysis of earnings' value relevance for a sample of quoted French family and non-family firms. First, it examines whether family firms show more or less relevant accounting earnings than non-family firms. Second, it seeks to study the heterogeneity of family firms in terms of earnings figures' relevance by considering the extent of family control and the involvement of a family CEO as mechanisms leading to alignment or entrenchment. The findings show that family firms exhibit better earnings' value relevance than non-family firms. In addition, when owning families' control becomes high, earnings' value relevance worsens, which suggests a possible entrenchment effect on behalf of controlling families.

Using insights from academic and practitioners' perspectives and recent data, this paper extends the literature by using pay variables that are typically used by practitioners, including those not studied in previous academic research. Consistent with previous findings, firm size, measured by three-year average revenues, has strong effects on CEO pay. However, the relationship is not the same for firms of different sizes. Revenue elasticity is strong among small companies and disappears for medium and large companies. Firm performance, measured by accounting-based measures (return on assets and return on equity), and market-based measures (total shareholder return and shareholder value), have little effects on CEO cash compensation, but strong positive effects on equity compensation. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2019 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between cooperative practices of accountability, cooperative ownership, advanced communication and non-financial performance in savings and credit cooperative societies. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a cross-sectional research design and adopted a mixed methodological approach were hypotheses were statistically tested using structural equation modeling based on survey data (n = 220) and narratives from qualitative findings supported the quantitative findings from savings and credit cooperative societies. Findings: The findings reveal that cooperative practices of accountability, cooperative ownership and advanced communication are significantly and positively associated with non-financial performance of savings and credit cooperative societies. Originality/value: This study provides empirical evidence on the relationship between cooperative practices of accountability, cooperative ownership and advanced communication and non-financial performance in savings and credit cooperative societies in emerging economies like Uganda. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is limited or no study that has used the construct of agency theory in explaining the relationship between cooperative practices and non-financial performance in savings and credit cooperative societies.

We investigate whether diversification affects bank risk taking in the U.S. banking industry, and whether this relation is partially explained by agency theory. Our results show that U.S. banks with a relatively high share of noninterest income become riskier when moving toward non-interest-income-generating activities, especially activities from investment banking, proprietary trading, and so on. Diversification not only affects conditional average risk, but also the dispersion of risk. Moreover, diversified banks that received assistance from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) become riskier than diversified nonrecipients after TARP capital injections. Our main findings are robust to a battery of robustness tests. The results are partially explained under agency frameworks related to poor corporate governance.

How do public procurement practices influence effective public financial management (PFM) in Africa? Notwithstanding the several public procurement reforms to improve PFM in Africa, outcomes have not been sustainable. Prior studies have failed to explain this phenomenon. With a descriptive case study design based on comprehensive datasets, this paper explains this situation with three key factors underlying the public procurement environment in three African countries: Ethiopia, Central African Republic, and Ghana. From the agency theory lenses, these factors affect the agency cost in public administrative systems necessary for addressing the agency problems in public procurement management towards desired PFM outcomes.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether foreign directors' influence on opportunistic behavior among managers varies between Islamic banks (IBs) and conventional banks (CBs). It also examines how religious ethics and morals guide foreign directors to be better monitors. Design/methodology/approach: A panel fixed effects regression is used to analyze the effect of foreign directors on opportunistic behavior among managers in IBs and CBs. The authors use different proxies such as loss avoidance, discretionary loan loss provision and expense preference behavior to measure management opportunistic behavior. Findings: Based on sample of 3,758 bank-year observations for 164 banks over the period 1993-2015, the authors show that the presence of foreign directors in IBs increases boards' effectiveness in impeding management opportunistic behavior, whereas the presence of foreign directors in CBs reduces boards' effectiveness in curbing management's unethical acts. The authors also document that IBs (CBs) with foreign directors demonstrate less (more) earnings management and expense-preference behavior among managers. In addition, the authors' evidence indicates that the existence of the Shari'ah supervisory boards helps foreign directors be more effective monitors. Research limitations/implications: The current study focuses on banks only which makes its results subject to sample bias; there are many other forms of financial institutions (e.g. investments, real-estates and mutual funds) complying to the Shari'ah law. Second, owing to the lack of foreign board directors characteristics, the authors cannot investigate the intensity of the specific characteristics that could have specific directions in affecting managerial behavior. Practical implications: The findings in this paper may help standards-setters, auditors, investors and regulators take appropriate measures and create better policies that reduce managers' discretion. This could in turn improve information transparency decision-making, monitoring, advising and accounting quality. Originality/value: The authors' theoretical framework combines the agency, contingency, resource-dependence, stewardship and stakeholders' theories and applies them to Shari'ah as an alternative ethical and internal governance mechanism. The authors find that the impact of foreign directors on management opportunistic behavior depends on the corporate religious norms within boards of directors, in particular, suggesting that religious values affect how foreign directors influence bank managers' behavior.

Purpose: This paper contributes to the capital structure literature by examining the impact of financial leverage on firm performance and also the extent to which firm size and crisis matter in the leverage -performance relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 2403 Indian firms during the period 1995-2014, generating a total of 19,544 firm-year observations, panel econometric methods are employed to test the leverage-performance relationship. Findings: Drawing insights from agency theory and using Tobin's Q (TQ) as our main measure of performance, the authors uncover that financial leverage is negatively and significantly related to firm performance. The authors also observe that the impact of financial leverage on firm performance is lower for smaller firms than larger ones. Finally, the authors show that the 2007/08 financial crisis had no significant impact on the relationship between financial leverage and firm performance. Originality/value: The paper provides fresh evidence on the impact of leverage on performance, particularly from the Indian context. This study is also among the first studies to examine the role of firm size and financial crisis in the leverage-performance relationship. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Computer abuse by employees has increased the potential for security vulnerabilities for organizations. Organizations have established various security countermeasures to prevent computer abuse and protect organizational information. However, these policies are only effective if followed. Thus, it is important for organizations to understand the factors that motivate employees to follow computer usage polices. We investigate the impact of different countermeasures, such as perceived sanctions, and awareness of being monitored on compliance with computer usage policies by drawing upon agency theory and general deterrence theory. After testing the hypothesized relationships using survey data, the results indicate that perceived sanction severity and certainty significantly influence intention to comply with computer usage policies. Furthermore, awareness of being monitored is found to significantly impact penalties. Study results further indicate that penalties may be effective only to the extent that organizations can detect employees' deviant behavior through managerial controls, such as computer monitoring.

Based on the agency theory, this paper analyzes whether family firms pay more dividends compared to no-family firms and identifies whether the board composition affects the dividend policy. Brazil and Chile have established mandatory dividends, retain lower cash holdings, pay higher dividends compared with other markets in the region. The sample of study is composed by 853 observations from 49 Brazilian and 32 Chilean top publicly listed firms in terms of market capitalization over the 11-year period from 2004 to 2014. Using an unbalanced panel data, results indicate that family controlled firms distribute more dividends and board composition namely; board size and the proportion of women on the board have a significant and positive impact on the dividend policy of the firm. By contrast, Chairman of Board - Chief Executive Office (COB-CEO) duality signficantly. Thus, dividend policy constitutes an effective corporate governance mechanism in mitigating the family' expropriation of minority shareholders' wealth. (c) 2021 European Journal of Family Business.

There is a broad call to integrate planetary boundaries and life-cycle based reporting into accounting theory and reporting standards. Although many practitioners back this call, including insurers, shareholders with a long-term orientation, and company law specialists who suggest that the inclusion of long-term stakeholder interests is necessary to counter both corporate and systemic risks, it remains unanswered. We argue that dominant assumptions about the status and architecture of corporations in corporate governance theory stand at the centre of this unanswered call in accounting theory and practice. As the status of the public corporation is interpreted as a nexus of contracts and its architecture as a restricted dyadic relation between 'principals' and 'agents', the object and audience for corporate reports are restricted to a very specific set of actors, interests and time-horizons. We argue that this conceptual setup unduly restricts notions of accountability and is connected to a specific notion of political economy. A broadening of reporting standards needs, therefore, to be accompanied by a critical assessment of the assumed object and audience of reporting in corporate governance theory.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to answer the research question: How do cooperative organizations perform when created by government fiat in an emerging market? Through the use of institutional and agency theory, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the efficiency of the cooperative form of organization and investor-owned firms-investigating how the social-political structures in a community affect the efficiency of cooperatives vis-a-vis investor-owned firms. This paper also attempts to offer a better understanding of how government quality and organizational size influence performance outcomes between different organizational forms specifically in the Philippines. Design Methodology Approach: The empirical analysis of this study was conducted among electric distribution utilities in the Philippines. Firm-level data was generated for 133 distributors, consisting of 119 electric cooperatives and 14 investor-owned companies. Panel data regressions were ran to test all hypotheses. Findings: Cooperative organizations operate at a less efficient rate than investor-owned firms in the Philippines, even when controlling for firm-specific factors such as size, customer density and profitability. In addition, the efficiency of these cooperative organizations is more strongly influenced by the quality of the local government than investor-owned firms. Originality Value: Positive externalities generated by the propagation of cooperatives on local communities may be based primarily on our understanding of how cooperatives have functioned largely in western contexts. Within the context of Southeast Asia, where national socio-political structures may be more dysfunctional, this paper observes that there is an equivalent negative externality caused by the tendency of cooperatives to replicate the political mismanagement of the community around it.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to verify the theoretical assumption about a weaker role of internal governance structures (namely, board and CEO) in determining sporting and financial performances in highly concentrated club ownership environment. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from the Italian and English football clubs playing in their national top divisions, over the period 2006-2015, the authors apply agency theory, property rights theory and win maximization logic to test the absence of a significant impact of internal governance structures on financial performances and clubs' sporting performance. Ownership structure's variables are used as control variable. Findings: Empirical findings document an overall poor impact of board structure and CEO features on financial performances, in comparison with the influence of ownership structure; the consolidation of win maximization logic of clubs' owners has been demonstrated in this specific context. However, the authors found that some internal governance elements have also an impact on performance even if their contribute is limited: board size results negatively associated to club profitability, board independence and CEO tenure are positively related to sporting performance; in addition, CEO tenure also increases profitability. Originality/value: The originality of the paper lies on the contribution arising from this empirical research, since a scarcity of empirical studies analyzing the correlation between internal governance and performance in European football sector is noticed.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the effect of setting up a separate risk management committee (RMC) on the performance of listed companies in Malaysia's consumer goods sector. The study considers several firm characteristics as control variables to influence the establishment of the RMC, such as firm size and leverage. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises 169 observations throughout a nine-year time frame starting from 2010 to 2018. The current study used a dichotomous variable of "1" to represent a listed company that establishes a separate RMC and "0" as otherwise. The data analysis is based on a static panel data technique, which utilised the fixed effects model (FEM) and random effects model (REM). Findings: There is a significant positive relationship between a separate RMC and Tobin's Q which suggests that the establishment of a separate RMC that consists of a majority of independent non-executive directors would significantly improve the firm's performance. The current work supports agency theory which suggests that independent non-executive directors can enhance the transparency of corporate boards as they improved the firm's compliance with the disclosure requirements. Originality/value: Proper risk management and internal control are critical aspects of a company's governance, management and operations that can influence a firm's performance. The empirical evidence contributes to the knowledge of corporate governance within the context of a RMC's role in monitoring a company's risk management framework, policies and its implementation. The formation of a separate RMC as a board committee will help to enhance the effectiveness of the risk oversight role of the BOD. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Organizational transparency has become a prominent concern for the nonprofit sector as it expands globally. Transparency is important to organizational accountability, which may be indicated by how nonprofits allocate their resources. In this study, we examine the relationship between nonprofits' transparency and their resource allocation to programs, administration, and fundraising. Our study focuses on China, where a nascent nonprofit sector is playing increasingly significant roles in social development while facing public trust challenges. Based on Agency Theory and Resource Dependence Theory, we propose two hypothesized frameworks that link transparency to resource allocation, and use the 2013-2015 China Grassroots Organizations' Transparency Survey data (n = 370) to test this relationship. Our results suggest that nonprofits with higher transparency allocate more resources to programs rather than administration, a possible result of the current public scrutiny of nonprofit accountability in China. Our findings provide implications for nonprofit practitioners and future research about the significance of organizational transparency, particularly in emerging nonprofit sectors.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate if product pre-announcement effects measured using stock market returns conform to the predictions of two competing consumer marketing theories. In particular, while buzz marketing theory indicates a direct positive effect, information asymmetry theory suggests an influence contingent upon evidence. The study also investigates whether a pecking order of performance effects exists across different signaling situations. Design/methodology/approach: The final sample consists of 219 product-preannouncements reported in the Wall Street Journal between 2005 and 2015. The standard event study methodology was used to test for performance effects. Findings: The results show that preannouncements with evidence alone significantly outperform those with buzz alone, and announcements containing buzz and evidence. Also, buzz acts as a salient moderator of the relationship between evidence and performance. In addition, company size also affects the evidence-performance relationship, with smaller firms benefiting more from evidence than larger firms. Research limitations/implications: The event study method assumes efficient markets and deals with publicly traded companies. Practical implications: Managers can allocate resources wisely by deciding whether to invest in evidence or buzz in their pre-announcements. Originality/value: In contrast to extant research that primarily investigates contingency effects, this study identifies how an important moderator, i.e. buzz affects performance.

This study examined the strategic planning process used in U.S. public company boardrooms, with a particular focus on companies that used board-level Strategic Planning Committees (SPCs) as opposed to those that engaged the full board in strategic planning oversight (which we call "strategic planning overall" or "SPO" firms). Based on interviews with 8 SPC members and 12 directors from SPO firms, we found a number of similarities in SPC and SPO processes, as well as a number of key differences. Overall, it is clear that there often can be a fundamental tension between management and directors with respect to the responsibility for strategic planning. There also can be significant information asymmetries arising from agency theoretic assumptions requiring board independence and arms-length interactions. Organizational scope may, within limits, constrain these assumptions. Such conditions increase both resource and information processing demands on the board, creating a need for greater formality in the board's strategic planning processes. These demands increase the need for paradoxical approaches that can accommodate greater flexibility in board-management interactions. The paradox lies in the board's ability to simultaneously meet and balance agency theoretic, resource dependence based and information processing demands. The contrasting organizational logics that are in play result in paradoxes that influence whether and in what form a board-level SPC should be constituted. The evidence suggests that constituting and structuring SPCs to embrace more collaborative interactions between the board and management could be helpful in dealing with the contrasting requirements and tensions that arise in certain firms. Embracing paradoxes and modifying governance approaches to include collaborative interactions with management may also help in ensuring that the board's strategic planning processes are equipped to deal with the challenges that confront the organization. Ultimately, individual company directors will need to determine whether and in what form a board-level SPC would add value to their governance structure and processes. Our interview-based evidence suggests that firm size and director experience are important considerations in the choice of how the board should oversee strategy. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

This study examines the effects of a dual-class structure on investment efficiency. Agency theory suggests that a dual-class structure exacerbates agency problems, leading to under- or overinvestment, but another view posits that the dual-class structure insulates managers from the pressure of the marketplace or activist investors seeking short-term profits. We find that dual-class firms invest more efficiently than single-class peers. This effect is more pronounced among firms with less transparent investments such as R&D. Our findings are robust to a propensity score matching approach and a setting where single-class firms recapitalize with dual-class shares. Furthermore, we find that among firms most at risk of overinvestment, dual-class firms have higher future accounting profitability and less volatile future returns. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study investigates the relationship between IFRS adoption and earnings management (EM) i.e. discretionary accruals (DA) and real earnings management (REM) in developing economy like Bangladesh. Moreover, the study examine the relationship between corporate governance (CG) strength and EM as well as moderating role of CG strength on the relationship between IFRS adoption and EM. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs 94 firms listed in Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) for 6 years i.e. 564 firm years observation, over two time period as pre (2004-06) and post (2013/14-15/16) adoption of IFRS. Underpinning theory of the study is agency theory which explained the relationship among variables. Based on earlier literature a CG index is developed to measure the strength of CG. The study uses random effect GLS with robust regression in a balanced panel data. Findings: The results show that IFRS and CGI both have significant negative relationship with EM. Moreover, it is documented that the CG strength significantly moderates the relationship between IFRS and REM. It implies that the presence of good CG may help to attain the objectives of IFRS adoption Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is one of the first empirical attempts at providing evidence about the role of CG on the relationship between IFRS adoption and EM in Bangladesh. The findings of this study can be beneficial for the member of the regulatory bodies and researchers to formulate new policy and enhance corporate governance practices in Bangladeshi companies as well as develop a better framework for all stakeholders involved in financial reporting. Future studies may also investigate the interacting effect of corporate governance strength on other related variables which may influence the level of earnings management. (c) 2020, Sciedu Press.

A dual-class share structure creates a separation between cash flow rights and voting rights. Dual-class firms impact audit fees through their effect on supply/demand for auditing. This article examines the association between audit fees and dual-class share structure for U.S. public firms. We find that a dual-class share structure is associated with lower audit fees compared to single-class firms. Further, within dual-class firms, we find that the divergence between cash flow rights and voting rights is negatively associated with audit fees. The results are consistent with the managerial incentive-alignment effect and/or the insulation effect of a dual-class share structure on the supply/demand for audit services. This study highlights that the ownership structure of a firm constitutes an important role in audit pricing. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine whether the strength of corporate governance influences the firm's ability to retain their key knowledge workers or inventors. Design/methodology/approach: This paper links agency and innovation theory to develop the hypotheses. Agency theory predicts that the interests of employees are counter to those of firm owners. The authors predict that as shareholder power grows as corporate governance strengthens, inventors who are highly productive, and those who pursue risky but valuable exploratory innovation will leave the firm. Given prior scholarship in innovation theory establishing the critical contributions that new knowledge creation and exploratory innovation make to firms' competitive advantage, the authors consider whether stronger firm-level corporate governance leads to the erosion of the firm's competitive advantage. The hypotheses are empirically tested using generalized least squares estimation on a data set that combines data on firms, their patents and the governance provisions these firms adopt. Findings: Using a 10-year sample of publicly traded US firms, the authors find that stronger corporate governance erodes the very foundation of a firm's innovation capabilities. Stronger corporate governance reduces management job security, which makes managers more risk-averse. This heightened "managerial myopia" results in increased departures of highly valuable inventors employed by the firm. The authors show that these departing inventors are more productive inventors than those who remain and engage in more exploratory R&D than the remaining inventors at the firm. Originality/value: The findings raise questions on the appropriateness of the adoption of governance provisions strengthening shareholder rights in firms pursuing innovation.

We examine the impact of corporate governance on cash holdings and the interplay of family ownership on this relationship through static and dynamic panel estimation models. Composite indicator for the corporate governance based on several proxies related to corporate board structure and ownership is constructed using principal component analysis (PCA). Our evidence is based on a sample of 120 publicly listed non-financial firms from Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) over the period 2013-2017. The selected sample is further divided into family and non-family firms based on 10% or more ownership. We document the negative impact of corporate governance on cash holdings. The findings reveal that family ownership as a moderator weakens the impact of corporate governance mechanism on cash holdings. The analysis of individual proxies of corporate governance and cash holdings in the whole sample, as well as sub-sample, provides some new insights that family firms with more board size, board independence, and institutional shareholdings hold more cash as compared to non-family firms. The study theoretically supports the agency theory. The study suggests that individual market participants may make investment decisions thereby keeping in view the role of family ownership. The study also provides better insights to regulatory authorities to design policies in such a way that ensure the protection of minority shareholders as corporate cash holdings decisions are different in family and non-family firms.

This study tests the implications of agency theory, signal theory and information asymmetry on the relationship between institutional ownership and a firm's value supported by the new concept of Productive Sustainable Investment based on Financial Constraints. Sample of this study is sharia companies in the Indonesia Stock Exchange on the period of 2011 to 2016 with a population of 412 firms; purposive sampling was used and obtained a sample of 131 companies with 786 observations. Data analysis used a path analysis utilizing the Warp PLS analysis tool. The result of this study shows that institutional ownership has a significant negative effect on the firm's value, which means there is a non-linear relationship between institutional ownership and the firm's value. The findings do not support the agency theory. However, productive sustainable investment based on financial constraints is able to mediate the influence of institutional ownership on firm value. It means that this finding supports the signal theory. Thus, productive sustainable investment based on financial constraints significantly has a positive influence on the firm's value. In other words, this finding supports the theory of information asymmetry. (c) 2020.

Numerous studies have investigated whether regulation substitutes for or complements internal governance. The results have been inconclusive due to their over reliance on agency theory and extensive use of demographic proxy variables to real board activities. We empirically investigate the relationship between government performance evaluation (GPEs) and internal monitoring by SOE boards in the context of Korean state-owned enterprises (SOEs), overcoming the limitations of existing empirical studies. This analysis is enabled by data collected from the 1,525 board minutes of 170 Korean SOEs. Our prior expectation is a substitutive relationship. First, the similarity of GPE and internal monitoring by the board makes the relative cost of internal monitoring more expensive. Second, GPEs only reward managers, leaving outside directors unpaid. The empirical results are consistent with our expectation, and indicate that even in heavily regulated SOEs, internal imperatives outweigh institutional pressure. Hence, policy makers should carefully design GPEs so as not to crowd-out the potential benefit of internal monitoring by SOE boards. (c), Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore why different directors feel different levels of accountability toward board tasks. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a reflexive three wave data and analysis process culminating in a rich data set of 49 interviews with Australian directors and 15 h of boardroom observations. Findings: Differences in role identification lead directors to perceive their accountability differently resulting in wide variation in levels of firm specific knowledge, eventually affecting their breadth of contribution to board tasks. Research limitations/implications: Researchers should question the application of traditional governance theory (such as agency theory) if it fails to account for individual differences in intrinsic self-interest. Practical implications: Selecting board members for their functional knowledge alone may not always produce optimal outcomes for the board and firm. Board induction processes and ongoing director training are important tools to inform and remind directors of their role and accountabilities on a board. Originality/value: This paper establishes that the strength of directors' identification with either the director role or expert role affects what they feel accountable for, the development of firm specific knowledge and long-term efficacy as a director.

Against the background of legal amendments and society's call for more gender-specific equality, this article examines the relationship between gender diversity in the supervisory board and its monitoring effectiveness. We test the aforementioned relationship based on agency theory and resource dependence theory and on the basis of several company-fixed panel regressions. The underlying panel data comprises 1500 supervisory boards of 132 companies listed in HDAX and SDAX between 2015 and 2017 (396 company years). Gender diversity is operationalized through different diversity metrics, and monitoring effectiveness is measured by excessive board compensation. The results indicate that a higher representation of women on the supervisory board (shareholder representatives and all members) is accompanied by lower excessive compensation and thus better monitoring effectiveness. In contrary, we cannot find a relationship between gender diversity of employee representatives or all members of the compensation committee and monitoring effectiveness. After international research has already dealt occasionally with this context, it is now being tested for the first time in the context of the dualistic corporate governance-system to what extent gender diversity in the supervisory board and the remuneration-related monitoring effectiveness are linked. Our paper argues that greater gender diversity, regardless of socio-political considerations, can be beneficial for companies' corporate governance and thus contributes to the discussion about the impact of the statutory gender quota.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether the stock price crash affects the dividend policy. The divided policy is measured by the amount of dividend paid, compared with the size of the firm. Firms that experience stock price crash have strong incentives to reduce agency costs. Specifically, we examine whether firms with stock price crash use dividend policy to reduce agency costs between the management and the outside investors and to inform an information about firm's future profitability to the market. In particular, we analyze whether this relationship would be different depend on the level of agency problem. In addition, we investigate the dividend paying firm's future value. The sample of this study is 7,736 Korea listed firm-year observations from 2001 to 2016. Empirical findings are summarized as follows. First, we find that firms with stock price crash are more likely to pay dividend to reduce the agent cost and provide additional an information to outside investors, and this relationship is more pronounced with higher agent costs. In addition, we find that firm's value increase after the dividend payment. This paper contributes to extant literature by showing the empirical results for the signaling effect of the dividend, and provides an additional information for the firm with stock price crash.

The purpose of this study is to validate the relationship between earnings management and financial distress. Further, it will explore the moderating role of ownership structure for the relationship between earnings management and financial distress which is missing in the current literature. Agency theory and the iron law of earnings management are utilized to develop the framework for this study. Data have been collected from 156 companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for the period of 2004 to 2017. All the reported results are on a log-odds matric because our dependent variable is binary. The results of the study proved that there exists a positive relationship between earnings management and financial distress and this relationship is negatively moderated by ownership structure. The results of this study are beneficial for investors as well as regulators regarding control mechanisms of ownership structure. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Purpose: Although principal-agent theory has gained a prominent place in research, its negative image of self-serving managers is frequently criticized. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine how existing theories of agency and stewardship can be combined by using behavioral characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: This study reviewed articles on the behavior of agents and stewards from the domains of finance, economics, management, corporate governance and organizational research. Additional theoretical and meta-analytical empirical literature from the fields of psychology and sociology was used to account for general patterns of human behavior. Findings: The results indicate that goal congruency and the perception of fairness can serve as moderators distinguishing agency theory and stewardship theory. Goal congruency can be achieved by stipulating psychological ownership. The perception of distributive and procedural fairness is demonstrated by two major corporate governance mechanisms: performance-based compensation and board monitoring. The results are summarized in six hypotheses that allow a situational, customized corporate governance. These hypotheses can be tested in future research. Originality/value: Prior work either focused on the merits of principal-agent theory or advocates the utilization of positive management theories, such as stewardship theory. However, little work has been done on bridging the gap between both constructs and develop a more extensive view of management theory. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Economic challenges in Zimbabwe have resulted in firms being pushed out of their optimal leverage. Firms are faced with the need to move back to the optimal level of financing to improve their value. They tend to adjust quickly to the optimal level whenever failing to do so is costlier. This study employs a dynamic capital structure model to examine the determinants of optimal leverage and the speed of adjustment under a hyperinflation and dollarization period (2000-2016). The study shows that firms have an optimal leverage and there are costs of adjusting to this level of capital. Findings are consistent with theoretical predictions of the static trade-off theory (STT) and agency theory. The adjustment factors for all the models were found to be at least 0.475 and are higher under hyperinflation than under dollarization. Both firm and macroeconomic factors explain the optimal capital structure while the former also explains the speed of adjustment. Policies focusing on improving access to and reducing costs for finance will assist firms to maximize value as they adjust to the desired financing mix. The policies adopted may vary in response to the economic environment. (c) 2020 Emerging Markets Forum, Washington DC.

We investigate if CEO characteristics determine the choice of Political Action Committee (PAC) contributions by firms and if such participation leads to better firm performance. Using a unique, hand-collected database, we also focus on the identity of the politicians receiving PAC contributions to examine the impact of the value-relevance of such contributions. Examining data on corporate contributions made to candidates seeking federal office during the 2002, 2004, and 2006 election cycles, we find that CEO dominance and interest alignment influence strategic choices of firms with regards to establishing PACs. Our analysis of value-relevant contributions shows that firms prefer to donate to politicians representing the state of a firm's headquarters, validating the truth to the adage that all politics is local. However, these targeted political contributions do not have a discernible impact on firm performance. (c) 2019 University of New Orleans

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the strength of corporate governance and the value of firm-level investment policies following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002 and the associated changes to the listing requirements of major stock exchanges. In particular the authors seek to examine potential changes in the market's assessed value of capital expenditures after the passage of the SOX Act relative to before. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ a difference-in-difference methodology, centred on the year of the passage of the SOX Act to test for the role of governance on the marginal value of capital expenditures. Excess stock returns are calculated by subtracting Fama and French (1993) size and book-to-market portfolio value-weighted returns from the firms' annual stock returns. Each firm is grouped into one of 25 size and book-to-market portfolios for each year in the sample, with size and the book-to-market ratio proxying for sensitivity to common risk factors in stock returns (Fama and French, 1993). Findings: The authors find that markets responded to the change in governance brought about by the new regulation by altering the value of firm-level capital expenditures in a way that is generally consistent with predictions of agency theory. While the overall findings imply a reduction in agency conflicts post-SOX, there is some evidence that certain firms may have suffered excessive costs of compliance, while still others saw managers become excessively risk averse. Research limitations/implications: The study has implications related to the efficacy of legislation. Cross-sectional variation in the effect of SOX on the marginal value of capital expenditures suggests that one-size-fits-all legislative approach can have both expected as well as unintended consequences. The study limits its analysis to examining the impact of three significant provisions of the Act. While, the value implications of the Act are largely captured by the selected three, a more comprehensive study could expand on the set of provisions studies to obtain a more granular level impact. Practical implications: This research should add to the growing body of the literature examining the effect of SOX on firms' real activities and decisions, as well as contribute to the debate on whether the Act was beneficial or costly to firms. With particular reference to the impact of capital expenditure on firm value, the research contributes to the sparse literature examining the contribution of capital expenditures to firm value and the role that agency conflicts play in this relationship. Additionally, this research adds to the growing body of the literature that examines the costs and benefits of the sweeping new regulations brought on by the adoption of SOX. Social implications: Given the importance of investment policy for economic productivity and growth, the insights provided by findings in this research should benefit lawmakers both within the USA as well as in countries where corporate misconduct and fraud is a concern. Originality/value: This is the first study that examines the impact of the SOX Act on the way capital markets value firm-level investment in capital expenditures. Since use of corporate resources by managers is fraught with agency conflicts, the role of SOX in potentially alleviating this conflict as revealed by the tests in this study are very valuable.

Two divergent theories emerge from the literature on CEO duality. The agency theory advocates that a dual CEO negatively affects corporate performance, because it compromises the monitoring and control of the CEO, whilst the stewardship theory suggests the contrary effect due to the unity of command it presents. For a sample of 26 non-financial listed Portuguese firms from 2002 to 2016, this study draws on agency and stewardship theories to evaluate the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance, proxied by Tobin's Q. Using ordinary least square (OLS) and two stage least squares (2SLS) techniques to control potential problems simultaneity between CEO duality and firm performance, the author finds a negative relationship between CEO duality and Tobin's Q. This suggests that investors perceive no value in having a concentration of power with a dual leadership structure. Therefore, this study recommends that the positions of chairman and CEO should be separated for listed Portuguese firms. (c) 2020 by IGI Global.

The field of corporate governance can to a large extent be traced back the aftermath of the Great Depression 1929. The problem which led to the crash of the stock market was described as a division between control and ownership. The problem was described as managerialism. The thesis of managerialism inspired agency theory which has been synonymous with corporate governance theory. The theory focuses on the shareholder perspective and the importance of maximizing profits. Although corporate legitimacy has become a more important concept within institutional theory, it has had limited influence on the corporate governance discourse. That is, however, likely to change as the importance of the stakeholder perspective is growing. To align corporate governance with stakeholder perspective and strive for corporate legitimacy will have profound effects on the role of boards and corporate governance.

Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: This paper aims to examine the decision usefulness of net income (NI) which includes predictive power and value relevance by comparing it with comprehensive income (CI), for financial firms in Malaysia. Design/Methodology/Approach: This study uses panel data analysis techniques which focus on unbalanced panel dataset of 2012 to 2017, obtained from 29 financial firms listed in Malaysia. Research findings: Results show that in the case of predictive power tests, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that one accounting metric has better predictive power than the other. In the case of value relevance, results show that NI is better than CI when using the price and return models. This indicates that NI is more decision useful to investors than CI for financial firms in Malaysia. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study expands on the literature of decision usefulness of NI (in comparison to CI) for financial firms within an emerging economy, such as Malaysia, which has a smaller and less efficient market. The findings support the agency theory, particularly the Type II agency problem, which show that there is a conflict between controlling and non-controlling shareholders. This outcome may reduce the demand for quality reporting for external shareholders. This study is related to fair value accounting (FVA) which is still underexplored in the Malaysian setting. The outcome may provide some insights into the financial statements used by investors for understanding the effect of FVA on reported earnings in Malaysia. Such evidence is currently lacking. Practitioner/Policy implications: The findings may be helpful to investors in making better investment decisions in the Malaysian market. This study may benefit academicians by expanding the literature on decision usefulness of FVA in an emerging economy. The outcome derived offers a body of knowledge to academia as a reference for future research. This paper may also be relevant to the standard setters, regulators, and policymakers as it offers empirical evidence on the decision usefulness of accounting information disclosures in the context of an emerging country such as Malaysia. Research limitation/Implications: The limitation of this study lies in the small sample size used, thereby reducing the generalisability of the findings. Larger sample size may add robustness to the results. (c) 2020, University of Malaya. All rights reserved.

The study investigates the effect of executive compensation on earnings management of Nigerian listed non-financial institutions. A longitudinal research design was adopted for the study. A sample of 40 listed firms was selected using a purposive sampling technique. The study covers a period of 2010-2018, resulting in 360 firm-year observations. The data collected was analysed using the Ordinary Least Square Method (OLS). The results show that executive compensation and statutory audit have a significant negative association with earnings management. The results suggest that executives with lower compensation engage in opportunistic behaviour, which is consistent with the positive accounting theory, while highly compensated executives engage in income-decreasing earnings consistent with the agency theory. Also, statutory audit plays a significant role in mitigating against the executive in engaging in income smoothing. (c) 2020. All Rights Reserved.

This paper looks at managerial diversion and agency theory and how both arguments may be applied to describe the governance practices and performance of state-owned enterprise companies in Indonesia. Managers are the main focus of the approaches, on the assumption that managers tend to expropriate the firms' and shareholders' value for their own benefit instead of looking for ways to maximize shareholders' value and fulfill their stakeholders' needs. Indonesia is selected because it has the highest number of State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) companies among the ASEAN countries. The government holds more than 51 percent of the shares and has a unique governance structure with two-tier boards to manage and run the companies. Besides, most of Indonesia's SOE companies have a tight connection with Indonesia's political party. With these characteristics, the agency problem in Indonesia's SOE companies is more prevalent compared to other listed SOE companies. The managerial diversion, which is linked to corruption, might be the principal critical factor that hinders SOE companies from performing well. Thus, even with the introduction of a good corporate governance score by the Indonesian government, which is imposed on SOE companies, it may not be able to improve the overall financial performance of SOEs as well as governance practice in the companies. This paper's objective is to review and examine prior literature on corporate governance and managerial diversion from the perspective of state-owned enterprise companies in Indonesia.

This study examined how research and development (R&D) spending affects stock returns. Three strands of research make different predictions about how R&D affects stock prices. The agency theory, presented by Jensen (1986) argues that managers do not make a corporate decision on behalf of shareholders and rather pursue their personal benefits by undertaking value-reducing projects such as R&Ds. The overconfidence theory suggests that overconfident managers tend to invest more in R&D because they overvalue their ability and they are excessively optimistic about future success of the R&D investment. These two theories predict that firms that invest more in R&D earn lower returns than those that invest less. In contrast, the signaling theory predicts that high-quality firms use R&D spending as a means of communicating with the stock market to mitigate information asymmetry problem, resulting in higher returns of the firms. Using data from Korean firms listed from January 1992 to December 2015 we showed that portfolios that invested heavily in R&D earn consistently high abnormal returns and that, consequently, spending on R&D is an effective explanatory factor for stock returns. We also found that the impact R&D expenditures has on stock value was long-term, as well as short-term. Overall, these results are consistent with the signaling theory in that R&D spending is an important channel through which firms improve their values by communicating with the stock market.

Motivated by the agency theory and the need to examine the effect of separation of ownership and management, this study examines the determinants of profitability in different firm ownership structures and how different ownership structures impact the profitability of listed firms between 2003 and 2013, using pooled annual data of 23 Ghanaian listed firms. Employing a number of static models (OLS, Random Effects and 3 Stage Least Squares), we find evidence that while profit determinants vary for listed firms given their ownership structures, ownership structures also affected profitability differently. Specifically, for listed firms, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, financial risk, age and GDP; for non-family owned listed firms, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, market share and age; for foreign-owned firms, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, age and GDP; and for non-foreign ownership, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, financial risk, growth, age and GDP. When we examine the impact of ownership structure on profitability and find that family-owned listed firms make 30% less profits compared to non-family owned ones, whilst foreign-owned firms make 13% more profits than non-foreign owned ones. These findings confirm the agency theory which posits that separation of ownership and management, though may lead to agency problems, can positively affect profits. The study recommends that family-owned listed firms should consider diluting ownership in order to grow more profits. (c) 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

If board-level controls matter, the introduction of the 2008 Companies Act with its enhanced legislative requirements, should have a positive impact on firm performance. To assess board-level controls this study developed two unique control indexes to assess the boards of 84 companies over three years. The study focuses on companies on the SRI index as they have a greater focus on sustainability and transparent disclosure of board-level controls including separation of duties, monitoring, goal-aligned remuneration and oversight. The first index uses 23 board-level control indicators (CI) and the second 19 board-level direction indicators (DI). The two indexes were assessed using fixed effects estimation methods against current and negatively lagged firm performance proxies. Results show that board-level controls matter as both indexes were positively related to return on assets (RoA), however, only DI was highly significant. Both indexes changed to a negative relationship to next year's return on assets (NYRoA), again highly significant for DI. The change to a negative relationship suggests a timing and information asymmetry problem. CI was positively related to the natural log of enterprise value per share (LEV) with a low level of significance while the positive relation continues to the next year's natural log of enterprise value per share (LNYEV) that was highly significant. The latter suggests that the controlling role of the board are continued to be valued by the market. (c) 2019 South African Journal of Accounting Research.

From the traditional agency theory perspective, managers may hide rent extraction through tax aggressiveness and social responsibility activities. Existing theories propose that greater managerial ownership generates greater alignment of the interests of managers and shareholders and thus reduces the agency costs. On the other hand, increasing managerial ownership may entrench managers, causing agency conflicts between the controlling owner who is also the manager and minority shareholders. Using a sample of Taiwanese listed companies from 2010 to 2016, this study investigates whether socially responsible firms are less or more tax aggressive, and whether this relationship will be impacted by managerial ownership. This study finds that firms with high CSR have higher effective tax rates, supporting the stakeholder theory. In addition, this study finds that firms with higher managerial ownership are less tax aggressive, consistent with the alignment effect argument. This study finds only limited evidence that managerial ownership has a moderating effect on the negative relation between CSR and tax aggressiveness. However, when managers own a significant equity ownership, this study finds no evidence that managerial ownership moderates the negative relationship between CSR and tax aggressiveness. This suggests that owner-managers might increase CSR activities to mask their rent extraction through tax aggressive activities. Copyright (c) 2020 Journal of Accounting Review. All rights reserved.

Purpose-This study aims to explore the main factors that could be used to determine the financing structure for companies listed in Amman Stock Exchange in Jordan. The hypotheses were developed in light of three theories relating financing structure, trade-off theory (TOT), agency theory and pecking order theory (POT). Design/methodology/approach-The study using unbalanced panel data sample applying regression models for two-dimensions combines cross-sectional and time series for non-financial Jordanian companies listed in ASE over the period 2014-2018. Using standard models include entering a fixed effect, random effect, or not using any effect. Findings-The findings showed that company size, growth opportunities, and tax-deductible items other than interest have a positive effect on the borrowing, but profitability affects negatively on borrowing. These results are consistent with the arrangement theories (trade-off theory (TOT) and pecking order theory (POT). indicating the factors associated with trade-off theory were stronger than what is usually found in developed countries, and this is an indication of deep problem resulted from asymmetry information in the Jordanian market. which require to focus efforts on how to building the confidence with investors by providing the data that serve them in decision making. This needs to develop the accounting profession which will open the future for an active market for bonds and stocks that serve companies to financing their projects, and not only for speculation. Practical implications-The results detected how to constitute the suitable financial structure and how making a balance between sources of finance. Also detected weakens role of companies managers and ASE regulators, which require to focusing efforts to improving information deloused to users. Originality/value-limited number researches which have been discuss this issue. Therefore, this study extensively contributes to the shortage literature on the perceived the main factors that may effect on financial structure.

I investigate bank loans to takeover targets considering the simultaneous decision of pricing, maturity, collateral, and covenants applying Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Results are largely in line with the Agency Theory of Covenants (ATC) as pricing for new bank debt is lower given greater collateral and covenant protection, consistent with existing literature on public debt. However, poor performing targets demonstrate a positive relationship between pricing and covenants while bank loans to high performers are consistent with ATC predictions. Finally, loan terms tied to ex post observations of merger outcomes suggest banks possess some knowledge of merger outcomes in advance. (c) 2019 University of New Orleans

This study provides evidence about how stockholders control insiders using dividend policy to prevent overinvestment. This study observes the dividend yield, market risk, profitability, and growth opportunities of 155 public firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2010 to 2017. The dividend yield data were split into quartiles and categorized into the following areas: 1) firms with the lowest dividend yields, 2) firms with lower dividend yields, 3) firms with higher dividend yields, and 4) firms with the highest dividend yields. This study conducts multinomial regression for testing the hypotheses. The results confirm that systematic risk has an insignificant relationship with dividend policy, and profitability has a significant relationship with dividend policy. Consistent with agency theory in supporting free cash flow theory, this study finds that the agency problem exists for firms with high dividend yields relative to firms with low dividend yields in the context of Indonesian public firms. The systematic risk has an insignificant relationship with dividend policy, of which the study sample is limited. The findings also imply that stockholders tend to control insiders in case of overinvestment. Besides, this study also finds that market risk as a systematic risk is insignificant both for firms with high and low dividend yields. (c) The author(s) 2020.

This study aims to examine determinants of intellectual capital disclosures of financial institutions in an emerging economy. The study constructs an intellectual capital disclosure index (ICDI) based on the disclosure of intellectual capital information in the annual reports of 53 listed financial institutions in Bangladesh. The study applies both parametric and non-parametric tests to examine the relationship of different company characteristics with ICDI. Results suggest that profitability and riskiness of firms are important determinants of intellectual capital disclosures. These findings support regulators and policy makers for deepening their understanding about the intellectual capital disclosure strategy of financial institutions. This study also contributes to the theoretical understanding of intellectual capital reporting by highlighting limitations of agency theory in explaining the relationship between different company characteristics and intellectual capital disclosure in the context of financial institutions of Bangladesh.

A panel dataset of 1322 firm-year observations of non-financial firms listed at the Amman Stock Exchange is investigated. The results suggest that the capital market regulations of Jordanian firms have spurred managers to use adjusted earnings to remain trading in the first market, as well as convert from the second to the first market. It also finds that the level of discretionary accruals is reduced significantly with the passage of the corporate governance code. This study supports positive accounting theory by adding new evidence to the ongoing debate about how governmental regulations may create an incentive for firms to manipulate their earnings. It also corroborates the assumptions of agency theory and extends its application to some developing capital markets. Copyright (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

SEBI, capital market regulator, have set the deadline of 1st April 2022 for all the listed firm to separate the position of CEO ( in Indian context CEO is called as MD( managing director) and chairman .Thus, the objective of this paper, the analysis of firm performance on CEO duality, the sample consist of 491 firms from BSE-500(Indian) firms for the eight year( 2011 to 2018) with total observation of 4608. Thus this study explores CEO duality by using quantile regression, which estimates the CEO duality at different performance level of the firm, as classical OLS method explores relation at conditional mean of the two variable .The study uses both the accounting measure (EPS,ROCE& ROE) and market measure (P/BV and PE) to provide robust measure for relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. The results are mixed both positive and negative and only some models are significant, supporting the agency theory and negating the organisation theory. Finally, this paper contributes to the literature of corporate governance-CEO duality and firm performance substantially through the quantile regression method and comprehensive measure of firm performance in the Indian context.

This study examines the relevance of board independence to stock return volatility for a sample of 160 companies listed on the Vietnamese stock market over ten years (2008-2017). After controlling for potential endogeneity, we find that the presence of non-executive directors on the board tends to increase firm risk. The results indicate that non-executive directors do not play a supervisory role under the agency theory. Our findings remain robust when we apply alternative measures of the dependent variable.

The Asian financial crisis in 1997 has gained a public attention on the importance of corporate governance. Several reforms have been undertaken, especially in strengthening the boards of director's composition to ensure the board of director's function is delivered efficiently. Thus, the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG) codified the best practices that could enhance the corporate performance. Using the agency theory as a theoretical lens, this study examines the relationship between board independence, CEO duality, board size and directors' remuneration on firm performance, based on two measurements, namely Return on Assets (ROA) and Tobin's Q following MCCG 2012. The 100 samples of annual reports were randomly selected from the Bursa Malaysia website for the year end 2013. Results from the multiple regression analysis reveal that CEO duality and directors' remuneration were found to have a significant relationship with firm performance when measured using Tobin's Q. None of the independent variables have a significant relationship with firm performance using Return on Assets as the proxy for accounting measure. The result reveals that there is a negatively significant relationship between firm size and firm performance. Findings would assist the committee of MCCG2012 and other authorities to reinforce on the corporate governance compliance and good practice. (c) 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

Within the realm of corporate finance, IPO (refers to the process of offering shares of corporation to the public for the first time) companies in Malaysia received little attention from the academic scholarly works. An important area of inquiry for IPO companies is to investigate the board characteristics impact on dividend initiation. With use of the agency theory principles, four argumentative hypotheses were proposed. The current study used a pooled cross-sectional data with a total sample size of 372 companies listed in the Malaysian Stock Market. The results of this study revealed that the independence of board and the size of board were found to have a positive and significant impact on the decision to initiate dividend for IPO companies. However, multi-seats were found to have a negative and significant impact on the decision to initiate dividend. But, CEO duality were found to be irrelevant to the decision of initiating dividend.

This study examines the relationship between board attributes and firm performance. In accordance with agency theory, effective board of directors plays a key role in establishing good corporate governance and enhancing firm performance by mitigating earnings management. Based on panel data set drawn from Tunisian listed firms over the period 2011 - 2017 and while using dynamic panel GMM estimator to alleviate endogeneity problems, a U-shaped relationship was found between board size, board independence and firm performance. Indeed, results show that a higher firm performance is confirmed if the board size is composed of at least 6 members and 15% of independent board members. For a robustness check, this study measures a composite score of the effectiveness of board of directors to capture the aggregate impact of board's effectiveness on firm performance. The findings of regression analysis find a significant positive relationship between the board effectiveness score and firm performance. Indeed, there is a synergy between mechanisms that act together to enhance firm performance in the Tunisian context. Copyright (c) 2020. Mejda DAKHLAOUI And Imen FREDJ.

The limits of financial disclosure in meeting the investors' needs have led to the request for reporting frameworks capable of incorporating information of different nature. Integrated reporting (IR), which is the latest novelty in organisational reporting practice, promises to bring together material financial and non-financial information. IR has received considerable academic attention in recent years. However, little attention has been paid to the role of the audit committee in IR processes, despite the influence that this body has on disclosure, thanks to its supervisory and monitoring functions. This study bridges this gap by analysing the effect of the audit committee attributes on integrated reporting quality (IRQ) from an agency theory perspective. The regression analysis, conducted on a sample of 125 international firms, demonstrated a positive effect of size, independence and meeting frequency of the audit committee on IRQ and a non-significant effect of financial expertise.

The objective of this study is to examine empirically the impact of good corporate governance on financial performance of United Kingdom non-financial listed firms. Agency theory and stewardship theory serve as the bases of a conceptual model. Five corporate governance mechanisms are examined on two financial performance indicators, return on assets and Tobin's Q, employing cross-sectional regression methodology. The conclusion drawn from empirical test so performed on 252 firms listed on London Stock Exchange for the year 2014 indicates a positive or a negative relationship, but also sometimes no effect, of corporate governance mechanisms impact on financial performance. The implications are discussed. Thereby, so distinguishing effects due to causes, we present a proof that, when the right corporate governance mechanisms are chosen, the finances of a firm can be improved. The results of this research should have some implication on academia and policy makers thoughts. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Corporate governance is being acknowledged by almost all kinds of business communities and firms as an ultimate driver to improve the firm financial performance. This study examined the association between corporate board structure and corporate financial performance using a dynamic panel model. Principles of corporate governance deliver an explicit board structure for the purpose to facilitate the board members, which helps in making good decisions. The board of directors consists of the CEO, the chairman, the internal directors, and the external non-executive directors to work for the shareholders. This study undertakes different corporate governance attributes including non-executive directors, board size, and CEO duality and examines its effect on firm performance. The dynamic panel model is used, and preestimation and postestimation tests were conducted for the validity of the model. This study found a significant effect of board size, CEO duality, and non-executive directors on firm performance. The findings show that most of the governance variables are endogenous by nature. Results are consistent with agency theory. This study provides the theoretical and empirical evidence and applies a superior model (dynamic panel model) to better explain the association between corporate board structure and corporate firm performance in listed firms.

The study aimed to (1) investigate the extent, level and pattern of environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure in annual report of listed companies in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), (2) to examine the different level of ESG disclosure between groups of interest in terms of board composition and corporate characteristic, and (3) to test the influence of board composition on ESG disclosure of Thai listed companies. Population was all listed companies in the SET. Using annual reports during 2015-2019, content analysis by word counting was used to quantify the extent, level and pattern of ESG disclosure, while board composition was measured by board size, board meeting, female board committee, audit committee, nomination committee, compensation committee, CSR committee, remuneration, CEO compensation, and board compensation. Descriptive analysis, independent sample t test, correlation matrix, and multiple regression were used to analyze the data of this study. The most common ESG disclosure was governance information disclosure following by social and environmental information disclosures. There was an increase of ESG disclosure in annual reporting during 2015-2019 by listed companies in the SET. Moreover, there was a significantly different level of ESG disclosure between groups of audit committee, nomination committee, compensation committee, CSR committee, and firm size. Finally, there was a significantly positive influence of board size, female board, compensation committee, CSR committee, and remuneration on ESG disclosure, while there was a negative influence of audit committee and CEO compensation on ESG disclosure. Finding of possible influence of board composition on ESG disclosure can demonstrate that agency theory can be used to explain the reason of ESG disclosure by Thai listed companies, although the disclosure is still voluntary reporting in Thailand.

This study uses 462,678 monthly observations of US-listed firms for the period 1990-2018 to document a strong positive relationship between short-term changes in financial distress risk and future stock price crashes. This result is economically significant as a one interquartile increase of the main explanatory variable in any month increases the probability of a stock price crash by 8.33% relative to its mean value. The findings withstand controls for a large array of variables, firm-fixed effect estimations, and alternative definitions of distress and crash risk measures; they are also robust to a range of tests conducted to buttress against endogeneity concerns. The study conducts analyses demonstrating that the positive distress-crash risk relationship is driven by managerial opportunism that seeks to camouflage bad news that has an adverse effect on firms' economic fundamentals. Accordingly, the findings corroborate an agency theory explanation for the impact of distress risk on stock price crashes. This study offers practical insights to investors, who should be vigilant of a firm's distress risk, as sudden short-term increases underscore withheld negative information pertinent to crash risk problems.

Purpose: This study explores the levels of and trends in corporate environmental disclosure (CED) among a sample of Sri Lankan listed companies from 2015 to 2019. Furthermore, this article examines the firm-level determinants of CED, including corporate governance (CG) mechanisms, in Sri Lanka from a multi-theoretical perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 205 firm-year observations, this paper distinctively applies a panel quantile regression (PQR) model to examine the determinants of CED in Sri Lanka. This method was supported by estimating a two-step generalized method of moment (GMM) model to tackle any possible existence of endogeneity concerns. Findings: The authors' findings indicate an increasing trend in CED practice among the sampled companies (i.e. 41 firms, the only adopters of the GRI framework) in Sri Lanka from 2015 to 2019. However, it is still considered at an early stage compared with other developed counterparts. Furthermore, this study suggests that board size, board independence, board meetings, industry type, profitability and firm size are positively associated with CED level. In contrast, and consistent with our expectation, CEO duality is negatively attributed to the disclosed amount of environmental information in the Sri Lankan context. Research limitations/implications: The authors' empirical evidence reiterates the crucial need to propagate and promote further substantive CG reforms, mandating CED in Sri Lanka. Originality/value: The authors' findings provide much-needed insights for indigenous companies, operating across similar emerging economies, to understand how CED can be incorporated into their reporting process based on the GRI framework in order to enhance their firm value, reduce legitimacy gaps and mitigate other operational risks.

This study investigates the impact of ownership structure on the dividend policy in Jordan. In particular, it aims to uncover the effects of family ownership, institutional ownership, foreign ownership, and state ownership on dividend decisions for a sample of 66 Jordanian industrial and service firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) for the period 2014-2017. Tobit Panel Regression is used to test the hypotheses of the study. The results show a significant positive association between institutional ownership and dividend yield, while foreign ownership is associated with a less likelihood of paying dividends. No evidence is found to support that family ownership and state ownership have an impact on dividend yield. Hence, the study provides a clear evidence that high institutional ownership as an external control mechanism increases the need to pay dividends. The results also indicate that Jordanian listed firms have highly concentrated ownership structures and are mainly dominated by families followed by financial institutions, then foreign investors while the state shows relatively lower ownership. The study recommends that investors should take into account ownership structure when making investment decisions to help them choose the best investment opportunities. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Growing evidence suggests that gender diversity on boards of directors is important for corporate governance and overall organizational effectiveness. Yet, progress in increasing female board representation has been slow. Prior studies have focused primarily on either the role of organizational characteristics in board gender composition or the role of national institutions as predictors of female board representation across countries. In this study, we integrate psychological theory related to implicit biases and agency theory, with institutional theory, to propose that the national context for gender equality moderates the extent to which characteristics of organizational leadership relate to female board representation. We conduct a meta-analysis of 158 samples encompassing 60,648 organizations across 36 countries to test our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the importance of the national context for gender equality as a boundary condition for understanding the relationship between organizational leadership characteristics and female board representation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for increasing the representation of female directors across countries. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: This study examines the impact of intellectual capital efficiency and corporate governance mechanisms on the annual report readability of Oman's financial sector companies. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a sample of 150 firm-year observations of listed financial sector companies in the Muscat Securities Market, Oman, from 2014 to 2018. Flesch Reading ease and Flesch Kinkaid Index are used as proxies for annual report readability. As part of sensitivity analysis, the study also uses the natural logarithm of annual report pages as alternative readability measures. The investigation is conducted using random effects regression analysis and supported with system GMM estimation for robustness. Findings: The findings of this study demonstrate a decrease in intellectual capital efficiency associated with better readability of annual reports for the financial sector firms. Alternatively, banks report a positive association of intellectual capital efficiency with the Flesch Reading ease score of the annual report. The structural capital and capital employed efficiency are also found to be negatively associated with annual report readability. Corporate governance mechanisms such as dispersed ownership and audit committee size also result in easy-to-read annual reports that support agency theory. Research limitations/implications: The research was conducted for financial firms of Oman, and thereby the findings can be generalized to the financial sector of countries with similar settings, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Practical implications: The policy implications arising from this study suggest a strengthening of the intellectual capital efficiency and corporate governance mechanisms to improve the readability of the firms and thereby increase investor confidence. Originality/value: This paper's uniqueness is in the model used to investigate the impact of intellectual capital efficiency and corporate governance mechanisms on the annual report readability of an emerging market.

Agency theory predicts that institutional ownership plays an important role in monitoring corporate risk-taking. This study examines this ownership-risk taking linkage in Japan over the period 2007 and 2019. We proxy risk through measures of idiosyncratic risk, total risk, and market beta. We show that (relational) foreign institutional shareholdings (do not) induce corporate risk-taking, thereby mitigating (preserving) the managerial 'quiet life' in Japanese corporations. Using 2SLS analysis, the roles of institutional shareholders are robust to endogeneity concerns. Finally, we also confirm robustness using alternative accounting-based risk proxies such as the standard deviation of Tobin's Q and ROA. Our study implies that the monitoring of institutional shareholders is important in Japanese corporations whose top executives might be prone to seek a 'quiet life'.

This study investigates specifically the effects of institutional settings and risks on dividend payout policy for banks operate in an emerging market of Nigeria. The present study measures the risk by using financial, business, credit, and default risk at the bank-level and financial, economic, and political risk at the country level. To achieve the objective of this study, panel data random-effects Tobit estimation methodology is employed from the period 2007-2016. Findings reveal that the weak institutional settings lead Nigerian banks to pay out fewer dividends and set their payouts corresponding to the substitution agency model of dividends. Also, results show that Nigerian banks typically pay out more dividends in cases of growth opportunity as a substitute mechanism for mitigating agency problems and for establishing a good reputation. However, by strengthening the levels of investor protection, Nigerian bank managers prefer a low payout policy and are less probable to use dividend policies as a substitute mechanism. Moreover, except for the positive effect of default risk, findings show that the risks at the bank-level, in particular, business risk, and at the country level, particularly financial and economic risks, have a significant negative effect on dividend payouts. Results are robust to alternative estimation procedures and also document that global risk has a statistically significant negative impact on Nigerian banks' dividend payouts policy.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the moderating role of family involvement on the corporate social responsibility (CSR)-firm performance (FP) relationship in the US hospitality industry. Building on agency theory, this study examines how family ownership, management and board control influence the relationship between CSR and FP. Design/methodology/approach: To examine the moderating effect of family ownership, family management and family board control, this study adopts the two-way fixed-effects model and performs a panel regression analysis with robust standard errors. The sample period spans 1994-2018 and 565 firm-year observations are included. Findings: This study finds that the impact of CSR on FP is positively moderated by the extent of a firm's family member involvement. In specific, all three aspects of corporate governance (i.e. ownership, management and board control) positively moderate the relationship between CSR and FP. Research limitations/implications: Findings of this study yield several recommendations for hospitality managers, including shaping strategic decisions for implementing CSR, by providing a unique perspective that the involvement of founding family members can be helpful in enhancing firm value through CSR activities. Originality/value: This study sheds light on the further understanding of the CSR-FP link in the hospitality literature. In addition, this study provides practical guidelines for hospitality firms in the context of CSR by revealing possible advantages of strengthened founding family involvement.

Multi-family firms represent an important and complex type of family firm that is not as well understood as single-family firms. We develop a governance-based framework of the agency complexities in multi-family firms, theorizing that divergent family-centered noneconomic goals between the owning families create complex inter-family agency problems that are intensified by evolving family dynamics. We propose governance mechanisms that address these problems by limiting opportunistic behavior associated with the pursuit of noneconomic goals related to firm control, family altruism, social capital, and transgenerational succession. We then present a future research agenda that can expand our knowledge of multi-family firms. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

Purpose: Challenging the static view of family business governance, we propose a model of owner-manager relationships derived from the configurational analysis of managerial behavior and change in governance structure. Design/methodology/approach: Stemming from social exchange theory and building on the 4C model proposed by Miller and Le Breton-Miller (2005), we consider the evolving owner-manager relationship in four main configurations. On the one hand, we account for family businesses shifting from a generalized to a restricted exchange system, and vice versa, according to whether a family manager misbehaves in a stewardship-oriented governance structure or a nonfamily manager succeeds in building a trusting relationship in an agency-oriented governance structure. On the other hand, we consider that family firms will strengthen a generalized exchange system, rather than a restricted one, according to whether a family manager contributes to the stewardship-oriented culture in the business or a nonfamily manager proves to be driven by extrinsic rewards. Four scenarios are analyzed in terms of the managerial behavior and governance structure that characterize the phases of the relationship between owners and managers. Findings: Various factors trigger managerial behavior, making the firm deviate from or further build on what is assumed by stewardship and agency theories (i.e. proorganizational versus opportunistic behavior, respectively), which determine the governance structure over time. Workplace deviance, asymmetric altruism and patriarchy on the one hand, and proorganizational behavior, relationship building and long-term commitment on the other, are found to determine how the manager behaves and thus characterize the owner's reactions in terms of governance mechanisms. This enables us to present a dynamic view of governance structures, which adapt to the actual attitudes and behaviors of employed managers. Research limitations/implications: As time is a relevant dimension affecting individual behavior and triggering change in an organization, one must consider family business governance as being dynamic in nature. Moreover, it is not family membership that determines the most appropriate governance structure but the owner-manager relationship that evolves over time, thus contributing to the 4C model. Originality/value: The proposed model integrates social exchange theory and the 4C model to predict changes in governance structure, as summarized in the final framework we propose.

Central to economic development is entrepreneurship. Using an agency theory lens, we seek to better understand how national policy can spur entrepreneurship. Guided by capitalist and socialist logic and ideals we investigate the direct and joint effects of market freedom and social spending national policies. In drawing from a sample of 19 countries spanning 2004-2010, we find that neither market freedom nor social spending alone positively impacts entrepreneurial activity; however, an interaction exists, as entrepreneurial activity is bolstered when enhancing market freedom and social spending complement one another. Findings suggest mixed national policies that combine market freedom and social spending are best positioned to spur entrepreneurship. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Women-owned businesses represent a significant segment of the contemporary economy upon a global basis. However, women entrepreneurs still experience more obstacles than men depending on cultural context; for example, research on the Arab world concerning the interaction between women entrepreneurs and their families remains under-developed. Consequently, we ground our study upon an enhanced framework of agency theory, which includes family altruism. We examined the relationships between business-family interface (BFI) enrichment components and the performance of firms headed by female entrepreneurs women in Jordan and Sudan. Specifically, we investigated if and how the country level of political and social stability moderates these relationships. The findings suggest that the relationship between the family-related objective factor (family financial support) and the performance of firms headed by female entrepreneurs is not affected by the country's political and social stability context. Conversely, the family-related subjective factor (family moral support) is affected by this context. Our study bridges the gap in contextual studies on the Arab world concerning the success of women-owned businesses and confirms how institutional elements affect business in addition to family-related matters. Implications for future research and public policy are discussed. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

We use the staggered adoption of the Universal Demand Laws (UD Laws) to examine the effect of an exogenous reduction in shareholders' ability to litigate on the extent of accounting conservatism. On average, we find an increase in reporting conservatism post-UD. The increased conservatism is concentrated in firms that contemplate equity issuance, with a high proportion of monitoring investors, and high corporate governance quality. In contrast, firms with specific short-term incentives for aggressive accounting-such as those narrowly beating benchmarks, those with abnormal insider trading, and those likely to violate debt covenants-weakly governed firms, and firms with high ex ante litigation risk decrease reporting conservatism after UD. Our results suggest that the relation between the litigation environment and reporting conservatism is complex and dependent on specific characteristics and unique circumstances of the firms.

Using a database of 56 studies on corporate governance in the banking industry that were published between 2007 and 2019, this study performs a meta-analytic review to examine the impact of board governance on bank performance. We investigate how board size, CEO duality, outside directors, and female directors on board play a role in determining bank performance. Variations in the relationship between board governance and bank performance that attribute to moderating effects of potential moderators, including the system of corporate governance, bank performance measures, the definitions of governance variables, publication quality, and endogeneity concerns, are also encapsulated. Our study shows that bank performance is positively associated with larger boards and a high proportion of outside and female directors, supporting the resource dependence theory. We find that the moderating variables considerably alter the link between board governance and bank performance. The study offers ways to enhance board effectiveness by enforcing governance practices in the banking systems based on each countries' legal and institutional framework and suggests reconsidering mandates for smaller boards and duality on boards of banking firms.

We investigate the dividend policies of firms in the United Kingdom to understand whether firms in different markets use dividends as a signaling or disciplining device. The sample consists of 1247 firms from the highly regulated Main Market (MAIN) and relatively unregulated Alternative Investment Market (AIM) for the period 2002-2017. We find that firms in AIM pay lower dividends than their MAIN counterparts. However, during turbulence, AIM firms decrease dividends lower than MAIN firms. In line with the signaling hypothesis, AIM firms with increased profitability are more likely to increase dividends. These results suggest that AIM firms depend more on the signaling feature of the dividends, whereas MAIN firms use dividends as a disciplining device to limit managerial discretion. Specifically, we find that AIM firms facing bigger agency problems pay lower dividends compared to other AIM firms, in line with the outcome view of agency theory. (c) 2020 The Authors

The paper investigates the impact of chief executive officer (CEO) compensation on firm performance from a sample of 155 listed French companies on SBF 120, over 2009-2018. Findings suggest that an increase in CEO compensation seems to improve the accounting-based firm performance, nevertheless it hurts the firm stock market value. More pronounced results are reported when we control for sector compensation interactions. We argue that attractive compensation may improve the executive services in achieving shareholders' objectives, but investors seem to not appreciate a CEO compensation increase. Based on the agency theory, it might be argued that investors fear possible executive opportunistic behavior encouraging them to enjoy overcompensation. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Agency theory posits that the profit orientation of firms influences their social and organisational performance. However, due to the extensive heterogeneity of lending organisations operating in the microfinance industry, there is no general agreement in the literature on how profit orientation affects social and organisational outcomes of microfinance institutions (MFIs). In this paper, we contribute to this debate by analysing whether the relationship between outreach and financial performance of MFIs is mediated by their productivity and loan portfolio quality, and, separately, whether this relationship is moderated by their profit orientation. To this end, a partial least squares (PLS) multi-group analysis is applied to a worldwide sample of 435 MFIs. First, we find substantial differences in the business model among non-profit-oriented and profit-oriented lenders, but the findings also reveal that both types of MFIs can increase their outreach while improving their financial outcomes. Essentially, the analysis shows a negative direct effect of outreach on financial performance for non-profit lenders, but we also find that this negative effect is positively mediated via productivity and portfolio quality of non-profit lenders which leads to a positive overall impact of outreach on financial performance. Hence, our findings do not support the mission drift hypothesis popular in the microfinance literature. On the contrary, the results suggest that non-profit-oriented lenders achieving higher levels of productivity and loan portfolio quality can additionally obtain better financial outcomes.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of board governance quality (BGQ) and its mechanisms, namely board activity, board independence, board communication and board expertise, on the level of risk disclosure compliance (RDC) among financial institutions (FIs) in Uganda. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a cross-sectional design where data are collected through a questionnaire survey and audited financial statements of 83 FIs. The authors employ partial least square structural equation modeling (SmartPLS32.7) to test hypotheses. Findings: The authors find that the level of RDC in Ugandan FIs is low. Further, the study finds the positive relation between BGQ and RDC. Moreover, the authors find that RDC is positively and significantly related with board activity, board independence, board communication and board expertise. Furthermore, the authors find that the level of RDC is positively and significantly related to ownership type, firm size and board size, respectively. Nevertheless, industry type, number of branches and firm age are insignificantly related to RDC. Practical implications: The study provides relevant insights into regulators and policy makers with early symptoms of potential problems regarding weak board governance in FIs. Policy makers may also use these findings as a guideline tool for improving existing board governance frameworks in place and development of new disclosure policies. In addition, the study provides an input into the review and amendments of existing corporate governance codes for the regulators. Originality/value: This study offers the empirical evidence on the nexus between BGQ and RDC of FIs in Uganda. Moreover, the study also offers evidence on how BGQ mechanisms impact RDC. The study also further adds theoretical foundations to the RDC literature. (c) 2020, Geofrey Nkuutu, Joseph Mpeera Ntayi, Isaac Nabeeta Nkote, John Munene and Will Kaberuka.

Our study aims to investigate how information asymmetry and ownership structure affect cost of equity capital. For that purpose, we collected 246 issuers over 4 years for a total of 984 observations. By using panel data processing, we found that the information asymmetry we proxied through Price non-Synchronization and trading volume had an effect on the cost of equity capital. Our results also confirmed both Agency Theory and Pecking Order Theory. Both theories are in line with the conditions of the stock market in Indonesia. In addition, we found that institutional and foreign ownership structures also had an effect on the cost of equity capital. Furthermore, our results also confirmed Interest Alignment Theory and Entrenchment Theory. Our research is expected to contribute to the debate on the existence of information asymmetry and ownership structures in relation to the cost of equity capital. We also hope that it will be a valuable input for investors in considering their investment. Moreover, from the results of this study, investors can also consider foreign ownership or institutional ownership in determining their investment. In addition, stock market regulators in Indonesia can develop approaches to minimize information asymmetry and encourage foreign investors to invest in Indonesia. (c) 2021 by the authors.

This study exploits the staggered adoption of universal demand (UD) laws, which place significant obstacles to derivative lawsuits and thus, undermine shareholders' rights by 23 states in the United States (U.S.) from 1989 to 2005 as a quasi-natural experiment to examine the effects of shareholder litigation rights on corporate payout policy. Weakened litigation rights for shareholders materially increase firms' payout ratios. The effect is more pronounced for firms exposed to higher shareholder litigation risk ex-ante, firms with higher institutional holdings, and ones financially unconstrained. Overall, the findings are consistent with lower shareholder litigation threats motivating firms to increase dividend payouts. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate firm-level determinants of capital structure using a large sample of 4,284 Japanese firms over a 19-year period (i.e., over 61,000 firm-year observations), a hitherto less examined sample for this purpose. We conduct our analysis and interpret our findings predominantly within the pecking order, the trade-off and the agency theoretical frameworks. We uncover three new findings. First, our evidence indicates that insights derived from the extant literature on capital structure are cross-national and are applicable in the context of Japan, despite the unique characteristics of Japanese firms. Second, financial crisis significantly impacts the relationship between leverage and firm-level determinants, particularly accentuating the effect of asset tangibility and growth. Third, product market competition significantly impacts the observed relationship between firm-level determinants and leverage. Our results are robust, controlling for the joint effects of competition and crisis. (c) 2020 The Authors. International Journal of Finance & Economics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Agency theory suggests that entrenched managers are less likely to pay dividends. However, according to the catering theory, external pressures from investors can force managers to increase dividend payments. Hence, we test whether entrenched managers respond to investor demand for dividends and share repurchases. Using a large sample of 9677 US firms over the period 1990-2016 (i.e. a total of 80,478 firm-year observations), we test and find evidence that managerial entrenchment negatively impacts dividend payments. Our findings suggest that catering effects weaken the negative impact of managerial entrenchment on payout policy and that in firms with entrenched managers an increase in the propensity to pay dividends is conspicuous only when there is external investor demand for dividends. Our results indicate that while insiders and institutional owners might not necessarily favour dividend payments, firms respond to catering incentives when dominated by insiders but not institutional owners. Overall, our findings are consistent with the view that dividend payments are a result of external pressures to reduce agency problems associated with firms run by entrenched managers.

The study examines the influence of board structure on the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of corporate sustainability performance from the perspective of agency theory and stakeholder theory. If a firm's commitment to sustainable development is to satisfy environmental and social needs and to develop long-term relationships with all stakeholders for sustainable business, we expect that a board of directors would demonstrate their commitment by enhancing all different dimensions of sustainability. Based on a panel analysis of data from the emerging East Asian markets between 2011 and 2016, we identify which board attributes promote corporate sustainability performance and also prove that some attributes fit well with some particular sustainability dimensions. The findings have important implications by identifying the role of corporate boards in sustainability performance and providing a foundation for their efforts to enhance sustainable development.

Using the first ever Newsweek "Green Rankings" of the 500 largest U. S. firms in 2009 as a significant historical event, we test for the stockholder reaction to ratings of corporate environmental performance. Both the conventional null hypothesis significance testing and Bayesian approaches show that stockholders react significantly more positively to corporations with higher ratings of corporate environmental performance and that this effect is stronger in family owned firms. Our findings suggest that majority shareholders do not necessarily appropriate minority stockholders' rents when investing in environmental activities, as would be the case in the presence of "Type II" agency conflicts between majority family owners and minority stockholders. The family ownership effect is also found to be stronger in dirty (heavy polluting) industries as well as in more competitive and more opaque industry contexts.

Purpose: The main objective of the study is to ascertain the level of independence and the effectiveness of the Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) members of Islamic banks in Bangladesh. This is because only SSB members are empowered to oversee and certify the overall business functions of Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach: This paper implements qualitative case research approach to explore the research objective in the context of Bangladesh. We applied purposeful and snowball sampling tactics for selecting respondents. By using a semi-structured questionnaire and face-to-face interviews, we collect data from SSB members, central bank executives and experts in Islamic banking and Shariah governance. Findings: The study finds that majority Islamic banks' SSB's positions are similar to the Board of Directors (BOD) of the banks. Next, this study finds that in recruiting/selecting SSB members, some banks do not follow the guidelines of the central bank. This study finds mixed evidence regarding the independence of the members of the SSB. Most of the respondents opined that SSBs do not have power; in some cases, members of SSB are not independent and seeming powerless as BOD selects and recruits them. In contrast, they are dependent on management in respect of strategy implementation. Research limitations/implications: The study significantly contributed to the national and global regulatory bodies by identifying an important governance determinant of Islamic banks that is the independence of SSB members, which is highly important for both Shariah functions, and to enhance the trust level of the stakeholders. This study makes a theoretical contribution by documenting the violation of stakeholder theory and agency theory in recruiting SSB members by BOD's choice. The lack of SSB members' independence has an impact on Shariah legitimacy of the Islamic banks which is contradictory with the notion of legitimacy theory. This study recommends the central bank to ensure the independence of the SSB and central bank should take initiatives to develop an environment for the Islamic banking sector. Originality/value: This study extends the literature of corporate governance relating to Islamic banking and financial institutions. More specifically, this paper explores the necessity of independence of members of the monitoring body (here SSB), an important constituent of governance, to ensure high-quality governance and transparency in reporting to increase diverse stakeholders' trust/confidence. The absence of independence of SSB in performing their functions contradicts with the agency, stakeholder and legitimacy theory, which is inconsistent with global evidence, that demands further investigations.

Auditors of foreign cross-listed firms face liability arising from the nature of the institutional monitoring framework of legal claims that can potentially be brought against the auditor in both the home country and the US. This paper is the first to document the relationship between auditor liability and auditor pricing of excess cash holdings for foreign firms cross-listed in the US. Our findings indicate that auditors demand a fee premium for foreign incorporated clients with greater excess cash holdings, consistent with auditors recognizing the potential for legal exposure to agency conflict arising from foreign listed US traded clients. Furthermore, we examine aspects of foreign capital market protections, such as disclosure requirements, the strength of legal enforcement, and the strength of shareholder rights to better understand auditor perception of the liability they incur due to the agency costs associated with excess cash holdings. We find that there is a significant positive association between audit fees and excess cash holdings for firms where the country of incorporation permits greater liability of auditors in criminal and civil litigation. In addition, auditors assign higher audit fees to firms holding greater excess cash incorporated in countries with greater required accounting disclosure, stronger legal enforcement and stronger shareholder rights.

The objective of the present research is to examine the relationship between corporate governance and voluntary disclosure, and to determine how certain factors enhance governance practices and consequently increase voluntary disclosure. The study considers the content analysis of 22 Saudi listed companies from 2015 to 2019. A comprehensive index is developed, with a check-list covering 30 items to extract and measure corporate governance practices and levels of voluntary disclosure. The researchers use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to examine whether corporate governance-specific mechanisms can explain any differences in voluntary disclosure levels among the listed companies. The results indicate a statistically significant relationship between the number of non-executive directors and board size and the level of voluntary disclosure. This study concluded that non-executive directors and board size are ranked the highest in terms of their positive effects on voluntary disclosure. The relationship between the independent directors and audit committees and voluntary disclosure is insignificant. The results suggest that the high number of non-executive directors and the increase in the number of directors on the boards lead to greater voluntary disclosure of information. This study helps regulators of corporate governance and company directors understand the factors affecting voluntary disclosure. Corporate governance regulators should require an increase in the minimum number of boards and non-executive directors for listed companies in order to gain the desired levels of voluntary disclosure and transparency. Saudi listed companies are advised to willingly increase their board members to the maximum number specified by regulation. This study has some limitations as participants represented a small sample; hence, the results cannot be generalised. Furthermore, the voluntary disclosure data were collected only from annual reports; sources such as websites, public announcements and press releases, were not taken into account, but would have provided many relevant details.

This article uses Michel Foucault's conceptualization of power to rethink how power operates within leadership relations. Foucault (1980:220) defines power as a "a structure of actions, bearing on the actions of those who are free." This idea is explored, noting how it differs from much leadership theorizing which defines power in terms of a leader's position or personal characteristics. Foucault's assertions that "power is everywhere" (1988, 12), that it is relationally based and is best perceived through its effects are examined. We identify implications for researching power from this perspective, including the appropriateness of methods capable of mapping social, historical, and institutional dynamics. We offer four analytic strategies: beginning from power's outcomes, investigating points of resistance, proactively identifying hidden dynamics and attending to networked alliances. Insights generated from this approach highlight the contingent, ephemeral nature of power and help explain the indeterminacy leaders often experience when wielding it in practice.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the moderating role of chief executive officer (CEO) power on the relationship between divestiture strategy and firm performance by framing the relationship under the agency and power circulation theories. Design/methodology/approach: This study focuses on a sample of 319 non-financial public-listed companies in Malaysia from the year 2012-2016 and estimates the model under two-step generalized method of moments panel regression to eliminate the endogeneity issue. Findings: The results show that divestiture strategy decreased the firm performance. Meanwhile, greater CEO power changed that divestiture effect but still failed to increase the performance. This study also indicates the CEO power strengthens the relationship between firm performance and divestiture. Research limitations/implications: The overall findings show that the positive moderating role of CEO power on the relationship between divestiture and performance. This research confirmed the agency and power circulation theories by showing that CEO power can make divestiture strategy works. However, the moderating plot tells different. CEO power may strengthen the relationship between divestiture and performance; it fails to boost up the performance in overall. Therefore, this study is about CEO power on the strategic decision and gives a good implication for corporate governance concerning the impact of CEO power on the organization's alignment process. Originality/value: This study examines the effect of CEO power on the performance of divestiture strategy implementation by contesting the agency and power circulation theories within an emerging country context.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the empirical relationship between family firms and lean innovation (i.e. generating more output with less input) as well as the moderating role of the executive's compensation. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data for ten years (2007-2016) have been collected from the CSMAR database. This study concludes the findings using descriptive statistics, correlation and panel data analysis techniques applying statistical software STATA. Findings: Results show that family firms are not motivated to follow lean innovation strategies until unless the executives are compensated well. We further find that family firms are more likely to pursue a lean innovation strategy, and they demonstrate a superior record of converting R&D inputs as granted patents, and; both input and output innovation are significantly affected by executive compensations. However, this study shows an insignificant negative relationship of propensity to patents with the moderating effects of executive compensation. Research limitations/implications: This research has been conducted on the emerging Chinese market. The study is useful for policymakers and managers to devise such strategies which can make the role of executive's more effective to reduce the agency cost and reap the benefits of innovation input more effectively (Petersen, 2009). Also, family firms are heterogeneous, and the research outcome may be applicable for both advanced and emerging economies. Originality/value: The previous family firm's research paid less attention to the role of the executive's compensation on the relationship of family firms and lean innovation. Moreover, they prioritize insight into how executive's compensation affects different proxies of innovation. This study sheds new light on the paradoxical findings of family firms and lean innovation by analyzing the significant role of executive compensation. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Rule changes are not uncommon in most professional sports, and scholars often study the effects of such changes. Given the substantial increase in rule changes and the substantially different nature of new rules (e.g., safety driven) in the National Football League since 2005, the authors examined how coaches adapt to the changing National Football League in terms of coaching strategies and securing subsequent head coach positions in the labor market. Using agency theory, the authors identified agency misalignment when coaches employ strategies whereby incurring more penalties results in on-field success, but decreases their likelihood of obtaining future employment as a head coach. In addition, the authors found evidence that, regardless of the penalties accrued, former coaches who previously held more head coaching jobs, are Black, or are younger have higher chances of securing subsequent head coaching positions. However, these attributes do not increase team performance, indicating that coach-hiring decisions are incongruent with determinants of coach performance. (c) 2021 Human Kinetics, Inc.

This study examines the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on corporate social performance. The amount a given country spends on corporate social responsibility activities varies due to various motives. Therefore, the objectives of the study involve examining the impact of board characteristics and ownership structure on corporate social responsibility. Based on a panel data regression, this study finds that board size is positively related to corporate social performance (social performance and environmental performance) in the Chinese context. In the case of India and South Africa, board size exhibits a negative relationship, which is inversely related to China. CEO duality is positively related to firms' corporate social performance in India and China. However, in the context of South Africa, it exhibits a negative relationship. Gender diversity has positive impact in India and South Africa, wherein in case of China it is inversely related. It is observed that women on the board and women directors significantly influence corporate social responsibility spending. Moreover, among the ownership structure, family ownership is positively related to corporate social responsibility in the India and South Africa. The institutional investors have a negative impact in South Africa and a positive impact in India and China. This study supports the stewardship theory and agency theory and finds that firms should spend on corporate social responsibility activities to protect the interests of the stakeholders and the role of firms' responsibilities towards different sectors of society. Finally, this study provides insights into the state-of-the-art literature and offers practical implications for top-level management and shareholders. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

The extant academic literature has shown the distinct differences between Islamic and conventional financial institutions along either a performance or efficiency front with an attribution to these differences to the adoption of a religio-financial framework merging the principles of economics and finance with those of Shariah. However, these empirical estimations do not entirely capture the religio-financial framework since they use performance and efficiency measures that include both conventional and Shariah transactions. We address this gap in the literature by examining the dynamics influencing the holding behavior of Shariah assets by Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). Given that the a priori hypothecation of Shariah asset holding behavior is relatively nebulous, we draw extensively from the traditional macroeconomic and managerialist literature in building our econometric model. By exploiting a unique and proprietary dataset comprising 140 Islamic financial institutions operating in 16 different countries over the time period 2011-2015, we find that economic wealth, market liquidity and the institutional board size are robust and positive linear predictors of IFI Shariah assets' holding behavior, thus providing support for the traditional macroeconomic theory of asset demand and firm-based agency theory.

Since the early 2000s, Sino-foreign equity joint ventures (JVs) have declined sharply as a predominant strategy for multinational enterprises (MNEs) to enter and operate in China. We study one of the contributory factors, foreign buyout, and its performance implications. By applying incomplete contract theory and an agency perspective, we provide micro evidence that superior post buyout performance is observed in converted wholly-owned subsidiaries (WOSs) with efficiency-seeking operations and subsequent CEO succession. The findings extend our understanding that ownership per se does not guarantee performance improvement. Instead, it is the alignment between ownership and the owner's inputs, and between ownership and the owner's managerial control, that give rise to performance improvement. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We present evidence that the negative impact of CEO short-termism on firm value can be attributed to a sub-optimal exercise of real options. Accordingly, the value relevance of firms' real options portfolios is maximized in the absence of CEO temporal myopia. Moreover, the impact of real options on firms' stock returns' idiosyncratic characteristics is more pronounced when CEOs' decision horizons are longer, in line with the view that enhanced operating flexibility from longer decision horizons can amplify the convexity of real options' payoffs. These findings have important implications regarding the impact of CEO career horizons on corporate strategies and board decisions related to CEO incentives and succession.

Our study aims to investigate the impact of some governance mechanisms especially, shareholder activism, gender diversity, board independence, and board size, on investment efficiency as measured by capital expenditure (CAPEX). So, we conducted an empirical study on 626 Asian listed companies (China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and India) during the period2012-2019. To test our hypotheses, we used panel data estimation and constructed estimates using three estimation methods: GLS, NEWEY-WEST, and WLS regressions. To strengthen our results, we established a robustness test by choosing a new measure for our dependent variable: the growth rate of Property, plant, and equipment (Growth PP&E). The results of our study highlight that shareholder activism, gender diversity, and duality impact negatively and significantly the level of investment efficiency, while debt and board size have positive impact on the dependent variable. The robustness check confirmed these results. (c) 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Drawing on stakeholder and agency theories, we examine how employee friendly practices impact dividend payments in emerging countries. Using data from 862 firms and 6,071 firm-year observations from 17 emerging countries, we find that the employee friendly practices are negatively related to the dividend payments. This relationship is found to be stronger for government owned firms. We further examine the 'agency problems' and 'future investment' as possible channels through which employee friendly practices may lead firms to pay low dividends. We find the support for the future investment channel. Lastly, we examine the value effect of employee friendly treatment and find that employee friendly practices increase firm performance in emerging markets which lends support to the effectiveness of the investment channel.

This paper examines whether firms' deviation from target leverage may predict types and outcomes of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals. We find that over-levered firms are more inclined to be involved in public acquisitions than non-public acquisitions. Consistent with the proposition of information economics theory, our findings suggest that information asymmetry is the main motive behind over-levered firms' preference for public targets. Specifically, we observe that over-levered acquirers not only prefer public targets, but also pick those with less information asymmetry. We find that, in the short term, the market reacts negatively to the announcement of public acquisitions by over-levered firms. However, in the long term these acquirers experience better operating synergies and values, measured by changes in return on assets and Tobin's q, respectively. Our results are robust after controlling for M&A deals-, firm-, industry-characteristics and endogeneity concerns using both propensity score matching and Heckman two stage methods. Overall, our findings support the premises of agency theory and Uysal, Journal of Financial Economics (2011), 102, 602-620 view that over-levered firms have a high tendency to pursue most value-enhancing acquisition deals due to the high pressure of holding high levels of debt.

We examine the extent to which outsider chief executive officers (CEOs) influence corporate financial leverage policies. We define an outsider CEO as one who appears in the reporting year and became CEO either immediately upon joining or within 3 months of joining a firm. There are arguments in the literature that the selection of an outsider CEO can either increase or decrease financial leverage. We investigate this issue using 11,118 Australian firm-year observations from 1216 firms listed during the period 2001-2015. Our findings suggest that, in the short-term after their appointment, outsider CEOs reduce firm dependence on debt. This result is robust to several additional tests and four measures to minimize endogeneity concerns. However, with an increase in their tenure at the firm, outsider CEOs revert to greater dependency on corporate debt. After supplementary analyses, we determine that the outsider CEOs short-term strategy of reducing financial leverage involves using cash reserves and restricting dividends to reduce existing debt. Instead, outsider CEOs finance capital expenditure projects thus providing a positive signal to the market that such CEOs are more creditworthy. Our results also suggest that outsider CEOs exercise more control over financial leverage when they have specialist attributes. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Research Question/Issue: On the basis of a dynamic interrelation between the assumptions of agency theory and stewardship theory, this study seeks to make sense of disobedience at the highest corporate level. Departing from a processual view in order to better understand how loyalty plays a critical role in the relationships between a CEO and his/her principal, we propose a conceptualization of the options open to a top executive in disagreement with the principal. We view the relationship from "below" by primarily taking the CEO's perspective, resulting in a more complex view on how "duty" is perceived and acted upon by the CEO. Research Findings/Insights: We use the rich and abundant archives left behind by the CEO of a large French firm. We had access to over 50,000 pages of documents that allowed us to follow the CEO and his relationships with his principals, at times from day to day. We found two competing loyalties (loyalty to the principal--agency theory--and loyalty to the organization--stewardship theory) that gradually become independent of each other, triggering different responses in terms of "exits" from the relationship with the principal. This particular dynamic in which the CEO acted as a guardian of the overall purpose of the organization enabled the emergence, development, and consolidation of a disobedience process that over the years contributed to the well-being of his firm as well as to the social changes occurring in France at that time. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This longitudinal study extends the corporate governance literature by offering a process-oriented approach, quite rare in this stream of research, and a more dynamic view of how agency theory and stewardship theory interact. Then, by providing empirical support for the idea that the disobedience process can protect and allow an organization to first evolve positively over time and eventually contribute to social improvements, our study proposes a form of responsible stewardship. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers important insights for executives, directors, and shareholders on how to make sense of, and in the long run potentially benefit from, disobedience at the highest corporate levels.

This study examines the relationship between board composition and voluntary risk disclosure during uncertainty for a sample of United Kingdom-listed companies. A strand of the disclosure literature focusing on the impact of the board on corporate disclosure argues that board composition influences the extent and quality of corporate disclosure, but such literature has largely used data from stable periods and rarely on risk disclosure. Instead, using agency theory, we examine the impact of board composition on risk disclosure during corporate uncertainty for a sample of UK-listed companies for the period 2006-2015. We used content analysis to derive our measure of risk disclosure and measure board composition based on its size, independence, meeting frequency, and gender diversity. Our regression analyses controlled for the extent of firms' agency costs, firm risk level, and the impact of mandatory risk disclosure regulation, among other control variables. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that board size and board independence are positively associated with firms' risk disclosure during uncertainty, but board meeting frequency and gender diversity seem inconsequential for risk disclosure. Firms' risk disclosure is positively associated with risk level and mandatory risk disclosure. Our results are robust to alternative model specifications and endogeneity concerns. We highlight the implications of our findings for management practice and regulations. (c) 2021 Board of Trustees, Vernon K. Zimmerman Center, University of Illinois.

Despite concerns that profit-sharing plans might have a detrimental effect on audit quality, there is little empirical evidence on this issue. We examine the effects of the type of profit-sharing plan, level of client importance, and auditor reinforcement sensitivity ( joint sensitivity to rewards and punishments) on auditor reporting decisions. By relying on agency theory and reinforcement sensitivity theory, we posit that the joint effects of profit-sharing and client importance on auditors' decisions are contingent on reinforcement sensitivity. In an experiment with 450 audit partners and managers, we manipulate type of profit-sharing plan and client importance, and measure extroversion and neuroticism. We find the highest audit quality when profit-sharing is based on firm performance, client importance is low, and reinforcement sensitivity is high. Thus, instead of just modifying the type of profit-sharing plans, it is the mix of economic incentives and personality traits that affect audit quality. (c) 2021, American Accounting Association.

This study investigates the associations between investment efficiency and both the existence of a board investment committee (IC) and its expertise. Using a sample of industrial firms from six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries across the 2005-2018 period, we find that IC existence reduces both under- and overinvestment by these firms. We also find that financial expertise among committee members affects firms' investment efficiency positively. These findings are consistent with the assertion that ICs assist with the monitoring and control of firms' investments. We also find that ICs reduce over- and underinvestment in firms with high levels of foreign ownership concentration. Our finding that reliance on an investment committee enhances investment efficiency is consistent with the tenets of agency theory in firms dominated by government and family ownership structures. These results are robust to a battery of additional tests that use alternative measures of investment efficiency, and to tests for self-selection bias and endogeneity.

Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: This paper aims to examine how the political effectiveness and board independence moderate the effect of managerial entrenchment on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/Methodology/Approach: Data of non-financial firms from the BRICS countries for the period of 2010-2018 were obtained from Thomson Reuters (asset 4) and financial reports. Panel regression model was employed to analyse the data. Research findings: The results show that there is a positive relationship between managerial entrenchment and CSR. Political embeddedness was found to strengthen the positive relationship between managerial entrenchment and CSR. Independent directors was reported to weaken the relationship between managerial entrenchment and CSR. Theoretical contribution/Originality: Theoretically, this study contributes to the literature on agency theory. The finding provides novel insights into how managerial entrenchment affects CSR activities. It also expands the body of knowledge on corporate governance and CSR by focusing on manager's self-interest to shareholder's interest. Practitioner/Policy implication: Practically, this study provides valuable information to stakeholders, regulatory authorities and investors who wish to assess various antecedents of CSR. Research limitation/Implications: Future study should consider comparing the developed and developing countries. Other aspects of CSR should also be considered for better understanding. This study sheds light on the relevance of promoting the social and environmental awareness mechanisms surrounding companies in addition to developing CSR policies focused on corporations of BRICS countries.

The growth in institutional holdings of public firms has led to increased interest in the concept of common ownership, in which the same investor owns stakes in multiple firms within the same industry. Economic theory suggests that common ownership could affect firm performance, but little empirical research has examined the nature of this effect or how a firm's extant marketing potentially relates to this effect. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a relationship between common ownership and firm performance that is moderated by the firm's extant marketing capabilities and its relative marketing strategic emphasis. Our empirical approach employs data from over 43 million institutional holdings to develop a measure of common ownership and accounts for empirical issues like endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity. The results document a positive relationship between common ownership and firm performance and provide some evidence that this effect is stronger for firms with lower marketing capabilities and a relative strategic emphasis towards R&D spending. These results suggest that public policymakers should consider the firms' extant strategic marketing when assessing regulations on common ownership. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: This study aims to assess the relationship between managerial entrenchment and accounting conservatism in Iran. Design/methodology/approach: To test hypotheses, all listed companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange during 2013-2018 (six years) that qualified were selected. Given the defined limitations of the study, a total of 120 firms with 720 year-observations was selected. After collecting data and figures, they were analyzed using EViews software. Having presented the inferential model tests, the panel data with fixed effects model is chosen. Findings: The study results indicate a positive and significant relationship between managerial entrenchment and unconditional conservatism presented in the income statement. Moreover, the authors find a meaningful relationship between managerial entrenchment and unconditional conservatism about the balance sheet. Practical implications: Managers will be more aware of the positive consequences of employment optimal corporate governance such as conservative accounting. Such corporate governance is likely to serve their interest in the long run by providing positive signals to the equity owners and board of directors. Originality/value: By assessing conservatism's literature in Iran, we observe many studies on this concept. Still, no investigation is carried out on the relationship between conservatism in accounting and managerial entrenchment. The present study is innovative because it evaluates the relationship between managerial entrenchment and two types of conservatism, namely, balance sheet and income statement conservatism, which have never been investigated by prior studies, notably in emerging markets.

Research Summary: Boards are unlikely to be effective if they do not have sufficient collective expertise to understand, monitor, and address future risks. This begs the question, does the board, in fact, have this expertise? If not, can they reconfigure their expertise to address those risks? Building on agency theory, we analyze the alignment between the board's expertise and the firm's future risks, with the expectation that board composition will change over time to reflect the firm's future risks--strategic reconfiguration. Our results show that misalignment has negative implications for firm performance, misalignment also motivates appropriate board reconfiguration, and that this reconfiguration positively effects firm performance. Managerial Summary: Our study illustrates the need for board expertise to be aligned with firm risks. While there has been increasing pressure for firms to assess their directors' expertise (i.e., skill matrices), simply identifying expertise which is present or absent does not speak to whether that expertise is actually needed (or not) by the firm given the risks faced. We analyze boards' collective expertise, compare that with the risks that firms are facing, and identify the gaps which may detrimentally impact the monitoring ability of the board and cause firm performance to suffer. Consequently, understanding the degree of (mis)alignment is of paramount importance for boards to be effective monitors and positively influence firm performance. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Based on agency theory, this paper contributes to the literature by assessing the effects of Supervisory Board size, gender diversity, and multiple directorship on performance within the banking industry of the small island developing state: Curacao. The research made use of the data drawn from annual reports of locally generated banks and its subsidiaries. Results from linear regressions indicate a positive relationship between multiple directorship and bank performance, and a negative association between bank outcomes and both gender diversity and board size. According to these results, it is concluded that the legislation on corporate governance for credit institutions in Curacao should incorporate a maximum number of members on the board, as well as promote interlocking directorates and quotas by gender.

Scholars endorsing the embeddedness outlook call for directors' greater engagement in the strategic management process. In contrast, scholars endorsing the control outlook argue that directors should focus on fulfilling their fiduciary duty of supervising top executives. Based on the behavioral-agency theory, this paper outlines a conduct outlook on boards. Recognizing the benefits of directors' participation in the strategic management process, we hypothesize that it may boost directors' satisfaction with firm's performance, strategic planning, and strategy. This could lead to cognitive entrenchment and spur inertial tendencies. Structural equations modeling analysis of the data from a survey of 367 Canadian directors supports the hypotheses. These findings add knowledge to latest research on the advantages vs. disadvantages of activist boards. (c) 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

IMPACT: We need to know more about the financial accountability of corporatized public services. In this article, the authors analyse the audit fees of a large sample of English local SOEs from 2009-2017, assessing the impact of board composition and ownership structure on those fees. SOEs with more politicians on their boards of directors had higher audit costs and this was especially so for majority-owned SOEs. This article highlights the need for policy-makers to evaluate the consistency of auditing arrangements for the hybrid arm's-length organizations delivering public services.

This article investigates the relationship between political control and audit fees for local state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in England--hybrid public service organizations not subject to public sector audit. Panel regression techniques are used to analyse secondary data on 405 SOEs for 2009-2017 where major local authorities held an interest. Statistical results suggest greater political representation on boards of directors of local SOEs is associated with higher audit fees and positive relationship between political control and audit fees is stronger for majority public ownership.

Purpose: Classical assumptions of agency theory (AT) fall short of providing satisfactory answers to modern management and organizational knowledge (MOK) problems, and there is a need for extending the scope of the field. This article aims to compare modern AT assumptions with the agency perspective of Islamic historical political treatises (namely, siyasetnamas) and point out how AT can be furthered. Design/methodology/approach: This article applies content analysis method to find out agency perspectives in Islamic political treatises and then compare them with those of the basic AT assumptions to find out similarities and differences between them in explaining agency problems. Findings: The agency perspective in siyasetnamas are based on the following assumptions which could contribute to the development of AT with their emphasis on (1) responsibilities beyond contracts, (2) entrustment rather than ownership, (3) shared societal responsibility rather than conflicting individual interests, (4) importance of self-control for both principals and agents and (5) trust discourse which emphasizes inner virtues rather than control discourse. Originality/value: Agency perspectives cannot be considered independent of cultural imprints. By introducing siyasetnamas' agency perspective, this article makes an effort to suggest implications for how to further modern MOK based overwhelmingly on individualistic cultural assumptions to rediscuss agency problems from the viewpoint of specifically the emerging markets in which collectivist culture plays an important role in social and economic life. In this respect, siyasetnamas' agency perspective based on the notion of entrustment seems, arguably, to be a better fit to the contextual realities and managerial practices of emerging markets.

This paper aims to explore several issues related to the financial performance of the listed companies in the UAE financial market. Agency theory and legitimacy theory were studied in which four criteria were extracted (corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, sustainability, and leadership).These criteria were then analyzed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) powerful mechanisms using information collected by a developed questionnaire that compares and sets priority between each element in the designed AHP model.The finding of our study shows the importance of corporate governance in improving the overall financial performance of the listed companies in the UAE. With the least emphasis on the outcome based leadership.This paper makes several important contributions to literature. First, it is an answer to the most recent calls from experts in the MENA region regarding the new trends faced in the financial market. Second, the present paper provides an examination of the performance of the big listed companies in the UAE Financial Market to reach a possible alternative that will lower the level of fluctuation in the stock exchange, which is considered among the first initiatives in the field. Third, this paper will provide a new insight to authority, as it will identify some gaps in the corporate practices and compliance in relation with different financial auditing, which will help not only in mitigating risks but also in improving the listed companies performance over the long run. Finally, the entire framework is new and has not been identified in previous literature. (c) 2021, Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies. All Rights Reserved.

The current study examines the effect of ownership structure (i.e., government ownership, family ownership, and foreign ownership) on chief executive officer (CEO) compensation in an emerging market, by considering Jordan as a case study. By using a sample of 136 non-financial firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange over the period of 2015-2019, we find that family ownership has a positive and significant impact on CEO compensation. The finding regarding foreign ownership is contrary to expectations, with a higher foreign ownership reflecting a higher CEO compensation. Overall, these results imply that the ownership structure of Jordanian companies exerts a significant influence on the CEO pay setting process. However, government ownership has no relationship with CEO compensation. This indicates that government ownership is ineffective in determining CEO compensation. We further find that firm size is positively related to CEO compensation, indicating that larger companies have more ability to generate high internal funding, and can afford to pay higher compensation to quality managerial talent. In contrast, the effects of firm age and liquidity are not at significant levels. (c) 2021 Asian Economic and Social Society. All rights reserved.

Effective corporate governance leads the way towards aligning the interest between managers and shareholders. Effectiveness of practicing the corporate governance of companies in Sri Lanka is debatable topic due to the variation between standard and actual practices. This study aims to examine the influence of board diversity on agency costs of companies listed in Sri Lanka as proposed by agency theory. The sample of this research consists of all companies listed in Sri Lanka, exclusive of bank and financial institutions which are practicing unique governance practices issued by Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The final sample consists of 180 companies during the period from 2013 to 2019. This study deployed panel regression analysis to test the relationship formulated in the hypotheses by using the EViews 9 software. The results showed that the board diversity-related variables such as separate leadership structure and presence of non-executive director on companies' board are appeared to have significant influence on agency costs. Meanwhile, board size does not have direct impact on agency costs. The findings of this study regarding board diversity and agency costs have important managerial implications, that these findings are unlikely to the prediction of agency theory and best practices. Agency theory is not applicable to these companies, since the exiting corporate governance practices increase agency costs. The potential benefits of this study led to re-think the board of directors of the companies, managers, shareholder and the policymakers to re-organise the implementation of best practices.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify whether negative operating cash flows are related to investment inefficiency, and specifically whether they are related to subsequent overinvestment and if this relationship is driven by agency problems within the firm. Design/methodology/approach: The study conducts fixed effect regressions, testing the relationship between negative operating cash flows and the firm's subsequent investment inefficiency. The relationship is further examined for all firms based on size, corporate governance and cash holdings - all of which are related to agency problems. Findings: The proportion of firms reporting negative operating cash flows has been increasing over time and is positively related to subsequent investment inefficiency. This increase is explained not only by the rise in investment of intangible assets. The positive relationship is not explained by the firm size or corporate governance, but is related to cash holdings. These results are consistent across four different measures of firm investment. Practical implications: The percentage of publicly traded firms with negative operating cash flows has never been higher. This paper is one of the first to identify factors that may be contributing to this rise. Originality/value: This study extends prior findings by identifying previously unexplored factors related to the rise in firms with negative operating cash flows. The rise in investment of intangible assets does not explain the increase alone. High cash holdings also influence the rise in negative operating cash flows. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper studied how firm governance affects the performance of quoted deposit money banks in Nigeria. The paper aimed to ascertain the effects of board size, board composition, and gender diversity after controlling for firm age and firm size on financial performance. The study was predicated on stewardship theory, agency theory, and resource dependency theory. Data was fetched from the financial statements of all quoted deposit money banks. The study utilized a panel regression method to examine the relationship between the predictive and explanatory variables from 2015 to 2019. The study population comprised the 14 banks listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange as of 31 December 2019. The individual outcomes showed that board size and gender diversity in conjunction with firm age have significant impacts in both directions on the financial performance proxied by return on assets. As can be inferred from the panel random effect test results, it was concluded that corporate governance mechanisms were collectively discovered to have significant relationships with the financial performance in the study, which was confirmed by the p-value (0.01695<0.05). The study recommended, among others, that deposit money banks in Nigeria should ensure that the employment of autonomous executives should not only be based on the supervisory ability of these members, but also on liberated proficient business competence and skills.

Using an agency theory framework, we investigate the relationship between CEO option pay and CEO risk-taking behavior. We integrate the incentive alignment and monitoring approaches to reducing principal-agent conflicts by considering them simultaneously. We develop and test hypotheses that suggest that aspects of the governance system of a firm moderate the relationship between CEO option pay and CEO risk-taking. Results based on data collected from 204 Fortune 1000 U.S. manufacturing firms revealed a strong, positive relationship between CEO option pay and CEO risk-taking. Further, moderating effects were found for CEO duality, blockholder ownership, institutional ownership, and insider ownership. However, empirical analyses fail to provide adequate evidence to support the expected moderating effect of board independence. (c) 2021

This study attempts to examine the role of managers in the associated agency theory on dividend policy decisions for firms that do not skip dividend payments. This research sample considered the firms that are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and pay regular dividends on an annual basis from the financial year 2011 to 2020. Panel data econometric tools and robustness tests were carried out for model validation. The study results show that there is a higher positive relationship between change in payout ratio and managerial remuneration. Similarly, there is a large positive significance to increase manager incentive for regular payer firms with greater promoter control in higher dividend payout. Thus, this brings an agency theory perspective of rewarding well to managers to increase promoter wealth. Hence, policymakers can contemplate these findings to analyze the nexus between managers and promoters in the dividend policy of firms that never skip their dividend payments.

The uncertainty of outcomes from innovation typically affects related decision-making in family firms. Innovation presents both opportunities for business growth and investment risks, and the relationship between family firms and innovation remains inconclusive. Moreover, the interplay between family firm ownership and control rights may result in agency problems. Ownership by family members can be regarded as a real option for family shareholders. Thus, we combine agency theory and the real option view to argue that ownership structure characteristics among family members in board affect innovation in family firms. Examination of the innovation behaviors of Taiwanese family firms reveals that ownership concentration among family board directors positively influences innovation in family firms. In addition, family board directors without personal ownership in the family firm are more supportive of innovation than those who have such ownership. (c) 2021 IEEE.

The purpose of this study is to investigate capital structure in the Pakistani corporate sector in light of the interest rate gap with other countries and emerging Islamic banking in the country. The study investigates the effect of leverage on firm value (Tobin's Q) and how other variables impact this relationship. The study used the System-GMM-Fixed effect model for linear analysis and fixed effect panel threshold regression model by Hansen (1999) for quadratic analysis using data from non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock exchange for the period 2005 to 2019. The results show that there is a negative relation between leverage and the value of the firm. In contrast, debt and non-debt tax shields have a positive relationship with the value of the firm. The study also found that there is quadratic nature of leverage with the value of the firm. The study supports Trade-off theory, pecking order theory, while it doesn't support agency theory.

Despite the agency theory prescribes risk alignment effect of corporate governance through CEO ownership, the empirical inquiries into the relationship between CEO ownership and corporate risk-taking thus far yielded a mixed result. This study aims to examine the nuances of such a relationship in the presence of financial slack and technological opportunities by contingency models. The study employs the secondary data in a sample of S&P 1500 from 2006 to 2018. According to empirical results, this study finds that both financial slack and technological opportunities positively moderate the CEO ownership-R&D investment relationship.

Short-termism (i.e., the sub-optimal favouring of short-term performance over long-term performance) is generally explained as an outcome of the agency relationship whereby self-interested managers and/or stock market pressures distort the balance between short and long-term performance. We investigate if short-termism (Crilly, 2017; Reilly, Souder, & Ranucci, 2016) is due to cognitive bias (temporal distortion) rather than agency costs. We test these hypotheses with an experimental approach by applying a 3x2 factorial design to manipulate temporal distortion on 60 non-conflicted decision-makers. Results suggest that individuals make inconsistent investment decisions based on differing payout time horizons. Participants faced with simple comparisons between investment opportunities were consistent across different time periods and followed a model of rational decision-making. In contrast, more complex decisions led to intertemporal inconsistency. We provide evidence that: 1) individuals on the whole struggle to deal with incorporating time into business decisions in a consistent way causing us to question the link between short-termism and agency theory; 2) principals likely view investment decisions inconsistently across time and so are a cause of sub-optimal investment decision-making and 3) we need to look beyond studies of moral hazard associated with agency theory and/or myopic market pricing when investigating short-termism.

How multinational enterprises (MNEs) coordinate and control their geographically dispersed subunits is central to international management research (Kostova, Nell, & Hoenen, 2018). Our study adopts agency rationales to evaluate the effects of headquarters (HQs)-subsidiary convergence on the performance levels of the latter. Convergence within organizations relies to a large amount on controls that predicate a specific extent of alignment. In theory, the concept of alignment is seen as a valid proxy of agency intensity (Eisenhardt, 1989). Drawing on the supposition that MNEs are differentiated networks, where some subsidiaries continue to function the traditional competence-exploiting role while others are competence-creating and augment the advantages of their home-base (Bjorkman, Barner-Rasmussen, & Li, 2004), alignment challenges can be manifested in six dimensions that define their strategic posture, span the organizational context and underly competitive imperatives: 1) subsidiary strategy, 2) culture, 3) governance practices, 4) financial decisions, 5) human resources, and 6) environmental activity. Drawing on a sample of 72 MNE foreign operations and gathering 254 responses from top management team (TMT) members, our results indicate that strategic, cultural, governance, and HR alignment are important determinants of subsidiary performance. However, whereas strategic, cultural, and governance convergence between HQs and subsidiaries are positively related to increased performance levels, an ethnocentric approach towards HR practices seems to trigger welfare losses.

Risk management is a prevalent concept that underlines the value of providing good quality control and risk management functions to effectively monitor the corporate risk management framework. Previously, the MCCG 2007 mandated listed companies to include a risk management team in the internal audit committee to assess the efficacy of the organization's risk management, internal control, and governance process. However, due to recent corporate failures and ineffectiveness of audit committee to monitor firm performance, there is a growing need for a separate RMC. Thus, the purpose of the study is therefore to analyse the risk management committee's structure and effectiveness distinguishing two (2) models; a separate and combined RMC on the firm financial performances of listed companies in Malaysia. The research is based on a Static Panel data technique involving regression based on FEM, REM and Pooled Ordinary Least Square (OLS). The findings indicate that a company that set up an RMC consisting of a majority of independent non-executive directors, specifically a separate RMC, would significantly improve the firm's performance. The latter results support Agency Theory which suggests that independent non-executive directors enhanced the transparency of corporate boards as they improved the firm's compliance with the disclosure requirements.

Even though the Board of Commissioners has a significant role in making an optimal international decision, there is a limited empirical finding using data from the Unique Continental corporate governance system, such as Indonesia. This study examines the relationship between the Board of Commissioners diversity and service companies' international decision. Specifically, this study investigates the effect of ethnic, nationality, qualification, and experience diversity of Board of Commissioners on the international decision. A company with a high Board of Commissioners diversity tends to have more effective monitoring the Management Board and therefore reduce the agency cost and the company performance. Ninety-nine service companies listed in Indonesia's stock exchange has participated in this study. As this study using the multivariate regression analysis, the classical assumptions must be satisfied. The result shows that ethnic, qualification and experience diversity have a significant effect on the international decision. Besides, company size tends to have a better position to sell in the foreign market. A company with higher leverage is likely to have a higher international decision. Theoretically, this research implies that board governance diversity in a unique two-tier board model could also be explained by agency theory. This finding also shows that the company can increase the international decision by increasing the Board of Commissioners' qualification and experience diversity. However, the Board of Commissioners ethnic diversity should be reduced to increase the international decision. (c) 2021 Ascociacion Internacional de Economia Aplicada. All rights reserved.

Purpose: We examine how the net share purchases of top executives of acquiring firms, specifically the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Operating Officer (COO), can impact shareholder perceptions of a merger and acquisition (M&A) around the announcement time. Design/methodology/approach: Regression tests using the post-announcement cumulative returns as the dependent variables, and CEO and COO net purchases as independent test controlling for the net purchases of all other insiders, COO and CEO ownership, exercised options, unexercised exercisable options, merger type, pre-announcement firm size, past performance, industry growth, industry instability, year and industry fixed effects. The regression tests are used for various sub-samples (i.e. non-contemporaneous events, duality, operational complexity, economic conditions). Findings: We find that overall shareholders value the COO's net purchases before the announcement but not those of the CEOs. If the COO is also the CEO, then executive buy-ins appear to have a negative reaction from the shareholders. When the firm has many business segments or when the announcement is made in an economic recession, the COO's net purchases do not have a positive influence on the shareholders. Originality/value: We are the first to provide evidence that investors pay attention to the COO around M&A announcements. In the age of celebrity CEOs, who can instantaneously change the stock price with one press release, having another executive that can shape the opinion of investors can diversify the agency risk.

Theoretical literature provides different predictions on the relationship between multiple directorships and managerial ability (relationship). Therefore, we empirically investigate the relationship. We find that the relationship is generally negative and statistically significant but not economically significant, i.e., the relationship is very small. In this regard, we show that the relationship is negative (positive) and also statistically and economically significant for firms with high levels of monitoring (advising) needs. Furthermore, we show that the regulatory oversight (1) mitigates the general negative relationship; (2) changes the direction of relationship from negative to positive, for firms with high levels of monitoring needs; and (3) does not influence the relationship, for firms with high levels of advising needs. Collectively, the results suggest that the monitoring-advising needs and regulatory oversight are important factors in the analysis of the relationship. (c) 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The study examines the effect of board size, frequency of board meetings and frequency of audit committee meetings on the market value of 11 Jordanian commercial banks as measured by Tobin's Q. Random effect panel data regression is employed to test the study hypotheses. Results reveal that board size has a significant and negative effect on bank market value. Results also show that frequency of board meetings has no effect on bank value, while the frequency of audit committee meetings has a significant and positive effect on bank value. The results suggest that the argument of agency theory and resource independence theory towards the role of board and its committees in supporting firm value should be always combined with the appropriate size. Accordingly, one important implication of the study is that the selection of an appropriate number of board members and the prior effective preparation for their meetings are critical factors to enhance the value of banks in Jordan.

This study empirically investigates the dismissal of U.S. CEOs following negative media coverage of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. Extending related literature on the media, ESG, and CEO dismissal, I develop a theoretical framework that considers the media as an influential third party that forms and reflects public opinion about ESG issues. In this role, the media reduces information asymmetry by providing cues on their relative salience and prompting corporate directors to attribute firm-level ESG issues to the CEO, regardless of their involvement in the misconduct. Findings confirm this framework and particularly suggest that coverage of issues in prominent media sources is more likely to result in CEO dismissal. Further, companies that have made public commitments to ESG oversight and those with stronger monitoring are more likely to dismiss the CEO following negative coverage of ESG issues. Overall, this study builds an understanding of how contemporary boards approach the uncertain CEO dismissal decision amidst media coverage of ESG- related misconduct and reflects a shifting norm towards ESG integration at the board-level.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the attributes of corporate boards in UK companies and their tendency to assure their corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports. Design/methodology/approach: From the agency theory perspective, the authors examine the impact of board attributes on the assurance of CSR reports for the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 350 during 2016-2019. The authors used annual integrated reports, companies' websites and Thomson Reuters Eikon database for data collection and the logistic regression for data analysis. Findings: The results confirm that some board attributes significantly influence a company's decision to assure its CSR reports. While board size, board tenure, the presence of female board members and female executive directors and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs)' global working experience positively contribute to CSR assurance (CSRA) decisions, the chairman's independence negatively contributes to it. However, board independence, board meetings and board financial expertise demonstrate no effect on the CSRA decision. Research limitations/implications: The authors focus on some attributes of board members, but the authors did not consider board diversity in its broader meaning. Moreover, the effect of board committees and their attributes on CSRA was not addressed. The authors also did not consider the impact of scope, the quality level of assurance service and the differences between assurance providers on companies' decisions to neither undertake CSRA nor choose between assurance providers. Practical implications: The study provides insights into the increasing demand on voluntary assurance to boost the credibility of CSR reports and the role of the board of directors (BOD) in taking this initiative. The findings highlight the importance of board diversity (e.g. gender) in improving transparency and sustainability reporting, which can help policymakers and regulators in shaping future governance policies. Additionally, the findings refer to a drawback in the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding the chairman's independence, which requires corrective actions from the Financial Reporting Council. The findings raise concern over the small share of audit firms in the assurance service market, despite the growing demand for these services in the UK, which may require more attention to these services from the audit firms. Social implications: Companies are increasingly pressurized, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, to discharge their accountability to stakeholders and to act in a socially responsible manner in their business activities. CSR reporting is one of the main tools that companies use to communicate their social activities. Understanding the determinants of voluntary CSRA helps to increase the credibility of CSR reports and the favorable response to social pressure. Originality/value: The authors add empirical evidence to the limited literature on CSRA about the role of the BOD in undertaking companies' social responsibility, improving CSR reporting and reducing information asymmetry. It also highlights the significance of maintaining a balanced BOD in terms of gender, experience and tenure, in minimizing the risk of perpetuating non-transparent integrated reporting.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the impact of ownership structure and board characteristics on dividend policy in the listed Turkish firms between 2013 and 2019. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the probability of paying dividends, dividend payout ratio and dividend yield measures. The suitable regression procedures (logit, probit and Tobit models) are used to examine the research hypotheses by focusing on a panel data set drawn from the Borsa Istanbul (BIST) 100 index, excluding financial and utility firms. Findings: The empirical findings indicate that institutional and concentrated ownerships are significant and positively associated with dividend payouts, whereas family ownership does not influence dividend policy. On the other end, board size is positive, while chief executive officer duality is negatively related to dividend policy. Additionally, the female directors and board independence are insignificant in influencing firms to pay high dividends. Research limitations/implications: Future researchers can validate this paper's findings by considering the stock dividends as well. Additionally, future researchers may investigate the relationship between these constructs by extending the sample size of firms listed on BIST or in other emerging markets. Practical implications: This study's findings may serve policymakers, regulators, investors and academic researchers to get valuable guidance from relevant literature. The Turkish firms may improve dividend policy by implementing the regulatory framework introduced by the Capital Markets Law in 2012 for effective monitoring and protecting the minority shareholders' rights. The controlling shareholders may alleviate principal-principal conflicts by ensuring the independence of directors and increasing the number of female directors according to the critical mass of at least 30% of board members. Originality/value: This study contributes to agency theory and signaling theory by considering ownership structure and board attributes among Turkish firms related to dividend payments.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of corporate governance attributes, in the form of board characteristics, on risk disclosures provided through integrated reporting (IR). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon an agency theory perspective, this study examines the effect of the main corporate governance board characteristics (size, gender diversity, independence and meeting frequency) on the level of risk disclosure provided by a sample of 95 IR adopters from 24 countries for 2018. Findings: The results suggest that firms are slow to realise IR's potential to produce innovations in risk disclosure mechanisms. In addition, certain board characteristics, such as gender diversity, independence of directors and meeting frequency, are positive drivers of the risk disclosure provided via IR. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on risk disclosure provided via IR. Connecting corporate governance mechanisms to IR risk disclosure practices can contribute to enhancing the practical and theoretical understanding of the role that the board of directors may play in stimulating transparency and accountability about risks via an alternative communication tool, IR, to the benefit of both investors and other stakeholders.

Purpose: The main aim of this study is to examine the effect of investment in outside governance monitoring (IOGM), through non-executive directors' remuneration (NEDR) and external audit fees (AFEE), on real earnings management (REM) in an emerging market in the Southeast Asia region, Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: The data comprises 1,056 observations from manufacturing companies listed on Bursa Malaysia for the four-year period, 2013 to 2016. The study tests IOGM individually and aggregately with REM. Feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) regression is used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results show that NEDR is negatively and significantly associated with REM. Likewise, AFEE is significantly associated with lower REM. Aggregate IOGM significantly mitigates REM. Additional tests conducted show consistent findings. Research limitations/implications: This evidence supports agency theory and signaling theory, that a high level of investment in governance monitoring signals a high demand for monitoring and fewer agency problems. It justifies more investment in outside scrutiny and monitoring to limit the existence of managers' opportunistic behavior in concentrated markets. This study relies on an aggregate measure of REM and focuses on manufacturing companies in Malaysia; thus, the results may not be the same using other measurements and samples. Originality/value: The study, to the best of the researchers' knowledge, is the first to document evidence in an emerging market suggesting that higher NEDR and AFEE are individually and aggregately associated with lower REM. Policymakers, shareholders and researchers may consider investment in these two mechanisms as a proxy of high-quality monitoring that mitigates REM. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Conventional wisdom leads to assert that good governance may underpin bank performance while bad governance destroys stability and soundness. We run a factor analysis to synthesize 23 bank board characteristics of the Eurostoxx banks into seven key features: independence, size, dedication, tenure, corporate governance quality, external perspective, competence, and diversity. We then use multiple regression and find that independence and board and committees size are the most relevant characteristics for banks risk-taking and in line with the agency theory, our results show that independence increases the solvency of banks, and size reduces it.

In the "shareholder primacy" (SP) view of the modern corporation, shareholders are endowed with ownership rights over the corporation. This view stems from the property rights and agency theories of the business firm formulated by financial and business economists in the 1970s and 1980s, which subsequently fed into US corporate law debates. It relies on positive legal assumptions that have largely been debunked by legal scholars, and on normative economic ideas that are equally problematic. However, SP is still very influential - if not the dominant paradigm of corporate governance, especially in the United States. The goal of the present study is to come back to the theoretical debates around the foundations of the SP paradigm to seek to identify key ideational properties that may explain, in part, the resilience of such paradigm in policy, scholarship and business practice. In particular, this paper proposes that one important reason for the persistence of the SP ideology lies in the latter's foundation on the radically contingent nature of shareholders' claims over the corporation.

Purpose: This study aims to know whether board composition is effective in improving firm performance and particularly to determine whether this relationship varies across different levels of performance, that is, companies with very low performance, low performance, moderate performance, high performance and very high performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a data set covering 213 Indian companies registered on S&P Bombay Stock Exchange 500 Index over the period 2001 to 2019 by using Tobin's Q as a performance parameter. The study applies the quantile regression technique and compares the results with fixed effect generalized least squares (GLS) regression. Findings: The findings reveal that board size positively affects the company's performance across all quantiles. Independent directors negatively impact the performance of companies across all quantiles. However, the strength of these relationships increases with increase in performance, thereby supporting agency theory and stewardship theory, respectively. The effect of executive directors on the performance of the companies varies across quantiles. The effect is adverse at moderate and high quantiles only. Practical implications: The findings provide some grounds for regulators to exercise caution while designing board composition guidelines, keeping in mind the unique internal environment of each company which ultimately affects their performance levels. Similarly, Indian companies are also suggested to compose their boards keeping in mind their performance levels. Originality/value: The study contributes towards the debate on the board composition and firm performance relationship by adding to the agency theory and stewardship theory that all the companies cannot have the similar board composition. Rather its composition depends upon the performance levels of the companies. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

While past research on minority acquisitions has ignored how agency conflicts could prevent acquirers from realizing value creation opportunities, this study investigates whether principal-agent and principal-principal conflicts with the target's managers and controlling shareholder hinder acquirers' ability to capture value from acquisitions of non-controlling equity stakes. Using archival data from a global sample of 443 minority acquisitions announced between 2011 and 2019, we found that cumulative abnormal returns are positively associated to minority shareholder protection and negatively associated to the presence of a strong controlling shareholder in the target firm. We also found that acquisitions of small non-controlling equity stakes amplify the negative effect of the strong controlling shareholder, which instead weakens if acquirers purchase large non-controlling equity stakes. This study contributes to the development of our understanding of the conditions that expose acquirers to value losses from minority acquisitions by examining the intricate bundle of agency conflicts with the target's managers and controlling shareholder. In so doing, this study also provides useful insights to business practice. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

We use a sample of French firms over the period 2001-2017 to investigate the relationship between board gender diversity and related-party transactions (RPTs). Although some of these transactions are efficient, RPTs are usually perceived negatively by outsiders because of the existence of conflict-of-interest transactions deemed to be value-destroying. Based on agency theory and managerial power theory, we argue that female directors have the ability and motivation to challenge managers' use of RPTs. Consistently with this argument, we find that board gender diversity negatively correlates with the number of reported RPTs. This negative correlation is driven by female directors involved in the board's monitoring duties (female independent directors and members of the audit committee). However, because they are less likely to be able to challenge managers, female inside directors do not affect the occurrence of RPTs. In January 2011, the French regulator enacted a gender quota law resulting in a significant increase in female board representativeness. We find that the marginal effect after enacting the gender quota law on the number of reported RPTs is negative for the proportion of female independent directors and female audit committee members, and positive for female inside directors.

Purpose: Using agency theory and impression management theory, this study examines the impact of financial performance (FP) and corporate governance (CG) mechanisms on the extent of intellectual capital disclosures (ICDs) and the three components within the CEO statement - human capital (HC), structural capital (SC) and relational capital (RC). Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a sample of non-financial SPF-120 French listed firms to capture the relevant variables; it collects data for 2010-2017, using a panel data technique to run the random effects regressions. Findings: The study finds that FP, measured using both market (Tobin's q) and accounting (return on equity and return on assets) indicators, plays a vital role in the extent of ICDs and the three components in the CEO statement published by SPF-120 companies. This confirms its impact on the decision-making needs of stakeholders. Among the CG mechanisms, this study finds that cultural diversity and gender diversity affect some ICD components. Moreover, CEO characteristics such as age, education and role duality affect ICD, while institutional ownership drives the extent of such disclosures. Practical implications: Our findings have comprehensive implications for managers of French listed firms, the Autorite des Marches Financiers, and stakeholders in general. Originality/value: This study provides significant insights by investigating the impact of FP, CG and company characteristics on the extent of the ICDs published in CEO statements.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the nexus between gender-diverse boards and cost of debt in the developing economies context. Specifically, the authors examine whether firm size moderates the relationship between female board representation and cost of debt, regardless of the industry type. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use panel data from 17 non-financial listed Ghanaian firms over the period 2007-2017, ordinary least square, two-stage least square and generalised method of moments estimations to test the hypothesis. Findings: The authors find that board gender diversity is positively related to cost of debt. Further evidence suggests the interaction of firm size and board gender diversity displays a negative association with cost of debt. Practical implications: The study evidence suggests larger non-manufacturing firms with gender-diverse boards attract lower cost of capital in an environment with lax enforcement of rules and regulations in corporate governance. Social implications: Lenders consider the size and industry of firms in pricing debt. This has implications on UN Goal 5, highlighting that shareholders of larger non-manufacturing firms benefit immensely from board gender diversity in the context of debt. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the board gender diversity and cost of debt literature by demonstrating that firm size and industry type matter in the developing economies context.

Financial statement analysts are concerned about the earnings power of companies, thus reliable information from a quality external audit and financial reporting is important as it will have an effect on the performances of GCC companies. On that note, underpinned by the agency theory, this study examines the effects of financial reporting quality, audit quality, and earnings power on companies' performances of the six Arabian GCC countries (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates). Company performance is measured using the accounting measures, i.e., return on assets and market-to-book value (ROA, M/B) and the market measures (Tobin's Q, EPS). The data sample of this study covers the period between 2013 and 2017, (pre-covid-19), across 191 companies, using 1337 company-years observations. The study uses EGLS Panel Data Regression analysis. The results of the study indicate that earnings power, audit quality, and financial reporting quality have positive effects on companies' performance. The agency theory confirms that financial reporting quality and audit quality increases the reliability of financial statements and decreases information asymmetry. (c) 2022 The Author

Purpose: The study aimed to examine the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on the performance of Egyptian firms listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX) between 2014 and 2016. Design/methodology/approach: We relied on agency theory and resource dependence theory to generate testable hypotheses and capture the empirical findings. We regressed various performance measures (Return on Assets; Asset Utilization Ratio, Tobin's Q) regarding governance mechanisms (institutional ownership, managerial ownership, board size, board frequent meetings, the presence of non-executive directors and female directors) while controlling for firm size, leverage, years of listing and market share. The study uses ordinary least square (OLS) and two stages least square (2SLS) regression analysis to address the possible endogenous impact of the firms' ownership structure. Findings: Board gender diversity, the managerial ownership and frequent board meetings positively influence the Egyptian firms' efficiency measured by assets utilization, while the institutional ownership and board size have negative effects. When using Tobin's Q, the managerial ownership shows a negative effect while institutional ownership and board size present positive effects. When using 2SLS regression, findings remained stable whereas non-executive directors showed a significant negative association with assets utilization. Practical implications: Policy makers are recommended to draft policies related to limiting the number of board members, diluting the government's indirect ownership of firms, empowering women in boardrooms and developing the skills needed for non-executive directors. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, our study is one of very few that address firms' performance after a period of political instability accompanied by a greater role for females in the boardrooms of Egypt.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between board gender diversity and private firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the association between board gender diversity and private firm performance by estimating pooled multivariate regressions using an unbalanced panel data set of 115,253 firm-year observations. Findings: The authors find that younger, less busy and local women directors enhance private firm performance. Firms with 40% or more women directors report triple the economic benefits compared to boards with at least 20% women directors. Considering firm size, women directors significantly increase small firm profitability, and the effect is more pronounced for high-risk firms. Greater board gender diversity enhances small firm performance as the monitoring role of women directors benefits the firm even in the presence of busy men directors. Consistent with the agency theory framework, the authors find that women directors improve small firm profitability in the presence of agency costs. Research limitations/implications: Due to the lack of availability of data about private firms, many factors are not directly observable. The analysis uses accounting-based performance measures that may be subject to managerial discretion. Nevertheless, the authors report highly significant results using cash-based performance measures that substantiate the overall findings. Practical implications: The results of the present study point to the need for private firms to increase board gender diversity and consider women director busyness, age, nationality and firm size when making board director appointments. Originality/value: This study adds to the scarce existent literature investigating private firms. The results contribute to the understanding of gender-diverse boards as well as the attributes of women directors that enhance private firm performance. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the role of earnings management in the relationship between firm performance and capital structure, dividing earnings management into discretionary and nondiscretionary accruals to test established theories on the capital structure. Using data on 802 companies in the member countries of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), our findings reveal that, in the absence of earnings management, the relationship between the capital structure and firm performance follows the trade-off theory or the pecking-order theory. Our results are consistent with agency theory only through managers' intervention via earnings management. In India, substantial opportunistic behavior in discretionary accruals is observed, and management seems to focus on manipulating capital structure performance in opportunistic ways. Furthermore, discretionary earnings are focused more on hiding asset inefficiency that arises from forced increases in firm size, reducing earnings risk. These practices reduce the impact of the capital structure on firm performance. This study has vital implications for debt managers and performance analysts in APTA member countries. Rather than testing the applicability in a traditional way, this study recommends dividing earnings management into discretionary and nondiscretionary accruals to test capital structure theories. Because nondiscretionary accruals play a dominant role in earnings management, firm behavior is consistent with trade-off or pecking-order theory, as seen in patterns in the relationship between the capital structure and firm performance, whereas agency theory holds only after external intervention by managers in terms of earnings management.

Purpose: The study aims to identify the impact of board characteristics (BC) on a firm's environmental performance, and provides future research directions in the area of BC impact on environmental disclosures (ED) in case of India's environmentally sensitive and non-sensitive industries (SI and NSI). Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect firm-level data from Prowess and Bloomberg, which cover 1,158 firm-year observations from National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) 500 listed companies from 2015 to 2020, and use a dynamic panel regression analysis to get deeper insights on the relationship of ED and BC. Findings: The study found that lagged environment disclosure score is positively and significantly associated with current environmental disclosure scores. The presence of sustainability committee, board size and frequency of meetings has a positive and significant association with ED for sensitive as well as non-sensitive industry groups. Factors such as board Independence, board gender diversity and CEO duality have no significant impact on ED of both sensitive and non-sensitive industry groups. Originality/value: Based on agency theory and stakeholder theory authors study for the first time in the context of India the effect of BC on ED using a large sample and covering an extensive period of six years. This study contributes by offering deep insights about the impact in case of "environmentally sensitive, non-sensitive and also all industries case". The findings of this study are valuable for corporate managers and regulators who are interested in improving ED practices through a better-governed corporate mechanism.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential influence of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms on audit risk in Tunisian companies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of Tunisian non-financial firms listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange (TSE) over the periods 2005 to 2010 (pre- 2011 revolution) and 2011 to 2017 (post -2011 revolution), consisting of 371 observations for the whole period, the authors apply the generalized least square (GLS) to test the research hypotheses and model. Findings: The results are consistent with the agency theory suggesting that efficient corporate governance is able to control and reduce a company's agency problem. Evidence reveals that the effectiveness of the director's board/ownership structure and audit quality have the most influence on audit risk before than after the 2011 revolution, although governance mechanisms should play a more active role in encouraging companies to be more transparent in the post-revolution period. Moreover these findings are confirmed when identifying a composite measure of corporate governance. Practical implications: Significant implications are provided for analysts, investors, regulators and academics. First, findings can help Tunisian regulators determine corporate governance disclosure requirements. Second, this research will make investors and stakeholders aware of the fact that minimizing auditor risk will be effective in reducing agency problems in emerging markets like Tunisia. Then, this work can help researchers better understand and realize the corporate governance role in the quality of audit process and financial statements and encourage them to deeply and broadly investigate this issue on other emerging markets. Originality/value: This study stands for an extension of the existing research on corporate governance and audit risk. It fills a research gap in the local context. In fact, the considered data are those of the pre- and post-revolution Tunisian market, mainly in periods of instability. Although emerging markets make up the vast majority of economic activity around the world, they have received limited attention in academic research. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Corporate governance has received substantial scholarly attention for decades, although the focus of this research has by and large been on publicly traded for-profit organizations. However, agency problems are increasingly recognized in nonprofits. As such, we examine the application of corporate governance logic in the context of nonprofits. Our study relies on nearly a decade of data spanning 6853 US-based charities and comprising nearly US$346 billion in total revenue. Our results show that common corporate governance practices--such as independent boards, chief executive officer oversight, and transparency--enhance the degree to which donor contributions are allocated toward a charity's mission. Overall, we assess the broader applicability and benefits of corporate governance and build on literature highlighting links between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In doing so, we demonstrate the usefulness of governance in this economically and socially consequential context. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the relationship between internal audit functions (IAF) and financial reporting quality (FRQ) and whether such a relationship is moderated by senior management support (SMS) in listed companies in Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). Design/methodology/approach: This research is a cross-sectional study, using primary data in the form of a survey sent to 175 listed companies in NSE. A total of 149 questionnaires have been collected and analysed out of which 97 were found to be useful and used in the final analysis. Findings: The findings indicate a positive and significant relationship between internal audit qualities of work performed, internal control activities, coordination between internal and external auditors and FRQ and this finding was also supported by SMS as a moderator. However, the results show a negative and insignificant relationship between internal audit competency, organisational status and FRQ. Research limitations/implications: The findings support the assumption with regard to agency theory. The board should support the IAF to serve as an effective monitoring mechanism in minimising opportunistic management actions. Regulators should also ensure adequate structures that will strengthen the organisational status of the internal auditors to perform towards improving FRQ. Originality/value: The study contributes to the existing literature by assessing the effect of IAF on FRQ as moderated by SMS. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Building on agency and resource dependence theories, we study the relationship between the value of initial public offerings and the extent of board independence, which we find to be an inverted U-shape: beyond a certain threshold, board independence becomes excessive. Consistent with agency theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced when ownership and control rights are separated. Consistent with resource dependence theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced in companies with higher industry diversification and less pronounced when the roles of the CEO and president of the board of directors are separated.

This paper aims to systematically review the existing studies of corporate governance with organisational performance in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and put forward theories, research methods, topics, and variables that emerge from the review. The systematic literature review is based on 42 peer-reviewed journal articles on the topic written by reputable academics on the Science Direct Database focused on corporate governance, board characteristics, and ownership structure. This study's conceptual framework is based on agency theory, which is the most widely used to analyse corporate governance (Fama & Jensen, 1983; Jensen & Meckling, 1976). The majority of results show a positive correlation between corporate governance and organisational performance (Pucheta-Martinez & Gallego-Alvarez, 2020) with agency theory being the most utilised theory of choice (Bergh, Ketchen, Orlandi, Heugens, & Boyd, 2019; Panda & Leepsa, 2017). This paper undertakes a significant thorough systematic review of corporate governance with firm performance and the Fourth Industrial Revolution literature. It gives an 11-year review with a reference index from 2011 to 2021, useful for both academics and professionals. This study recommends more evidence-based systematic reviews for different aspects and within different regions. It is further recommended to expand geographical spread across all continents to cover corporate governance area and to improve studies related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and its impact on corporate governance. Lastly, it is recommended that more studies that look at the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on corporate governance and firm performance should be performed. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Purpose: In view of the current climate change emergency and the growing importance of the climate-related accountability of companies, this paper aims to advance a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of carbon-related chief executive officer (CEO) compensation. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the agency-theoretical perspective on executive compensation and existing work in the fields of management, corporate governance, cultural studies, and behavioral science, this paper derives a multilevel framework of the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation. Findings: This paper maps the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation at the societal, organizational, group, and individual levels of analysis. It also provides research propositions on the determinants that can support and challenge the implementation of this instrument of environmental corporate governance. Originality/value: In the past literature, the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation have remained largely unexplored. This paper contributes to the academic discussion on environmental corporate governance by showcasing the role of interlinkages among the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation and the possible countervailing impacts. In view of the complex interdisciplinary nature of climate change impact, this paper encourages businesses practitioners and regulators to intensify their climate change mitigation efforts and delineates the levers at their disposal.

Previous corporate governance research has paid little attention to the role of chief executive officer (CEO) labor markets in controlling CEO behaviors because the CEO labor market has been considered inefficient. With the increasing mobility of top executives across firms, however, the potential of CEO labor markets to serve as an external disciplining force has been growing. In this study, we argue that CEOs will be more pressured to engage in desirable behaviors as the CEO labor market becomes more efficient. Using a longitudinal sample of S&P 1500 firms in high-technology industries in United States from 2011 to 2019, we found that CEOs tend to increase R&D investment as CEO labor market supply increases. We also found that the tendency is greater when external CEO succession is more frequent in the market. Our results demonstrate that CEO labor markets have the potential to function as an effective external governance mechanism. Copyright (c) The Author(s), 2022.

This paper investigates the role of corporate governance in China's outward foreign direct investment (ODI) using a sample of Chinese public firms over the period 2009-2015. Different from previous studies, which mainly use country-level aggregate data to examine China's ODI behavior, this study utilizes firm-level data to explore the impact of corporate governance on firms' ODI decision making. Building on the integration of agency theory and foreign direct investment theories, the study finds that ownership concentration, share ownership, and executive compensation significantly influence China's ODI flows in both full-sample and sub-sample estimations. The corporate governance has an essential effect on firms' ODI flows in that the firms with better corporate governance are more interested in undertaking ODI projects. The results are robust across different sample periods and in both state-owned and non-state-owned firm sub-groups. The government may design some policies such as friendly tax regulations to stimulate private firms to invest overseas. (c) 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland

This study examines the effect of board size on the economic impact of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the US. Using a hand-collected dataset of 508 M&A between 2012 and 2018, we find that board size is negatively related to acquirer excess returns. In an additional analysis, we show that large boards have positive value implications for banks that combine the CEO and chairman roles as well as for large banks. Our findings indicate that a "one-size-fits-all" approach to board size is not necessarily in the interests of shareholders; instead, a more flexible and proactive formulation is needed.

Prior research has found that corporate political activity (CPA) can both positively and negatively impact firm performance. Combining agency theory with the resource-based view, we examine the relationship between domestic lobbying (a key form of CPA) and firm performance by explicating the moderating effects of international and product diversification. We argue that expansion into international and product markets increases a firm's resources and reduces agency costs in domestic lobbying. Our results, based on a sample of 737 firms, show that lobbying is positively associated with performance for firms that are diversified in both international markets and along product-lines; whereas lobbying is counter-productive for purely domestic and undiversified firms. Our results contribute to the literature on the firm performance implications of corporate political activity by highlighting the roles of international and product diversification.

This study investigates the determinants of dividend pay-out of listed firms in Pakistan from the year 2011 to 2015. The focus of the study is the life cycle theory of dividends, agency theory and signaling theory. Corporate governance indicators, firm efficiency and cash flow volatility are the main determinants used in this study. This study also includes eight corporate governance indicators namely insider ownership, ownership concentration, institutional ownership, board independence, board size, CEO duality, audit committee independence and remuneration committee. It is found that ownership concentration, institutional ownership, CEO duality, firm efficiency and cash flow volatility are the significant determinants of dividend pay-out in Pakistan. It is also found that growth opportunities significantly moderate the impact of ownership concentration, institutional ownership, CEO duality, firm efficiency, cash flow volatility on the dividend pay-out. This research is among the pioneer studies which examine the impact of firm efficiency on dividend pay-out. Likewise, the study is among the first attempts to incorporate growth opportunities as moderating variable in the relationship between corporate governance indicators, firm efficiency and cash flow volatility with dividend pay-out. Results show that the management of an efficient firm pays a high dividend to increase its reputation in the market. Furthermore, the negative signaling effect of dividend omission may not exist for efficient firms. It implies that efficient firms at their growth stage may also skip dividends.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the significance of board gender diversity (BGD) on the firm's intellectual capital (IC) performance of 272 Indian firms listed on the National Stock Exchange during 2007-2019. Considering the recent regulatory amendment by the Indian regulatory system (Security Exchange Board of India, 2018) which mandates at least one female independent directors on boards of all listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on theories and literature reviews, hypotheses were developed. This paper uses the proportion of female director on board and proportion of female independent directors to measure BGD and modified value-added intellectual coefficient (MVAIC) methodology to measure firms' IC performance. Two-step system-generalised method of moment panel data regression analysis has been employed to identify the variables that significantly affect IC performance. Findings: This paper finds female representation on boards has a significant impact on MVAIC; capital employed efficiency shows the strongest association with female directors on board, followed by structural capital efficiency and human capital efficiency, while relational capital efficiency shows no significant effect. The results further demonstrate that female independent director has a significant but negative impact on IC. Research limitations/implications: As the study is limited to the listed firms of an emerging economy with a mandatory female quota for boards. Thus to increase the generalizability of findings, future research can be extended to include all listed and non-listed firms from another emerging economy with a mandatory female quota. Practical implications: From the practical perspective, this study bridges the gap between theory and practice in terms of providing a deeper understanding to the policymakers and Indian regulatory bodies like the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Securities Exchange Board on the importance of including female members on board as a vital contributing factor for leveraging firm's intangible performance. Originality/value: Using resource dependency theory and agency, this study extends the literature on IC efficiency and female representation on boards by presenting the research outcome for Indian listed firms. This paper, addressing the recent changes introduced by Indian regulators and using the female independent directors on board, is amongst the first attempts to assess the relevance of BGD and IC performance. This issue has still not been discussed and analysed by researchers in India. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The paper aims to explore the impact of two types of monitoring mechanisms, namely, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) comment letters (CLs) and short sellers, on management's demand for audit quality. Design/methodology/approach: Using information on the short interest positions and a panel data of SEC CLs between 2005 and 2015, this study applies logit regression model to estimate the likelihood of hiring Big 4 and industry expert audit firm. This study also applies an ordinary least squares regression technique to estimate audit fees. Findings: Consistent with disclosure and agency theories, results from empirical analyses provide that management demands higher quality audits measured by higher audit fees, and higher likelihood to hire Big 4 and industry expert audit firm. However, this study finds that the effect varies depending on the specific monitoring mechanisms. Additionally, when both monitoring mechanisms are in place, the SEC CLs drive the overall direction of the demand for audit quality when audit demand is captured by propensity to hire Big 4/industry expert audit firm. Research limitations/implications: This study provides researchers with enhanced understanding of the factors having effect on the demand side for audit quality. Furthermore, it adds to the stream of literature on economic consequences of SEC CLs and short selling. Originality/value: To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to document the effect of two types of monitoring mechanisms, namely, SEC CLs and short selling, on the demand for audit quality.

We investigate the relationship between firm whistleblower governance and audit pricing of Australian listed financial firms over the 2008-2018 period. Consistent with agency and organisational justice theoretical tenets, we find that firms that exhibit stronger whistleblower governance incur lower audit fees. We find that the negative association between strength in whistleblower governance and firms' audit fees is more pronounced for firms that are exposed to increased litigation risk, and for firms having an anti-fraud policy. Our results are robust to endogeneity tests including difference-in-difference (DID), two-stage least squares (2SLS) and propensity score matching (PSM) analyses.

This study aimed to analyze the influence of board characteristics on the quality of risk disclosures in integrated annual reports of banks in India. Integrated reports support organizations in controlling risks, identifying opportunities, connecting risks with business policies, developing business models, and contributing to the value creation process. In February 2017, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) recommended the adoption of an integrated reporting (IR) framework by the top 500 companies in India on a voluntary basis from 2017-18. Considering the relevance of integrated reporting and its underlying benefits to various stakeholders, banks have primarily adopted the IR framework and started publishing their annual reports in line with the IR principles. Using content analysis on the sample of 30 banks listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India, the efficacy of risk disclosures, the outlook orientation (past, present, and future), approaches to risk (positive, neutral, and negative) were investigated, and the influence of attributes of board of directors on the quality of risk disclosure was examined. On examining 4,183 sentences concerning risk disclosures by Indian banks, the results showed a positive relationship between board size, diversity, independence, meetings, and education background in accounting/finance with risk disclosure quality (RDQ). Also, it was found that integrated reporters tended to disclose more risks and suggested ways to mitigate those risks compared to non-adopters. (c) 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

This paper uses new and unique bank-level data to investigate whether board governance determines executives' remuneration and if the pay-governance relationship changes across bank ownership groups in India. The findings based on dynamic pay model estimated using two-step system GMM approach reveal that (i) past pay levels hold significant predicting power for the future level of executives' pay, (ii) executive remuneration is significantly responsive to forward-looking market-based profitability measures, and (iii) individual board attributes play a significant role in pay setting in the Indian banking industry. Frequent board meetings and a more significant proportion of female directors on board moderate the executive remuneration packages. The results further infer that the board's monitoring abilities considerably differ across ownership groups, with boards play a more prominent role in private banks, while boards of public sector banks lack adequate autonomy to determine executives' pay. The results validate the "managerial power" approach, suggesting that any weaknesses in governance structure (especially in private banks) may inhibit bank boards from effectively performing their monitoring functions in optimal pay fixation.

Board director independence is critical to achieving and maintaining control to address the agency theory-based issue of interest misalignment between the principal (the organization) and the executives (agent). However, theoretical and empirical research and strategic risk considerations have brought into question the role or relevance that director independence plays in these control task and agency theory domains. We ask, using a quantitative survey method, whether board activity-based applications of independence may be associated with the service task of the board, namely its resource dependence mission. Our findings suggest that the resource dependence duty of the board may be positively associated with some autonomous activities, and yet other activities might be driven primarily by normative practices. Based on this, we suggest that a theoretical scope beyond and greater than agency theory may be needed when reassessing the role of director independence.

Purpose: While there is an increased demand from various corporate stakeholders on the need for public companies to have risk management frameworks as well as a stand-alone risk management committee to mitigate risks and simultaneously improve performance, this study investigates the effects of the risk management committee attributes on firm performance, and the role of board size is highlighted on this relationship in Malaysian listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: Both accounting- and market-based performance measures have been used for measuring performance. A dynamic model using the generalized method of moments (GMM) has been employed to control for potential endogeneity, simultaneity and unobserved heterogeneity. Findings: The findings reveal that risk management committee attributes such as size, independence and meetings negatively affect book-based performance measures and positively affect market-based performance measures. Moreover, board size positively moderates the risk management committee attributes and performance relationship. The study embraces the predictions of agency theory and resource dependence theory. Practical implications: The findings are practically significant for Bursa Malaysia, Securities Commission Malaysia to assess the compliance of the Corporate Governance Code (MCCG, 2017) and for academia to further explore significant relationships in other emerging economies. Originality/value: The paper contributes to multiple aspects: first, it studies the impact of risk management committee attributes on firm performance; second, it investigates the moderating effect of board size on RMC-performance relationship; in the end, the study employs dynamic modeling for estimation process to avoid dynamic endogeneity considered a main econometric problem for CG-performance relationships.

Purpose: Capitalizing on a unique measure of takeover susceptibility principally based on the staggered implementation of state laws, this study aims to explore the takeover market's effect on managerial ownership. The market for corporate control, often known as the takeover market, is an important external governance mechanism, whereas managerial ownership is a vital internal governance instrument. Managerial ownership brings into convergence the interests of shareholders and managers. The originality of this study arises from the usage of state-level anti-takeover legislations as a measure which is beyond the control of firms and plausibly exogenous to firm-specific characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: In addition to the standard regression analysis, this study also executes a variety of robustness checks to minimize endogeneity, i.e. propensity score matching, entropy balancing, instrumental-variable analysis, Lewbel's (2012) heteroscedastic identification and Oster's (2019) testing for coefficient stability. Findings: Based on a large sample of US firms, the results show that more hostile takeover threats bring about significantly lower managerial ownership. The results reinforce the prediction of the substitution hypothesis. The disciplinary function of the takeover market reduces agency conflict to the point where managerial ownership is less necessary as a governance mechanism. Specifically, a rise in takeover susceptibility by one standard deviation diminishes managerial ownership by 7.22%. Originality/value: `To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to shed light on the impact of the takeover market on managerial ownership using a novel measure mainly based on the staggered adoption of state laws, which are plausibly exogenous to individual firms' characteristics. Consequently, unlike prior research, this study is more likely to indicate a causal effect, rather than merely a correlation. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are notoriously prone to disputes among stakeholders, some of which may unduly jeopardize contract performance. Contract disputes arising in Iran are often due to inefficiency of PPP concession agreements and practice. This study presents a causal-predictive model of the root causes and preventive measures for inter-organization disputes to enhance the likelihood of achieving desirable performance in PPP projects. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical "causal-predictive" model was developed with fourteen hypotheses based on extant literature and contractual agency theory, which resulted in the creation of a pool of 110 published items. Data were obtained from a questionnaire survey with 75 valid responses, completed by 4 stratified groups of Iranian PPP experts. Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used for validating the proposed model via a case study. Findings: Results reveal that the main three factors of PPP desirable performance are as follows: on-time project completion, high quality of activities/products and services for public satisfaction. Further, the most influential factors of the lifecycle problems, construction stage, and preferred risk allocation included risk misallocation, improper payment mechanism and failure to facilitate a timely approval process. Originality/value: For researchers, the findings contribute to the theory of contractual agency; specifically, how different influences among the model's elements lead to better PPP performance. In practical terms, proposed outcome-based strategies will inform PPP stakeholders to avoid dispute occurrence and thus improve the time, quality and services of projects.

Purpose: In this study, the authors explore the effects of politically controlled boards on bank loan performance in both state-owned commercial banks (SCBs) and private sector commercial banks (PCBs) in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: The data consist of 409 bank-year observations from 46 sample SCBs and PCBs of Bangladesh for the period 2008-17. The authors apply ordinary least squares pooled regression with year fixed effect for baseline econometric analyses and generalized method of moments regression for robustness tests after addressing the endogeneity issue. Findings: The regression results reveal that the presence of bank "boards controlled by politically affiliated directors" (PA) have significant positive effects on non-performing loans (NPLs). Similarly, the presence of "boards controlled by politically affiliated directors without substantial ownership interests" (PAWOI) show positive association with NPLs. In contrast, the presence of "boards controlled by politically affiliated directors with substantial ownership interests" (PAOI) exhibit an inverse relationship with NPLs. These findings support 'agency conflict' arguments and document that both PA and PAWOI are detrimental to bank loan performance in Bangladesh, while PAOI do not have significant effect on increasing NPLs. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing bank governance literature by providing evidence from an emerging economy perspective, where politically affiliated directors (PADs) exploit their positions for personal and/or political gain at the cost of other stakeholders by taking advantage of relaxed regulatory oversights and investor protections.

Purpose: There is still an ongoing debate on the value relevance of capital structure and its determinants. Recently the issue has been explored in family firms after being explored in mature firms. This paper investigates the role of institutional investors and the firm's innovation activity in influencing the firm's decision and ability to acquire debt capital. Design/methodology/approach: A large sample of 700 privately-held family firms in Italy from 2010 to 2019. Two analysis techniques are used: panel analysis and path analysis. The value of debt and the debt ratio are used as leverage measures. The value of patent (as a proxy for innovation) and institutional investor are the explanatory variables. Findings: The results show that institutional investors have no relationship with financial leverage measures except when controlling for an interaction variable (Institutional investors x Lombardy region). The patent value is positively correlated with debt; however, the ratio patent-to-asset is negatively related to financial leverage indicating higher risk exposure. The nonlinearity test demonstrates a turning point when the relationship between patent value and debt inverts. Practical implications: Firms should monitor their innovation activity since excessive innovation increases risk exposure and affects financing opportunities and value. The involvement of institutional investors does not always enhance value. Originality/value: Existing literature focuses separately on family firm innovations and financial leverage as outcome variables, emphasizing the role of institutional investors in both fields by adopting agency theory and socioemotional wealth framework. In this study, the authors go further by merging both relationships, investigating the dynamics of the institutional-family firm innovation relationship in influencing the firm's capital structure. The authors contribute to the ongoing debate by providing original findings on capital structure, governance and innovation, supported by rigorous methods to enhance family firms' decision-making.

Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: This study examines the effect of board characteristics on earnings management and the moderating effect of gender diversity over this nexus by investigating 393 Bursa Malaysia listed companies from 2014 to 2018. Design/Methodology/Approach: This study applies the performance-adjusted Jones model (Dechow et al., 1996) and the performance-matched Jones model (Kothari et al., 2005) to measure accrual-based earnings management. Research findings: Based on the results, the agency theory fails to illustrate that board characteristics (i.e., defined by the attributes of board independence, board size, and non-CEO duality) are effective in reducing earnings management. On the other hand, the results show that gender diversity in independent directorship and board membership apparently reduces the level of earnings management. However, this research finds no significant moderating effect of gender diversity on the relationship between CEO duality and earnings management. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study adds to the literature by demonstrating that the application of agency theory does not have a significant impact on reducing earnings management in the Malaysian context. Applying gender socialisation theory, the findings of this study show successful moderation of gender diversity in terms of reducing the level of earnings management. Practitioner/Policy implication: The results on gender diversity are likely of interest to policymakers to come up with regulations related to ensuring an increasing presence of female directors in the boardrooms to increase the board gender diversity. Research limitation: This study examines only three board characteristics under corporate governance, and measures only accrual-based earnings management. Moreover, the sample is restricted to only non-financial listed companies. (c) 2022, Faculty of Business and Economics,University of Malaya. All rights reserved.

This study examines the association among the effectiveness of audit committee, arrangement of internal audit function (IAF), and financial reporting lag (FRL). It also expands the literature by exploring the effect of IAF sourcing arrangement on financial reporting lag. Financial reporting lag is measured based on the number of days between the dates of the financial year end to the date of announcement of financial reporting. The effectiveness of the audit committee consists of size, independence, meetings, experts, and the chairperson's qualifications. The internal audit arrangement is either performed in-house or outsourced to a third-party internal audit service provider and the cost of incurred for the IAF in the financial year. The agency theory is applied to explain the framework of this study and tested on 2,284 Malaysian listed companies from 2012 to 2015. Results show that IAF sourcing arrangement and cost are significantly associated with financial report lag. These findings offer important implications on audit committee and IAF literature through improving the timeliness of financial information.

This article investigates the determinants of dividend policy on the Casablanca stock exchange. The variables tested were based on the main theories of dividend policy, and the fixed effect model was used to test panel data over a period of 16 years from 2003 to 2018. The eight independent variables tested were profitability, firm size, retained earnings, firm age, leverage, growth opportunities, price to earnings (P/E) and a dummy variable introduced for financial companies. To corroborate the results, two proxies were used to test the dependent variable: dividend yield and payout ratio. The results led to the identification of three significant determinants of dividend policy, which are firm age, growth opportunities and firm size. The negative correlation between the variables of firm size and firm age with dividend policy is explained by signaling theory. On the other hand, the negative correlation between growth opportunities and dividend payments is predicted by different theories, such as agency theory, financial flexibility theory and life cycle theory. This study provides insights for investors, analysts and researchers into dividend policy determinants on the Casablanca stock exchange based on firms' characteristic variables.

The paper presents a conception of firms' efficiency that breaks with the agency theory of the firm, which sees the efficiency of firms as no different in nature from that of markets. We argue that firms are efficient relative to markets, thanks to two kinds of social interaction, namely, interpersonal interactions and compliance with authority; these interactions take place among workers engaged in a collective productive venture and could not develop in markets. Two kinds of norm emerge from these interactions that create the rights and obligations needed for horizontal and vertical cooperation; the functioning of firms and their specific efficiency thus have a deontic basis. Just as shareholder-oriented governance is normatively derived from agency theory's vision of the firm, which has succeeded in powerfully influencing corporate law and corporate governance since the 1980s, participatory governance is the governance mode that normatively derives from our understanding of the firm.

Corporate governance (CG) failures, exemplified by noncompliance with laws, regulations and best practices, have pecuniary costs. Using agency theory, the study aimed to quantify costs of governance failures in South Africa's FTSE/JSE Top40 listed companies and establish ultimate cost bearer. This differentiates this study from extant literature and makes both methodological and practice contributions by using Value at Risk procedures. Except for Steinhoff, which lost 85% of its value in six weeks, event study method was used to select the other eleven Top40 listed companies included in the study. Data on identified CG failures, published on the Stock Exchange News Service and announced by Regulatory Authorities between 2008 and 2016, was used. At 99.99% confidence level, up to 73.33% of revenue and 62 cents per R1 of market capitalisation were eroded because of governance failures. Due to ascertained losses, the study concluded that CG failures have pecuniary socioeconomic costs incurred by principals and government through social expenditure. Theoretical implications suggest agency theory's extension as agency costs underestimate potential costs by excluding socio-economic costs. The study recommended the use of behavioural theories for insights into agents' behaviours leading to governance failures and losses. It also recommended that policymakers should strengthen the role of gatekeeping professions to curb the magnitude of ascertained costs. (c) 2022 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd. All rights reserved.

This concept paper synthesises the special issue with an integrated discussion of all four papers published therein, from the viewpoint of the theme of this special issue: opportunities and challenges for future empirical research in corporate finance. The four papers highlight that future empirical research faces the challenge of acknowledging fundamental paradigms in the literature. These include analytical models of capital structure, agency theory, the literature on Initial Public Offering anomalies and earnings valuation. An opportunity for future empirical research is to use these foundations to contribute to emerging paradigms. The latter include the empirical evidence of the shareholder wealth effects of government investment, managerial overinvestment and the acknowledgement of unlisted entities within capital markets research.

Purpose: On the example of professional football in Germany, this paper analyses the conflict about the punishment of fan misbehaviour within an agency-theoretical framework to cast light on the reasons for the ineffectiveness of the sentences and to show possible solutions. Design/methodology/approach: In a pre-study, more than 1,300 hand-collected past sentences against clubs by the German and European sports courts were analysed to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the penalties so far. Additionally, in the main study, 26 expert interviews with German representatives of the football association, courts, clubs, sponsors, police and active fan scenes allow a deep insight into the relationships of the involved parties. Findings: The paper suggests that the sentences do not sufficiently consider several agency problems. Due to moral hazard, they exert hardly any influence on fan behaviour and only a small one on the clubs. While the lighting of pyrotechnics is by far the most punished type of misbehaviour, most of the interviewees cite the impossibility of preventing it. Despite the sentences, some clubs make non-public agreements with their fans about still tolerable misconduct or do not pass the penalties on to the polluters as intended by the association. The findings highlight the importance of communication for less misbehaviour. Originality/value: For the first time, the agency theory and the economic theory of optimal punishment are brought together with insights from interviews with the involved parties. The authors discover a two-stage principal-agent problem and get new insights into stakeholders' hidden motivations and attitudes. The results should encourage a debate on the current penalties and possible solutions to the recurring problem of pyrotechnics. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Recently ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) activities have attracted a lot of theoretical and practical attention. With these changes, there have been an active research on corporate social responsibility activities measured by ESG and major financial strategies of companies. Related with previous research, this study seeks to systematically analyze the association between social responsibility activities and dividend policieswww.earticle.net of corporations. Studies such as Rakotomavo (2012) and Benlemlih (2019) suggest that social responsibility activities have a positive impact on dividend policy, while studies such as Pham and Jung (2020) and Ni and Zhang (2019) report that social responsibility activities have a negative effect on dividend policy. In addition, the domestic previous research has analyzed the effect of social responsibility activities on dividends by using a simple OLS regression. These studies have not considered the endogeneity problem of variables and the partial adjustment of dividends with panel data. They did not investigate the relation between corporate social activities and stability of dividends either. Studies on these topics with Korean firms are still lacking. The dividend theory has been greatly developed with signaling theory, agency theory, and life cycle theory based on the dividend-irrelevance theory of MM (1961). If the signal theory of dividends is true, it can be argued that social responsibility activities will affect dividend payout level positively (Benlemlih, 2019). If the outcome hypothesis of agency theory of dividend is true, social responsibility activities will show a positive relationship between dividend levels (Adjaoud and Ben-Amar, 2010), conversely, if substitute hypothesis of agency theory is true, social responsibility activities and dividend levels will show a negative (-) relationship (John and Knyazeva, 2006). According to life cycle theory, corporate social activities have a positive association with dividend payout (Rakotomavo, 2012). In addition, Benlemlih (2019) shows that the companies with excellent levels of social responsibility activities prefer to have more stable dividend policy in order to signal a reduction in agent costs through dividend and a sound management policy. Matos, Barros and Sarmento (2020) also show that the firms with more sustainability have more stable dividend policies by using data from the European securities market. These studies imply that social responsibility activities are expected to have a significant impact on the stability of dividend policies. This study utilizes the ESG ratings provided by the Korea Corporate Governance Service as the measures of CSR/ESG activities of firms. We collected the data from the non-financial firms listed in Korea security market during the period of 2013 through 2019. The financial data required for analysis used the KIS-VALUE database of Korea Credit Evaluation Information. The information about the major shareholders' equity was collected from the section of ownership status in the annual reports of the firms. The samples used in this study are 4,126 firm-year unbalanced panel data. The empirical analysis was conducted by applying a fixed effect panel analysis and a two-stage fixed effects panel analysis using the industrial average of social responsibility activities as an instrumental variable for social responsibility activities to alleviate the endogenous problem of social responsibility activities. The results of the analysis are as follows: First, the empirical results show that the ESG activities of the company have different effects on dividend level according to the measures of dividend payout. When dividend payout ratio (dividend/net income) is used for the dependent variable, only the social rating has been analyzed to have a statistically significant and positive effect on dividend. On the other hand, when dividend rate (dividend/total asset) and dividendwww.earticle.net yield(dividend/stock price) are used as dependent variables, the company's ESG integration rating, environmental rating, social rating, and governance rating have been shown to have a significant and positive impact on dividend. These results shows that the increase in corporate social responsibility activities among corporate ESG activities can improve the dividend propensity of companies. Since the dividend payout ratios of Korea firms remain relatively low, it is suggested that the company's social responsibility activities should be strengthened more in order to increase dividend propensity. In addition, it can be confirmed that the company's ESG activities have a significant and positive impact on the dividend level of the company, so that the company should be more interested in ESG for sustainability. In other words, the more a company have interests in the various stakeholders of the firm, the more profitable it is for shareholders. Second, this the findings can be explained by the outcome hypothesis of agent theory and the life cycle hypothesis. The cash ratio, which is the proxy variable of the agency issue, has a significant and positive effect on dividend propensity. Cash ratio, majority shareholder equity, foreign equity have a positive association with the dividend ratios, and the majority shareholder's ownership has a significant and positive impact on dividend yield. In addition, it was also confirmed that the ratios such as operating cash flow/total assets, earned surplus/total assets, and gross operating profit/total assets, which are the proxies of life cycle theory, are significantly and positively associated with the dividend rate. The variables such as market value/book value, earned surplus/total asset, gross operating profit margin have a significant and positive impact on the dividend yield. Third, the ESG activities were analyzed to have a significant impact on the stability of dividend policy. The better the ESG activity, the higher the target dividend level, and the faster the difference between the target dividend level and the actual dividend level was adjusted. This means that the better the ESG activity, the higher the sustainability, and the higher the dividend level can be maintained. Since the company is more profitable with better ESG activity, it can be adjusted to the target dividend level more quickly. (c) 2022, Korean Finance Association. All rights reserved.

Based on the Resource Dependence Theory (TDR) and the Agency Theory (TA), this research aims to analyze whether there is a relationship between the number and type of directors (construct board of directors) concerning indicators of financial performance of the company based on ROA, ROE, Net Profit Margin, Income Per Employee, and Beta or Systematic Risk (construct financial performance). Using the innovative and suitable method for small samples, PLS-SEM, authors create a theoretical model based on literature review and a measurement model that operates based on multiple and simultaneous correlations between the selected variables. The results show the conformation of two constructs and denote a statistically significant relationship between them. It has the limitation of being an exploratory and transversal analysis. The study is original in applying the statistical method to the field of corporate governance and finance and in the selection of variables. It is concluded that the proposed theoretical model is efficient in studying the constructs in companies. (c) 2022 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas. All right reserved.

The aim of this study is to examine a possible relationship of corporate financial performance and board membership changes. As a consequence, whether too little or too much board membership changes would produce a detrimental impact to financial performance. Furthermore, this study investigated whether this effect is more pronounced in family firms over non-family firms. Based on the agency theory and stewardship perspective, the results indicate that board membership changes are significant for family firms towards short-term financial performance indicators, with positive effect above a certain interval, though it signaling to the market may not be relevant. Also provides insightful examination of a specific corporate governance issue that is valuable both for academics and practitioners. (c) 2022 Authors. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The practice of corporate chief executive officer (CEOs) engaging in sociopolitical activism on issues both related and unrelated to their companies is gaining attention in the popular press and among management scholars. The purpose of this paper is to explore the antecedents and motivations of CEO sociopolitical activism in a typology of influences internal and external to the CEO and to the organization. This study's typology highlights the need for greater understanding of CEOs' sociopolitical activism for the CEO as an individual actor and for the company they represent. Design/methodology/approach: This study's approach is to conceptually review the literature on CEO activism and to create a theoretic framework for future analysis of the antecedents and motivations and ramifications of CEOs' sociopolitical activism for the CEO as an individual actor and for the company they represent. The author highlights four theories and seeks future application of these theories to the phenomena in a typology. Findings: The typology highlights the application of management theories to various ramifications of CEO activism to four influences on CEO activities. Upper echelons theory helps explain the motivation of a CEO internally, whereas agency theory applies to CEO activism internal to the CEO and external to the organizational operations. External to the CEO, organizational culture theory supports responses internal to the organization, and stakeholder theory provides insight into responses external to the CEO and the organization. Originality/value: This study provides conceptual support for the study of CEO activism and encourages future research on the topic. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study documents a puzzling historical trend in crash risk for US-listed firms: between 1950 and 2019, the firm-year occurrences of idiosyncratic stock price crashes rose from 5.5% to an astonishing 27%. The vastness of the literature notoriously attributes crashes to agency reasons, i.e. self-interested executives who strategically camouflage bad news via the financial reporting opacity and overinvestment channels. Nonetheless, we document that the opacity- and overinvestment-crash relations are non-significant, especially in the period following the enforcement of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The statistically non-significant relations are also witnessed in tests that account for the effect of equity-based compensation incentives and corporate governance functions. Overall, this study criticizes the efficacy of opacity and overinvestment as channels in explaining crash risk. Our conclusions offer avenues for future research to pursue in rationalizing the puzzling surge in stock price crashes. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Abstract This research examines the relation between annual report readability and company performance in a German-speaking country, Austria. The incomplete revelation hypothesis, management obfuscation hypothesis and agency theory assume that firms with lower performance strategically use readability in their disclosures to obfuscate negative results. For investors, reading, analysing, and interpreting data becomes a costly affair; this weakens the negative effect of such data on a firm's reputation and share price. We use LIX and Flesch formulas to measure the readability of letters to the shareholders and/or interviews with the board in annual reports. The sample consists of 37 companies that are listed on the Prime Market of the Vienna Stock Exchange and their data from the year 2009 to 2020. Company performance is measured by the change in turnover, profit, and share price. The analysed sections mostly show high to very high levels of difficulty. During the observation period, readability levels do not change significantly. We find that the annual reports of firms with lower performance are not harder to read and, therefore, cannot confirm the management obfuscation hypothesis. A significant influence of change in profit/loss on readability is minutely observed. Possible reasons for this observation could be characteristics of the German language, statistical outliers, the long observation period, more professional investor relations offices, and changing communication channels between companies and stakeholders. The last point, changing communication channels, also puts the obfuscation hypothesis and its application to readability up for discussion again. Implications for Central European audience: Our study shows that also Central European countries are confronted with low levels of readability in annual reports. Nevertheless, we cannot see a clear tendency towards obfuscation in corporate disclosures. (c) 2022, Central European Business Review. All Rights Reserved.

Following its 40th anniversary and more than three decades after its introduction to the strategic management literature, agency theory remains the predominant theory of corporate governance. In this paper, we examine affect, an underexplored dimension in principal-agent relationships. Using the CEO-board of directors relationship as a context, we develop a theoretical lens that explains how interpersonal affect underlying relationships between CEOs and directors of boards shapes behavior in ways that deviate from traditional agency theory predictions. We discuss how the incorporation of an affective perspective advances principal-agent research by revising agency theory's assumptions concerning human nature and behavior and suggesting new research directions. By acknowledging a central role of affect, we connect existing behavioral approaches to organizational agency and advance our understanding of socioemotional foundations of principal-agent tensions, problems, and agency costs.

This article aims to summarise a significant number of previous qualitative and quantitative researches in order for scholars to reconsider their understanding of corporate governance mechanisms. The fundamental purpose of examining corporate governance practices is to define the way earnings management can be reduced. The findings show unclear conclusions concerning the board of directors' and the committee's characteristics on earnings management. That is why adopting corporate governance mechanisms strives for reducing the 'agency' problem. Furthermore, researchers can monitor the impact of corporate governance mechanisms by focusing on recent literature (2019, 2020, 2021). Future research in this area is therefore being promoted. Implementing corporate governance in companies is a given, as it can ensure their effectiveness and increase their credibility and prestige. Adopting corporate governance practices mitigates earnings management phenomena, and companies make the right decisions for their smoother operation. Copyright (c) 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations on accrual earnings management (AEM) and real earnings management (REM) in Iran's emerging capital market. Design/methodology/approach: The panel data regression is used to testing hypotheses. The sample includes 2,020 data and 202 companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) over a period of ten years from 2012 to 2021. Also, the companies covered in this study include financial and nonfinancial companies. Furthermore, the data related to the research variables were extracted from the annual financial statements and the TSE database. Findings: The results show that compliance with AML regulations leads to a reduction in AEM and REM. In other words, companies with higher money laundering (ML) tend to manage their earnings, which is in line with agency theory. Practical implications: This study has implication for policymakers and regulators, auditors and managers. Considering the negative impact of AML regulations on earnings management (EM), Iranian auditing firms need to emphasize on the full implementation of AML regulations in TSE. Also, the results of this research may aid policymakers and regulators to detect financial crimes through accounting signals. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study in an Iran capital market to examine the impact of AML regulations on EM in financial and nonfinancial companies. Previous research has not controlled for the effects of financial companies. Prior studies have not examined the effects of financial companies. In addition, this study differentiates itself from previous studies by introducing a new method for measuring the independent ML variable based on auditor opinions. The obtained data can aid international bodies to better understand compliance with ML regulations in Iran and can reduce their concerns in negotiations. (c), Emerald Publishing Limited.

This chapter considers the new labour market relations within the high-tech sector through the prism of agency theory. Agency theory offers a valuable lens for examining work relationships as its unit of analysis is the contract between principal and agent. This chapter takes an up-close look at the nature of this contract in the conditions of the digital economy, the race for innovation and high demand for high-tech professionals. It discusses the implications of new forms of work for both employers and high-tech professionals. First, the assumptions and logics of agency theory are presented. Then, the landscape of new labour relations in high-tech industries is discussed in order to understand their contractual nature in the digital economy. New forms of work might limit workers' agency potential by fragmenting employees from each other and depriving them of social security nets. On the other hand, the hyper-competitive high-tech industry, pressure on new technologies coupled with surging demand for high-tech professionals and labour market disequilibrium impact high-tech professionals' agency potential. To understand the potential alignment and misalignment of agency contracts, two important variables of agency theory - risk and agency control - are examined. Finally, the usefulness of agency theory in explaining contemporary agency problems is assessed, its limitations are discussed and promising new research directions are proposed.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the moderating effect of external financing needs on the relationship between the disclosure level of integrated reporting (IR) and firm value using evidence from Egypt. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a panel regression analysis for a matched sample of 50 companies listed on the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX), specifically from EGX100. The sample covers four years (2017-2020). The current study uses content analysis to measure IR and Tobin's Q as a proxy for firm value. Findings: The findings reveal a significant positive relationship between the disclosure level of IR and firm value. In addition, the authors find that external financing needs moderate the relationship between IR and firm value. It is concluded that the higher the disclosure level of IR content, the higher the firm's value, and that this relationship strengthens in firms with high needs for external financing. Practical implications: Several practical implications can be derived from the results of the current study. Policymakers and regulators can impose mandatory requirements for IR in Egypt. It also opens new insights for board members, managers, analysts and auditors in forming financing decisions based on annual reports. Originality/value: The present study has a novel insight from a developing country and significant contributions to the extant literature. The study provides empirical evidence from an emerging economy and an insight into how external financing can be used for firms with different levels of IR. It also provides a comprehensive disclosure index to estimate the level of IR. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The growing number of corporate scandals globally highlights the importance of effective corporate governance mechanisms. Many of the corporate governance frameworks that are rooted in the agency theory advocate the election of independent non-executive directors, an independent chairperson, and a lead independent director. Shareholder voting on the election or re-election of directors (hereafter referred to as 'director re-elections') has been largely unexplored in South Africa--a country widely recognised as a pioneer in the corporate governance field and yet marred by several corporate scandals in recent years. In this study, an unbalanced panel data set was thus constructed comprising voting outcomes and board-level characteristics of companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2020. Significant positive relationships were noted between shareholder voting opposition to director re-elections and both board size and board tenure. Shareholders who cast opposing votes mainly did so because of their concerns about the lack of director independence, at board, committee, and nominee level. The findings of this study were explained in the context of the agency, stakeholder, stewardship, and resource dependence theories. It is recommended that nomination committees use more robust selection criteria for directors. Shareholders are also encouraged to vote more actively on director re-elections to monitor these monitors. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

This study investigates the relationship between corporate governance and corporate sustainability performance in the emerging Asian markets where the central role of sustainable development was perceived after the 2008 global financial crisis. We base our study on the triple bottom line approach that incorporates three dimensions of sustainability: economic, environmental, and social performance. A governance index comprising ten firm-specific provisions is proposed to summarise internal corporate governance. Consistent with agency theory, we confirm that firms with better corporate governance have better corporate sustainability performance. We also determine which main factors drive the governance-sustainability relation. The findings have practical implications for firms, shareholders, and policy makers by emphasising the role of corporate governance in assessing and enhancing corporate sustainability performance.

Drawing on agency and socioemotional wealth theory, this study elucidates that ownership succession intentions affect earnings management in private family firms. Based on a combination of questionnaire data and archival data of 331 Belgian private family firms, results indicate that family firms intending to transfer ownership to non-family members engage more in earnings management than those planning to transfer ownership to family members. Our findings also show differences in earnings management within each subset of ownership succession, thereby highlighting family firm heterogeneity. Family owners intending to transfer ownership to their children engage less in upward earnings management than those planning to transfer ownership to other family members. Family owners intending to transfer ownership to employees engage more in downward earnings management than those intending to transfer ownership to outsiders. This study contributes to both theory and practice by considering ownership succession intentions as a driver of earnings management.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of managerial myopia on information technology (IT) investment. Specifically, it aims to investigate the influence of chief information officer (CIO) compensation on IT investment and the moderating role of the board monitoring strength on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The study examines a sample of 194 firms listed on US stock exchanges with a CIO position in 2019. The authors employ hierarchical regression analysis to test the hypothesis. Findings: The results show that CIO compensation negatively influences IT investment. Further, even though vigilant board monitoring does not necessarily reduce such opportunistic behaviors, weak board monitoring creates an environment for such actions. Research limitations/implications: First, the cross-sectional data can limit the results' generalizability. Second, the sampling frame is not perfectly random as it consists of firms that have CIO compensation information in the ExecuComp for 2019. Third, we include only two measures of board monitoring strength. Practical implications: Board of directors should wisely select compensation packages' components since equity incentives potentially exacerbate managerial myopia. Moreover, firms may regulate CIOs' investment behaviors through board-level IT governance. Originality/value: This study is one of the few studies that utilize CIO sensitivity to measure CIO compensation. Moreover, by examining the factors affecting IT investment behavior, this study sheds light on CIO incentives' impact on IT investment behaviors. Finally, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate board monitoring's role in the relationship between CIO sensitivity and IT investment intensity.

This study evaluates whether an association exists between the agency incentives of the audit committee chair and voluntary disclosure of their monitoring activities in their audit committee report. Prior research suggests that a shift toward greater voluntary disclosure in the audit committee report occurred following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act but does not directly address the determinants of voluntary disclosure. Consistent with agency theory, audit committee chairs signal their duty-specific monitoring activities to shareholders, possibly to protect their reputation and justify their compensation. Within a high-litigation industry, this study provides evidence that audit committee chairs with a greater reputation level (i.e., more public company directorships) provide more concise duty-specific voluntary disclosure when serving companies with high levels of agency conflicts. This provides evidence consistent with efficiency in the market for audit committee chairs. This study also provides evidence that audit committee chairs respond to likely shareholder concerns by providing more concise duty-specific voluntary disclosure when their company has previously restated its financials. Finally, audit committee chairs provide increased voluntary disclosure specifically related to external audit oversight when high agency conflicts exist. As a whole, this contributes to the existing audit committee literature by providing evidence that voluntary disclosure incentives for financial reporting are also important determinants of more qualitative compliance-based reporting in the proxy statement. This has implications for accounting and governance practitioners as voluntary audit committee report disclosure offers shareholders detailed information that they may use in evaluating audit committee monitoring performance.

This paper explores the effect of dividends on the investment decisions of listed firms in Vietnam from 2010 to 2020. The study employs quantitative research methods to reveal the significant effect of dividends on investment decisions. In addition, the phenomena involving endogeneity and over-identifying restrictions are tested to ensure the reliability of the findings. The dividend-investment relationship is explained based on some theories, including the bird-in-the-hand theory, the asymmetric information theory, the signalling theory, and the agency theory. Under control variables, the findings define and support the effects on the dividend-investment relationship. (c) 2022, Institute of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. All rights reserved.

In modern organizations, there is a separation between ownership and control of the firm. On the lenses of agency theory, this study statistically examines the relationship between ownership structure (i.e., ownership concentration and owner identity) and firm performance of non-financial listed firms of Pakistan by taking firm-level control variables of size, age, liquidity, financial leverage, and growth of the firm. Secondary data is collected from annual reports of 65 non-financial listed firms for the year 2008 to 2012. The least-square dummy variable model followed by the random effect model has been employed to statistically determining the impact of ownership structure on firm performance. The results of the least square dummy variable model reveal that the ownership concentration has a significant positive impact on firm performance. The owner identity (such as dispersed, family, institutional, and government ownership) has a significant causal effect on firm performance as indicated from t and p values. (c) 2022 by IGI Global.

Public companies represent a valuable tool for the state to intervene in the economy by correcting market failures. However, critical positions that advocate its privatization continue to appear since they do not usually have great returns. This study analyzes the effect that political goals have on the efficiency of a state-owned enterprise (SOE) when ownership and management tend to be concentrated in the same actor. Agency theory served as a reference framework, using Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) as a case study during the period 1995-2014. First, the period was divided into four stages differentiated by changes in the SOE volumetric strategy, the exploration strategy, the position regarding foreign capital, and the SOE participation in social development activities. Later, the SOE economic and productive efficiency was analyzed in the stages to identify relevant changes. The results indicate that the interests of the principal and the agent by good management of the SOE increase when the profit is reduced. It is mainly due to the need of the government to benefit from these activities. However, when the company surplus increase, the government tends to intensify its control to obtain additional benefits, especially during electoral events. (c) 2022 The author(s).

Firms are defined by a set-up of associations that represent contractual provisions for financing, capital structure, managerial ownership and recompense. It has been observed from business history that these relationships have disagreements but virtually every party has alleged to the overall objective of good performance of the business. Previous studies have investigated the relationship among various parties within a firm and the impact on performance through agency theory as this theory leads to separation of ownership and control. But the results of previous studies are rather mixed due to disparity in measures of ownership and performance. This study looks for examining performance under different and detailed list of ownerships and composition of board. Using panel data an attempt was made to study the association between ownership pattern and firm performance for all the major industries listed on BSE 500 index.

Research question: This article aims to explain that poorly functioning separation between decision-making, decision-control, and risk-bearing is a fundamental reason for the financial underperformance of major or large sport events. We look at empirical data from four major sports events hosted in Norway: The 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics, the 2011 International Ski Federation (FIS) World Skiing Championship, the 2014 FIDE Chess Olympiad, and the 2017 International Cycling Union (UCI) World Road Cycling Championships. All these events suffered financially. Research methods: The study data were collected from 66 semi-structured interviews and different types of documents, like guides and reports filed by different stakeholders, applications for financial support, collaboration agreements, protocols of meetings, e-mail correspondence, financial statements, and budgeting documents. Results and findings: Through an examination of the previous literature, our analysis confirms drivers and symptoms of financial problems at sport events. These are: the exaggerated focus on legitimising the event, soft-budget practices, interference by political interests, and so on. We argue that many of these factors could have been handled better if a more consequent separation of risk-bearing, decision-making, and decision-control was in place. Implications: We propose a better separation between the decision-making and decision-control function, by means of a permanent and independent entity that is responsible for the decision-control function. Such an institution could enhance knowledge transfer, contribute competence and skills, and improve the financial outcome of a sports events. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

This study investigates the effects of foreign return-oriented shareholders and domestic relational shareholders of Japanese companies on the earnings management behavior of their invested firms when stock option pay is adopted. We theorize that foreign shareholders seek short-term returns and do not engage in close monitoring due to an information disadvantage while domestic shareholders prevent managerial behavior that distorts information disclosure. Our findings show that managers of firms that use stock option pay engage in earnings management to increase their private financial benefits and meet capital markets' expectations, which allows them to enhance their own reputation. However, this managerial behavior is contingent on the firm's ownership structure. Our results show that while foreign shareholders enhance the positive impact of stock options on earning management, domestic shareholders and affiliated directors mitigate this positive effect. Our empirical analyses support the argument that ownership heterogeneity is a key determinant of managerial propensity to engage in earnings management when Japanese firms adopt stock option pay.

Though managerial ties are substitutes for the weak market-supporting institutions in developing and emerging countries, little is known about the contingent value of these ties in credit markets. In this study, we disintegrate managerial ties into political and financial ties, and examine their effect on access to finance. Using agency theory, we propose that political and financial ties reduce information asymmetry between firms, politicians and banks, culminating in increased access to bank loans for firms. We also propose that CEO duality, through its influence on corporate governance and information consolidation, strengthens (weakens) the effect of financial (political) ties on access to finance. Using survey data from Ghana, we found support for our propositions. Overall, this study shows that the value of managerial ties is contingent on CEO duality. It also suggests that CEO duality is a double-edged sword with corporate governance and information implications for credit access in developing economies. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Purpose: This study draws on agency, theory to evaluate the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and earnings quality, proxied by discretionary accruals. Additionally, this study aims to examine whether board independence moderates the relationship between CEO duality and earnings quality. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a fixed-effects regression model to examine the effect of CEO duality on earnings quality and to test whether board independence moderates that relationship for a sample of non-financial listed Portuguese firms-year from 2002 to 2016. Findings: Consistent with agency theory, this study suggests that CEO duality decreases earnings quality. Further, the results also suggest that the earnings quality reduction associated with CEO duality is attenuated when the board of directors has a higher proportion of independent directors. Practical implications: The findings based on this study provide useful information to investors and regulators in evaluating the impact of CEO duality on earnings quality and the effect of board independence on the role of CEO duality, especially under concentrated ownership. Originality/value: To the knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the role of board independence on the association between CEO duality and earnings quality. In addition, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the direct and indirect effect of CEO duality on earnings quality in Portugal. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The objective of this study is to examine the role that the specialized committees, created within the board of directors, and the auditor play in relation to the hiring of a non-financial information assurance service and in relation to the choices of the assurance provider for such non-financial information. Specifically, this study analyses the effect of the independence and specialisation of the audit committee, the existence of a CSR committee, and the reputation of the financial auditor associated with its classification as Big4. The results indicate that those responsible for financial information do not show interest in contracting an assurance service, especially if it is realized by an accountant provider, except that the information is standardised according to the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and the contracted service is comparable to the financial audit standards, has assurance for a reasonable/high level, and is carried out according to the ISAE3000 standard.

Cultural dimensions have a significant impact on capital structure decisions, particularly in Islamic economies where unique personal, social and ethical values are closely integrated with culture. This study considers the relationship between four Hofstede cultural dimensions to explain their connection with the capital structure decisions of Shariah-compliant firms. Using a panel of 342 Shariah complaint companies from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for the period 2013 to 2017, this study investigates the influence of cultural dimensions on short-term, long-term and total leverage in the presence of several firm- and country-specific variables. On average, Saudi Arabian firms witnessed comparatively higher percentages of all three debt classifications considered. Typically, determinants of debt do not otherwise differ significantly across the three countries. Firms also carefully consider asset structure and growth opportunities when raising debt capital. On the other hand, when tested alongside cultural dimensions, Islamic firms from countries with (a) higher power distance scores, (b) higher levels of individualism, (c) higher masculinity scores and (d) lower degrees of uncertainty avoidance exhibit a preference for long-term debt. This finding diverges from the existing literature on non-Islamic firms. Agency theory and pecking order theory predominate in explaining our findings. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether threshold effects exist in the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the panel smooth threshold regression model (PSTR) to a sample of 284 non-financial French firms listed on Euronext Paris over the period 2009-2017. Firm performance proxies are Tobin's Q and return on assets (ROA). The board gender diversity is measured by the percentage of women participation in board. Findings: Threshold effects in the relationships between board gender diversity and firm performance measures are found. For Tobin's Q, the model has one threshold at the 34.17% of women directors' appointment on boards. Similarly, for ROA, the model has one threshold at the 38.28% of women presence in the board. The results show that above the estimated threshold, women directorship has a positive impact on firm performance. However, below the threshold, there is a neutral relationship. The findings support the critical mass view that a minimum of one third women representation in board is compulsory to achieve the desired effect of gender diversity. Practical implications: This study's finding provides useful insights to managers, investors and policymakers. Managers and investors can identify the adequate board gender diversity levels that enhance firm performance. Policymakers are divided on whether mandatory or voluntary board gender quota should be adopted. This study suggests that a quota of one third can be used in policy implementation. Originality/value: Unlike prior studies that consider the relationship between firm performance and board gender diversity as linear, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the threshold effects in this relationship using a new econometric approach.

Using a cross-sectional dataset comprising 749 firms from 13 countries in Asia Pacific markets, this study examines the effect of board monitoring effectiveness (BME) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP). This study also investigates how BME and the country's legal system, and BME and CEO non-duality leadership interact to influence CSP. The results reveal that BME positively affects CSP, suggesting that strengthening board monitoring effectiveness will lead to a greater drive towards firms' sustainable business conduct. This study also finds that firms from countries with civil law system and firms practicing CEO non-duality leadership would enhance the impact of BME on CSP. Additionally, the effect of BME on CSP is more pronounced among non-duality firms operating in countries with civil law regime. The findings are consistent and robust to two different measures of CSP. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the relationship between key audit matters (KAMs) and audit costs and whether board size and independence affect this relationship. Furthermore, this paper examines the moderating effect of corporate governance on the relationship between KAMs and audit costs. Design/methodology/approach: The authors hypothesise that disclosing more KAMs in the audit report is positively associated with audit costs because of the greater effort. The agency theory suggests that firms with good governance will mitigate the agency conflict of interest and improve financial reporting quality. Thus, good governance might moderate the relationship between reported KAMs and audit costs. The authors use a quantitative approach. The authors are using a sample of the UK FTSE all-share non-financial firms from 2014 to 2018 for the UK Financial Times Stock Exchange all-share non-financial firms. Findings: The authors provide evidence of a significant positive relationship between KAMs and audit costs. The relationship is relatively higher when considering the independent directors' percentage as a moderating factor. These results came consistent with the agency theory literature. However, the authors found no empirical evidence to support a moderating effect of board size on the relationship between KAMs and audit cost. Practical implications: The finding benefits the regulatory setters to better understand the consequences of the new auditing standards. This paper has theoretical and practical implications for regulators, standard setters, professional bodies, shareholders and academics. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature assessing the regulatory changes related to audit reform and adds to the debate on the impact on audit costs. This paper underlines governance factors as a moderating role in this relationship between KAMs and audit costs. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The purpose of this study is to gauge the efficacy of theories of corporate governance in alleviating bankruptcy in the Indian context. The study uses logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard model on a sample of 680 firm observations. Two-stage least squares regression is employed to mitigate endogeneity issues. Main results support agency theory in terms of CEO non-duality, low CEO compensation, and concentrated ownership variables, and defend resource dependence theory with respect to large board size and high directors' attendance, for precluding bankruptcy. Internal and external governance mechanisms are more favourable in 5 to 3 years and 1 to 2 years prior to bankruptcy, respectively. The predictive power of governance models is found to be better than of financial models in 5 to 4 years prior to bankruptcy. Combined models involving both governance and financial variables outperform standalone governance or financial models and are most accurate in the fifth year preceding bankruptcy. Additional tests show that the time availability of independent directors holds more importance over their resourcefulness in the initial years of distress. This study has a few key takeaways for stakeholders, companies, and regulating bodies. It is suggested that regulators enforce CEO non-duality and necessitate a minimum number of board meetings to be attended per year by the directors. This is one of the first studies to develop a corporate governance model on bankruptcy in the Indian context since the enactment of its new bankruptcy code.

Purpose: This paper examines whether ownership type has a moderating influence on dividend payouts during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis with respect to changes in profits. Future uncertainties because of the pandemic will result in a perceived need for liquidity within the company, but retaining cash may be risky for shareholders who could look for less risky alternatives. The dividend payout strategy is thus even more closely related to the overall type concentration and strategy of the owners during the crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The effects are explored and tested on early data from 2019 to 2020 of Finnish companies using ANCOVA while controlling for profitability and sector variables. Findings: A significant effect on dividend payout during the COVID crisis was found when the companies are dominantly held by individual owners validating early suggestions on such an influence. Therefore, this study contributes further to the academic debates on the influence of ownership concentration in times of crises. This study lists certain sectors which experience diminished profits during such a crisis which pinpoints sector separation in future discussions. Research limitations/implications: This study explores early data from a specific context in the Nordic countries. However, it does so out of purpose as explained in the paper. Practical implications: Ownership type and concentration matters when it comes to dividend payout decisions under uncertainty with regard to changes in profit. Investors need to accept these behavioural insights into their decisions. Originality/value: This study examines the signalling effect of dividends by analysing how actual or anticipated change in profitability due to a crisis is reflected by owners and leads to dividend payout decisions under uncertainty.

This study aims to examine a set of institutional isomorphic influences toward integrated reporting quality (IRQ) and the role of board independence in moderating such influences. The results from a cross-sectional sample of 200 international companies indicated that both coercive (regulatory quality) and normative isomorphism (press freedom, CEO with accounting qualification, Dow Jones Sustainability Index listing, and winning an IR award) exert positive effects on IRQ. Moreover, board independence moderates positively for the effects of mimetic isomorphism (environmental sensitive industry) on IRQ. This study contributes to filling the gap in the literature by offering a multi-theory approach to analyzing the antecedent of IRQ from the lenses of both institutional and agency theory. It also offers a practical contribution for corporate IR adopters, users, and regulatory authorities to improve corporate reporting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the moderating role of board independence on IRQ. (c) 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of corporate governance mechanisms, namely, board of directors and auditors, on tax aggressiveness in Italian companies listed on the Milan Stock Exchange. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a population of 168 Italian non-financial firms listed on the Milan Stock Exchange, holding shares in at least one foreign subsidiary in countries other than Italy in fiscal year 2018. Data on corporate boards and auditors were collected through the evaluation of companies' annual reports over the period 2011-2018. Five panel data analyses with fixed effects were performed for each tax aggressiveness index, yielding 1,176 observations to test the research hypothesis. Findings: This paper finds that corporate board characteristics, such as size, gender diversity and CEO duality, and auditors' features, such as external audit quality, increase corporate tax aggressiveness. Practical implications: This study provides investors with an understanding of corporate boards' and auditors' roles in preventing agency conflicts and evaluating a company's tax approach. Furthermore, the findings are useful for international political bodies in regulating corporate board composition and managerial monitoring. Originality/value: Almost all studies focusing primarily on corporate governance mechanisms' effects on tax aggressiveness are within the US context. Empirical evidence on the topic in the European contexts is limited. The legislative discrepancy between countries is reflected in the computation of indices measuring tax aggressiveness, affecting US studies' generalizability across nations. This paper extends the literature on the topic by investigating other unexplored corporate governance mechanisms. Five indices were used to measure corporate tax aggressiveness and to assess analysis reliability and data robustness. Moreover, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate the link between corporate governance mechanisms and tax aggressiveness in Italy.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the drivers for proactive workplace social performance in family firms through a configurational approach. Comparative research on family versus non-family firms and workplace social performance has produced mixed results. Consequently, several calls have been made to account for family business heterogeneity to understand better how family involvement in the business affects the workplace social performance. The authors respond to these calls by exploring the governance antecedents that can catalyze family firms' workplace social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using qualitative comparative analysis, the authors analyze 131 family firms from the STEP survey data. Findings: The authors find two governance configurations that lead to better family business workplace social performance. The first configuration is the combination of 100% family ownership, high family involvement in management and a mix of outside directors and family members on the board. The second configuration is the combination of less than 100% family ownership and low family involvement in management. Originality/value: The study builds on and extends the nascent work suggesting the integration of agency and stewardship theories. The authors show that these two theoretical approaches are able to not only coexist, but that they can also be complementary in helping to understand the unique workplace social behaviors of family firms.

Longstanding assumptions underlying strategic alliances, such as agency theory, are actively being revoked by dynamics in the new economy. The mechanism of inter-firm cooperation is increasingly being altered by radical developments in blockchains and artificial intelligence among other technologies. To capture and address this shift, this review takes a problematisation approach and focuses wholly on the pertinence of agency theory. First, it begins by acknowledging the established corpus in the area before, second, appraising the seven long-held assumptions in the principal-agent relationship encompassing (1) self-interest, (2) conflicting goals, (3) bounded rationality, (4) information asymmetry, (5) pre-eminence of efficiency, (6) risk aversion and (7) information as a commodity. Third, to add a fresh perspective, the review proceeds to proffer seven assumptions to advance a novel 'Blockchain Agency Theory' that would better describe new attributes and relaxed agency behaviour in blockchain alliances. These counter assumptions are (1) common interests, (2) congruent goals, (3) unbounded rationality, (4) information symmetry, (5) smart contracts, (6) mean risk and (7) information availability. In the fourth part, the prior audience of principals and agents is appraised and this culminates into, fifth, a consideration of a new audience of blockchain agency in algocratic environments. Altogether, the seven new assumptions extend and provoke new agency thinking among scholars and blockchain practitioners alike. (c) 2023 The Authors

Publicly listed firms have discretion to disclose (or not) advertising spending in their annual (10-K) reports. The disclosure of advertising spending can provide valuable information because advertising is a leading indicator of future performance. However, estimates of advertising spending are available from data providers, arguably mitigating the need for its formal disclosure. This article argues that firms' disclosure of advertising spending provides more complete and public information and therefore lowers investor uncertainty about future firm performance (idiosyncratic risk). Empirical analyses show that the effect is largely driven by the negative effect of disclosure of advertising spending on analyst uncertainty. Consistent with agency theory, the negative effect of the disclosure of advertising spending on analyst uncertainty is stronger for firms with more financial resources, firms with lower disclosure quality, and firms that are in more competitive industries. Additional analyses show that the disclosure of advertising spending has a significant positive effect on firm value in specific sectors. These results, therefore, identify an avenue for chief marketing officers to play a greater role in managing investor relations. In addition, they suggest strong merit for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board to reconsider current regulations governing advertising spending disclosure.

Extending past research, this paper proposes that the quadratic inverse-U relationship between family ownership and the performance of entrepreneurial firms when moderated by the presence of family management and external blockholding. Specifically, it proposes that both factors exacerbate the decline in performance when the proportion of family ownership in entrepreneurial firms remains high. The proposed hypotheses are tested on ten years of panel data from a sample of European firms. Analysis of data supports the hypotheses. Implications for the theory and practice of entrepreneurial firms are discussed. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

We document strong evidence that CEO incentive compensation can predict the significance of stock price momentum through discretionary accrual and real activities manipulation. The profit of momentum strategy increases with CEO pay-for-performance incentive, but decreases with CEO risk-taking incentive. It also evaluates the effects of information uncertainty on such relationship. The evidence is more significant for firms with older and longer tenured CEOs and firms with more informed traders. The relationship between the profit of momentum strategy and CEO pay-for-performance incentive is stronger among CEOs without the risk-taking incentive. Our results are robust for different sub-samples based on before and after Reg FD and Sarbanes-Oxley Act, even after controlling for the potential endogeneity. Further, our findings are consistent with the information diffusion explanation of momentum and the agency theory that incentivised CEOs tend to manipulate information by smoothing good news, concealing mildly bad news and accelerating the disclosure of extremely bad news.

We use a novel measure of firm-level political risk based on a textual search technique on firms' quarterly earnings conference transcripts to explain dividend payouts in publicly listed U.S. firms. We find a positive and significant effect of firm-level political risk on dividend payouts, particularly in uncertainties related to economics, institutions, technology, trade, and security. The effect is more pronounced in firms with better corporate governance, less analyst follow-up, and higher growth opportunities. These results support the signaling role of dividends rather than the role of agency theory in explaining dividend payouts when firms are associated with higher levels of political risk. We also find the effect to be prominent after controlling for an aggregate measure of economic policy uncertainty and in poor economic conditions and in major political event periods. We address endogeneity concerns by running placebo tests and conducting instrumental variable analysis and we alleviate self-selection bias by performing propensity score matching technique.

<Abstract> This study examines the effect of the interaction between controlling shareholder ownership and product market competition on investment inefficiency in Korea. Consistent with classical agency theory, this study finds that the lower the controlling shareholder owner-ship, the greater the overinvestment. However, this relationship strengthens in non-competitive markets but disappears in competitive markets. This suggests that product market competition has a disciplinary effect on the incentive of controlling shareholders to pursue private benefits. This study has implications for the disciplinary effect of competition and expands the literature on agency theory in emerging countries with concentrated ownership structures.

Based on agency and asymmetric information theories, the objective of this paper is to investigate whether the transparency on corporate governance is determined by strategies followed by the board of directors (liquidity, investment, capital structure, innovation and board composition impact on the corporate governance transparency). The study sample is composed by 826 observations from Latin American firms during the period 2004-2010 (128 unique firms). A two-way cluster standard errors and GMM methods have been adopted to perform the econometric analysis. Results suggest that corporate governance disclosure is attributable to changes on firm's decisions made by the board with respect to financial aspects and innovation. However, the impact upon transparency of board composition with regards to female directors, independence and size of boards are attributable to industry and/or country effects. Although the main limitation of the study is focused on the period of analysis, the results provide important implications for the business sector, demonstrating that the board composition and the financial and innovation strategies adopted by the board encourage greater corporate transparency, thus increasing confidence in the markets.

Investors increasingly use ESG information for their investment decisions. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether investors practise disciplinary trading using the ESG scores provided by rating agencies to influence firms' cash holdings. Employing a larger sample of US listed firms, we find that stock liquidity acts as a channel between ESG scores and cash holdings. ESG scores carry vital information on the effectiveness of firms' governance and agency problems. Hence, investors respond to ESG information through stock trading that send signals to management, resulting in changes in firms' cash holdings. Consequently, investors use stock trading as a mechanism to create the necessary push for insiders to resolve agency problems. (c) 2023

Responding to the calls in both earnings management and sustainability literature to examine corporate governance patterns, this study fills the sustainability literature gap by shedding light on the moderating role of corporate governance on earnings management and environmental, social and governance performance. Using a sample of UK firms listed on the London Stock Exchange for the period 2016-2020, we find considerable evidence that earnings management reduces environmental, social and governance performance. Importantly, we find that board gender diversity among other corporate governance mechanisms is stronger and more effective in attenuating the negative effects of earnings management on environmental, social and governance performance significantly. We find support for the agency theory that corporate governance mechanisms reduce the managerial exploitation of resources required for sustainable investments and sustainability performance.

Despite the nonprofit sector's significance in economic contribution, workforce, and social impact, it faces unique innovation hurdles and is not well positioned for sustainability, growth, and prosperity. However, with only a partial, disconnected view from the extant research, we do not understand the relationship between boards and nonprofit innovation for growth. To address this problem, we conducted a systematic literature review drawing on 27 studies published since 2000 to provide a first-in-field and comprehensive integration of disparate, mono-factorial research. We conceptualize a new, multifactorial model that depicts a blend of board composition, relations and practice factors, and organizational and environmental characteristics that influence nonprofit innovation for growth.

This study reviews contemporary corporate governance (CG) in China. This is crucial because of the lack of awareness in the foreign investor community concerning the transparency and reliability of the second-largest economy's governance policy. The review offered in this study not only contributes to the expanding literature in relation to the Chinese CG model, but also further deepens the understanding of the governance issues concerning businesses operating in China among foreign institutional investors and foreign corporate practitioners. The significance of promoting the transparency and integrity of Chinese firms and capital markets is ensuring that firm assets are used diligently and effectively to safeguard the interests of investors and other relevant stakeholders. Moreover, this study sheds light on the latest developments in the Chinese capital market, regulatory framework, and CG perspective for managers of multinational firms to evaluate their potential direct investment decisions in China. In addition, this study provides a review of existing literature on whether Chinese CG is converging towards or diverging from the Anglo-American model, which may be helpful for the decision-making process of Chinese policymakers and regulators in relation to the formulation of new codes, regulations, and policies in the future.

Purpose: Public listing of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) stimulates unremitting transformations into their corporate governance (CG) practices. These transformations in CG are likely to impact the financial performance (FP). The current study examines how individual corporate CG mechanisms and their mutual interactions (configurational approach) stimulate the FP of listed SMEs. The study selects promoters' ownership (PO), the board (B-INX) and information disclosures (DISC) as individual CG mechanisms. In addition, market competition (COMP) is considered a form of external governance/regulation. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses five years of panel data (2018-2022) of 80 SMEs listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) SME listing platform in India. Panel data fixed effects and cluster robust standard errors estimated. In addition to the impact of individual CG mechanisms, their mutual interactions (configurational approach) are tested using moderated hierarchical regression and confirmed by slope tests. Findings: The results signify the ineffectiveness of individual CG mechanisms when acting in silos. However, their mutual interactions drive the FP. A hierarchy of results is obtained. PO is the dominant form of internal CG, negatively influencing the relevance of B-INX and DISC. B-INX tends to adhere to good governance by positively moderating the impact of DISC on FP. Lastly, COMP acts as external governance that dominates the ownership effects. Findings reveal that the interactions among individual CG mechanisms are essential to the FP of listed SMEs. Such interactions adjust the agency theory dynamics of CG in these firms. Research limitations/implications: The study takes a holistic approach to investigate the agency theory dynamics via the mutual interactions among multiple CG forms. It highlights how the presence of a dominant form of CG can adjust the financial effect of others, thereby adjusting agency theory dynamics. Practical implications: These results hold practical significance for SMEs in multiple ways. SMEs should embrace configurational approach to comprehend their agency dynamics. The configurational approach of CG mechanisms is the way forward for SMEs, which are known to be financially constrained. In other words, the fact that the resiliency of SMEs is very often questioned calls for the configurational approach, where different CG mechanisms coexist to drive FP. Originality/value: The study is by far the first of its kind to investigate the CG of listed SMEs against the backdrop of the configurational approach. The findings will benefit industry practitioners, academics and regulatory bodies to visualize the governance practices through the lenses of configurational approach.

Agency conflicts increase with contract maturity. As contract maturity increases, managers, acting on behalf of shareholders, have more opportunities to use their discretion in ways that adversely affect future payoffs. Agency theory suggests that when contract maturity increases, creditors place less weight on a firm's growth opportunities in assessing default risk. We present a counter-argument: because the timing of future payoffs is uncertain, longer-duration debt provides creditors with a longer horizon over which payoffs are earned. Using credit default swap (CDS) spreads, we demonstrate that the relevance of future earnings expectations increases with CDS maturity. Our results suggest that contract maturity is not a reliable proxy for agency costs when evaluating the credit market relevance of financial information.

Purpose: As shareholder-elected monitors, independent non-executive directors (INEDs) should ensure that managers do not retain earnings to promote their own interests. The relationship between board independence and dividend distributions was hence investigated for selected companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). The country offers a well-developed corporate governance framework to listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: Data on the considered companies' dividend payout ratios (DPRs), board independence and six control variables were obtained from Bloomberg for the period 2007-2021. The significance of the observed trends in these variables was considered by conducting analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) tests. The hypothesised relationship was assessed using a mixed-model regression. Findings/results: The results are in line with prior research showing that dividends are often omitted or reduced during and after crisis periods, that is, the global financial crisis (2008/2009) and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (2020/2021). A negative but statistically insignificant relationship was reported between DPR and board independence. Practical implications: Although board independence was not significantly related to dividend distributions for the sampled companies, INEDs still perform an important monitoring role. Shareholders are thus encouraged to play a more active role in the election of these directors. Originality/value: This study extends and refines previous research in South Africa and reveals new insights regarding board independence and dividend distributions during three King regimes and distribution-related regulatory changes.

Purpose: From an agency perspective, the authors investigate whether family ownership and control configurations are systematically associated with a firm's choice of auditor and audit fees. Agency theory is an economic theory that purposes the existence of a contract between two parties, principals and agents. Auditor choice and audit fees by family firms provide interesting insights given the unique nature of the agency problems faced by such firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ Big-4 auditors (PWC, KPMG, E&Y and Deloitte) as a proxy for high quality auditor (Big N) for the auditor choice model. For the audit fee model, the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of audit fees (LnAF). The authors use two measures for family firm as explanatory variables: (1) a dummy variable (FAM_Control), which equals one if the firm is classified as a family firm and (2) FAM_Ownership, which is an indicator variable with a value of one if a firm has family members who hold CEO position, occupy board seats, or hold at least 10% of the firm's equity. Data of Chinese listed firms from 2011 to 2021 are used. The authors adopt the Heckman (1979) two-stage model to mitigate the potential endogeneity issue involved in the selection of Big-N auditors. Findings: The findings suggest that compared with non-family firms, Chinese family firms have a less tendency to employ Big-4 auditors due to less severe agency problems between owners and managers. Additionally, Chinese family firms sustain higher audit fees than non-family firms. Similar to the prior literature, however, Chinese family firms audited by Big-4 auditors incur lower audit fees than family firms audited by non-Big-4 auditors in this study. In contrast to young-family firms, old-family firms are less likely to pick top-tier auditors and sustain lower audit fees. Consistent and robust results are found from endogeneity tests and sensitivity analyses. Originality/value: The empirical evidence provides a unique insight, for accounting practitioners, policymakers, family owners and other capital market participants concerning the diverse effects of various family ownership and control features on selecting high-quality auditors and audit fees. This study advances the understanding, showing that a lower demand for audit quality occurs in Chinese family firms as they encounter less severe Type I agency problems. However, the more severe Type II agency problems in Chinese family firms sustain higher audit fees due to higher audit risk and greater audit effort. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the theoretical underpinnings of international financial reporting standards (IFRS)-related studies and offers directions for theoretical and empirical research. Specifically, this study examines the main theories in IFRS adoption research (i.e. adoption, compliance and effects). Design/methodology/approach: The sample contains 67 empirical papers that have used theories and was collected from Web of Science database. This study uses a systematic review technique. Findings: Generally, the review shows the prevalent and pervasive use of institutional theories of isomorphism across all the three areas of IFRS adoption. Particularly, regarding IFRS adoption stream, this study finds the institutional theory as a dominant theory used to explain IFRS diffusion around the globe. For IFRS compliance, this study finds that the agency and the capital need theories are widely used. For IFRS adoption effects stream, this study finds a few studies using the contingency and neo-institutional theories. Overall, the review provides theoretical lens for IFRS adoption, IFRS compliance and IFRS adoption effects. Originality/value: Given the lack of a well-defined set of theories in the domain of accounting, the findings provide further guidance on theory building within the field. Further, accounting regulators, academics and practitioners may benefit from the findings when explaining various changes in the world of accounting. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study addresses the influence of sustainable institutional investors (SII), based on the signatory status of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), on corporate tax avoidance. Moreover, the moderating influence of corporate sustainability performance (CSP) is analyzed. The analyses concentrate on a European sample consisting of 1689 firm-year observations between 2014 and 2020 (EUROSTOXX 600) embedded in a stakeholder agency theoretical framework. Correlation, regression, and robustness analyses are conducted. The results are in line with prior studies on equity ownership and tax avoidance and indicate that SII have a negative impact on tax avoidance and that CSP strengthens this negative effect. These results are robust to a battery of sensitivity analyses. SII represent a major monitoring mechanism in promoting responsible tax behavior, which is in line with other stakeholders' interests. Tax avoidance should be integrated into overall sustainability management to realize an increased firm reputation. As the European Commission initiated several regulations on sustainable finance, sustainability reporting, and tax disclosure, the empirical results stress the interdependencies between ownership structure, CSP, and tax avoidance. The study makes a major contribution to prior analyses, as this study is the first to assess the link between SII and tax avoidance and the moderating impact of CSP to urge top management to increase sustainability efforts.

Background: Chief executive officer (CEO) payment and company performance are highly controversial, and existing research has focused on this link for decades. The study was conducted in South Africa where corporate governance regulators have introduced measures to improve the relationship between CEO pay and performance. Aim: This research aimed to explore the problem by extending Pepper and Gore's (2015) behavioural agency theory to examine the moderating effect of remuneration governance on the CEO pay - company performance relationship. Setting: The study focused on the Top 100 listed companies in which several regulations concerning CEO pay were introduced, which provided the opportunity to examine such regulations on the alignment of CEO pay and company performance. Method: Panel data from 67 company annual reports were analysed over two decades with 871 datapoints, divided into three periods corresponding with the introduction of regulations. Analyses included corrected panel standard errors and estimated generalised least squared hierarchical multiple regression and moderated multiple regression analyses. Results: Results showed a statistically significant positive relationship between company performance measures and total CEO remuneration (including long-term incentives [LTIs]) for each of the three periods. We found that LTIs tied to performance-vested criteria and CEO minimum shareholding do enhance pay-performance sensitivity. Results further suggest that the behavioural agency theory is incomplete and researchers should consider the role of remuneration governance in moderating CEO overpayment. Conclusion: Remuneration governance should be refined through the inclusion of retrospective CEO remuneration disclosure to increase pay-performance sensitivity. Contribution: This research contributes to knowledge of CEO payment and company performance. (c) 2023. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of ownership structure variables on the performance of Saudi listed firms. Design/methodology/approach: The impact of ownership structure variables on firm performance is examined using fixed effects and dynamic panel generalised method of moments regression approaches for 70 listed firms over the period 2016-2021. Ownership structure variables are captured by examining government, institutional, insider, foreign and family ownership, and firm performance is gauged in terms of the accounting-based measures of return on assets and the return on equity and the market-based measures of Tobin's Q and the market-to-book ratio. Findings: The results show that government, institutional, insider and foreign ownership all positively affect both accounting and market-based performance measures, whereas family ownership exerts a negative impact across the models. The findings support resource dependence theory, agency theory and alignment effects arguments. Practical implications: The findings have significant implications for Saudi regulators in their effort to improve domestic capital market efficiency and investor protection, while also highlighting the need for a corporate governance code to safeguard minority shareholders. The results demonstrate that government, institutional, insider and foreign ownership exert an important impact on firm operational and market performance. Originality/value: This study expands the literature by examining how ownership structure variables affect performance in an interesting developing country corporate context.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the impact of risk committee characteristics on the risk disclosure of banking institutions in an emerging economy, Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: The data are collected through a manual content analysis of 21 banks regulated by the State Bank of Pakistan over the period 2011-2020. The study utilizes the generalized least square (GLS) regression model as the method of analysis. Findings: The study finds that risk committee size is positively associated with risk disclosure, which is in line with agency theory. However, risk committee independence and risk committee gender diversity are negatively associated with risk disclosure. This contradicts the theoretical perspective and is explained by the weak regulatory framework of Pakistan. Research limitations/implications: This study was carried out in a single research setting, which limits the generalizability of its findings to other developed and emerging economies. Practical implications: The results provide valuable insights for regulators by identifying the attributes that require regulatory focus to strengthen risk committees and enhance risk disclosure practices within the banking sector of Pakistan. The findings highlight the effectiveness of the risk committee size, call for fully independent risk committees and encourage greater representation of women in these committees. Originality/value: This study contributes to the corporate governance literature by empirically examining the risk committee characteristics and their impact on the risk disclosure of banks in an emerging economy. Moreover, this study contributes to theory by utilizing upper echelon theory in addition to agency theory as the motivation for the study. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This research recognizes the increasing importance of the preservation of the natural environment for society as well as for the corporate sector. The study adopts a stakeholder-agency theory perspective to examine the influence of characteristics and effectiveness of the board of directors on the environmental disclosures made by the corporate sector. The method of content analysis was adopted for collecting information on board characteristics, board processes, and environmental disclosures made by the sample companies. The extent of environmental disclosure has been measured by using an Environmental Disclosures Index. It was found that a higher proportion of independent directors, the absence of chairman-CEO duality, and the overall board effectiveness had a significant positive influence on the extent of environmental disclosures. However, board diversity represented by female directors on the boards was found to have a statistically insignificant impact on environmental disclosures.

This study aims to provide a bibliometric review (Zupic & Cater, 2015; Hallinger, 2019) of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base. This paper is guided by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and based on the Scopus index for determining and extracting data. A total of 1,661 articles from 1983 to 2021 are included. The USA, the UK, and Australia are the leaders in the literature. A significant gap exists for further research from developing and non-Western settings. We identified authors with the highest citations (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Kose John), the most prominent authors based on the citation for each document (Danny Miller, Luc Renneboog, and Igor Filatotchev), and the most highly cited documents (--Higher market valuation of companies with a small board of directors||, Yermack, 1996; --Disentangling the incentive and entrenchment effects of large shareholdings||, Claessens et al., 2002, and --Boards: Does one size fit all?||, Coles et al., 2008). Besides, the review reveals an intellectual structure of the corporate governance and firm value knowledge base in three schools of thought: agency theory, firm value, and boards of directors. Our findings provide an overview of top-influential research for new scholars and enable us to identify highly cited theoretical foundations quickly. (c) 2023 The Authors.

This paper examines the relationship between board capital attributes and corporate social responsibility disclosure (CSRD) quality and how CEO power moderates the association between board capital attributes and CSRD quality. Using a cross-sectional sample of 114 firms, we find that directors' experience and directors' interlocking have positive impacts on CSRD quality while directors' political ties have a significant negative impact on CSRD quality in Saudi firms. Contrary to our hypotheses, we find no support for the impacts of directors' education, directors' expertise, and board nationality on CSRD quality. Moreover, we find partial support for the moderation effects of CEO power. Overall, we theoretically highlight the roles of resource dependence theory and agency theory in enhancing CSRD quality.

We analyze the impact of Small Blockholders' (SBH-with 5% to 10% of voting rights) heterogeneity and their access to private information on the demand for audit services. By promoting enhanced audit services, we expect SBH to have a moderating effect on the relation between Large Blockholders (LBH-more than 10% of voting rights) and audit fees in a context of low shareholder protection. Drawn on Swiss public firm data over the 2002-2019 period, our results show that the presence of SBH flattens the concave relation between ownership concentration and audit fees found in prior studies. This moderating effect is mainly driven by the uninformed SBH, who given their lower-compared with informed SBH-access to private channels of information, are more likely to rely on audited public financial statements. Our findings contribute to the literature on the role of SBH in the company's corporate governance. (c) 2022 European Accounting Association.
