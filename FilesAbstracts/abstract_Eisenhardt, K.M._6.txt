Agency theory argues that shareholder interests require protection by separation of incumbency of roles of board chair and CEO. Stewardship theory argues shareholder interests are maximised by shared incumbency of these roles. Results of an empirical test fail to support agency theory and provide some support for stewardship theory. (c) 1991, Association for Clinical Biochemistry. All rights reserved.

This article analyzes the role of top management as a key resource in obtaining sustained, competitive advantage for thefirm. The nature of managerial skills is examined and linked to isolating mechanisms and firm rents. The article aims to refocus attention on the importance of managerial expertise as a rent-generating firm resource and implies greater alignment of top management-shareholder interests than in many applications of agency theory to the firm.

This research examines the relationship between ownership structure and financial performance in the context of the agency theory. It improves upon previous research by presenting an improved risk-adjusted performance measure, by using a larger sample size than prior work and also by controlling for firm size differences. The results suggest that ownership is significantly related to firm financial performance even after controlling for size. Copyright (c) 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines the role of the straight-commissioned salesperson in the context of agency theory and asserts that because the agent acts to benefit two principals, potential conflicts of interest arise. Temporal differences in receipt of rewards create a major conflict, while the firm's exhibition of both espoused and actual behaviors and information asymmetries intensify this conflict. Finally, in light of these inconsistencies, the ethical implications of the straight-commission compensation system are examined. (c) 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Taking agency theory and stakeholder theory as points of departure, this article proposes a paradigm that helps explain the following: (1) certain aspects of a firm's strategic behaviour; (2) the structure of management-stakeholder contracts; (3) the form taken by the institutional structures that monitor and enforce contracts between managers and other stakeholders; and (4) the evolutionary process that shapes both management-stakeholder contracts and the institutional structures that police those contracts.

The literature applying agency theory to management has focused on the performance advantages to be gained when ownership and control of the firm are aligned. This article investigates that premise by comparing family-owned and -managed and professionally managed firms. The article presents the results of a field survey that examined the extent to which family-owned and -managed firms differ across structural, process, and performance dimensions from their professionally managed counterparts. Significant differences exist between these two groups on both structural and process dimensions, and there is evidence that family-owned and -managed firms exhibit performance advantages as a result of the unification of ownership and control.

Vertical integration is a fundamental corporate strategy of interest to the fields of strategic management and organizational economics. This paper synthesizes theoretical arguments and empirical findings from this literature to identify the underlying advantages and disadvantages of choosing vertical financial ownership relative to vertical contracts. It then suggests that in the absence of agency and transaction costs, vertical financial ownership and vertical contracting are equivalent governance structures for achieving corporate objectives. However, given a world of positive agency and transaction costs, the key theoretic question then becomes predicting when market mechanisms are sufficient, when intermediate forms of vertical contracting become necessary, and when vertical financial ownership becomes the preferred governance structure. The concluding section of the paper provides a framework for making this analysis based on a synthesis of agency and transaction costs perspectives. Copyright (c) 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Many small firms in Sweden are characterized by a lack of equity capital. For several years measures to increase the equity capital have been discussed. In this discussion the private investors' market has received virtually no attention. This study presents some preliminary results of the private investors in Sweden. The research in small firms financing is characterized by a lack of theoretical framework. One basic assumption in the study is that agency theory can provide an essential framework to explain the interaction between the private investor and entrepreneur. Twenty-five hypotheses generated from agency theory are formulated and tested on 62 small unlisted firms in Sweden. Multiple regression analysis is used for the causal analyses. The empirical results in the study show inter alia that the geographic distance and the private investor's knowledge about the portfolio firm's transformation process seem to be the most influential factors for determining the private investor's involvement in the portfolio firms. It is also interesting to notice that none of the variables, frequency of contacts and the private investor's operational work in the portfolio firm affect the performance of the firm. Contrary to conventional wisdom, private investors do not add value to their portfolio firms through their interaction with the entrepreneurs. The theoretical conclusion is that agency theory does not provide any satisfactory framework to explain the private investor -entrepreneur relationship. Some of the basic assumptions in agency theory seem to be invalid. A model for the relationship between private investors and entrepreneurs is developed in which four interaction strategies are identified. The model gives implications on two levels: the portfolio level and the individual case level. (c) 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Recently, economists have directed attention to the phenomenon of organization. An important difference between the newly developed economic theories of organization, such as for example agency theory, and sociological theories of organization is the fact that economists explicitly employ an individual utility maximization assumption. In this paper, it is reasoned that this assumption, if used as in agency theory, entails logical inconsistencies if we try to explain the existence of the kind of agreements that purportedly form the basis of organiza tions. However, if the condition of uncertainty to which agency theorists merely pay lip service is taken seriously, the observed inconsistencies can be reconciled. A classificatory scheme of four 'sources of obligation' is proposed for the analysis of the basis of agreements. Taking all four sources into consideration in the analysis of organizational agreements can help to avoid one-sided attention to, for example, formal, legally enforceable agreements. The findings of empirical research suggest that two basic dimensions lie at the root of the proposed classifi catory scheme. Further research is needed to check this supposition and its implications.

This paper tests competing theoretical explanations for the passage of corporate charter antitakeover amendments. The managerial entrenchment hypothesis suggests that antitakeover amendments are adopted by incumbent management to obtain job security at stockholders' expense. An alternative hypothesis is that antitakeover amendments are proposed in order to enable the management of the target firm to extract a higher price from the bidding firm and thereby benefit stockholders. Our event study from a sample of 409 firms that adopted antitakeover amendments in the 1974-88 period indicates a strongly negative effect on stockholder wealth, in support of the managerial entrenchment hypothesis that antitakeover amendments are adopted by managers at the expense of stockholders.

The extensive MS/OR literature on sales force compensation in marketing has attacked a great variety of problems facing sales managers, including how to set commission rates, whether to delegate pricing authority to a sales force, what mix of salary and incentive compensation to provide to the sales force, whether or not to offer a menu of compensation plans, and how to elicit valuable information from salespeople about their utility functions and sales response functions. In the case of theoretical models, some predictions have been tested statistically, but these tests have been incomplete and, in some cases, inconclusive. Based on available empirical results, one cannot reject agency theory as a useful paradigm for compensation-setting, but further research is necessary to increase the level of confidence in the theory and its predictions. On the decision support system (DSS) front, few diagnostics have been presented for the models described in the literature, although those presented suggest the usefulness of the approach as well.

The utility of the contract model is illustrated empirically using a large data set on organizations and their employees in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing industries. The results are consistent with many transaction cost and agency theory predictions, though they also indicate the need to supplement these economic theories with sociological explanations based on political, cultural, and other institutional differences.

The objective of this study is to examine the effects of control system characteristics and perceived environmental uncertainty on the relative use of performance-contingent compensation. The results, based on a survey of division managers, indicate that monitoring ability is negatively associated with the use of performance-contingent compensation. In addition, monitoring is found to moderate the relationship between uncertainty and compensation system design. Whereas in non-monitoring firms, higher levels of uncertainty are associated with increased use of performance-contingent compensation, in monitoring firms, higher levels of uncertainty are associated with decreased use of performance-contingent compensation. These results support agency theory arguments that compensation structure is determined at least in part by concerns for economic efficiency. (c) 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Research into the behaviour, management and control of distribution channels has traditionally relied on behavioural frameworks of analysis. Agency theory offers a different but complementary perspective and by integrating behavioural concepts within the framework of agency theory, analytic approaches can be developed which explicitly acknowledge the importance of power within hierarchical relationships. The case of distribution channels for cars in Turkey is used to provide an illustration of the issues relating to power and control within a vertically quasi-integrated distribution system.

The board of directors has been identified as a key internal control mechanism for setting CEO compensation. Theory suggests that CEOs will attempt to circumvent board control in an effort to maximize salary. This hypothesis was tested using a sample of 193 firms in a cross-section of industries. Corporate governance literature was reviewed to develop a multiple indicator measure of board control. Although, as hypothesized, CEO salaries were greater in firms with lower levels of control, CEO compensation was not significantly related to firm size or profitability.

Recent research and public discourse on executive compensation and corporate governance suggests a growing consensus that firms can and should increase their control over top managers by increasing the use of managerial incentives and monitoring by boards of directors. This study departs from this consensus by offering an alternative perspective that considers not only the benefits, but also the costs of both incentives and monitoring in large corporations. The study develops and tests a contingency cost/benefit perspective on governance decisions as resource allocation decisions, proposing how and why the observed levels of managerial incentives and monitoring may vary across organizations and across time. Specifically, the study suggests that: (1) firms that are more risky face greater costs when using incentive compensation contracts for top managers, thus reducing the expected level of incentive compensation use for such firms; (2) firms facing this problem of low incentive compensation use can realize greater benefits from higher levels of board monitoring, and thus are likely to rely more on board monitoring; and (3) firms with more complex comporate strategies face higher costs in using board monitoring, and are thus likely to rely less on board monitoring as a source of controlling top management behavior. The study also proposes that within this contingency perspective there may be diminishing 'behavioral returns' to increases in monitoring and incentives. These hypotheses are tested using extensive longitudinal data from over 400 of the largest U.S. corporations. The supportive findings suggest that maximal levels of incentives and monitoring are not necessarily optimal, and that a firm's strategy may not only have significant product/market implications, but also corporate governance implications.

This paper evaluates agency theory as a theory of performance outcome. Agency theory attributes uncertainty in performance outcomes to moral hazard, adverse selection and the state of nature. This paper argues that by overlooking two critical sources of outcome uncertainty in organizations -- incomplete knowledge about the effort-outcome relationship and lack of agreement about effort and outcome -- the generalizability of the theory is strictly limited. Even in such settings where it is generalizable, principal-agent approaches to contract design are unrealistic to the extent that they presume that performance in organizations results exclusively from individual-contributor jobs, exagger ate the degree to which individuals are work-averse, and emphasize the quant ity of effort at the expense of the quality and type of effort. As a theory of performance, principal-agent approaches overstate the importance of opera tional effort and ignore the importance of facilitative effort such as team work. (c) 1994, Sage Publications.

Using data from 192 firms in 12 industries, both the direction and magnitude of the duality-performance relationship was found to vary systematically across Dess and Beard's (1984) environmental dimensions. These results provide partial support for both agency and stewardship perspectives. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this paper we argue that unobservable constructs lie at the core of a number of influential theories used in the strategic management literature--including agency theory, transaction cost theory, and the resource-based view of the firm. The debate over how best to deal with the problem of unobservables has raged in the philosophy of science literature for the best part of the current century. On the one hand, there are the positivists, who believe that theories containing unobservable constructs are only useful as tools for making predictions. According to positivists, such theories do not inform us about the deep structure of reality. On the other hand, there are the realists, who believe that our theories can give us knowledge about unobservables. Herein we review this debate, we argue for adopting a realist position, and we draw out the implications for strategic management research. Copyright (c) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Critics have argued that the field of information systems (IS) lacks a coherent theoretical framework. This paper attempts to further the theoretical development of a critical and pervasive contemporary phenomenon, outsourcing of IS functions, by synthesizing four theoretical models (resource-based theory, resource-dependence theory, transaction cost theory and agency theory) that are useful for understanding determinants of a firm's outsourcing strategy. From these theoretical models, a contingency model of outsourcing is developed which can be used to direct empirical research. (c) 1995, Palgrave Publishing. All Rights Reserved.

Couched in positive agency theory, it is shown that the straight-commission compensation system (SCCS) creates a conflict of interest between the agent's and the client's self-interests. Based on this, it is hypothesized that the SCCS will encourage agents to intend to act unethically towards their clients. Two hundred and forty five insurance agents in the U.S. were surveyed, with 59% responding. The results suggest that the SCCS does not significantly affect agents' ethical intentions, positively or negatively. This lack of empirical evidence may be due to the unique nature of the sample. Indeed, the company which enabled this sample appears to have found a practical solution to temper the potential negative effects of the SCCS in its commitment to selective hiring and marketing products which benefit both the client and the agent.

The recent marketing literature reflects a growing interest in relationship management issues. In particular, several recent studies have drawn on transaction cost and agency theory to examine how interfirm relationships are organized. The general premise is that explicit control mechanisms must be deployed in a relationship to manage a partner's potential opportunism. Although previous research has shown that different mechanisms can be used, the tendency has been to examine individual mechanisms in isolation. The authors develop hypotheses about interdependencies between different control mechanisms. They also identify some of the contextual factors that influence their use. The framework is tested empirically by examining how chemical manufacturers organize their supplier relationships. The results generally support the hypothesis that firms' choices among control mechanisms are influenced by contextual factors. Only limited support is found for the hypothesis that interdependencies exist between different mechanisms.

This paper examines the influence of competitive strategy on the relationship between suppliers and their distribution networks. Drawing on agency theory, hypotheses are developed specifying the appropriate match between manufacturer strategies and systems of control within distribution channels. Cluster analysis is used to show distinct differences in channel management and structure for the three generic strategies of cost leadership, differentiation and focus. Results suggest that variation in control relationships may be explained by the demands posed by manufacturers' competitive strategies. This study therefore extends the applicability of Porter's typology to the specific structure of distribution channels and shows that agency theory can provide insights into the economic basis of interorganizational relationships.

This study used a sample of middle-level managers to investigate the effects of organization-level agency-theory-based variables on the proportion of variable compensation that managers receive. Level of task programmability was associated with an increased use of variable pay, and long-term relationships between an agent and principal were associated with decreased use. Results supported the classical organizationtheory prediction that under higher risk, organizations use higher proportions of variable pay; but results question agency theory's ability to predict compensation strategy for middle-level managers in the high-risk situation.

The study of capital structure has increasingly gained importance in strategic management research. Paradigms derived from organizational economics have also gained popularity in explaining firm actions. Agency theory and transaction cost economics represent two such paradigms that rely on the notion of market imperfections. Notwithstanding the similarities between them, these two offer different explanations of the role of debt and equity in a firm. The governance abilities of the financing structures and the nature of assets of the firm provide two key sources of differences. Viewing capital structure from transaction cost economics gives rise to predictions that are contradictory to those presented by agency theory. It is argued that the extant evidence mainly supports the transaction cost viewpoint. Two organizational phenomena - leveraged buyouts and product diversification - are used to highlight the comparison.

Within many categories of consumer products, manufacturers differ markedly in how intensively they distribute their brands among retailers. The authors enhance understanding of why such differences in distribution intensity occur. Literature in the marketing and economics disciplines on brand and channel management, agency theory, and credible commitments, combined with extensive field interviews, provides the foundation for a conceptual framework that centers on proposed moderator effects. Data collected from manufacturers in the consumer electronics industry are used to test the conceptual framework. Credible commitments by retailers in the form of contractual agreements and investments are shown to moderate the relationships of manufacturer brand strategy and channel practices with distribution intensity.

For innovators and entrepreneurs in service businesses, franchising is frequently suggested as a way to succeed and grow. Academic research has provided little guidance for potential franchisors, however. This article provides a model to guide that choice of organizational form using results from agency theory. Analytically, franchising is a way to allocate decisions within the franchise system between the franchisor and the franchisee in order to promote efficiency and provide incentives. Franchisees make decisions regarding local operations, such as hours, prices, and locations, because they have the knowledge about local trading conditions. Franchisors make decisions regarding the product, its production, and associated marketing efforts that together create the standardization that the trademark signals. The revenue of franchise systems is divided to provide incentives to each party to support the allocation of decisions. Franchisors receive a percentage of gross sales, typically 5%, to compensate them for use of the trademark and associated services. Franchisees keep the unit's profits after paying royalties. These profits motivate the franchisee to make the good decisions that operate the unit efficiently. But franchising has limitations as well. First, by making franchisees invest in a unit in a specific geographic area, the franchise system exposes the franchisees to business risk; it consists of local economic conditions beyond franchisees' control that could reduce or eliminate their capital. That risk could be eliminated by owning a geographically diversified portfolio of shares of units in different places, but then incentives are weakened. Second, the requirements of standardization under the common trademark constrain franchisees from the full use of their human capital, including their knowledge of local conditions. Some adaptations to the local market are prohibited by the requirement of standardization. So high levels of either business risk or human capital in an industry make franchising a less desirable choice of organizational form. These ideas are tested with interindustry data using an econometric discrete choice model on the share of sales through franchise systems (termed organizational form share). The methodology is identical to market share models used in economics and marketing. Business risk, as measured by percent of units that have failed in the industry in the last 3 years, and human capital required in the industry, as measured by average wages paid, both negatively influence the share of sales through franchise systems. The model can be applied by entrepreneurs considering franchising, especially in industries not traditionally associated with franchising. Using public data sources identified in the study, a prospective franchisor can research the industry to determine if industry conditions support franchising as the optimal choice of organizational form. The empirical tests also suggest a second managerially relevant conclusion: the decision of "should we franchise?" can be and should be separated from the decision of "how do we implement franchising?" Factors previously shown to influence the implementation of franchising, the degree of ownership of units within the system, do not influence organizational form share, thus suggesting that the strategic decision of whether to franchise is distinct from the operating decision of how to implement franchising.

Variability in employment levels, particularly when resulting from downsizing and layoffs, has considerable consequences for employees and organizations. Applying strategic compensation and agency theory principles to multiple years of employment, financial performance, and managerial compensation data on 152 organizations, we found that compensation design was related to employment variability through two avenues. First, organizations relying more heavily on long-term compensation incentives for managers exhibited less employment variability. Second, when groups of employees were covered by variable pay plans, their employment variability was lower.

Most current writers on strategic control, whether from the rational planning or processual schools, agree on the importance of dialogue and debate between the interested parties to the control process. This is particularly so when strategic control is regarded in a 'warning bell' sense, responding to a signal that all is not going according to plan, rather than as a behavioural constraint or as an element of agency theory practice. This paper advances a normative framework for ensuring the effectiveness of such discussions based on Bird's notion of a 'good conversation'. Bird argued that the discussion of business ethical problems should be vocal, reciprocating, issues-oriented, rational, imaginative, and honest. It is argued here that these characteristics should also apply to the discussions within the strategic control process if the process is not to be dysfunctional.

This article, first, synthesizes three theoretical approaches to salesforce control systems and, second, examines the effect of the control mechanisms on key consequence variables. More specifically, the manuscript develops a comprehensive model of salesforce control by integrating key constructs from three alternative theories: organization theory, agency theory, and transaction cost analysis. The constructs are (1) outcome observability from organization theory, (2) behavior observability from agency theory, (3) transaction-specific assets (TSA) from transaction cost analysis, and (4) task programmability or environmental task uncertainty, a key construct in all three theories. In addition, the study examines the effects of controls on certain consequence variables: salesperson-customer relationships and salespersons' motivation and organizational commitment.

This research note reports results of a laboratory experiment conducted as a follow-up investigation of an earlier study by Umanath, Ray and Campbell (1993). Here, we focus on a specific unexpected result of Umanath et al. who found evidence contradicting the theoretical prediction with respect to the impact of environmental uncertainty on the composition of compensation contracts. Umanath et al., in retrospect, offered an explanation for their unexpected finding based on an alternative theory under the same agency framework. Our results not only ratify the alternative explanation offered by Umanath et al., but also identify information symmetry / asymmetry as the contingent factor capable of reconciling the apparently contradicting predictions of the two agency-based theories used in this research.

Innovation in complex engineering projects is hampered by information asymmetries which attend joint problem solving by owners and external organizations. This uncertainty creates additional informational asymmetries between owners and firms engaged in designing, building, and supplying projects. Industrial marketing suggests that overcoming these asymmetries is easier when owners are knowledgeable and part of the design process. We examine whether the same proposition holds for innovation in complex engineering projects. We focus on the relationship between innovativeness of complex engineering projects and internal owner capabilities. We test hypotheses derived from agency and organization theories of innovation. Our results indicate that projects where owners have internal capabilities are generally less innovative than projects where owners lack internal capabilities.

In recent years, agency theory has substantially influenced research on corporate governance. Organizational sociologists have critiqued the agency theory model of boards as limited and have studied how the functioning of boards is shaped by structural, political, and cognitive contexts. Building on their work, this paper empirically studies the cultural embeddedness of boards in a nonprofit organization called Medlay. It shows how organizational identity - the members' shared beliefs about the central, enduring, and distinctive characteristics of the organization - influences the construction and enactment of the director's role and shapes interactions among board members and managers. The findings demonstrate that the role of the director is shaped by Medlay's Janus-faced identity, as both a volunteer-driven organization and a family of friends; directors see themselves as vigilant monitors and as friendly, supportive colleagues. The findings also portray how some board members' scrutiny of the budget, including "lavish" travel expenditures, surfaces the contradictions in Medlay's identity, and creates conflicts for directors. Should board members take managers to task and thereby exercise vigilance and uphold the ideal of volunteer control, or should they safeguard the principle of friendship and avoid all conflict? An influential subset of directors and top managers resolved the budget issue and preserved Medlay's identity by using different "face-saving" strategies to make directors feel that they had been vigilant, and to affirm sentiments of cooperation. More generally, this study extends the literature on corporate governance by showing how organizational identity influences the construction and enactment of the director's role. It introduces the idea of "conflicts of commitment," a form of intra-role conflict that arises when directors are besieged by conflicting aspects of the organization's identity. When actions occur that breach the expected role performance of board members, latent contradictions in the organizational identity emerge, and directors are faced with the conflict of upholding one dimension of identity while undermining the other. The study also contributes to research on organizational identity by proposing a model of how organizational and individual identities shape the board role through the processes of identification and action, and how a hybrid identity generates the potential for intra-role conflict.

Previous empirical studies of top managers tend to draw from either positive agency theory or strategic leadership theory. This manuscript reviews and critiques these two approaches, outlining their advantages and inherent limitations. Because each is inherently limited, we suggest that developments in personality theory, transformational leadership theory, and visionary leadership theory can contribute to a more realistic view of top managers. Consequently, we contrast these three alternative perspectives with the two more dominant approaches in this manuscript. As a result, we identify future research directions for scholars interested in studying strategic leadership. (c) 1997 JAI Press Inc. All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

This study examines the performance implications of the fit between strategic orientations and incentive plan characteristics. Research hypotheses are based on a framework that draws upon managerial discretion and agency theories to identify the links between firm strategy, managerial motivation and control, managerial risk-bearing, and incentive plan characteristics. A pooled cross-sectional, time series research design is used to test hypotheses in a sample of 50 electric utility firms. Consistent with theory, results indicate that annual bonus plans that use cash incentives and accounting measures of performance lead to better performance among firms with Defender strategic orientations. In contrast, firms with Prospector strategic orientations realize performance benefits when they adopt stock-based incentive plans and use market measures to evaluate managerial performance.

Firms exporting via foreign channel intermediaries, such as import agents or distributors, trade off a lack of control of the foreign channel for a low-risk market entry. Agency theory and transaction cost analysis suggest that a lack of control manifests itself in the foreign channel intermediary (FCI) having opportunities to behave in its own interests, rather than those of the exporter. Even so, management strategies that result in an alignment of the exporter's and FCI's goals are more likely to result in a perception of satisfaction in the relationship than if only one party's goals were met. Such management strategies should commence with an extensive precontractual screening step to find an intermediary whose goals are complementary to those of the exporter. After forming a trading relationship, an exporter can better coordinate the relationship by noncoercive monitoring of the exporter, and reduce the potential for opportunistic behavior and achieve a relationship that performs to the satisfaction to both parties. Greater monitoring is also likely to maintain a state of goal congruence between the parties. Conditions of environmental uncertainty may, however, create difficulties in precontractual screening by the exporter. A conceptual framework explaining the interaction between these variables has been presented, along with nine testable propositions and directions for future research.

There has been a steady increase in the amount of research and theorising in the area of interorganisational research, especially with regard to buyer-seller arrangements in marketing channels (Andersen and Narus 1990, Bergen et.al., 1992, Boyle et.al., 1992). Alternative interorganisational governance models, such as joint ventures, strategic alliances, and sole-sourcing are the reality of modern business management (Borys and Jemison 1989, Buckley and Casson 1988), and so interfirm governance has become a strategic management issue. The much-cited work of Porter (1985, 1991) has focused on the optimal linkage of interfirm activities, and regards the planning and governance of interfirm relations as an important competitive strategic issue, a point reiterated by Heide (1994). The issue of channel relationships has been one of concern for both practitioners and academics, and theories such as those of transaction cost analysis (TCA), agency theory, and relational norms have on the one hand shed much light on the problems, and on the other provided a fruitful backdrop to much empirical research. Less attention has been given to the effects of time on these notions, both in the literature and in empirical research. In this article we provide an overview of the theories, and attempt an integration. The purpose of this article is to focus on transaction cost economics (TCE) and relational exchange theory to provide an overview of the areas of interorganisational research where relationships play a role. A number of areas where the theories diverge and converge are outlined. More importantly, we endeavour to bring the effects of time into consideration, and to develop propositions for further research. (c) 1997, MCB UP Limited

Cooperative organizational forms such as franchising and joint venturing have long been popularamong hospitality chains. However, not all chains use cooperative organizational forms and those that do varygreatlyin theirproclivityto use them. One possible explanation for this variation is that when a chain confronts critical resource scarcities, its managers will use cooperative organization in order to build upon the resources of their partners. However a second approach, agency theory, suggests that chain managers use cooperative organization to minimize the costs of monitor ing outlet managers. Using data on 94 restaurant chains, hypotheses are tested that investigate the independent and joint efficacy of these explanations. Results show that capital and brand name are important resources affecting the choice of organizational form whereas geographic dispersion, task programmability, and asset specificity are key agency variables. Overall, perhaps the key finding is that the ability of agency theory to explain organizational form is diminished among resource scarce chains. The results, therefore, suggest that both perspectives are needed to fully explain the choice of organizational form. (c) 1997 THE COUNCIL ON HOTEL, RESTAURANT AND INSTITUTIONAL EDUCATION.

The agency framework is a general formulation of a stylized relationship between two parties, the principal and the agent, where the principal wants the agent to supply a productive input. However, due to information asymmetries, the relationship is not frictionless. In the case of investments, the agent may use the information asymmetries to produce investment myopia in an attempt to boost the agent'smarket value or otherwise to further his/her own interests. Throughout the literature review, a simplified model is used to capture the information asymmetry leading to bias. Critical drivers, as well as main and ancillary results, are tabulated and discussed. Suggestions of testable hypotheses and managerial implications are provided. As a general conclusion, the theoretical case of investment bias within the agency framework appears to have reached a state of maturity, spanning a number of issues and possible real-world situations. Thus, it seems more and more timely to develop an integrated and general formulation of the problem at hand, a formulation that captures the fundamental economic properties in a stable and convincing fashion, rather than to pursue further variations of assumptions which, in the models, sometimes are of a partial and ad hoc nature. To that end, four possible fundamental investment bias drivers have been suggested: 1. Several input factors that are unobservable to the principal, through 'signal jamming', create a potential for investment bias. 2. Limited possibilities of risk spreading of human capital, together with managerial risk-aversion, affect investment bias. The information asymmetries of the investment models are primarily grouped into hidden action and private information. 3. Chain effects of exogenous frictions in capital markets may induce investment bias. 4. Non-verifiabilities of critical information pose problems of incentive and bias, particularly with innovative output. At a greater level of generality, the investment bias problem revolves around the well-known market failure problems: imperfect and incomplete markets. However, it can be shown that the very foundation of received capital budgeting theory since Fisher (1930) o the Separation Theorem o rests precisely on the assumption of perfect and complete markets. The Separation Theorem in turn provides the theoretical foundation of the received managerial implication: use the discounted cash flow method. Since the agency theory offers an intra-theoretical rationale for questioning the validity of the Separation Theorem, agency theory promises new perspectives on a dominant finding in empirical studies on the administrative use of capital budgeting methods o namely, the limited role of the methods for reaching administrative decisions. Traditionally, this finding has been related to weaker forms of economic rationality (e.g. bounded rationality) and the impact of uncertainty. However, with agency theory there is no need to shift theoretical focus and the finding can instead be related to the impact of information asymmetries. Thus, there is a potential scope for agency theory in both empirical and managerial settings. This potential can hardly be realized by trying to apply specific models to administrative problems, but rather by using the theory as a general framework in which economic trade-offs and information asymmetries in organizational structures and processes are illuminated. Developing the framework into an analytical and useful tool formanagement seems a fruitful research objective, since the positive nature of economics in general suggests a practical role for the agency framework also in this field o the economics of management, and the economics of investment management in particular.(c)Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997.

The best opportunity for growth is often overseas, even for smaller entrepreneurial firms. However, resource-constrained smaller firms do not have as many available entry strategies as larger multinational corporations (MNCs). Smaller firms frequently must ally themselves with partners in order to make international expansion feasible (i.e., employing an export agent, licensing, joint venture, or strategic alliance). The alliance of two distinct parties central to these entry strategies lends itself to an agency theory perspective. Agency theory illuminates the underpinnings of these relationships, in particular highlighting the problems and risks that the entrepreneur faces when entering into the partnership. These problems arise from information asymmetry (each party is privy to knowledge that the other isn't). This article develops these problems within the entrepreneur/ export agent realm and suggests that government assistance can reduce these problems. Specifically, government assistance reduces verification and monitoring costs. The article proposes that those firms that take advantage of governmental information and assistance will more likely enter foreign countries successfully. (c) 1997 Taylor & Francis.

Total quality management (TQM) has received considerable attention as a way to increase both the effectiveness and the efficiency of corporations (Bounds et. al., 1994; Grant, Shani and Krisnan 1994; Olian and Rynes 1991; Powell 1995; Ross 1993). Concerned primarily with the delivery of customer satisfaction, the proponents of quality and/or TQM (Deming 1986; Juran 1992; and Crosby 1979) have developed principles and procedures for achieving total quality and meeting multiple corporate goals. Empirical evidence regarding outcomes is mixed; success and failure case studies abound, statistical methodologies are questioned, and more rigorous empirical studies present some positive findings (Powell 1995). Some maintain that the reasons for the failure of TQM systems is incompatibility between existing Western management thought which is grounded in economic models, and the TQM paradigm, which evolved from statistical theory, and has its own set of assumptions (Grant, Shani and Krisnan 1994). Despite such mixed empirical results, TQM continues to be promoted and implemented. This is the beginning point for our examination of TQM. The TQ management paradigm is practiced in economically and culturally diverse environments, including those which embrace an economic perspective, complete with maximisation of shareholder wealth, self-interest, rational decision makers, separation of ownership, and agency costs (Grant, Shani and Krishnan 1994).

Firms' boundary choices have undergone careful examination in recent years, particularly in information services. While transaction cost economics provides a widely tested explanation for boundary choice, more recent theoretical work advances competing knowledge-based and measurement cost explanations. Similar to transaction cost economics, these theories examine the impact of exchange attributes on the performance of markets and hierarchies as institutions of governance. These theories, however, offer alternative attributes to those suggested by transaction cost economics or offer alternative mechanisms through which similar attributes influence make-buy choices. Traditional empirical specifications of make-buy models are unable to comparatively test among these alternative theories. By developing and testing a model of comparative institutional performance rather than institutional choice, we examine the degree of support for these competing explanations of boundary choice. Hypotheses are tested using data on the governance of nine information services at 152 companies. Our results suggest that a theory of the firm and a theory of boundary choice is likely to be complex, requiring integration of transaction cost, knowledge-based, and measurement reasoning.

Extant research examining the relationship between a firm's board and its CEO's compensation has focused primarily on the composition of the board-at-large. However, it may be the nature of the compensation committee, not the board as a whole, that is at issue. This study was a longitudinal assessment of the relationship between the composition of a firm's compensation committee and multiple measurements of CEO compensation. We found no evidence that "captured" directors led to greater levels of, or changes in, CEO compensation. These findings may suggest the consideration of theories other than agency theory as explanations for the continued focus on board independence.

Amihud and Lev (1981) are widely cited as providing evidence that managers, unless closely monitored by large block shareholders, will attempt to reduce their employment risk through unrelated mergers and diversification. These corporate strategies, however, may not be in shareholders' interests. Reconsidering the agency assumptions underlying Amihud and Lev's study and the methodology they used, we develop hypotheses regarding the association between ownership structure, board vigilance, corporate strategy, and corporate performance from management theory and test them using Amihud and Lev's data from the 1960s and new data from the 1980s. Neither study supports the conclusions of Amihud and Lev, nor the agency theory belief that monitoring efforts by principals affect the strategic behaviors of agents or the performance of firms that they manage.

The results of this research demonstrate that boards of directors in venture-capital backed companies are more involved in both strategy formation and evaluation than are boards where members do not have large ownership stakes. These same results are demonstrated even when industry, board size, level of diversification, and insider board representation are held constant. Agency theory and institutional theory are advanced as reasons for this higher level of involvement. Venture capitalists are generally seen as value-added investors who have played a significant role in the development of many entrepreneurial businesses (Bygrave and Timmons 1992). This success has lead students of industrial competitiveness like Thurow (1992) to argue that the venture capitalist should serve as an example for directors of all types of organizations. One of the most significant value-added activities of the venture capitalist is involvement with strategy (Fried and Hisrich 1995; MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian 1988; Sapienza 1989, Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir 1996; Rosenstein, Bruno, Bygrave, and Taylor 1993). Implicit in the writings extolling directors who act like venture capitalists (Porter 1992a, 1992b; Bhide 1994; Thurow 1992) is the belief that they will be more active than traditional board members. However, little empirical work has been done to directly compare the level of strategic involvement of the two types of boards. Building on the work of Judge and Zeithaml (1992), this study compares the level of board involvement with strategy by the boards of venture capital-backed companies with the boards of other types of organizations. After establishing different levels of involvement, it then examines why there is a difference. Finally, this study provides additional empirical evidence on the relationship between board involvement and performance (Zahra and Pearce 1989). (c) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

This paper examines the link between a firm's resources and its efficient organization form with a focus on entrepreneurial resources. Entrepreneurial resources are defined as the propensity of an individual to behave creatively, act with foresight, use intuition, and be alert to new opportunities. This paper assumes that these entrepreneurial resources can be distributed in two ways throughout the firm: they can be held by one or a few individuals-"individual entrepreneurial resources" - or they can be dispersed among a team of individuals - "team entrepreneurial resources." Agency theory is used to consider how various organizational characteristics - such as the assignment of decision responsibilities, incentives and risk bearing, the number of hierarchical levels, horizontal linking structures, mutual monitoring and bonding devices, and information systems - will differ in the individual and team entrepreneurial forms. Generally, the individual entrepreneurial form resembles the "classic entrepreneurial firm" (Fama and Jensen 1983) in which various decision making roles and risk bearing are performed by a single entrepreneur. The team entrepreneurial form is similar to what Bartlett and Ghoshal (1993) call "beyond the m-form." Responsibility for steps in the decision process is dispersed in the team form, and monitoring the decision process will occur at the organization's apex. The CEO will not make operational or strategic decisions; instead, he manages the internal market for managers and develops an organization's cultural context and information systems. Below the CEO level, team entrepreneurs are responsible for ratifying innovative decisions, and below this team entrepreneurs are responsible for initiating innovative decisions. After presenting these two entrepreneurial forms, this paper relates them to extant research on corporate entrepreneurship and organizational forms.

Much debate has been generated about whether privatization tends to enhance firm financial performance. The research presented here seeks to identify the strategic choices that differentiated firms with superior post-privatization performance from those with inferior post-privatization performance. Using agency theory as a theoretical foundation, it is hypothesized that superior post-privatization firm performance will be associated with (1) the government not retaining a significant stock holding, (2) changes in leadership, (3) management stock options being initiated, (4) employee head count being reduced and (5) the company being restructured financially. The sample draws from 41 privatized firms from six industry classifications and 15 countries. To accommodate comparisons of small subsamples, non-parametric statistical methods are used. Controlling for size, industry and country (economic/regulatory effects), the hypotheses are generally supported except for the one relating to headcount.

Agency theorists argue that organizations typically get little value from using employees and that they should instead use nonemployees operating fully as residual claimants. Yet, even in a context where those theorists would predict virtually no employees - taxicab organizations - they are common. What drives the use of employment relationships in these organizations? The authors show how employment relationships are linked to firm capabilities and strategic opportunities in a sample of taxicab organizations, relying on arguments about the linkage of employment to the internal liquidity of labor, organizational routines, and internal cooperation. The theoretical arguments and findings suggest what organizations gain by having employment relationships and show that integrating the agency theoretic argument with the other theoretical arguments leads toward a resource-based view of strategy and human resources. The authors highlight the importance of embedding arguments on the internal management of human resources in the strategic and competitive context in which organizations operate. Their arguments also have implications for the resource-based approach to strategy in mapping the resource space of human assets in organizations and, within that space, directing attention to how organizations gain sustainable competitive advantage through managing human resources.

The authors describe the pharmaceutical utilization system and present the conceptual framework for agency theory. They then apply agency theory to the selection of pharmaceuticals and the role of drug formularies in drug selection. The use of drug formularies can increase the goal conflict and uncertainty related to the selection of drug products. The authors address public policy and research directions to suggest ways of reducing the level of goal conflict and uncertainty associated with drug selection. Recognition of agency relationships and the environment surrounding agency relationships appear to be important for the development and analysis of future policy regarding selection decisions pertaining to pharmaceuticals.

This paper tests the principal-agent theory in the context of contracting practices for the development of large-scale engineering projects. Five hypotheses are derived from the principal-agent theory regarding the propensity to use behaviour-based contracts versus outcome-based contracts function of the project owner's risk aversion and monitoring competencies, of the goal congruence between principal and agent, of the agent's risk aversion, and of the technological innovation required by the project. A sixth hypothesis states that more successful projects are more in line with the predictions of the first five hypotheses. All hypotheses are translated into testable propositions specific to large-scale engineering projects. For instance, outcome-based contracts are assimilated to fixed-price contracts such as turnkey and EPC. Results based on a sample of 60 power plant projects confirm that participants tend to select contracts as the principal agent theory predicts. Moreover, contracts used in successful projects follow more accurately the theoretical predictions.

We investigate the influence of the composition of the board of directors and stock ownership patterns on the decision to enter markets in Central and Eastern Europe. Our findings suggest that board composition alone does not influence the entry decision while firms with less concentrated stock ownership were more likely to enter these developing markets. We also found that while better performing firms were attracted to opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe, firms with poor prior performance and outside dominated boards were also more likely to enter these markets.

The development of the field of strategic management within the last two decades has been dramatic. While its roots have been in a more applied area, often referred to as business policy, the current field of strategic management is strongly theory based, with substantial empirical research, and is eclectic in nature. This review of the development of the field and its current position examines the field's early development and the primary theoretical and methodological bases through its history. Early developments include Chandler's (1962) Strategy and Structure and Ansoff's (1965) Corporate Strategy. These early works took on a contingency perspective (fit between strategy and structure) and a resource-based framework emphasizing internal strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps, one of the more significant contributions to the development of strategic management came from industrial organization (IO) economics, specifically the work of Michael Porter. The structure-conduct-performance framework and the notion of strategic groups, as well as providing a foundation for research on competitive dynamics, are flourishing currently. The IO paradigm also brought econometric tools to the research on strategic management. Building on the IO economics framework, the organizational economics perspective contributed transaction costs economics and agency theory to strategic management. More recent theoretical contributions focus on the resource-based view of the firm. While it has its roots in Edith Penrose's work in the late 1950s, the resource-based view was largely introduced to the field of strategic management in the 1980s and became a dominant framework in the 1990s. Based on the resource-based view or developing concurrently were research on strategic leadership, strategic decision theory (process research) and knowledge-based view of the firm. The research methodologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated and now frequently combine both quantitative and qualitative approaches and unique and new statistical tools. Finally, this review examines the future directions, both in terms of theory and methodologies, as the study of strategic management evolves. (c) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

We offer a rationale for a link between capital scarcity and franchising. Predictions respectively based on agency theory and the capital scarcity hypothesis were tested among 91 restaurant chains. Our specific focus was on whether or not variables based on capital scarcity could explain variance in firms' franchising decisions beyond what was explained by agency variables. The latter were significant predictors of franchising, and the capital scarcity variables explained additional variance, indicating that capital is among the resources related to franchising.

The Virtual Design Team (VDT) extends and operationalizes Galbraith's (1973) information-processing view of organizations. VDT simulates the micro-level information processing, communication, and coordination behavior of participants in a project organization and predicts several measures of participant and project-level performance. VDT-1 (Cohen 1991) and VDT-2 (Christiansen 1993) modeled project organizations containing actors with perfectly congruent goals engaged in complex but routine engineering design work within static organization structures. VDT-3 extends the VDT-2 work process representation to include measures of activity flexibility, complexity, uncertainty, and interdependence strength. It explicitly models the effects of goal incongruency between agents on their information processing and communication behavior while executing more flexible tasks. These extensions allow VDT to model more flexible organizations executing less routine work processes. VDT thus bridges rigorously between cognitive and social psychological micro-organization theory and sociological and economic macro-organization theory for project teams. VDT-3 has been used to model and simulate the design of two major subsystems of a complex satellite launch vehicle. This case study provides initial evidence that the micro-contingency theory embodied in VDT-3 can be used to predict organizational breakdowns, and to evaluate alternative organizational changes to mitigate identified risks. VDT thus supports true `organizational engineering' for project teams.

The author summarizes 11 hypotheses from agency theory, transaction cost analysis, and Ouchi's theoretical approach about the impact of environmental, company, and salesperson characteristics on the design of sales force control systems (outcome- versus behavior-based) and tests them on a data set of 270 German sales organizations. Many of the hypotheses receive empirical support. Sales force size, the only construct for which the author derives two opposing hypotheses, is related negatively to the use of behavior-based control in sales forces. Thus, the hypothesis derived from Ouchi's approach is supported, whereas the contradictory hypothesis from transaction cost analysis is rejected.

Agency theory suggests that an efficient contract between a franchisor (principal) and a franchisee (agent) could be established by the use of selection criteria that would screen prospective franchisees based on their likely future outcomes desired by their franchisors. Franchisors can use franchisee selection criteria as a key input control to enhance the outcomes of their future franchisees. This article examines the relationship between key franchisee selection criteria such as franchisees' financial capability, experience and management skills, demographic characteristics, attitude toward business dimensions (perceived innovativeness, desire for personal development, seek work-related challenges, personal commitment to the business, and business risk-taking), and key measures of outcomes desired by franchisors (perceived cooperation, satisfaction with the business decision, and franchisee opportunism). The findings show that certain franchisee attitudes toward business can be used as an effective input control strategy by franchisors because they explain a substantial portion of the variance in franchisees' outcome desired by franchisors.

International retailers are increasingly using franchising as a means of entering foreign markets. However, international retail franchising lacks a conceptual basis from which an explanation of the major elements of this activity can be generated. Agency theory and its major premises of information asymmetry, monitoring costs, moral hazard and opportunism, are introduced in an attempt to provide an initial effort at bridging this conceptual gap. The paper reviews international retailing and franchise research before explaining agency theory. A discussion follows on how agency theory can explain major elements of international franchise activity of retail firms such as the international retail franchise process and the operationalisation of the international retail franchise system.

Research on the internationalization of retailing has focused on descriptive and empirical studies centring on issues such as motivations for retail internationalization and individual company experiences of the internationalization process. One particular aspect of the retail internationalization process that has remained relatively underresearched, and consequently under theorized, is market entry mode strategy. Furthermore, with a few notable exceptions, potentially interesting research from the economics of international production and corporate finance literatures has been virtually ignored in the international retailing domain. This paper represents an initial step in rectifying these deficiencies by exploring some of the issues associated with the economics-based internalization and agency theories, in the context of international retailers' market entry mode strategy. By combining market transaction costs (associated with internalization theory), together with information and monitoring costs (associated with agency theory), and thus highlighting the interlinking issue of information asymmetry, a more coherent basis is established for analysing international retailers' entry mode choice decision.

This article examines creative-risk-taking behavior by agencies and the circumstances that increase their propensity to take risks. Drawing upon agency theory, and the wider literature on risk in management decision making, two areas are investigated. (1) resolving the conflicting desires of agencies and advertisers, and (2) how advertisers control agent's risk-taking. A mail survey of senior creative directors across a cross section of agencies is used and data to test the hypotheses gathered. Analyses indicate that agencies are less risk-seeking than expected. Market response and advertisers have the most influence on agency risk-taking, and agencies take a portfolio approach to risk - being more likely to suggest creative risk-taking for relatively smaller clients. The findings are discussed in terms of developing winning creative ideas. Suggestions for future research are identified.

A substantial body of research employs agency theory and transaction costs analysis to explain ownership decisions in distribution channels. Agency theory identifies factors that prompt firms to favor behavior-based contracting over outcome-based agreements. Transaction cost economics is a complementary framework which maintains that the organizational form in a location should be the one that economizes on production and transaction costs. Prior research illustrates that independent variables (e.g. proximity to highways, dedicated assets) outlined in these theories provide a partial explanation for ownership decisions. Nevertheless, scant research has analyzed whether factors outlined in agency theory and transaction cost analysis are employed by executives when making ownership decisions. The purpose of this study is to investigate managerial rationales underlying plural contractual networks. (c) 1999, MCB UP Limited.

Industrial foundations are self-governing, non-profit institutions that own business companies. This ownership structure is found in a fair number of Northern European companies, some of them successful world-class competitors. Standard agency theory would predict foundation-owned companies to be relatively inefficient since they lack monitoring by residual claimants and access to equity finance from the stock market. Nevertheless, empirical research (Thomsen 1996) has found that Danish foundation-owned companies do no worse in terms of profitability and growth than companies with dispersed ownership or family ownership. The paper considers and tests alternative explanations of this paradox. Explanations based on tax incentives, alternative control mechanisms and product-market advantages are rejected, but some support is found for performance advantages related to family control and long-term business commitment.

In this paper, we examine agency theory's presumptions of self-interest, opportunistic behavior, and the notion of the "economic man" (or woman). We contend that the application of agency theory's presumptions to the firm may imply high costs, competitive disadvantage, and high firm risk. We suggest that agency theory's presumptions may not contribute to the interests of the principal, agent, or other stakeholders. Alternatively, we discuss socioeconomic theories' presumptions of enlightened self-interest, trustworthy behavior, and the possibility of the noneconomic person. We argue that the extension of socioeconomic theories to the firm may imply low costs, competitive advantage, and low firm risk. We contend that the socioeconomic presumptions may contribute to the interests of various stakeholders. (c) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

Results based on personal visits to 90 small retail clothing stores located at shopping centers throughout Singapore, with responses from 180 salespersons, store owners, and supervisors, showed that agency theory was robust in explaining the extent of outcome-based compensation used in rewarding salespeople. Risk sharing factors (e.g., the principal's risk aversion and average purchase size) were more prominent than monitoring factors (e.g., number of stores owned by the principal) in explaining the structure of compensation for salespeople in the industry.

The ineffectiveness of several privatized firms within emerging economies underscores the importance of agency theory issues and their impact on the privatization-performance relationship. We argue that weak governance and limited protection of minority shareholders intensify traditional principal-agent problems (perquisite consumption and entrenchment) and create unique agency problems (expropriation). We suggest that postprivatization performance can be enhanced by using appropriate ownership, management, and corporate structures that mitigate agency problems in the context of weak governance, and we highlight avenues for research.

This study uses the resource-based view of the firm and agency theory to examine the relationship between innovation and CEO pay in 90 high-technology firms. With firm size, performance, and other factors controlled, CEO short-term compensation was related to innovation as measured by number of patents and R&D spending. The data also suggest a less consistent temporal relationship between innovation and long-term CEO compensation in the high-technology firms. In a control sample of 74 low-technology firms, there was no relationship between innovation and either short-or long-term CEO pay.

Franchising is fast becoming one of the most popular entry mode strategies for international retail companies when moving into international markets. Academic research, however, has only recently begun to examine international franchising within the context of retailer internationalization. A major gap in the literature is the nature of the international retail franchise relationship and, in particular, the mechanisms used to control and co-ordinate the international franchise network. This paper reports the findings from an in-depth, ethnographic study of the internationalization activity of one retail franchise company and examines the extent to which the marketing channels and agency theory literatures can, in practice, explain power and control in international retail franchising.

Because shark repellents decrease the vulnerability of firms (and their incumbent managers) to the market for corporate control, the decision to adopt these devices represents an excellent test of agency theory. In this empirical study, we examined the relationships between the adoption of shark repellents and several mechanisms that, according to agency theory, should align the interests of corporate board members and shareholders and/or make directors more effective monitors of management behaviour. Of the variables included, only board stock ownership (especially by employee directors) was linked to a reduced propensity to adopt shark repellents in the predicted manner. Two variables not immediately associated with agency theory - the proportion of inside directors appointed by the incumbent chief executive officer (CEO) and a lower ratio of CEO compensation to the compensation of other top executives - were linked to higher rates of shark repellent adoption. Given that agency theory explains relatively little of the variance in shark repellent adoption, we advocate serious consideration of other theoretical formulations for corporate governance, including two approaches -stewardship theory and agent morality - that take the moral ('other regarding') obligations of directors seriously.

Competitive predictions regarding the relationships between: (a) monitoring and agent tenure, and (b) performance-contingent compensation are derived from agency theory and collaborative perspectives. These results are tested in a within-industry (trucking) sample and in a cross-industry sample. The results partially support both perspectives, particularly with respect to monitoring and agent tenure. Implications of the results for theory and practice are discussed.

Increasingly, the equity investments of individual investors are being channeled through financial institutions. This article posits that the role of institutional owners as financial intermediaries, and the resulting complexity that institutions bring to ownership, distinguish institutional ownership from individual ownership. I develop a model of institutional ownership, referred to as the nexus agency model (NAM), which reflects this complexity. The model provides a framework for identifying the potential additional agency costs to beneficial owners that are associated with owning via financial institutions. The degree to which owning via institutions benefits individual owners depends on the adequacy of the legal and regulatory environment and governance mechanisms in protecting individual owners' interests. The applicability of the nexus model to different institutional owner types is then demonstrated in a discussion of U.S. public and private pension plans and mutual funds, leading to the generation of a NAM-based research agenda for each type and across the types. The article ends with discussion of the model's applicability to non-U.S. institutional environments. (c) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Governance in organizations according to traditional agency theory is based on the premise that managers and employees do not have identical goals. As a consequence, employees need to be monitored and controlled. If legal contracts are not sufficient for proper control, incentive contracts should be used. This paper argues that incentive contracts are not sufficient to solve governance issues in organizations due to problems in measurability and enforceability of presumed contract violations. Such problems are complicated by asymmetries in power, perspectives and aspirations between managers and employees. Acognitive argument is advanced suggesting that time constraints and bounded rationality render the idea of monitoring relatively ineffective. Governance ideas that focus on communication flow and information sharing are described. The role that other cognitive elements such as memory play in a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary framework for understanding governance relations is discussed.

The economic importance of 'knowledge work' has become widely accepted. Less widely accepted are the changes knowledge work requires in how we manage performance. This paper explores the differences between knowledge work and more traditional physical and managerial work, in the context of economic agency models, the most rigorous extant theoretical representations of how to manage performance. Assumptions derived from the characteristics of knowledge work are used to extend agency models. The conclusions about how to manage from this extended model are different from the conclusions of traditional agency models. Linking measured performance and compensation - a common recommendation that arises from interpretations of agency theories - is effective in knowledge work contexts only if knowledge workers are intrinsically motivated. We conclude that agency models and recommendations derived from them are relevant only to the extent that they employ modified assumptions consistent with the distinctive characteristics of knowledge work and knowledge workers.

The relationship between exporters and independent foreign channel intermediaries (FCIs) is complex. The present paper analyses and discusses the potential types of opportunistic behaviour that might be engaged in by foreign agents or distributors (FCIs) using an agency theory approach. A classification framework of opportunistic behaviour is developed and a detailed qualitative examination of the content of five agencydistributor agreements between Australian exporters and their FCIs. A five-category classification scheme for opportunistic behaviour was found that included (1) product, (2) price, (3) information, (4) logistical, and (5) legal opportunism. The implications of each type of opportunism for an exporter are discussed using examples obtained from ways to control opportunistic behaviour are discussed.

Does owner management necessarily eliminate the agency costs of ownership? Drawing on agency literature and on the economic theory of the household, we argue that private ownership and owner management expose privately held, owner-managed firms to agency threats ignored by Jensen's and Meckling's (1976) agency model. Private ownership and owner management not only reduce the effectiveness of external control mechanisms, they also expose firms to a "self-control" problem created by incentives that cause owners to take actions which "harm themselves as well as those around them" (Jensen 1994, p. 43). Thus, shareholders have incentive to invest resources in curbing both managerial and owner opportunism. We extend this thesis to the domain of the family firm. After developing hypotheses which describe how family dynamics and, specifically, altruism, exacerbate agency problems experienced by these privately held, owner-managed firms, we use data obtained from a large-scale survey of family businesses to field test our hypotheses and find evidence which suggests support for our proposed theory. Finally, we discuss the implications of our theory for research on family and other types of privately held, owner-managed firms.

The corporatization reform in Chinese SOEs has been largely influenced by the Anglo-American corporate governance model, but at issues is whether or not this model suits China's current institutional and cultural contexts. Agency theory and stewardship theory are two corporate governance theories that provide conflicting assumptions about human behavior and different prescriptions about governance mechanisms. In this study we drew upon both theories and developed competing hypotheses about the relationships between board composition, leadership structure, and organizational performance in Chinese shareholding companies. We gave special attention to China's unique institutional context and its influence on board attributes. The hypotheses were tested with a sample of Chinese listed companies. Overall, the stewardship hypotheses received stronger empirical support. (c) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

In this paper, we discuss agency theory in the context of the individual principal and agent, and also in the context of the organization and its groups. Agency theory is examined in the context of goal orientation, obligation and reciprocity, risk, and self-interest. We offer propositions given agency theory's assumptions. We also extend agency theory and offer alternative propositions based on a relaxing of agency theory's assumptions. In relaxing the assumptions of agency theory, insights from outside the agency literature, specifically from behavioral theories are used. Implications of agency theory and the extension of this theory are also discussed in relation to outcomes associated with economic exchanges. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

This paper focuses on the question of how relational rents can be created in the venture capitalist-entrepreneur dyad. It identifies how theoretical frameworks, such as agency theory and procedural justice theory, have been used to describe the relationship between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Further, it shows how other research streams, such as organizational learning theory and social exchange theory, may be integrated with research on venture capital financing. The central thesis of the paper is that relational rents can be created in venture capitalist-entrepreneur dyads through relation-specific investments and knowledgesharing routines, based on an effective governance of the relationship between both parties.

We challenge the implicit assumption that entrepreneurs are the sole owners of their young firms and we suggest that because cutting-edge innovation projects are complex, they create substantial information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and their investors. Linking previous research on governance, entrepreneurship, and innovation, we ask what forms of governance and incentive systems are conducive to spur and implement innovation among young entrepreneurial firms. Using agency theory and building on the rich literature on governance, we make eight practical suggestions regarding the governance of young entrepreneurial firms. We suggest that early and effective governance systems may help entrepreneurs and investors work in alignment with each other's best interests. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

In Asia, the recent catastrophic decline in regional stock markets, continuing currency crisis and failures of major financial institutions and industrial corporations have increased domestic and international interest in corporate governance. Nowhere is this greater than in Japan where financial institution reform has catapulted this to the fore. In this paper, we use agency theory and institutional theory, together with comparative case examples, to derive some propositions on the dynamics of changing corporate governance systems in Japanese firms. We argue for the co-existence of stakeholder and shareholder-centered corporate governance systems in Japan. This argument has an important implication for corporate governance research and agency theory. Namely, changes in ownership structure and institutional expectations would force firms to focus on maximizing shareholder value even where the interests of stakeholders are more emphasized. It suggests an environmental selection mechanism to ensure the emergence of appropriate corporate governance mechanisms to solve the agency problem. Further, the loss of competitiveness and the prolonged poor performance of firms can change the institutional norms to emphasize asset efficiency and transparency rather than stability and business ties.

Adapting well-established organization theories to international joint ventures (IJVs), this paper develops an overarching theoretical model of the determinants and effects of parent control of IJVs from an interpartner bargaining power perspective. Drawing upon power dependence, transaction costs, and agency theories, we argue that the relative bargaining power between IJV partners serves as the key determinant of control structure, and that control exerts a direct effect on the venture's performance. In addition, government influence and interpartner working relationship are critical factors that complicate the linkage between control and performance but may help to explain past conflicting results. Propositions regarding these relationships are formed for future empirical test, and implications and directions for future research are provided. (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The paper gives an overview of major scientific approaches to inter-enterprise relationships. A distinction is made between approaches that focus on business process integration (Supply Chain Management, Costing approaches), approaches that focus on organizational collaboration (Transaction Cost Theory. Agency Theory), and approaches that focus on the business environment (Strategic Management, Network Theory, Resource Dependency Theory). Although these approaches are different with regard to their perspectives on collaboration, variables and methods, the paper shows that they are complementary tools in the analysis and design of inter-enterprise relationships.

This paper looks at the changing nature of work for workers in knowledge-intensive high-tech firms. Four theories (institutional theory [IT], resource-based theory, game theory, and agency theory) are examined and propositions formulated as to how each theory helps explain the existence of intellectual cooperation and knowledge sharing within high-tech firms. The paper examines the usefulness of existing theory and suggests new research propositions, constructs, and methods to focus on building an empirical approach towards organizational research in the high-tech arena.

This study is an extension of research which links top management team characteristics and the use of a variety of business strategies. Agency theory and information processing theory provided the framework used to investigate the complex business strategies of 219 Japanese firms in four sectors. Statistical results support our view that top team characteristics reflect important aspects of the corporate governance strategies needed to manage business strategies such as specialization, diversification and internationalization. Although there are substantial institutional differences in the business environments, it appears that there is increasing convergence in the Japanese and American approaches to corporate governance.

The compensation of managers is not a new topic; nevertheless, it is a field that is far from exhausted. In this context, our study is situated within the new trend of seeking non-economic explanations for the compensation of senior management. Specifically, our intention is to integrate agency theory with the contingent perspective. From among the various situational factors that could be taken into account, we have taken the strategy of the organization, which is considered to be the principal contingent factor. The main argument of our study is that the closer the fit between the compensation of the top management and the strategy of an organization, the better will be the business results of that organization. The review of theory will enable us to formulate a set of hypotheses referring to the relationship between the generic strategy and the compensation strategy. In the empirical research, taking a set of Spanish companies, we check these hypotheses. In the treatment of the information obtained, use was made of descriptive statistics, the testing of hypotheses and cluster analysis. In the last part of the paper, we present our conclusions, among which the difference in the behaviour shown by the Spanish companies is emphasized.

Focusing on player agents in professional ice hockey, this paper utilizes the theoretical construct of agency theory as a means of evaluating attempts by several stakeholder groups to find solutions to opportunistic agent behavior. As proposed by agency theorists, this would include the creation and implementation of monitoring mechanisms by industry stakeholders in order to regulate agent activities. Stakeholder groups involved include state and federal governments, the agents themselves, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and Players' Associations, which, at various times, all have adopted forms of certification programs in attempts to monitor player agents. Documentation on these programs and interviews with industry stakeholders are employed to develop criteria by which such programs can be assessed in terms of their ability to reduce traditional agency problems. In doing so, it is argued that the agency model can be used to provide additional insight into problems associated with these programs and to improve program effectiveness in monitoring hockey agent behavior.

Managers of a sample of private and public banks in Greece were surveyed through the vehicle of agency theory. It was found that managers in private banks showed greater alignment of interests with those of the bank, their pay related to outcomes and they were more mobile in their jobs. Private banks also used more control mechanisms to align interests of their managers with those of the bank and displayed a different working climate. Given evolving organisation structures resulting from deregulation, the convergence of information technology and communications and the entry of firms from other industries, the implications of the findings for governance are important.

In this research we discuss the relationship between CEO and top management team (TMT) member compensation, and explore the implications of TMT pay for firm performance. Specifically, we suggest that firm performance may benefit due to agency and group behavioral issues when top management team member pay is aligned-alignment is defined as the degree to which TMT member pay reflects (1) shareholder interests and (2) key political and strategic contingencies within the firm. In support of our theorizing, we found CEO pay to be related to TMT pay; TMT compensation, in turn, predicted performance (i.e., return on assets and Tobin's q) when aligned with shareholder interests and internal contingencies. Moreover, the effect of CEO pay on future firm performance was dependent on top team pay.

In this article an extension of agency theory based on problems that arise in agency relationships, even when agents are assumed to be honest and dutiful, is put forward. With one exception, these assumptions lead to essentially the same predictions as in standard agency theory, suggesting that effects commonly attributed to self-seeking may be better understood as more fundamental effects of the agency relationship itself. This analysis raises a number of previously unexplored research questions concerning the nature of managerial agency relationships.

We examined the effects of unsystematic and systematic firm risk on CEO compensation risk bearing and total pay. Both the proportion of variable pay in CEO pay packages and their magnitude are curvilinearly related to unsystematic firm risk - that is, they are highest under conditions of moderate firm-specific risk. Our results are consistent with agency theory predictions that both performance-contingent pay and the greater earnings potential associated with that form of pay are highest when an agent has greater control over performance outcomes.

Cognitive evaluation theory and its hypothetical construct of intrinsic motivation are enjoying increasing popularity in the fields of business administration and economics. Consequently, intensifying skepticism towards performance incentives and agency theory is postulated. According to cognitive evaluation theory, it is argued that performance pay may undermine an agent's intrinsic motivation. In contradiction to agency theory, the principal might be worse off when providing an incentive contract to the agent than without doing so. Since the contention is substantiated by empirical evidence, it seems worrying enough for further investigation. Restricting attention to performance pay in business corporations, the scope of this article is to evaluate whether agency theory faces an urgent need to incorporate the construct of intrinsic motivation and its 'hidden costs of reward' as postulated by supporters of the concept. The subsequent analysis reveals good and bad news for agency theory. The bad news is that hidden costs of reward do indeed exist. The good news is that the empirical evidence on undermining effects cannot be interpreted as being contradictory to agency theory. In particular, the antecedents for such effects not only seldomly prevail in business corporations, they are also easily avoidable. (c) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Some scholars have argued that CEOs may have excessive influence on their foundation's trustees to give away a portion of company profits to charitable causes in order to gain access to elite circles or support the CEO's personal causes. This may result in charitable contributions that ultimately serve the personal interests of the CEOs without regard to corporate interests or social needs. We examine the extent that CEOs appear to direct charitable giving to be compatible with their own personal interests, and if CEO participation on the foundation board affects the relationship between CEO personal interests and charitable giving. Using a sample of 160 corporate foundations, our results showed that CEOs' interests, as measured by membership in different non-profit organizations, was associated with foundation charitable giving. This association decreased, but was not eliminated, when CEOs were absent from the foundation board. Implications of these findings for researchers and managers are discussed in regards to both agency theory and stewardship theory.

When is franchising the appropriate organizational form for implementing marketing strategy in global markets? In this paper we identify conditions under which franchising facilitates efficient transactions globally with the help of constructs from transaction cost analysis, agency theory, and franchising research in domestic contexts. Some, bases for setting initial fees and royalty payments as well as the rationale, for establishing master franchises are also explored The advantages and limitations of adopting franchising as the mode of operation in gbbal markets are briefly discussed A conceptual framework that provides an integrated multidisciplinary approach for studies of franchising from a global marketing perspective is developed.

This article focuses on the role of the family business shareholder. Based on Agency Theory, it examines the elements that influence the conflict of interests and objectives between nonemployed shareholders and the top management team and its impact on commitment to the family firm. Data were empirically obtained from a field study of 156 shareholders and executives of 10 Spanish family firms. Combining quantitative and qualitative data, investigation results show that the degree of commitment to the family business is negatively correlated with the number of family members on the board of directors. Nevertheless, the most robust and statistically significant correlation (positive) was found between the number of external board members and the commitment level of the nonemployed shareholders. Regarding the mechanisms and processes implemented, results depended on the attention that the family business paid to the institutional overlap of the three subsystems: ownership, family, and business.

Most empirical investigations on the disassociation between executive compensation and firm performance have been done using agency theory. Agency theory alludes to a power imbalance favorable to the executives, allowing them to pursue their self-interest in the form of large pay packages. However, because of its roots in the economic discipline, agency theory has led researchers to test financial rather than behavioral hypotheses. Over 70 years of research has been conducted on the pay-form-performance relationship, but only a few significant relationships have been found. This paper attempts to incorporate behavioral conjectures of power into the agency theory framework to provide a comprehensive approach to testing executive pay. Agency theory is combined with the resource dependency theory and with specific measures of power developed by Finkelstein (1992) for a more complete executive pay model.

This paper advances the Hunt-Vitell General Theory of Marketing Ethics as a framework for enriching current understanding of both long-term marketing relationships in general, and principal-agent associations specifically. Under economic models of agency theory, manufacturer-distributor relationships are conceptualized as principal-agent associations where both parties are assumed be motivated exclusively by short-term financial self-interest within the logical constraints of zero-sum game conditions. As a general model of ethical decision making and behavior in marketing, the Hunt-Vitell theory illustrates how ethical decisions are predicated not only upon estimations of potential benefits or outcomes (using teleological criteria), but also deontological evaluations which invoke norms and values. Furthermore, the recent ideas advanced in "relationship marketing" perspectives suggest that distribution channel associations premised upon non-zero-sum or symbiotic assumptions may be more effective and more jointly profitable. Based upon the Hunt-Vitell model, propositions are formulated that complement the understanding of agency theory within the context of marketing channel relationships, and thus, may represent a basis for more effective agency selection and interaction in marketing practice.

The concept of opportunism from transaction cost and agency theories suggests that in a normal class of students, there may be a few who will engage in opportunistic behavior, and to identify who they are will be virtually impossible. Therefore, professors engage in practices to keep students from engaging in opportunistic activities such as cheating. This article explores the possibility that some of these practices may be creating a "destructive Golem effect" in those students who would not otherwise engage in opportunistic behavior and explores ways to create Pygmalion and Galatea effects in the classroom.

Agency theory dominates research on equity holdings-firm performance relationships; however, extant studies provide no consensus about the direction and magnitude of such relationships. Consistent linkages have not been demonstrated for firm performance and CEO, officer, director, institutional, or blockholder equity. We conducted a series of meta-analyses of relevant empirical ownership-performance studies. The meta-analyses provide few examples of systematic relationships, lending little support for agency theory. We propose a substitution theory perspective for future ownership-performance research.

How likely are multinational enterprises (MNEs) to use expatriate parent country nationals to staff culturally distant subsidiaries? How does their employment affect subsidiary performance? The agency theory prediction is that MNEs will rely more heavily on parent country nationals as cultural distance increases and that this reliance will weaken over time. Both agency theory and the "resource-based view" suggest that a positive effect of expatriate staffing on subsidiary performance increases with cultural distance but decreases over time. Results largely supported the predictions in data on Japanese foreign subsidiaries.

This article consists of two parts. The first part reports findings from a survey of the issues facing top executives in 272 Canadian family firms. Results show that succession is their No. 1 concern, thus supporting the predominant focus of family business researchers on succession issues. Results also show that concern about relationships with nonfamily managers is a close second in importance. The second part of the article uses Agency Theory to explain why relationships with nonfamily managers are so important. Empirical results show that both the extent and the criticality of a firm's dependence on nonfamily managers are statistically significant determinants of the importance. This study implies that relationships with nonfamily managers is a neglected research topic and points to a new direction for research in family business management. (c) 2003, SAGE Publications.

Although uncovering the factors that lead firms to offer franchises has long been a central goal of franchising research, considerable ambiguity surrounds extant findings. In an effort to help resolve this ambiguity, we used meta-analysis to aggregate results from 44 studies containing 140 tests of ten hypotheses. The ten hypotheses reflect two theoretical perspectives-resource scarcity and agency theory. Overall, the findings offer support for several of the hypotheses grounded in agency theory, but not those grounded in resource scarcity. The results also highlight the need for future inquiry to include new theoretical approaches and richer data. (c) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Many firms have adopted outsourcing in recent years as a means of governing their information technology (IT) operations. While outsourcing is associated with significant benefits, it can also be a risky endeavour. This paper proposes a scenario-based conceptualization of the IT outsourcing risk, wherein risk is defined as a quadruplet comprising a scenario, the likelihood of that scenario, its consequences and the risk mitigation mechanisms that can attenuate or help avoid the occurrence of a scenario. This definition draws on and extends a risk assessment framework that is widely used in engineering. The proposed conceptualization of risk is then applied to the specific context of IT outsourcing using previous research on IT outsourcing as well as transaction cost and agency theory as a point of departure.

Executives confront potentially conflicting pressures-maximizing shareholder wealth in the long term and appeasing shareholders in the near term. Because they must address near-term pressures to preserve tenure and to realize the benefits of long-term strategies, executives are increasingly likely to seek to mollify shareholders. We develop a behavioral-agency theoretical framework for studying how stock repurchase programs are used to help top managers appease shareholders. Analysis of 250 large U.S. firms suggested that stock repurchase programs are variously a function of information asymmetry, risky stock-based incentives, and performance expectations.

This article examines the franchisor-franchisee relationship from two theoretical perspectives - agency theory and exchange theory. Taking the case of the fast-food industry in Israel, the research focuses on control and autonomy in a domestic hamburger chain - Burger Ranch - and two international chains - McDonald's and Burger King. The findings led to the design of a model that illustrates several aspects, such as the concept of franchising, the size and age of the chain, and the range of the contract, that relate to control and autonomy. The combination of agency theory and exchange theory enables us to focus on control and autonomy as multidimensional concepts, and to present various possibilities for judiciously balancing them. The case indicates that in some respects (e.g. master franchisee), the two global chains are more similar to each other than to the domestic chain. However, in other respects (e.g. size, growth rate), the domestic and one of the two global chains show more similarities than differences. The findings indicate different forms of integration of control and autonomy in the three chains. (c) 2003, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

Researchers use various definitions to describe the family firm. The characteristics of family firms that are stressed in each of these definitions are somehow related to family control. All characteristics together reflect a spectrum of family firm types along one core dimension: family involvement in the firm. However, it is more helpful to distinguish among family firms by using their precise type. Each particular family firm type is characterised by a set of agency relations within and between the family system, ownership system and the business system. This paper is a first attempt to apply the insights from agency theory on a highly simplified (reference) family firm situation where the father is full owner and the daughter manager of the family firm. Agency theory establishes the foundation for the optimal contract conditions between father and daughter. While real life is often characterised by bounded rationality and incomplete information, future research should help identify the "optimal contract" between the family/shareholders and management in various family firm types under these circumstances.

This article examines the implications of the escalation in institutional inves power and heterogeneity for two dominant theories of corporate governanceagency theory and stakeholder theory. From this analysis, a new view of the agency relationship between institutional investors and their portfolio firms emerges, which recognizes the institutions' market power, complex role as financial intermediaries, and possible involvement in simultaneous and opposing agency contracts. We also conclude that stakeholder theorists should reconsider these newly empowered shareholders'moral standing in relation to their portfolio firms, and they should reexamine the identities and goals of these modern investors. To that end, we demonstrate that a novel, intragroup application of Mitchell, Agle, and Wood's stakeholder framework to heterogeneous institutional investors illuminates their varying levels of stakeholder salience.

This study examines the perceptions of directors in Australian public listed companies about their access to information for their role as directors. We focus on information costs and information asymmetry. Directors' perceptions of the relationship between the composition of Boards, the perceived roles of Boards and the information requirements to fulfil those roles were explored in interviews with 45 directors from public listed companies. Implicit in Agency Theory is the assumption that independent directors have free access to the information required to fulfil their role in monitoring and control. We found, however, demonstrable evidence of information asymmetry. The central finding was that directors perceive that the CEO and Executive have the controlling power over information. The provision of appropriate information for Board decisions is perceived to hinge on the "integrity" of the CEO and Executive. This emphasis on integrity and "good companies" does appear consistent with the Stewardship Theory of governance. It raises as a question for future research the possible alternative relationships between Boards and management. The directors interviewed discussed a range of strategies they used to keep themselves informed and made observations of additions to information that they believed should be available as a matter of course.

In this article, the political environment of privatization and its impact on public management are examined in the context of the privatization of a state park in Georgia. The study specifically focuses on the actions of public managers in the privatization formulation and implementation stage. Public management capacity actually increased as a result of privatization. This is an outcome quite different from those reported by public management studies of other privatized services. Applying a principal-agent framework, this study yielded several lessons that may strengthen public managers' capacity to act as "smart buyers" of goods and services and to enforce accountability when managing contractual relationships. This study links theory to practice using a case study that allows a careful examination of the strategic responses of public managers confronted by largely political, as opposed to economic, pressures to privatize an already successful state park.

We develop and test a model of nonprofit executive compensation based on theories of organizational science, economics, and agency theory. Our sample consisted of 114 directors of small business development centers in theUnited States. Consistent with our model, we find significant effects for human capital, organizational size, and organizational affiliation. We find tentative support for a significant pay-for-performancerelationship. We find that when education, tenure, size, performance, and affiliation are held constant, femaleexecutives are compensated significantly less than male executives. (c) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper examines the professional hockey industry to explore the principles of agency theory. Using basic tenets derived from the agency literature and conditions specific to the hockey industry, a series of propositions are developed. These are investigated using data from industry documents, popular articles on hockey, and interviews with players, agents, team managers and other relevant industry stakeholders. The results suggested that concerns for agent reputation, agent competition, agent certification and salary disclosure have cumulatively reduced information asymmetry favoring the agent and have decreased the likelihood of agent opportunism. This has resulted in a decrease in the use of commissions by agents, but this form of performance contingent compensation remains the most widely used form of remuneration.

This paper examines the financial performance effect of three corporate governance mechanisms: (i) founding family CEO, (ii) board ownership, and (iii) board independence. The developed hypotheses are tested using multivariate ordinary least-squares regression on a 3-year sample of 32 publicly traded maritime firms from Norway and Sweden, and compared to the results of the same hypotheses tested on a sample of 96 manufacturing firms. This study concludes that maritime firms with a founding family CEO have better financial performance than maritime firms with a non-founding family CEO. Support was also found for the hypothesis that a high level of board independence enhances profitability in maritime firms. Contrary to agency theory predictions, no significant relation was found between the level of board ownership and firm profitability in maritime firms, although board ownership control was significant in the sample of manufacturing firms.

This paper analyses operational differences between mobile franchising arrangements and fixed-site franchises from an agency-theoretic perspective. Almost 40 per cent of all franchised units in Australia operate as mobile or home-based businesses, predominantly in service industries where products or services are provided directly to consumers. A two-stage methodology is reported in this paper, incorporating quantitative and qualitative research methods. In stage one, data obtained from a survey of the population of Australian franchisors in 1998 are analysed to compare operational variables of mobile and fixed-site franchise units. The second stage of the research employs in-depth interviews with a sample of mobile franchisors and franchisees to further explore relevant issues. The results confirm the agency theory perspective that start-up investment risk is lower in mobile units and mobile operations exhibit a higher level of repeat customers than fixed-site franchises. No significant differences between the two arrangements are revealed in relation to the levels of franchisee monitoring, initial training or essential franchisee experience. This study indicates that agency theory contributes to our understanding of mobile franchising arrangements, yet also suggests the findings are not completely explained by agency theory. The results imply that both monitoring and alignment of incentives have complimentary effects and that both forms of contract are necessary in a franchisor's control system. (c) 2003, MCB UP Limited.

This study examines the choice between management contracts and franchise agreements in the corporate development of international hotel companies. The fact that contractual modes of corporate development are quite prevalent in the hotel sector world-wide, in combination with the lack of research in that direction, suggests the gap in this field. This study attempts to fill this void by developing a theoretical framework in order for further empirical research to reveal important findings regarding the factors that influence the choice between franchise agreements and management contracts as a means of non-equity hotel development. It has been suggested that management contracts should be viewed as a more hierarchical form of organisation in terms of the degree of control the firm can exercise. Additionally, a more robust theoretical discussion has been provided, combining both transaction cost theory and agency theory on the decision for corporate development in the hotel industry. Finally, important factors have been identified, which influence a hotel company's choice between management contracts and franchise agreement in its corporate development, followed by propositions, therefore, set out a guideline for further empirical studies.

Metrics provide essential links between strategy, execution, and ultimate value creation. Changing competitive dynamics are placing heavy demands on conventional metrics systems, and creating stresses throughout firms and their supply chains. Research has not kept pace with these new demands in an environment where it is no longer sufficient to simply let metrics evolve over time - we must learn how to proactively design and manage them. The intent of this paper is to convey the importance and need for metrics-related research. An outline of the important characteristics of the metrics research topic is provided. Specifically, we address the functions of metrics; their focus and tense; their operational and strategic contexts; as well as discuss the distinction between metrics, metrics sets and metrics systems. Some initial theoretical grounding for the research topic is provided through agency theory. We conclude with a discussion of the intent and process of the special issue, and introduction of the associated articles. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As franchising has increased its visibility and impact on the business landscape, it has attracted the attention of a wide variety of researchers from different academic backgrounds. We draw together much of this research by juxtaposing the two key theories used to explain franchising, resource scarcity and agency theory, with the empirical findings regarding three key franchising constructs-franchise initiation, subsequent propensity to franchise, and franchise performance. We suggest that research emphasis needs to shift toward understanding why firms initiate franchising and how franchising impacts different types of organizational performance. We also find that extant research can benefit from additional theoretical diversity and thus we offer new propositions grounded in three theories not yet widely applied to franchising.

In this article, we document the growing influence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the realm of socially responsible investing (SRI). Drawing from ethical and economic perspectives on stakeholder management and agency theory, we develop a framework to understand how and when NGOs will be most influential in shaping the ethical and social responsibility orientations of business using the emergence of SRI as the primary influencing vehicle. We find that NGOs have opportunities to influence corporate conduct via direct, indirect, and interactive influences on the investment community, and that the overall influence of NGOs as major actors in socially responsible investment is growing, with attendant consequences for corporate strategy, governance, and social performance.

The role of the board of directors in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. However, research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies: the lack of an overarching theoretical perspective, reliance on proxies for the strategy role rather than a direct measure of it and the lack of quantitative data linking this role to firm financial performance. We propose a new theoretical perspective to explain the board's role in strategy, integrating organisational control and agency theories. We categorise a board's approach to strategy according to two constructs: strategic control and financial control. The extent to which either construct is favoured depends on contextual factors such as board power, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry.

Management buyouts (MBOs) and buyins (MBIs) are an alternative solution to the private family firm ownership succession issue. It is typically assumed that MBO/MBIs of private family firms progress more smoothly than other types of MBO/MBI, due to fewer information asymmetries and closer relationships between the parties involved. This study provides novel evidence from eight private family firms that had selected an MBO or an MBI. The myths surrounding the succession issues of family firms who have selected an MBO/MBI are specifically explored. The MBO/MBI process is examined within an agency theory framework with particular emphasis on the balance of information and the relationships between vendors and purchasers. Complementary theoretical frameworks relating to trust and negotiation behavior are utilized. Interviews were held with former family owners as well as the current members of the MBO/MBI teams. Triangulation of opinions was considered, thus strengthening the validity of presented results. The case studies confirmed that information asymmetries were widespread, providing opportunities for the parties with more information to negotiate a price and structure the deal to their advantage. Good relationships and trust between the vendor and MBO/MBI team mitigated information asymmetries. Where the MBO/MBI was part of the family firm's long-term strategy, there were fewer information asymmetries, and knowledge transfer was facilitated. (c) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although franchising is a pervasive organizational form, little is known about its performance consequences. Prior studies have not found a direct performance effect, suggesting a need for alternative approaches. Drawing upon agency and resource scarcity theories, we develop the idea that strategic groups exist among franchisors and that performance differs among the groups. Using a sample of 65 restaurant chains, three strategic groups were found. The strategic group most influenced to franchise out of resource scarcity exhibited poorer performance than the other two groups. Results indicate that important, but nonlinear, relationships exist among franchising, its antecedents, and performance. (c) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To date, corporate governance research agendas have tended to concentrate on one particular role that a board performs. For instance, agency theory concentrates on the monitoring role, resource dependence theory concentrates on the board providing access to resources and stewardship theory concentrates on the board's advice-giving or strategic role. While these approaches provide practitioners with useful guidelines regarding issues such as board independence, we contend that practitioners need to take care not to act on the recommendations from a single theory in isolation from the others. To address this concern, we provide a model of board effectiveness that uses the construct of board intellectual capital to integrate the predominant theories of corporate governance and illustrate how the board can drive corporate performance. We further contend that boards that wish to improve their performance need to review their intellectual capital. We conclude by linking the model to a practitioner-focused framework that identifies four key areas on which a board must concentrate to develop its intellectual capital.

In this paper, we take an integrated view of Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) and Agency Theory (AT) in order to study the direct salesforce vs. rep decision and the design of compensation plans in German salesforces. We test, with a single data set, a set of established and new hypotheses of both theories in the context of both decisions. This allows us to assess the complementarity of AT and TCA by estimating the relative explanatory power of the two frameworks for each of the two decisions. On the one hand, we find support for most of the established hypotheses. However, the hypothesized effect of uncertainty is rejected in our data set. Moreover, we document the impact of some new variables. We also find that, while AT does not add much to explain the decision of direct vs. rep in our data, TCA is equally limiting in helping understand the design of salesforce compensation plans. Therefore, one has to be cautious in treating AT and TCA as complementary theories. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Agency theory assumes that employees and employers have different goals, act in a self-interested manner, and are willing to assume varying degrees of risk. In this paper, we argue that cultural differences may attenuate those assumptions and thereby temper agency theory predictions. Culture may align goals between employers and employees, change a company's preference for behavior- versus outcome-based pay, require higher incentives before employees will accept outcome-based pay, and lower the moral hazard concerns associated with outcome-based pay. Based on those arguments, we develop propositions that can be tested empirically. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper advances the resource dependence and social networks literature by investigating a board's structural social capital created as a consequence of interlocking directorates. Using approaches and measures developed by social network analysis we compare the interpersonal directorship networks of the top 250 companies in the United States and Australia. We find that the smaller, sparser Australian network is only marginally less compact and connected than the larger US network at the firm level of analysis. However, at the director level of analysis the US network is much larger and more connected than its Australian counterpart. As a result, we argue that scholars studying the resource dependence role of boards should consider using measures of interpersonal links as well as traditional measures of inter-firm links. Understanding how boards impact on corporate performance is a question central to the corporate governance research agenda. Agency theory, for example, argues that the key way a board adds value is by ensuring the interests of the managers of the firm are aligned with the interests of the owners (Eisenhardt 1989; Jensen & Meckling 1976). A quite distinct area of inquiry, however, relates to the role that the board plays in providing access to important resources such as customers (Pennings 1980), capital (Mizruchi & Stearns 1988), the business elite (Uscem 1984) and power in general (Pfeffer & Salancik 1978). We aim to broaden understanding of the resource dependence theory of corporate governance by examining the links provided to a board by interlocking directorships. We commence by reviewing existing research on the resource dependence role of the board before outlining how the emerging construct of social capital can be adapted and applied to investigate this role. In particular, we highlight how it is the personal director network that is critical to the development of social capital rather than the corporate network (i.e. network of corporations). While this study is primarily exploratory and descriptive, we contribute to the literature by employing a new methodology to measure the 'opportunity network' that interlocking directorates provide a board within a national corporate governance system (Adams 2002a; 2002b; 2002c). We show how the formal models, procedures and techniques developed in social network analysis can be applied to individual-level networks among directors. We stress that we are not considering the formation of social capital at the individual level; rather we are examining the systemic connections of individual directors in order to illustrate the opportunity network available to a board within the national corporate governance system. A comparison of the Australian and US systems highlights the divergence in network attributes between corporate networks and the networks of interlocking directors. We conclude with implications and areas for further research.

Suppliers and buyers of R&D results perceive two exchange risks: first, the risk to achieve a lower profitability on the innovation return than the exchange partner, second, the risk of the partner becoming a competitor by unplanned, one-sided knowledge flows. Both risks motivate opportunistic behaviour. The paper deals with the reduction of the perceived supplier risks. We analyse how an option on later negotiation of an additional continuous innovation return sharing which is based on contractual hostages can lower the perceived exchange risks. An empirical study examines how effectively these hostages lower the perceived risks. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper describes the results of a field experiment involving 400 employees from ten financial institutions operating within the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone of the People's Republic of China. It was found that, when faced with an agency-based problem, employees indicated they would be less inclined to advise management of the existence of unethical work practices. Younger employees without supervisory experience displayed significant risk aversion. Traditional Chinese values associated with Confucian work dynamism, were shown to be poor predictors of moral choice response. A parsimonious regression model was developed that provides evidence that the universal trait Masculinity/Femininity (Human-heartedness) acted to offset the negative influence of the agency problem. On the other hand, an operative's level of education attainment exerted a negative influence on moral response scores.

This paper sets out the results of interview-based research to determine why companies use performance-related pay. The findings indicate that many companies adopt this structure despite a belief that the money does not motivate executives. Reasons related in part to best practice in human resource management: pay structures were designed to attract and retain executives with the potential of large earnings; to focus their efforts in the direction agreed by the board; and to demonstrate fairness. Importantly, the variable pay was seen as a symbol of the director's success, both internally and to his or her peers in other companies. Finally, and significantly, an institutional theory explanation was given: companies used performance-related pay because their peers did, and because that legitimised them in the eyes of the establishment.

China's open-market reform and rapid economic growth have generated a tremendous surge in activity and market investment by multinational corporations (MNCs). By 2000, 400 of the 500 most famous MNCs had invested in China. One distinctive feature of China' s business environment, its authoritarian political system, requires MNCs to practise strategic public affairs to interact constantly with the different levels of Chinese government, respond to the policies and further influence business policy formation. This paper proposes a conceptual model of MNC-government bargaining that is composed of international political economy, dependency theory and agency theory. It then examines (1) the international and domestic influences on MNC-government bargaining in China and (2) the strategies MNCs employed to influence Chinese laws for foreign business in their interests. A case study of the Chinese ban on direct selling operations in 1998 and Amway's strategies to remove the ban is presented. Results suggest that effective public affairs should engage in the following activities: (1) issues management, (2) constantly and systematically analysing the MNC's bargaining power with the host government, (3) selecting public affairs strategies based on the analysis of MNC-government bargaining, (4) exercising relationship management, and (5) being ethical in its practice.

Different organizational theories clearly define critical organizational activities necessary for organizational survival. Recent attention to "hybrid" research that links organizational theory with MIS research has been proposed to lend new insights into strategic alignment of IT (Orlikowski & Barley, 2000; Zrnud, 2002). One gap still to be addressed relates to role expectations and skills required by the IT professional according to different organizational theories. Much of the literature on strategic alignment of IT emphasizes the value provided by the IT artifact or focuses on communication between IT and business management, rather than on the role of IT professionals inferred by critical survival activities outlined in different organizational theories. Motivated by organizational concerns related to the clarity and articulation of the role of Information Technology professionals in contributing to strategic alignment, our study reviews literature about the role of the information technology professional and the differences according to three organizational theories: Agency theory, Transaction Cost theory and Institutional theory. We then use bibliometrics and content analysis to analyze published research for implicit or explicit skill expectations and contributions to organizational survival and strategic alignment of IT. The goal of our study is to contribute to a better understanding of role conflict, skill expectations, and value of information technology professionals in organizations, and also contribute to a consolidation between information systems research and organizational studies.

Agency theory starts with the assumption that people act in their own self-interest, and holds that under normal conditions, the goals, interests, and risks of two actors (principal and agent) are not identical. This means that the agent will not necessarily act according to the interests of the principal. CEO compensation is the type of control mechanism that companies employ to reduce the agency problem. This paper took 201 manufacturing companies in the year 1998 in Taiwan, and used the LISTREL 8 model to analyze the influence of company performance, scale, and board of director control over CEO compensation. The results indicate is that company performance, scale, and control by the board of directors all influence CEO compensation, with company scale the main factor, followed by company performance, and control by the board of directors. I also find that CEO compensation is higher when the board of directors' does not have effective control. Moreover, the board of directors control of a company is diminished when the CTO and chairman of the board are one person, and also when the number of internal directors is great. Conversely, the board of directors' control is increased when their ratio of stock ownership is higher. (c) 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in international markets. This study argues that the ownership structures of SMEs influence their proclivity to take risks and expand the scale and scope of their internationalization efforts. Data from 889 Swedish SMEs reveal that internal owners (CEOs and other senior executives) tend to be risk averse and have a lower proclivity to increase scale and scope of internationalization than external owners (venture capitalists and institutional investors). The results provide interesting insights into the behavioral change of executives regarding the scale and scope of internationalization in the presence of external ownership.

To help understand how firms develop and maintain dynamic capabilities, we examine the effects of the dynamics, management, and governance of R&D and marketing resource deployments on firm-level economic performance. In a sample of technology-based entrepreneurial firms, we find that a history of increased investments in marketing is an enduring source of competitive advantage. We also find that managers' firm-specific experience positively moderates the relationship between R&D deployment intensity and economic returns. In addition, institutional ownership boosts economic returns from marketing deployments by subjecting these deployments to increased scrutiny and by sending positive signals to the market about the firm.

Property rights theory has common antecedents with contractual theories of the firm such as transaction costs and agency theories, and is yet distinct from these theories. We illustrate fundamental theoretical principles derived from these three theories by analyzing the business case of oil field unitization. Theoretical principles and application of theory to oil field unitization are each summarized. From this, it is possible to see how property rights theory is well suited to explain business situations where inefficient economic outcomes persist. Additionally, property rights theory forges new theoretical connections with other branches of organizational economics, in particular, resource-based theory.

Purpose This research paper aims to identify and rank critical issues in IT outsourcing relationships. Design/methodology/approach A total of 11 management theories were applied in this research: theory of core competencies, resource-based theory, neo-classical economic theory, transaction cost theory, contractual theory, agency theory, partnership and alliance theory, relational exchange theory, stakeholder theory, social exchange theory and theory of firm boundaries. The main method used is case studies and survey. Case studies were conducted in three IT outsourcing relationships: ABB-IBM, SAS-CSC, and RR-EDS. Findings Core competence management and stakeholder management were found to be the most critical success factors. Future research should focus on one or two theories, explicitly laying out expectations with respect to the theories, and organizing rich data to test expectations. Originality/value This paper demonstrates that a holistic approach to IT outsourcing is needed that recognizes and emphasizes the combination of several critical success factors. The theory-based factors have both divergent and convergent implications for management. (c) 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

This paper addresses how the global activities undertaken by multinational enterprises (MNEs) in international settings impact corporate governance mechanisms and accountability systems. International corporate governance and accountability research, whether from a political science, economics, finance, or accounting perspective, has thus far predominantly focused on the comparison of corporate governance schemes in different countries and on the investigation of institutional parameters that determine these schemes. Straying from this line of inquiry, this article discusses how globalization at the firm level affects governance and accountability systems at parent- and subsidiary-levels. It emphasizes how an MNE's globalization attributes such as globalization scale, foreign adaptation, global competition, and international experience influence the design of governance mechanisms such as board size, board composition, executive compensation, market discipline, interlocking directorate, ownership concentration, duality and inbreeding, as well as the design of accountability systems such as accounting information, auditing standards, and financial and non-financial disclosures. This article bases its conjectures on information processing and agency theories. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper draws on field study data to provide an examination of the condominium owner/manager relationship in the Australian tourism context. Although there has been considerable growth in tourism accommodation owned through strata-title, no research examining the somewhat idiosyncratic relationship between unit owners and resident managers has been found in the literature. The peculiar nature of the relationship underlines its significance as a context in which to apply the agency theoretical model. As Australian condominium resident unit managers provide letting and caretaker services for condominium unit owners, it appears that the relationship can be justifiably viewed as a principal-agent exchange (Mills, P.K., J. Business Res. 20 (1990) 31). The study specifically focuses on strata title condominiums located in major tourism regions. This sub-sector of the condominium management industry was chosen for study because it exhibits several key attributes distinguishing it from the non-tourist-based condominium sector. For example, two different parties represent the principal (resident owners and investor owners), also a significant proportion of a resident manager's work relates to the management of short-term holiday unit letting. In light of the particular agency relationship dynamics arising in large tourist-based condominium governance, several suggestions concerning the legal environment of the industry are provided.

How and to what extent should a transnational corporation's governance structures be differentiated to satisfy varying strategic roles played by foreign subsidiaries? Drawing on an agency theory perspective, we examine the effects of agency problems in the headquarters-subsidiary relationships on the design of corporate governance in transnational corporations. We propose that corporate governance of foreign subsidiaries in a transnational corporation should be constructed in response to different levels of agency problems associated with varying strategic roles of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we postulate that differentiating governance structures for each foreign subsidiary is a key contingency requirement in order to achieve superior MNE performance as a whole.

Research on detrimental workplace behaviors has increased recently, predominantly focusing on justice issues. Research from the integrity testing literature, which is grounded in trait theory, has not received as much attention in the management literature. Trait theory, agency theory, and psychological contracts theory each have different predictions about employee performance that is harmful to the organization. While on the surface they appear contradictory, this paper describes how each can be integrated to increase our understanding of detrimental workplace behaviors.Deborah L. Kidder is an Associate Professor in the Department of Management at Towson University, in Towson, MD, USA. Her Ph.D. is in Industrial Relations from the University of Minnesta.

Government regulation in an industry is an intermediary in the principal-agent relationship that acts as a substitute for internal governance mechanisms. We propose a model for studying how different forms of deregulation (frame-breaking, metamorphic, piecemeal, and plodding) impact variations in the speed of adaptation of internal governance mechanisms to the theoretical predictions of agency theory and resulting performance implications. We develop illustrative propositions for a set of contingencies that moderate the above relationship. How government and firms manage the deregulatory process has important economic and social consequences.

This paper undertakes an exploratory study on determining capabilities of international franchising within East Asia. There is a need to develop a deeper understanding in franchising within East Asia as much of the franchising literature is based on the U.S. experience. Findings from this paper indicate that international franchisors use a combination of mechanisms to prevent franchisee opportunism in East Asia. They include ex-ante bonds, performance schedules and formal controls in brand management. However, the effectiveness of these mechanisms depend on the capabilities of the franchisor to negotiate a high initial franchise fee, select the right franchisee and make adaptation but still maintain brand integrity.

We use the classic agency model to derive a time-varying optimal hedge ratio for low-frequency time-series data: the type of data used by crop farmers when deciding about production and about their hedging strategy. Rooted in the classic agency framework, the proposed hedge ratio reflects the context of both the crop farmer's decision and the crop farmer's contractual relationships in the marketing channel. An empirical illustration of the Dutch ware potato sector and its futures market in Amsterdam over the period 1971-2003 reveals that the time-varying optimal hedge ratio decreased from 0.34 in 1971 to 0.24 in 2003. The hedging effectiveness, according to this ratio, is 39%. These estimates conform better with farmers' interest in using futures contracts for hedging purposes than the much higher estimates obtained when price risk minimisation is the only objective considered.

The purpose of this paper is to examine player representation in professional sport within the context of broader changes in the global market. Following an overview of agency theory and the traditional role fulfilled by agents on behalf of players, we review how changes have impacted players and agents in professional sports. These include: * The increasing importance of endorsements. * The increasing presence of transnational agencies. * A growing allegiance for athletes toward the corporations that sponsor them. * The mobility of labour and rise of 'borderless athletes'. * The emergence of athletes whose incomes are generated as much by their marketability as their playing talent. We then discuss the implications these changes have for the player-agent relationship in terms of the traditional principal-agent relationship proposed by agency theorists, and suggest that the bond between player and agent has been eroded by agents' relationships with sponsoring corporations.

Researchers that have used agency theory predictions of monitoring and incentive alignment that focus solely on principal-agent relationships at the organizational level have been unable to rationalize the use and design of stock options within organizations. In the early 1990s, stock options were virtually free, but eventually, organizations were required to disclose the value of the options in the footnotes of their financial statements. This imperative ignited a battle between agents (and their advocates) who opposed the formal accounting of options and shareholders (and their advocates) who changed their opinions about options over time. In this article, we develop a model to explain how the varying pressures across the various stages of institutionalization cannot only explain how principals and agents are influenced by the institutional environment in making options compensation decisions, but also when and how these parties will shape institutional contexts at the field level to encourage, perpetuate, or delegitimate the stock option arrangements that these actors prefer.

The paper offers a property rights and monitoring cost explanation for the allocation of residual income and decision rights between the carriers and truck drivers under internal governance. First, by applying the property rights theory, we argue that the structure of residual income rights depends on the importance of noncontractible (intangible) assets of the truck driver to generate residual surplus. The more important the truck driver's intangible knowledge assets, the more residual income rights should be transferred to him. Second, we controlled for the monitoring costs as an additional explanatory variable of the allocation of residual income rights. According to agency theory, the variable proportion of the driver's income should be higher where monitoring costs are higher. Third, we investigate the relationship between residual income and residual decision rights under internal governance. If the contractual relation is governed by an employment contract, residual decision and residual income rights may be substitutes because, under fiat, a certain incentive effect of the governance structure may result either from the allocation of high-powered incentives or the transfer of residual decision rights to the driver. These hypotheses were tested by using data from the Hungarian trucking industry. The data provide partial support for the hypotheses. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines China's transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to competitive privatised entities. With China's move toward an open market society, the Chinese government saw the need to privatise some of the SOEs. Using Agency Theory and Ramamurti's three-tiered model of privatisation as a theoretical framework, we chronicle the transformation of six Chinese SOEs that have used advanced management systems to make themselves viable market contenders and competitive enterprises. Finally, we showcase one firm, Chongqing CHN & CHN Ceramics Co., Ltd. (C&C), a company well on its way to becoming a leader in the global ceramics market. (c) 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Elena Rocco 1. INTRODUCTION A large number of heterogeneous human relations, like transactions, delegation, teamwork, promises, are based on trust. As a consequence, different disciplines have contributed from different perspectives to the study of trust (Rousseau et al. 1998; Kramer and Tyler 1996). A shared view in this multidisciplinary debate is that is that there is no trust without risk (Deutsch 1958; Currall 1990; March and Shapiro 1987). Formal control and coordination mechanisms have been devised to reduce the amount of risk associated to trust, for example, escrow account, control procedures and hierarchical control (Thompson 1967; Mintzberg 1979). Nevertheless, these mechanisms reduce risks to the extent we can identify and predict the range of threats to trust. In the face of an unforeseeable event, either intentional or unintentional, if the trustee does not behave as the trustor would have expected to, the trust-based relation is likely to be undermined. Economic models, like the agency theory (Alchian and Demsetz 1972) and the transaction costs perspective (Williamson 1985), have focused on opportunism as the main threat to trust. Opportunistic behavior often leads to intentional actions unknown to the trustor and detrimental to his own interest (Williamson 1985; Gambetta 1988). Beyond opportunism, other elements may undermine trust. Trust may indeed be weakened by unintentional action by the trustee. For instance, the employee may act in the interest of her manager but not as he would have expected to. Similarly, tacit coordination in teams works as long as individuals can rely on each other's.... (c) Katinka Bijlsma-Frankema and Rosalinde Klein Woolthuis 2005.

In this theoretical paper we are investigating the important question of why, in the face of strong evidence that mergers and acquisitions (M&As) do not generate returns for acquiring company shareholders, CEOs continue to pursue these strategies. Drawing on a variety of theoretical perspectives, we argue that the firm's agents (the CEO and executives) and M&A promoters (investment bankers, lawyers and other advisors) have developed non-efficiency based relationships in the context of increased competitive pressures and a crisis in corporate ethics. The key theoretical point is that the nexus between CEOs, professional advisors and boards provides a more compelling explanation for the observed merger preference phenomenon than either the agency problem or the promoter effect on their own. Implications of the model for practice, research and theory building are discussed. (c) 2005 Yoser Gadhoum.

This article seeks to link the domains of corporate governance, investment policies, competitive asymmetries, and sustainable capabilities. Conditions such as concentrated ownership, lengthy tenures, and profound business expertise give some family-controlled business (FCB) owners the discretion, incentive, knowledge, and ultimately, the resources to invest deeply in the future of the firm. These long-term investments accrue from particular governance conditions and engender competitive asymmetries - organizational qualities that are hard for other firms to copy, and thus, if tied to the value chain, create capabilities that are sustainable. Investments in staff and training, e.g., create tacit knowledge and preserve it within the firm. Investments in enduring relationships with partners enhance access to resources and free firms to focus on core competencies. And devotion to a compelling mission dedicates most of these investments to a core competency. When such investments are farsighted, orchestrated, and ongoing, capabilities will tend to evolve in a cumulative trajectory, making them doubly hard to imitate and thereby extending competitive advantage. Arguments are supported by making reference to the literature on corporate governance and agency theory and to emerging research on FCBs. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Corporate social performance (CSP) is increasingly viewed as an important business outcome by researchers, investors, and society as a whole. Furthermore, empirical research indicates that CSP is positively related to corporate financial performance. These considerations lead to the question of whether CEO pay is properly structured to provide incentive to the CEO to improve firm CSP. In a sample of 313 firms, the authors found that a short-term CEO pay focus was negatively related to CSP, whereas a long-term focus was positively related to CSP. Implications of these results for future research and CEO pay design are presented. (c) 2006 Southern Management Association. All rights reserved.

Agency theory suggests that the interests of opportunistic, self-interested agents conflict with those of principals. Stewardship theory suggests instead that executives' interests are aligned with company interests and that executives are thus more intrinsically motivated than agency theory implies. This study develops hypotheses regarding the psychological and situational factors that affect the applicability of each theory to executive compensation. I tested hypotheses using a unique data set of 1,238 executives from 528 private companies. Results suggest significant differences between founder-stewards and nonfounder agents that diminish with company growth, and significant effects of equity ownership and outside rounds of financing.

Prior research over several decades has catalogued many positive motives underlying firms' decisions to engage in joint ventures and other forms of alliances. In this empirical analysis, we investigate whether agency problems brought about by the separation of ownership and control also stimulate the development of firms' joint venture portfolios. By focusing on joint ventures, as opposed to diversification in general or acquisitions, we address the recent debate on agency theory's domain. Results from a sample of U.S. manufacturing firms' alliance portfolios offer supporting evidence, and comparable findings are obtained for international and domestic joint ventures. Agency hazards are also found to bring about extensions of firms' nonequity alliance portfolios in both the international and domestic settings. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This article assesses the corporate governance-related antecedents of nomination committee adoption, and the impact of nomination committees' existence and their composition on board independence and board demographic diversity. We conducted a longitudinal study of board composition amongst 210 Swiss public companies from January 2001 through December 2003, a period during which the Swiss (Stock) Exchange (SWX) introduced new corporate governance-related disclosure guidelines. We find firms with nomination committees are more likely to have a higher number of independent and foreign directors, but not more likely to have a higher number of female board members. Further, the existence of nomination committees is associated with a higher degree of nationality diversity but is not related to board educational diversity. We also find that nomination committee composition matters in the nomination of independent and foreign, but not of female directors. Our results suggest that understanding different board roles and composition require a multi-theoretical approach, and that agency theory, resource-dependence theory and group effectiveness theory help to explain different aspects of board composition and effectiveness. Finally, the article discusses the concept of diversity and appropriate ways to study diversity in a boardroom context. (c) Springer 2006.

This study investigated the tenure of CEOs in a sample of 304 listed companies in Taiwan; 63 firms were family controlled, 241 were not. The results show that CEO turnover is significantly lower in family firms and its relationship to corporate performance is negative. CEO ownership and board ownership are not significant in explaining the length of family CEO tenure. These findings imply that family boards can still effectively replace the CEO despite relatively low ownership. From the ownership structure perspective, this study suggested that the agency theory is applicable for nonfamily firms in Taiwan, but unsuitable for family firms.

This article discusses agency problems in sport organizations in which the same individuals are involved in both the management and control of decision making. We focus our analysis on the case of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by reviewing the behavior of selected IOC members with regard to the bidding process for the Olympic Games and the resulting reform attempts made by the IOC in an effort to address issues of corruption. After a review of examples of corrupt behavior on the part of IOC members, agency theory is introduced to discuss IOC reforms and provide some suggestions for future reform. We propose incorporating other stakeholders (in addition to the IOC members), such as corporate partners, media conglomerates, and other members of the Olympic movement (e.g., athletes, coaches, officials), into management and control functions. More specifically, it is suggested that these stakeholders comprise a board that oversees the operations of the IOC (similar to the IOC's current executive committee) and be given the ability to remove and/or sanction IOC members who act self-interestedly to the detriment of the Olympic movement. Thus, by delegating the control function of decision making to a board and the management function to internal agents, greater accountability for all organization members can be achieved.

Purpose - To improve the understanding of the inter-organizational dynamics of the dyadic relationships between a buyer and provider of logistics services (TPL dyads). Design/methodology/approach - Analyzes the preparation, implementation, and operation of a particular case of third party logistics (TPL) arrangements. Based on a single case study of a dyadic relationship, the paper confronts the static view of the transaction cost approach and the agency theory on "governance structures" and "contracts" by showing how "relationship governance" emerges and develops over time. Findings - TPL dyads are subject to both controllable and non-controllable forces of change, which may not always have a positive effect on the logistics performance or the relationship itself. Inter-organizational dynamics not only relate to learning, competence development, or adaptation, as suggested by other studies, but also to how the dyadic relationships are governed. As the dyad accumulates experience over time, changes will occur in the balance between the two parties in terms of goal congruence and risk preferences, which has a strong influence on the nature of contracts and other safeguards governing the relationship. Similarly, explanatory power of theories applicable to inter-organizational settings may vary as relationships emerge and develop over time. Focus on core competencies as the logic of outsourcing is followed by a period characterized by a principal-agent relationship. To ensure further prosperity of the relationship, the two companies must direct their efforts towards the logic of the network approach. Originality/value - Contributes to a cross-disciplinary fertilization of the SCM field, in particular inter-organizational relationships. (c) 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

This paper discusses the merits of purchasing firms of pursuing a focused commitment strategy (FCS) with suppliers. An FCS involves committing long-term investments with a limited number of suppliers to achieve superior performance. Drawing upon transaction cost theory, agency theory and the knowledge-based view, a basis is provided for comparisons of the benefits and risks of such a strategy. Using data gathered from 224 US manufacturing firms, support for the hypothesized trade-offs associated with an FCS is examined. The findings support such trade-offs, suggesting that operational benefits accrue from increasing levels of focused commitment beyond unfocused levels - but only up to a point. The results indicate that firms pursuing above-average levels of focused commitment may be subject to risks that offset transactional and scale-related benefits. Detriments from too much focused commitment erode the firm's manufacturing-based competitive performance. In addition, the evidence indicates that profitability and market share growth also suffer. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for managers and for future research.

This chapter reviews the interorganizational accounting literature. There are two different types of interorganizational settings that have been covered within the literature: dyadic relationships between two collaborating companies and networks where a relationship is seen as embedded in a set of relationships. The emphasis on intensive and long-term relationships can be associated with a number of interorganizational accounting practices, such as open-book accounting, target costing, interorganizational cost management, value-chain accounting, integrated information systems, total cost of ownership, nonfinancial measurement, and informal control mechanisms. Published papers within the literature have applied a mixture of theoretical models, such as transaction cost economics, agency theory, actor network theory, and the industrial-network approach.

As the debate over appropriate compensation disclosure continues, some firms have volunteered to recognize stock option costs within their income statements. On the one hand, stock option expensing can significantly enhance the legitimacy of the organization and restore shareholders' confidence in corporate governance practices. On the other hand, expensing stock options could decrease firm earnings, leading to unfavorable comparisons to non-expensing firms. Our logit analysis of 402 S&P firms lends partial support to agency theory explanations for stock option expensing; these results depend on the costs associated with expensing. We find stronger support for the institutional theory perspective that mimetic pressures significantly increase the likelihood that firms will expense stock options, independent of the cost. Our findings have important governance implications, suggesting a more complex model of compensation disclosure in which social pressures dominate voluntary compensation disclosure decisions.

Purpose - The paper seeks to explain the collaborative intent, trust development, and conflict resolution in a headquarters-subsidiary relationship in a new product launch context in an emerging market. Design/methodology/ approach - Grounded theory development is employed through personal interviews with senior executives of selected multinational firms operating in Turkey. Findings - A major challenge in collaboration is convincing both parties to the dyad that the expertise of the other party is essential for effective collaboration. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based solely on looking at the subsidiary side of the subsidiary-HQ dyad in a single country, which limits their generalizability. Since we did not interview the HQ side of this dyad, speculations made about the possible reactions of HQ personnel to subsidiary actions must be interpreted with caution. Practical implications - The perceptions of both parties play a far more important role than the facts or perceptions of just one party when it comes to relationships and conflict resolution. Both parties need to pay more attention to the possible causes of means incongruence and take perception gaps and the other side's needs and expertise into account when approaching collaboration and conflict resolution. Originality/value - Agency theory is extended to a multinational firm-subsidiary context in order to suggest mechanisms for resolving conflict through increased communication, greater trust in each other's capabilities, and greater collaboration in meeting common challenges. A diagnostic and prescriptive framework and mechanisms are also offered through which disruptive conflict can be transformed into functional conflict and collaboration.

I argue and found that the effectiveness of a firm's monitoring mechanisms to prevent managerial opportunism in acquisitions becomes more important under high environmental complexity and/or dynamism because of the increased information asymmetry between investors and top executives under these conditions. I also found that increased monitoring under non-complex and/or stable environments may be viewed negatively by investors, and that symbolic information about governance arrangements affects investors' evaluations of managerial opportunism in acquisitions. The results highlight the need for more research on factors that influence the explanatory power of agency theory. (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Although agency theory purportedly applies to a very broad range of organizations and suggests strategies for governing ali types of workers, very little agency theory research has involved professional organizations. Such research is needed to support generalizing agency theory's predictions to professional organizations and to guide managers in professional firms as they make decisions about their firms' governance structures. Furthermore, although professional organizations increasingly use contract professionals to provide services to clients, there has been very little research examining the governance of contract professionals. Because professionals who work on a contract basis have a different relationship with organizations than do employees or partners, agency theory suggests that professional organizations would govern them differently. This study examines whether one important type of professi onal organization, medical groups, use stronger monitoring and incentive mechanisms to govern contract physicians than they use with member physicians. We final no differences in the monitoring mechanisms used (collecting information about or requiring ratification of the physicians' decisions), but medical groups do use more incentive compensation with contract professionals when the medical group is paid by capitation. Overall, our results are not what we would have expected based on agency theory. We discuss the implications of our results for agency theory and for the governance of contract professionals, and highlight the need for further research in this area.

Today, the global economy is undergoing some dramatic changes in the organisation of the workplace and the manner in which employees are paid. The growing use of teams in the workplace has led to an increasing number of incentive systems designed to motivate and increase team performance. As a field aiming to develop and unleash human expertise for the purposes of improving performance, Human Resources heavily utilises the workteam method as one of its practice tools. Agency theory further provides a dimension in understanding the dynamics of team-based compensation. Copyright (c) 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Moral choice, as a precursor to behaviour, has an important influence on the success or failure of business entities. According to Rest, 1983, Morality, Moral Behavior and Moral Development (John Wiley & Sons, New York), moral choice is prompted, amongst other things, by a motivational component. With this in mind, data obtained from a sample of four hundred financial sector operatives, employed in a rapidly developing region of China, was used to construct a relatively stable set of motivational typologies which could be used to predict choice within an agency-based context. A non-egoist version of the agency theory was developed, which permitted the modelling of alternative heuristic patterns. Altruists and persons identified as bordering on the verge of being classified as psychological egoists, refused to reorganize their motives when responding to a problem that included both moral hazard and adverse selection criteria. It was also possible to identify certain personal and contextual issues which discriminated between the typologies. (c) Springer 2006.

For the last two decades or more, agency theory has provided the dominant guiding framework for the research of governance. Despite the results of this effort being described as "remarkably inconsistent not only with the theory but with each other" (Daily, Dalton and Rajagopalan, 2003, p. 152) there have been few attempts to offer alternate paradigms for research. The result of this limitation is that several academics and commentators have had cause to publicly acknowledge that we actually know little about governance. Our understanding of the relationship between governance and subsequent organisational performance is at best haphazard, at worst, little more than an assumption. One attempt at breaking this stalemate concerns venturing into the 'black box' (LeBlanc and Schwartz, 2004), an activity that requires a different battery of research skills including a range of qualitative research methods, direct observation of practice, oral histories, case studies, interventions, action research and the analysis of decision-making. Few of these practices sit comfortably within the normal science (Kuhn, 1970) practices of much governance research conducted to date. The aim of this paper is to discuss the attributes of such black box research, identify various approaches to its conduct and to present a brief summary of interim results from a range of research activities in progress in New Zealand. The primary aim of the research 'agenda' informing these activities is firstly, to determine how a relationship between governance and subsequent organisational performance may operate given the complexities of such an approach and to identify whether specific attributes (either governance architecture or board capabilities) actually influence organisational outcomes. Results to date offer a tentative glimpse at what may be effective governance. In time, they may seriously challenge the relevance of much current research and what is increasingly being promoted by various agencies and accepted by practitioners as best practice.

This research shows female financial sector employees acting as moral agents demonstrate high levels of adversity to risk compared to their male counterparts, reducing the likelihood that they would report unethical work practices. The degree of risk and its effect on moral choice is dependent on the interaction of age, education and employment status.

We introduce the concept that internal organizational agents who negotiate starting salary packages with job applicants may not always act in the organization's best interests. To gain an understanding of what motivates the internal agent toward assuming a particular role, we use expectancy theory, agency theory and concepts from the negotiations literature. We describe the roles that agents may assume, identify factors that impact agents' motivation, and formulate propositions to help identify which role an agent is likely to enact in starting salary negotiations. We form propositions as to how these roles are likely to impact final negotiation outcomes of probability of hiring, salary size, and applicant satisfaction and discuss strategies for ensuring agents are motivated to enact a role that meets organizational objectives.

Since the late 1980s, the trend towards outsourcing of information systems has continued unabated. Much research has focused on reasons why companies outsource (Ang and Cummings 1997, Ang and Straub 1998, Lacity and Hirschheim 1993, Lacity and Willcocks 2000, Slaughter and Ang 1996), but, more recently, research has shifted the focus away from the causes of outsourcing to how companies manage outsourcing contracts (Ang and Beath 1993, Ang and Endeshaw 1997, Ang and Slaughter 2001, DiRomualdo and Gurbaxani 1998). The experience of outsourcing has been mixed. While some companies have attained desired results with IT outsourcing, others have faced significant difficulties in managing the change (for example, see Ang and Toh 1998). One challenge, then, is to understand how organizations successfully manage outsourcing contracts. One form of outsourcing that is commonly practiced is that of spin-offs, examples of which can be found in organizations such as American Airlines, Baxter Healthcare, and Philips Electronics (Willcocks and Lacity 1998). In this form of outsourcing, an IT department (including the employees, systems, and operations) within an organization gets "spun-off" into a separate external entity, becoming empowered to behave as an external vendor and having to focus on new issues such as marketing, customer service, and offering competitive prices to the clients (Ang and Koh 2000, Willcocks and Lacity 1998). In addition, the IT employees formally leave their organization and are transplanted to the new spin-off company, which employs them and offers their services back to th original employer for a service fee. Even though these transplants still provide services to the original organization, it no longer directly employs them. Instead, the spin-off company is the new employer and is responsible for the management and supervision of these transplants, including compensating them and assigning them to specific clients (Ang and Slaughter 2002). In other words, the status of the transplants relative to the original employer changes from subordinates to thirdparty contractors. The advantages for a client organization of using transplants (as opposed to nontransplants) are numerous. Due to the transplants prior experience with the client organization, they are familiar with the operations and procedures of the organization and need not invest as much time and effort to understand its fundamental problems and opportunities. Also, because these transplants (or contractors) are former subordinates of the client-managers, the latter should possess a deeper knowledge of contractor competencies and skills and, consequently, be more effective in supervising them. There is an alternative hypothesis about the efficacy of using transplants. From their prior experience in supervising the contractors (as subordinates), clientmanagers may have developed clear expectations about what the contractors should provide to the organization, such as a requisite level of work, effort, and commitment. Evidence from social psychology suggests that expectations and beliefs are not readily subject to change, even in the face of disconfirming evidence (e.g., Anderson et al. 1980). Hence, if prior expectations persist into the IT outsourcing relationship, client-managers would tend to think of these contractors as subordinates, imposing on them role expectations that are not appropriate under the new contractual relationship. After outsourcing, clientmanagers no longer possess the legitimate power previously accorded them as a function of their position in the formal organizational hierarchy. Consequently, conflicts concerning the responsibilities of contractors can (and do) arise between the two parties, which may prove difficult to resolve and, in the worst case, contribute to failure of the outsourcing arrangement. The objective of this study is to examine managerial attitudes and expectations toward transplants in IT spin-off arrangements. Specifically, we focus on the phenomenon of persistent expectations by exploring the conditions under which managerial expectations persist and the effect on managerial evaluation of contractor performance. We first draw on literature in social and cognitive psychology, particularly research in belief perseverance, as well as agency theory, to offer theoretical lenses for the phenomenon of persistent expectations. We then adopt a mixed-method approach to empirically develop and test a model of persistent expectations (Creswell 1994, Tashakkori and Teddlie 1998). Using persistent expectations as the focal a priori construct, this approach adopts a twophase design, the first of which involves a qualitative (case study) approach (Eisenhardt 1989a). In this approach, we have the construct in mind and use case study techniques (more generally, qualitative techniques) to develop a model of persistent expectations. This leads to an empirical understanding of the phenomenon and results in the development of the persistent expectations model. This model, together with formal hypotheses on the antecedents and consequences of persistent expectations, is further elaborated upon by drawing on extant theories on agency theory, schema formation, and belief perseverance. Using a field/study/survey approach, we empirically test the model and its hypotheses in the second phase of the approach. After discussing the results of the second study, we conclude with implications for future research.

This article examines the effects of monitoring on interfirm relationships. Whereas some research suggests that monitoring can serve as a control mechanism that reduces exchange partner opportunism, there is also evidence showing that monitoring can actually promote such behavior. The authors propose that the actual effect of monitoring depends on (1) the form of monitoring used (output versus behavior) and (2) the context in which monitoring takes place. With regard to the form of monitoring, the results from a longitudinal field study of buyer-supplier relationships show that output monitoring decreases partner opportunism, as transaction cost and agency theory predict, whereas behavior monitoring, which is a more obtrusive form of control, increases partner opportunism. With regard to the context, the authors find that informal relationship elements in the form of microlevel social contracts serve as buffers that both enhance the effects of output monitoring and permit behavior monitoring to suppress opportunism in the first place.

We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This paper investigates how governance mechanisms affect the ability of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to introduce strategic change. Previous research typically assumes that governance mechanisms operate independently of each other. Building on agency theory and insights from the literature on small firm governance, we hypothesize that governance variables related to ownership, the board of directors and the top management team all affect strategic change and that it is important to examine the interaction effects of these governance mechanisms. Using a longitudinal sample of over 800 SMEs, our general logic and hypotheses are supported by the analyses. We find that closely held firms exhibit less strategic change than do SMEs relying on more widespread ownership structures. However, to some extent, closely held firms can overcome these weaknesses and achieve strategic change by utilizing outside directors on the board and/or extending the size of the top management teams. Implications for theory and management practice in SMEs are discussed. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Challenging agency theory prescriptions for board composition, we contend that the boards of young firms that have recently gone public are best comprised of a majority of original top management team (TMT) members, rather than independent outsiders. We argue that such board members possess valuable tacit knowledge of the firms and their entrepreneurial visions and are in the best position to provide oversight. We additionally argue that outsiders should provide resources that firms' TMTs might use to execute their strategies, rather than monitor the TMTs. Our results from 1996-97 data on 524 initial public offerings support our contentions. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

This field study investigated contextual antecedents of free riding by franchisees on franchisor brand reputation and effects of free riding on performance in a multinational corporation's franchising network. Structural elements (increased formalization, decentralized decision-making), interactions between franchisor representatives and franchisee dealers, and market-related factors (external competition) were associated with lower levels of franchisee free riding. The findings also indicated that free riding has deleterious effects on franchisee performance. The results support theoretical arguments that both economic and social exchange perspectives are valuable in examining free riding and provide important practical guidance in designing and managing franchise systems.

Common prescriptions for improving the performance of supermarket retailers center on using key suppliers as "category captains" and leveraging their resources and capabilities to implement effective category management that will both reduce retailer costs and provide a basis for differentiation. However, despite these widespread prescriptions, the potential for supplier opportunism means that supermarket retailers are either skeptical or have failed to make such category management relationships with key suppliers work. Drawing on agency, transaction costs, and network theory, we synthesize insights from qualitative fieldwork with retailer and supplier managers and primary data from 73 category managers in U.K. supermarket retailers to empirically examine antecedents and consequences of category-level focal supplier opportunism. Our findings suggest that focal supplier opportunism decreases retailer category performance and increases militant behaviors among non-focal suppliers in the category supply chain. Consistent with retailer fears, we find that focal suppliers with significant influence in retailers' category management efforts are more likely to engage in opportunistic behavior. However, our results also reveal that retailer fears that being dependent on a focal supplier will lead to greater supplier opportunism are largely unfounded, while supplier dependence on the retailer is also unrelated to focal supplier opportunism. Finally, we find that retailers' ability to monitor - but not to punish - its focal suppliers is negatively related to opportunistic behavior among focal suppliers. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Pure incentive schemes rely on the agent's self-interest, rather than more coercive control, to motivate subordinates. Yet most organizations, and in particular public agencies, rely very little on pure incentive contracts and instead use coercive mechanisms of monitoring and sanctioning that many theorists find objectionable. We use principal-agency theory to investigate the problem. Principal-agency theory has tacitly assumed throughout that it is in the principal's interests to find a set of incentives that induce efficient levels of effort from the agent. We show that this is not necessarily the case. We identify a problem we denote as "the principal's moral hazard constraint" in which bonuses large enough to produce the efficient incentive effect are prohibitively expensive for the principal. Potential solutions to this problem - involving penalization or joint ownership - are unavailable in the public sphere. This means that for a large class of control problems in agencies, the principal's self-interest will result in the inefficient use of monitoring and oversight rather than outcome-contingent incentives. Although monitoring is often thought of as resulting from the agent's moral hazard, it can just as reasonably be seen as resulting from the principal's moral hazard.

While corporate governance research has had some success tying boards' demographic characteristics to relatively distant outcomes such as CEO pay and succession, numerous studies have indicated that a major weakness of this research is that it has largely ignored the intervening behaviours associated with board vigilance. This study begins to answer this call by examining the relationship between boards' demographic characteristics and boards' information-gathering behaviour. Using primary and secondary data from 149 firms, this study finds that an increase in the proportion of outside directors on a board is associated with an increase in boards' information quality and proactive information-seeking. In addition, an increase in outside director tenure is associated with boards exchanging information more frequently. Consistent with agency theory predictions, these findings suggest that vigilant boards are likely to take actions aimed at reducing the level of information asymmetry between them and their CEOs.

As outsourced and multinational IT projects become more common, managing risks for these projects is increasingly important. The research reported here examines key risks identified by Hong Kong vendor project managers working on both local and international package implementation projects. In addition to the typical risks that threaten project outcome success, respondents noted location-specific risks on their multinationalprojects. They also distinguished threats to the satisfactory process of the project, and threats to their own firms from competitors and feom potential damage to their reputation arising from customer dissatisfaction with either the outcomes or the process of the project. Using an agency theory perspective, this broader focus is examined in the light of differing definitions of project success for clients and outsource providers. Copyright (c) 2007, Idea Group Inc.

The authors examine the moderating effects of conscientiousness on the relationships between agency controls and effort and agency controls and task performance. Results show that less conscientious individuals appear to increase effort through incentive alignment and monitoring, whereas conscientious individuals do not shirk with or without agency controls. Furthermore, results show that less conscientious individuals increase task performance through incentive alignment, but not through monitoring. The study confirms that motivation to act opportunistically differs between individuals unlike what is assumed by agency theory. Also, incentive alignment may be more effective than monitoring when attempting to align principal and agent interests. (c) 2007 Sage Publications.

This paper analyzes the relationship between investors and private equity managers in order to identify the factors that affect the latter's reputation. Since there are no individual references about their past returns in developing private equity markets, the reputation of such players is thought to be linked to their capacity for obtaining new funds. Results provide evidence of the volume of investments recorded in the past, the ratio of portfolio companies to investment manager, the percentage of divestments carried out through initial public offerings and trade sales, the membership of the national private equity association and the size of funds under management as characteristics of the highest importance in raising funds.

To understand the evolving perspectives and behaviour of directors and institutional investors, field research was conducted in 2004-2005 by way of a survey with corporate directors in four countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States; n = 658) and institutional investors in Canada (n = 34). Reported changes in directors' views and practices are substantial and consistent across countries, the defining characteristic of which is a fundamental shift in the positioning of the board toward becoming a strategic partner to management. The role of institutional investors also shifted in ways that are complementary to this new role of directors (e.g., toward increased monitoring). While most research has focused on agency concepts of the board as monitors of management, our research suggests that the board is evolving towards a more collaborative role with management, consistent with stewardship theory. Our findings also suggest that directors are seeking a balance between collaboration and their role as monitors of management, rejecting the notion of the board as primarily a monitoring body. An evolutionary model is offered to explain these changes and implications are discussed. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Agency theory focuses on monitoring and incentives as two solutions to agency problems. Prior research suggests that monitoring and incentives may act either as substitutes or as complements, and that the context of the agency relationship plays a major role in determining the direction of the relationship between them. In a corporate governance setting, we contend that board information and boards' usage of CEO control mechanisms are best viewed as complements. Thus, we hypothesize that boards' information gathering behaviour will be positively related to boards' usage of CEO control mechanisms. Using primary and secondary data from 149 US firms, we find that increases in boards' information gathering are associated with increases in boards' usage of managerial controls. These findings suggest that information and managerial control mechanisms act as complements in the governance context, and that boards take a variety of actions to protect the interests of shareholders.

This paper undertakes two related tasks to augment current understanding regarding vendor-owned inventory management (VOIM) arrangements implemented in the retail industry. The first task formally juxtaposes three prevalent forms of VOIM arrangements (i.e., Consignment, Pay-On-Scan, and Scan-Based Trading) to one another and identifies three dimensions (i.e., Relevant Data Visibility, Timeliness of Information Release, and Shrink Responsibility) that serve to discriminate among them. The second task applies an Agency Theory lens to uncover differing profiles of characteristics underlying the retailer-vendor relationship across the Consignment, Pay-On-Scan, and Scan-Based Trading arrangements. These conceptual results contribute to and have implications for the science and practice of VOIM arrangements in the retail industry. 2007 Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals

This study of risk sharing in the Italian high precision air conditioning (AC) industry confirms agency theory predictions that buyers absorb risk to a non-negligible degree, and that they absorb more risk (a) the greater the supplier's environmental uncertainty, (b) the more risk averse the supplier, and (c) the less severe the supplier's moral hazard. The analyzed buyers accommodate for unforeseen and uncontracted-for cost fluctuations, which is consistent with relational contract theory. The study clarifies the relationship between risk sharing and the supplier's size, technological capability, financial stability, and cost fluctuation. It also suggests how buyers may adjust their risk-sharing strategy as suppliers grow, develop technological capabilities, and change financial structure. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose - This paper proposes a methodology for governing expatriate assignments in the context of corporate-level objectives. Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken is to envisage expatriate managerial assignments within the theoretical framework of agency theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm. The paper begins with the view that knowledge acquisition and integration is a primary goal for most expatriate assignments. The relationship between expatriate managers and multinational corporation (MNC) headquarters from an agency perspective are considered and the notion of a "knowledge contract" as a means of governing that relationship is discussed. Four corporate-level international strategies available to MNCs (global, international, transnational, and multidomestic) are then examined and the extent of agency problems under each strategy is discussed. Findings - The paper makes specific predictions about the type of knowledge contract that is most likely to address agency problems for each corporate strategy. Originality/value - This research extends agency theory by introducing the knowledge contract as a means of managing agency concerns. This offers a broader range of contract alternatives, moving researchers beyond traditional agency theoretic prescriptions. The research also contributes to the literature on expatriate management by integrating assignment success with research on corporate-level international strategy. Few authors have recognized organizational strategy as an important unit of study in international human resource management. Doing so, however, has yielded a unique set of contingency relationships that would otherwise be obscured.

Recent scandals in the business world have intensified the demand for an explanation of the causes of corporate wrongdoing. This study empirically tests the effects of mutual fund management fees and control structures on the likelihood of illegal activity within mutual fund organizations. Specific attention is given to the presence of agency duality issues in the mutual fund industry and how this influences the motivations and decisions of fund managers. Findings provide support for the hypothesized relationship that higher levels of management fees decrease the likelihood of illegal behavior. Additionally, control of the mutual fund by external management is found to have a negative impact on the likelihood of illegal activity while also acting as a moderator of the management fee-illegal behavior relationship.

Sumantra Ghoshal, in his recent Academy of Management Learning & Education article, argued that management theories currently taught in MBA programs are the causal factor in triggering (a), the recent wave of corporate scandals in the United States and (b), lack of theory building for contemporary management. He identified the dominance in graduate business education of agency theory as the primary culprit for these problems. In this essay I outline how a cognitive philosophy of science shift in the business school culture from Thomas Kuhn's normal science paradigm framework to Karl Popper's revolutionary science methodology would mitigate many of the dysfunctions Ghoshal catalogues. This position is based on published literature, contemporary trends in management theory, and teaching graduate courses in the administrative sciences. I also suggest that, if such a transition is not made, MBA programs will continue to lose both societal and organizational legitimacy. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

This article classifies empirical research on vertical integration under four approaches - value-added-to-sales, qualitative-quantitative, input-output, and microanalytic. The emphasis here is on the microanalytic approach which has accumulated the most systematic evidence to support its theoretical propositions. In particular, this article emphasizes theoretical and empirical contributions from organizational economics (especially transaction costs and agency theories) for both vertical integration and (vertical) contracting. Limitations and methodological challenges concerning the empirical testing of theories of vertical integration are addressed and suggestions for further research are provided. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explains, through a field study and from an agency perspective, how monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms change to support the interests of a privatized firm's new ownership. In this case, privatization led to important changes in the board of directors and to more formal performance evaluation and compensation systems for top managers, as profitability and financial control gained relevancy with the firm ownership change. Our results show that differences in incentives management before and after privatization are due to different agency relations in the two periods. We also argue that in a privatization framework the relation between monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms is complex, not simply substitutive as agency theory would predict, and this finding allows us to refine and extend agency theory for this specific context.

This paper presents a model for the governance of radical innovation (RI) efforts within the firm. A longitudinal study of 12 large established companies committed to develop and institutionalize a radical innovation capability are used to inform our work. Thus the firm, rather than the RI project, is the unit of analysis for this work. We draw on Agency Theory, Firm Level Governance, Stewardship Theory and Stakeholder Theory as well to enrich the model. We find that none of these theoretical frames adequately describes the issues faced by companies as they build governance systems to oversee high risk, high uncertainty innovation portfolios. A series of propositions is offered based on the data analysis and extant literature that address board composition, decision style and decision processes that, we believe, enhance a company's ability to generate and commercialize radical innovations.

This paper reports interview-based research examining reasons for the continued increase in executive directors' remuneration in large UK companies. This issue has not specifically been addressed by previous studies, which have focused on the level of the increases, rather than their underlying explanations. Reasons given for making changes included: increases due to being below-market; changing performance-related schemes that did not pay out or paid less than expected; changes in the company's culture or strategy; changes to senior personnel; and compliance with good practice in human resource management and in corporate governance. The results are analysed through two theoretical lenses. Agency theory provides an explanation of the structure of the contracts; expectancy theory suggests why schemes might be changed to motivate the executives. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Corporate governance (CG) needs to acknowledge the intentional part of governance, where an actor of governance uses the set of corporate governance mechanisms in order to influence the agent to create a performance that will satisfy the interest of the principal. This paper offers a conception of this activity through the concept of governance strategy. The concept is based on a property right approach and derived within the context of agency theory, stressing the interest and the capacity of the principal. It is applied to two empirical organisations seldom investigated in CG research: the organisation of multinational corporations in a business group and the organisation of a riding school in a democratic not-for-profit association, thereby extending the relevance of the concept from corporate governance to organizational governance. The empirical analysis indicates the relevance of the conception and suggests further extension through hypotheses of governance strategy related to environmental influence, accessibility of governance mechanisms and momentum of mechanisms.

Agency Theory is normally used to explain the relationship between the managers of a corporation and its owners, or shareholders, and to legitimate the payment of share options, and other remuneration mechanisms, to those managers on the basis that this will align the interests of the managers of a corporation with those of its owners. The paper aims to argue that this outworn legitimation is not just based on a bankrupt theory but is actually deleterious to corporate performance, managerial behaviour and the relationship between managers, shareholders and other stakeholders. The approach is to examine the behaviour of the managers of The Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies ("Shell") as they have continued to reinterpret accounting regulations, reclassify oil reserves and re-report past and probable/possible future performance of the company. The argument is predicated in the assertion that in the relationship between owners and managers of such a corporation there are actually no principals and therefore there can be no agents. Furthermore, the rewards structure developed from the theory provides a motivation for managerial misrepresentation leading to a situation in which principles are defunct. The Social Contract between all stakeholders to a corporation has been reinvigorated as a basis for sustainable performance, with consequent implications for the behaviour of all parties to the contract. The paper illustrates that evidence abounds showing that corporations do not have any sense of social responsibility and do not feel constrained by any kind of ethical code, no matter what their corporate literature states, but that there are an increasing number of stakeholders to organisations who are demanding accountability - and forcing corporations to respond accordingly.

This chapter explains how the agency theory can be used to prevent a development of divergent interests between the management team and investors after a management buy-out (MBO). Agency costs are caused by increased costs of monitoring by the investor to overcome the problems of self-interest, risk aversion, goal conflict, and information asymmetry. The chapter focuses MBOs divested from foreign or local parent companies, of which the majority of the equity after the MBO is owned by venture capitalist. The chapter focuses on the agency costs of equity and debt by analyzing the monitoring role of venture capitalists, the goal congruence between the new shareholders, the financial unification, and the repayment of debt. These mechanisms motivate managers to look for efficiencies to protect the firm against the downside risks as well as for new market opportunities to use the firms' upside potential. Examples are efficiencies in investment programs, in cutting overhead cost, and in disposal of assets. The mechanisms reduce the agency problem by stimulating the agent to make decisions that are in the interest of the principal and result in an improvement of economic performance after the MBO.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This is a cross-sectional study of the relation between corporate governance and voluntary disclosure in Ireland. Research Findings/Results: We report clear evidence that voluntary disclosure increases with the number of nonexecutive directors on the board. Firms that have a nonexecutive chairman make greater voluntary disclosures than other firms. This finding is not robust to the inclusion of other explanatory variables. We find no evidence that ownership structure is related to voluntary disclosure. Theoretical Implications: The results regarding nonexecutive directors are interpreted as independent boards facilitating a reduction in information asymmetry between owners and managers. While this supports the predictions of agency theory, the absence of evidence that ownership structure influences voluntary disclosure does not. It is posited that sociological and organizational factors (e.g., informal networking) that pervade the Irish market mitigate against our disclosure measure capturing all aspects of voluntary disclosure. Furthermore, indirect evidence is provided that there are other costs and benefits to disclosure that vary across firms and may outweigh agency costs in many situations. We conclude that while agency theory has some explanatory power for voluntary disclosure, it cannot explain all the cross-sectional differences in voluntary disclosure by Irish public limited companies. Practical Implications: The results support the attention paid by regulators to the proportion of nonexecutive directors on the board. However, the costs and benefits to disclosure vary across firms. Regardless of agency considerations and regulatory guidelines, firms will ultimately formulate their disclosure policy with reference to overall marginal costs and marginal benefits.

This article contributes to the social networks literature by examining how corporate governance factors influence CEOs' external advice-seeking behaviors. We incorporate insights from social networks research into an agency theory perspective to predict, and demonstrate empirically, that governance factors recommended by agency theory increase CEOs' tendencies to seek out advice contacts who are likely to offer perspectives on strategic issues that differ from their own; these advice-seeking behaviors ultimately enhance firm performance. Accordingly, this article also contributes to the corporate governance literature by describing how and why CEOs' advice networks mediate the effects of governance factors on firm performance.

The objective of this paper is to provide a more comprehensive view of corporate governance than that considered by the traditional agency literature predominately employed in auditing and accounting studies of governance. Specifically, we discuss three widely recognized additional theoretical perspectives: resource dependence, managerial hegemony, and institutional theory. Resource dependence is developed in the strategic management literature and focuses on the contribution of governance mechanisms as a vehicle to help a firm achieve or further its strategic objectives. In contrast with the agency and resource dependence perspectives which offer a functional view of governance, the managerial hegemony perspective views the board and its attendant committees as being under the control of management and hence could be potentially viewed as dysfunctional from a stakeholder viewpoint. Finally, institutional theory, developed in the sociology of organizations and organizational behavior literatures, suggests that it is necessary to understand the substance of the interactions between different governance parties and how these parties use at times symbolic gestures and activities to maintain their form to all relevant parties. Although the value of using multiple theoretical perspectives with respect to governance has been well recognized in the economics and behavioral literatures, this is the first paper that we are aware of that examines the effect of using alternative theories of governance on auditing issues that are influenced by the governance structure of a firm. In addition, we examine how these theories provide a useful basis for reconciling conflicting findings in the existing agency-based audit-related governance literature. Finally, we provide examples of how these alternative theories provide important new insights to issues in auditing research and practice.

Synthesizing agency theory and prospect theory, we examined the effects of stock-based incentives on CEO earnings manipulation behaviors. In analyses of data compiled from the public companies listed in Compustat's Executive Compensation Database and a U.S. General Accounting Office restatements database, we found that CEOs were more likely to manipulate firm earnings when they had more out-of-the-money options and lower stock ownership. Firm performance and CEO tenure interacted with out-of-the-money options and ownership to influence CEO earnings manipulation behaviors. Our findings inform agency-based views by providing evidence that, under certain conditions, stock-based managerial incentives lead to incentive misalignment.

We develop a conceptual model of the career horizon problem of CEOs approaching retirement and discuss its implications on firm risk taking, specifically in engagement in international acquisitions. Based on prospect theory and agency theory, we emphasize the legacy conservation and wealth preservation concerns of CEOs and investigate how their holdings of in-the-money unexercised options and firm equity accentuate or mitigate the career horizon problem. The model is tested in the context of international acquisitions with a sample of 293 U.S. firms over a five-year period (1995-1999). We find that a longer CEO career horizon is associated with a higher likelihood of international acquisitions. We also find that CEOs nearing retirement with high levels of in-the-money unexercised options and equity holdings are less likely to engage in international acquisitions than CEOs with low levels of in-the-money options and equity holdings. The study raises important considerations about the implications of CEOs ' equity and in-the-money option holdings on firm risk taking at various stages of their career horizon.

This study examines the role of business familiarity in determining how software development outsourcing projects are managed and priced to address risks. Increased business familiarity suggests both more prior knowledge, and hence reduced adverse selection risk, and increased implied trust about future behavior, and hence implied reduced moral hazard risk. Preferring high business familiarity partners may also alleviate concerns about incomplete contracts. By reducing these risks, higher business familiarity is hypothesized to be associated with higher priced projects, reduced penalties, and an increased tendency to contract on a time and materials rather than a fixed price basis. These hypotheses were examined with objective contractual legal data from contracts made by a leading international bank. Integrating trust theory into agency theory and into incomplete contract theory and examining unique contract data, the contribution of the study is to show that the premium on business familiarity and the trust it implies is not in directly affecting price, but, rather, in changing how the relationship is managed toward a tendency to sign time and materials contracts. Implications about integrating trust into agency theory and incomplete contract theory, as well as implications regarding trust premiums and software development outsourcing, are discussed.

In a world that is flat, where all clients and providers can easily transact with one another, offshoring represents the proposition that information technology providers from low-wage nations can now underbid providers from high-wage nations and win contracts. We examined a particularly flat "world" - an online programming marketplace - and found that this profound tilt to low-wage nations is overstated. We analyzed the entire history of transactions at one of the major online programming marketplaces, a marketplace for outsourcing small IT projects. The data spanned 38 months and included over 263,000 bids by over 31,000 providers from 70 countries on over 20,000 small IT projects requested by over 7,900 clients from 59 countries. Contrary to the world-is-flat proposition, the data in this particular site show some client preference for domestic providers. However, the largest group of clients, the American clients, are a marked exception to clients in the rest of the world: they give relatively less preference to domestic providers. In a sense, the American clients have a higher preference for offshore providers. Among non-American clients the preference for domestic providers is mitigated when both client and provider are from an English-speaking nation. Relative bid price, onften very low already, also determines the winning bid, as does the ratio of purchasing power parity (PPP) between the country of the client and the country of the provider. Nonetheless, the strongest determinant of the winning bid is client loyalty: the client gives very strong preference to a provider with whom there has been a previous relationship, regardless of whether the provider is offshore or domestic.

Using a sample of 714 private family influenced businesses in Germany, we investigate the relationship of goal alignment between owners and managers and the existence of a board of directors. Agency theory and stewardship theory serve as theoretical bases for our study. We find that firms with relatively high levels of goal alignment are less likely to have a board of directors. Our results provide support for the substitution hypothesis of formal by social control mechanisms. Furthermore, the findings show that firms without a board and with relatively low levels of goal alignment have less family members in the top management team. This circumstance might in turn be a trigger for owners to install a board. (c) 2008 International Council for Small Business.

Aftermarket sales and profits are becoming an increasingly important part of an original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) business model. Because replacement parts often do not require further manufacturing, OEMs act as intermediaries in the aftermarket. As with any intermediary, the OEM must concern itself with suppliers disintermediating its supply chain selling replacement parts directly to the OEM's customers. We frame supply chain disintermediation (SCD) as a principal-agent contracting problem between an OEM buyer and a supplier. Hypotheses relate contract conditions, goal incongruence, supplier capabilities and contract enforcement to SCD. The data are collected from the aerospace industry using a multimethod study, combining an Internet-based survey with archival data. Causal modeling with structural equation modeling (SEM) shows general support for the hypotheses. Particularly, SCD is positively related to buyer-supplier goal incongruence. The agency model offers insights that differ from previous transaction-cost-based models of buyer-supplier relationships. OEM buyers with a lucrative aftermarket should consider aligning goals through incentives rather than relying entirely on economic hostages associated with specific assets.

Different forms from the literature are compared with empirical examples to give an overview of forms, which are then described in terms of strategy, skills and organisation. Whilst acknowledging variations, the paper distinguishes between two main forms: virtual networks and third-party organisations. Using empirical data and four theoretical perspectives (transaction cost economics, resource-based view, contingency theory, agency theory), the paper reflects on when which form can be used and presents an overall framework to help choose an organisational form.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a broader understanding of target cost arrangements by empirical study of the choice of sharing ratios from the perspective of both clients and contractors. Design/methodology/ approach - Eight Swedish construction clients and eight contractors were interviewed. These interviews were followed by a case study of a large construction project with a target cost contract. The data for the case study were gathered through interviews, contract documents and non-participant observation. The impact of perceived risks on the selection process is discussed in terms of agency theory. Findings - Key factors influencing the selection of a sharing ratio included perceptions of fairness, knowledge of target cost contracts, and long-term relationships. The perceived level of risk is affected by the perceived performance risk and the perceived relational risk. Consequently, attention should be paid to the impact of long-term relationships on the design and outcome of target cost contracts since such relationships reduce the risks associated with asymmetric information, such as relational risk. Originality/value - This study identifies factors that previous research has ignored in relation to the negotiation of target cost contracts. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Professional service firms have distinct operational challenges due to the type of work that is transacted by the employees of these firms, and due to the nature of the employees themselves. In this paper, we develop and present factors that influence professional service operations in firms and compensation structures for professional service providers. We establish professional service influence factors, which we posit will impact agency relationships in professional service firms. That is, we hypothesize that professional service influence factors (PSIFs) will moderate the effect of task programmability and outcome measurability in predicting the use of behavior- or outcome-based compensation schemes (control strategy). Logistic regression is used on data provided by 192 professional service providers in order to examine the impact of the agency variables and moderating factors on control strategies. The results indicate that company- and profession-based factors have moderating effects on task programmability when predicting control strategy. We discuss the implications of our findings.

A Norwegian Ministry of Defence publication states that when procurement decisions are made, systems that yield the lowest possible life cycle cost (LCC) for the Norwegian Defence must be procured, even if this means that initial procurement cost becomes higher. However, several projects within the community are still carried out and reviewed based on initial procurement cost alone. This study investigates four hypotheses, based on agency theory and earlier LCC work, in order to help explain why this is happening. A questionnaire was administered to all projects currently running in the defence community. Findings regarding project uncertainty, information symmetry, the project leader's attitude and knowledge about LCC, as well as control variables are discussed both towards theory and in terms of managerial implications.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue The relationship between board members and top executives is held central to corporate governance, yet studies of it are relatively few and our knowledge of its consequences is limited. This study aims to address how board-CEO relationships, in terms of power balance and social ties, contribute to the performance of new product introduction. It proposes a contingency view to highlight the context-dependent nature of such governance arrangements. Research Findings/Results Using survey and archival data in a sample of 198 industrial firms in Taiwan, this research finds that the two distinct types of board-CEO relationships relate curvilinearly to the performance of new product introduction. Furthermore, such universal relationships are moderated by market instability and board interlocks, respectively. Theoretical Implications: This study departs from the traditional agency view to an argument that fine-tuned board-CEO relationships, in light of sociopolitical and sociopsychological forces, and will serve as an essential enabling context for managerial risk taking. It demonstrates that research in this field should accommodate different theories to elaborate on the underlying tensions in the corporate governance and emphasize the merits of complementarity. Practical Implications: Acknowledging that good governance design softens managerial risk aversion, this study helps identify the governance conditions in which risk differentials between the board and CEO may align, and thus when exploratory efforts, in the form of new product introduction, are more likely to succeed.

In this paper I first review the basic tenets of agency theory and theory of managerial capitalism as well as some of the major research in these areas then suggest for areas for future research that go beyond the extant empirical work. First, I suggest that it would be useful to reconsider the basic nature of the agency relationship, taking into account that while equity holders can be considered the principal, the board of directors may be more realistically in need of agent-like controls. Second, the complementary or supplementary nature of the monitoring/incentive alignment relationship has been shown theoretically but the empirical evidence is equivocal and needs future investigation. Third, there has been very limited research on the construct validity of archival measures of the sort used in agency theory. This requires the use of methodologies outside those of the more conventional type used in agency theory (i.e., from economics and finance). Finally, agency theory development would profit greatly by more extensive use of research methods such as laboratory studies and survey methodology and the integration of concepts such as personality and control processes.

Incentive alignment, and risk and gain sharing, are argued to be key factors for the successful implementation of Supply Chain Management (SCM). Incentive-related issues can be improved by contract-based, information-based and trust-based solutions. The focus of this article is on contract mechanisms used in the context of high demand volatility, supply allocation and outsourced supply chains. Two case illustrations from a high-tech industry (Agilent and Hewlett Packard) describe recently implemented risk-sharing contracts, as well as experiences and issues regarding their implementation from a buyers' perspective. Although the work of implementing these more formal contracts is demanding, buyers are pleased with the results and the buyers also report pleased suppliers. In the cases, the main barrier to implementing risk-sharing contracts seems to be the shift in mindset and culture needed internally, especially among purchasers.

Achieving competitive advantage through a broader consideration of stakeholders of the firm is examined. The inclusion of other significant organisational actors such as managers and employees as stakeholders capable of creating competitive strategic advantage for the firm is considered. Findings indicate that competitive advantage within an economic perspective may be garnered by establishing a broader conceptualisation of stakeholders of the firm. It is concluded employees may be characterised as hybrid stakeholders, as they are a mix of residual risk bearers and input suppliers of strategically highly relevant resources and that ways of articulating employee voice is a key element of gaining competitive advantage. The aim of this paper is to analyse internationally operating modern public corporations from an agency theory point of view with the focus on the role of a suite of stakeholders including shareholders, managers and employees. The economic reasoning demonstrates that the employees' voice is an important component of business from a strategic perspective irrespective of the type of institutional environment present in any given country.

Purpose - This paper aims to describe an application of key concepts in agency theory to organizational development. Specifically, it seeks to highlight that formal control systems, the ways to regulate employees' performance, are associated with an important factor for organizational development - the capacity for improvement. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a literature review on organizational development and agency theory, and an empirical examination of the relationships between bureaucratic control systems, task programmability and the organization's capacity for improvement. The hypotheses of interrelationships among different control systems, task programmability and the capacity for improvement were tested with a sample of 237 employees in the service industry. Findings - Results indicate that input control is a significant factor in determining an organization's capacity for improvement, and task programmability moderates the relation between a bureaucratic control and the organization's capacity for improvement. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on a cross-sectional self-report study. It is advisable to include managers' assessment of subordinates' capacity of improvement in further research. Originality/value - The effect of formal controls on organizational performance was controversial. This paper reveals the moderating role of task programmability in a control-performance relationship. In doing so, this paper sheds light on how a manager can enhance his/her subordinates' performance on organizational improvement through different control tactics.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual. Research Question/Issue: Post-acquisition director turnover is a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that needs to be examined beyond the agency lens. In this article, we examine the likelihood of non-executive director turnover in target firms following an acquisition. Research Findings/Result: Acquisitions present an interesting case where conflict of interests may arise between shareholders and directors. This study proposes that the likelihood of target non-executive director turnover depends on the factors that determine the performance of directors in their monitoring, advisory and social roles pre-acquisition and during the acquisition process. Theoretical Implications: While there are multiple studies examining the likelihood of turnover of executive directors (TMTs) following an acquisition, there is no systematic conceptual research explaining the likelihood of turnover of non-executive directors. We draw on three theoretical perspectives-agency theory, resource-based view and the social capital perspective to comprehensively investigate target non-executive director turnover post-acquisition. We further clarify the boundaries of these theoretical arguments concerning their implications for target non-executive director turnover. Practical Implications: One of the most important tasks for the newly formed firm post-acquisition is to build the new leadership team, including a new board. In view of the important roles directors take on in modern corporations, it is critical to understand how the new board should be constituted and what members of the target firm are more likely to join that new board.

Purpose - A strong and repeating theme in sales force automation (SFA) tool research is perceived usefulness. When salespeople perceived high levels of SFA tool usefulness, they report higher intent and actual use. The authors aim to apply agency theory to the concept of perceived usefulness (from the technology acceptance model) to explain why salespeople adopt some forms of SFA and reject still others. A set of hypotheses are proposed and tested revealing that salespeople will decide to use a SFA tool because they perceive it to be useful to themselves (i.e. PUsp) and to their management (PUsm). Design/methodology/approach - Based on responses from 105 salespeople, the SFA tools they used were categorized as either outcome-based (i.e. helping salespeople achieve their selling outcome goals) or activity-based tools (i.e. helping management monitor selling activities/behaviors). Regression analyses were used to test six hypotheses relating salespeople's usage of each category of tools (the dependent variable) to the salesperson perceived usefulness constructs (both PUsp and PUsm - the independent variables). Findings - The findings confirm that SFA tool use (either outcome-based or activity-based) is a function of both forms of perceived usefulness (i.e. PUsp and PUsm). Furthermore, when PU sp is high, the salesperson is more likely to use outcome-based (versus activity-based) SFA tools over a longer period of time. Practical implications - The paper validates agency theory as a useful paradigm for understanding salesperson SFA tool adoption. Salespeople will use SFA tools that they view as useful to their productivity and that the sales manager's influence over the salesperson's use of SFA tools may not be as important. To encourage use, firms need to emphasize how a SFA tool can meet salesperson needs. Originality/value - The paper is the first to hypothesize and test the relationship between perceptions of SFA tool usefulness and actual usage by considering salesperson perception of usefulness to themselves (PUsp) and perception of usefulness to their sales manager (PUsm).

The empirical support for agency theory explanations for the great variance in CEO pay has been equivocal. Drawing from the performance appraisal literature, we hypothesize that boards of directors incorporate human judgment into the evaluation and reward of CEO performance in order to balance managerial risk with agency costs. We test Baysinger and Hoskisson's (1990) proposition that insider-dominated corporate boards rely on subjective performance evaluation to reward the CEO, and we argue that R&D intensity influences this relationship. Using a sample of Fortune firms, findings support our contention that human judgment is important in evaluating and rewarding CEO performance. (c) 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Scholarly investigations on the board of directors, although intense from the mid-1990s onward, did not lead to entirely convincing results. This study proposes discussion on building a multidisciplinary and integrated theoretical framework able to capture the complexity and distinctive dimensions of the board as a group decision-making process. This is achieved through an essay developed from analytical and descriptive review of the literature. A synthesis on board research is presented, aiming to understand theoretical models lenses used to study corporate governance issues. The strengths and weaknesses of these models are pointed out, and their influence on board investigation is observed. This essay concludes by proposing a research agenda that considers the addition of psychological and sociological approaches to economic models of the analysis of group decision-making.

Destination marketing systems are a key technology for destination marketing, however many have failed due to a lack of tourism operators' participation. This study uses a multiple case study research design to investigate how inter-organizational relationship theories of dependency, agency and trust apply to a destination marketing system, a non-transactional distribution technology. In particular, destination marketing and branding is found to be a cause of goal conflict, which influences hidden action and hidden characteristic problems, as well as influencing dependency. This is a new understanding of how goal conflict applies in destination marketing relationships. Results inform on key issues for destination marketers in managing their relationships with tourism operators, as well as in developing and implementing policies to manage destination marketing systems.

The attempt to align interests of executives with those of shareholders has been addressed in the corporate governance context from a predominantly economic outlook based on the agency theory. The models that combine monitoring and control systems in association with financial incentive mechanisms, such as profit and income sharing, stock options, bonds and other benefits, consider an individual to be individualist, opportunist and self-interested, diverging from the assumptions of other theories and contemporary ideas in the area of human resources management. Based on the criticism related to the agency theory, particularly when drawing up incentive schemes, this article aims to look at alternative theories to build corporate governance practices that include considerations on extrinsic and intrinsic motivation of agents.

Anglo governance systems rely of a number of controls to align shareholder and boards of director's interests. In general they are referred to as market control, regulatory control, and political and cultural control. Agency theory proposes that these control mechanisms are necessary as human nature is such that directors and managers act in a self-interested and boundedly rational manner in decision-making that can result in sub optimality. Notwithstanding that each country within the Anglo system accepts such controls are necessary they have their own foci and priorities, being a product of their own system's characteristics. This paper through interviewing a number of Australian business executives adds to the academic literature by providing evidence from the field of the important characteristics of the Australian governance system, the drivers of change and the effectiveness of the principles-based approach. It argues that debate needs to move beyond the principles versus rules approach to look at how firms can be provided with more guidance in operationalising some of the principles that appear to be key to governance effectiveness. It concludes that there is a need for a holistic model of governance that is broader than that focusing on the control/legalistic approach; that top management is important in setting and driving the in-firm governance agenda; that the public needs to be informed and educated about governance and its importance; and that disclosure still requires an improvement in quality.

Theory is fundamental to how we understand the empirical world, and cases present a wonderful opportunity to both learn from and challenge current theory. The author juxtaposes the specifics of the case of the Polish-based restaurant operator with current franchising theory to offer two propositions. The first, grounded in the dominant agency theory, suggests that franchising allows a company to expand without the expense of the personnel necessary to operate international units. The other, based on an emerging symbiosis perspective, proposes that franchisor and franchisee need each other to adapt an already successful operating system for the new home market. One possible reason that the Polish franchise failed may be based on inadequate autonomy allowed the Polish franchisee. (c) 2008 Cornell University.

As outsourced and multinational IT projects become more common, managing risks for these projects is increasingly important. The research reported here examined key risks identified by Hong Kong vendor project managers working on both local and international package implementation projects. In addition to the typical risks that threaten project outcome success, respondents noted additional client-side and vendor-side risks, as well as location-specific risks on their multinational projects. They also distinguished threats to the satisfactory process of the project, and threats to their own firms from competitors and from potential damage to their reputation arising from customer dissatisfaction with either the outcomes or the process of the project. This broader risk focus of vendor project managers is contrasted with the client perspective through the lens of agency theory. Traditionally, agency theory has been used to predict risks to the client-principal related to vendors' profit goals in the outsourcing relationship. However, the findings of this study suggest that vendors' higher-level concerns for their future business and reputation mitigate the risk to the client of vendor opportunistic behavior.

In 2003, an important national policy of rejuvenating Northeast China was put forward. The region produces nearly 25% of the country's agricultural commodities. This paper focuses on the adoption of Logistics Information Systems (LIS) in Northeast China's large-scale agricultural corporations. Case research method is used, and Jilin Grain Group Co. Ltd. and Haoyue Beef Co. Ltd. are chosen as our research cases. They both adopted LIS to enhance their logistics efficiency. We adopt the UTAUT model and agency theory to analyze the factors affecting their adoption. This paper finds and tests that principal-agent problems serve as one of the main factors affecting the adoption in Northeast China's large-scale agricultural corporations. So in order to better adopt and use LIS, it is important to adjust the organization system, and to align the interest of the principal and that of the agent. (c) ASCE.

Based on the work of Berle and Means (1932), Coase (1937), Arrow (1971), and others, agency theory emerged in the 1970s to explain economic relationships under conditions of uncertainty and less-than-perfect information. It has become a widely used theoretical lens in strategic management research, with applications intended to inform research about corporate governance (Finkelstein and D'Aveni, 1994; Walsh and Kosnik, 1993), CEO compensation (Barkema and Gomez-Mehia, 1998), firm performance (Brush, Bromiley, and Hendrickx, 2000; Li and Simerly, 1998), firm risk (Bloom and Milkovich, 1998; Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia, 1998); and strategic decisions such as diversification (Kochhar, 1996; Markides and Singh, 1997) and mergers (Holl and Kyriazis, 1997; Reuer and Miller, 1997).

Companies are increasingly sourcing services from third party providers on a global level. Nevertheless, the academic research on phenomena such as offshoring, international purchasing and the sourcing of certain specific categories is still scarce. Lydia Bals provides terminological clarity regarding the field of offshoring. She identifies different types of offshoring, concluding that the buy option of offshore outsourcing versus hybrid or make options is directly related to purchasing. Her in-depth analysis specifically focuses on the sourcing of marketing services. In this context, the investigations of purchasing/marketing integration provide a conceptual model of barriers to purchasing involvement in sourcing of services. Moreover, the author seeks to shed light on issues of providing incentives for advertising agencies from an agency theory perspective. The case study illustrates that the measures taken against an initially problematic situation in the purchase of advertising agency services correspond with the theoretically identified solution mechanisms.

Agency theory has served as a key basis for identifying drivers of offshore information system project success. Consequently, the role of relational factors in driving project success has been overlooked in this literature. In this paper, we address this gap by integrating the social embeddedness perspective and the culture literature to theorize how and why relational factors affect the success of offshore IS projects that are strategic in nature. We identify organizational and interpersonal cultural differences as critical success factors in this context. Using data from a longitudinal field study of 155 offshore IS projects managed by 22 project leaders, we found evidence of a relationship between hypothesized relational factors and two measures of offshore IS project success-namely, project cost overruns and client satisfaction-over and above the effects of project characteristics and agency factors. Specifically, we found that information exchange, jointproblem solving, and trust reduce projectcost overruns and improve client satisfaction. We also found a relationship between cultural differences at the organizational and team level, and offshore IS project success. The model explained 40 percent and 41 percent of the variance in project cost overruns and client satisfaction, respectively, for projects with a client representative. For projects with no client representative, the model explained 35 percent and 3 7 percent of the variance in project cost overruns and client satisfaction, respectively. Collectively, the results have important theoretical and practical implications for how clientvendor relationships should be managed when partnering with offshore firms and designing offshore IS project teams.

Using takeover protection as an indicator of corporate governance, this study examines how an exogenous shift in power from shareholders to managers affects corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Two competing hypotheses are entertained. The shareholder view predicts that stronger takeover protection will lead to a decrease in corporate attention to shareholders and non-shareholding stakeholders alike, as managers divert resources from share-holders to the pursuit of their private interests. The stakeholder view, in contrast, predicts that stronger takeover protection will increase corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders. Because catering to non-shareholding stakeholders contributes to the long-term value of the firm, managers will be more likely to attend to those stakeholders when relieved from short-termism triggered by the threat of hostile takeovers. Using a sample of 878 U.S. firms from 1991 to 2002, the study finds that an exogenous increase in takeover protection leads to higher corporate attention to community and the natural environment, but has no impact on corporate attention to employees, minorities, and customers. Additional analyses show that firms that increase their attention to stakeholders experience an increase in long-term shareholder value. These findings provide additional evidence that relief from short-termism is a likely source of the increase in corporate attention to non-shareholding stakeholders following the increase in takeover protection.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to understand how business group affiliation, within firm governance and external governance environment affect firm performance in emerging economies. We examine two aspects of within firm governance - ownership concentration and board independence. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data on the top 500 Indian and Chinese firms from multiple data sources for 2007, we found that group affiliated firms performed worse than unaffiliated firms, and the negative relationship was stronger in the case of Indian firms than for Chinese firms. We also found that ownership concentration had a positive effect on firm performance, while board independence had a negative effect on firm performance. Further, we found that group affiliation - firm performance relationship in a given country context was moderated by ownership concentration. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study utilizes an integration of agency theory with an institutional perspective, providing a more comprehensive framework to analyze the CG problems, particularly in the emerging economy firms. Empirically, our findings support, as well as contradict, some of the conventional wisdom, and suggest useful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study shows that reforms in general and CG reforms in particular are effective in emerging economies, which is an encouraging sign for policy makers. However, our research also suggests that it may be time for India and China to stop the encouragement for the empire building through group formation in the corporate world. For practioners, our findings suggest that firms need to balance the need for oversight with the need for advice, while selecting independent directors. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: This paper extends the theory of bundles of corporate governance mechanisms to address agency issues within the Anglo-Saxon system of corporate governance. The focus of our study is to detail the role of firm performance as a key determinant of how the governance mechanisms of monitoring and incentive alignment serve as complements or substitutes in addressing agency issues. Previous research has looked at these mechanisms in isolation from each other, with limited regard for the contingencies of firm performance and external monitoring. We propose that it is best to look at these mechanisms as a bundle of mechanisms to protect shareholder interests, and that firm performance is a key determinant of the composition of this bundle. Research Findings/Insights: We introduce firm performance as a critical contingency that heightens shareholders' concerns over governance issues as they seek to retain control over adverse selection and moral hazard problems. We propose that when firms are performing poorly, outside monitoring by institutional investors can complement internal monitoring by boards of directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We examine governance bundles under both agency and stewardship theoretical lenses to tie together previous empirical research and advance theory. In specifying the role of firm performance in determining the mix of mechanisms within the governance bundle, we reconcile prior disparate findings as to whether or not these governance mechanisms act in a complementary or substitutable fashion. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The conceptualization of these governance mechanisms has practitioner merit in analyzing the challenges that board members face managing agency conflicts through the mix of governance mechanisms, given different levels of firm performance. Our research also shows that, under conditions of poor performance, shareholders can provide effective external monitoring that can improve the overall governance effectiveness of the firm.

There is considerable variation across countries in both the extent to which large publicly listed firms are family-owned and the dominance of such family-owned firms in stock markets. The literature presents competing theoretical viewpoints on what influences such country-level variation. On one hand, institutional economists suggest that institutional voids can have a strong influence. On the other hand, cultural sociologists suggest that a country's culture can have a strong influence. One type of institutional void is a lack of institutional norms and regulations needed for monitoring contracts (which can discourage owners from hiring professional agents for top management positions in their firms) and another type of institutional void is a lack of financial credit availability in the country. Cultural dimensions include collectivism (i.e. cohesion within in-groups/families) and power distance (i.e. inequalities in society). This country-level empirical study suggests that both national culture and institutional voids influence family ownership patterns around the world, and that institutional voids moderate the influence of national culture. National culture has a stronger influence when a country has institutional voids; however, the influence of national culture weakens when institutional voids are overcome. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Agency theory addresses problems created from the separation of principals and agents in modern corporations. Some agency theorists have investigated the exact relationship between control mechanisms (monitoring and bonding) and suggested that they work as substitutes. We posit that, although monitoring and bonding may be concurrent substitutes in a system of governance, monitoring intensity is positively related to bonding (i.e., compensation) so that over time, they are complements rather than substitutes. In particular, we suggest that increased monitoring intensity shifts risk to managers, who then require greater compensation to offset their increased employment and career risk. Accordingly, they reinforce each other in a negative cycle such that monitoring leads to increased pay, which in turn leads to increased monitoring due to complaints of excessive pay. The result is that in today's economic environment society often criticizes executive pay without realizing that, in part, higher compensation is an outcome of prior increased monitoring intensity. These findings are particularly important as elected officials are increasingly under pressure to monitor and limit executive compensation. An understanding of this relationship also has implications for executive risk taking and entrepreneurial activities.

Manuscript Type: Editorial Research Question/Issue: This essay identifies some key issues for the analysis of corporate governance based on the articles within this special review issue coupled with our own perspectives. Our aim in this issue is to distil some research streams in the field and identify opportunities for future research. Research Findings/Results: We summarize the eight papers included in this special issue and briefly highlight their main contributions to the literature which collectively deal with the role and impact of corporate boards, codes of corporate governance, and the globalization of corporate governance systems. In addition to the new insights offered by these reviews, we attempt to offer our own ideas on where future research needs to be targeted. Theoretical Implications: We highlight a number of research themes where future governance research may prove fruitful. This includes taking a more holistic approach to corporate governance issues and developing an inter-disciplinary perspective by building on agency theory while considering the rich new insights offered by complementary theories, such as behavioral theory, institutional theory and the resource-based views of the firm. In particular, future corporate governance research needs to be conducted in multiple countries, particularly in emerging economies, if we want to move closer to the journal's aim of producing a global theory of corporate governance. Practical Implications: Our analysis suggests that analytic and regulatory approaches to corporate governance issues should move from a "one-size-fits-all" template to taking into account organizational, institutional and national contexts.

* While research on international joint ventures (IJVs) has intensified over the last few decades, numerous reviewers have criticized the field for lack of accumulation. We use meta-analytic techniques to quantitatively synthesize and evaluate agency theory and the behavioral perspective in their ability to explain IJV performance variance. Overall, we find support for these theories but moderator analyses unveil important effects of artifactual variables, and point to a unique character of IJVs in China. * Based on meta-analyses of 165 effect sizes from 61 independent samples and a total of 26,927 IJVs, the results offer overall support for a hypothesized path model grounded in agency theory and the behavioral perspective. However, only 19 percent of the variance in IJV performance is accounted for, indicating a need to explore other underexplored variables. We do not find evidence that hierarchical control is associated with partner conflict. Closer examination shows that for IJVs in China such control lowers partner conflict, while for IJVs in other countries it amplifies partner conflict. The effects of partner conflict on IJV performance are less harmful for Chinese joint ventures than for joint ventures in other countries. Furthermore, while objective measures of cultural distance show a weak positive effect on IJV performance, subjective measures show a negative effect. (c) 2009 Gabler-Verlag.

In a broad sense, corporate governance is about how firms should be governed so that they are run effectively and efficiently. This paper takes a broad perspective on corporate governance mechanisms and considers possible synergies between corporate governance and international business (IB) research. We summarize the papers included in this Focused Issue, and draw out their main contributions to the literature. In so doing, we compare and contrast the four theoretical perspectives concerning corporate governance and IB adopted in the five papers: i.e. transaction cost economics, the resource-based view, agency theory, and institutional theory. Finally, we highlight five research themes (international diversification, business groups, entry modes, subsidiary mandates, and new international ownership structures) where future work explicitly addressing governance issues may prove fruitful.

Drawing on the agency theory, corporate governance, and international business literatures, the authors link board characteristics and managerial incentives to the choice between acquisitions and joint ventures by firms entering foreign markets. Hypothesized relationships are examined in the context of 383 acquisition and 171 joint venture entries undertaken by relatively nondiversified firms in the U.S. manufacturing sector during the period 1991 to 1999. Findings indicate that firms with boards characterized by a higher proportion of outside directors and independent leadership structures (i.e., the absence of duality) are more inclined to favor acquisitions over joint ventures in foreign market entry. Likewise, the data reveal that firms where insiders have greater equity ownership and compensation structures that are more closely linked to long-term firm performance prefer acquisitions over joint ventures. Implications of the findings along with directions for future research are discussed. (c) 2009 Southern Management Association.

Manuscript type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper examines the relationships between initial public offering (IPO) underpricing, CEO duality, and strategic ownership in 12 Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Research Findings/Results: Using all IPOs from January 2000 until the end of July 2007, we document an average IPO underpricing of 184.1 per cent. Underpricing is higher in IPO firms that have CEO duality. However, strategic shareholders, such as corporations and other industry-related investors, are likely to play a monitoring role whereas underpricing is found to be lower in firms with both CEO duality and strategic shareholder ownership. Moreover, the negative relation between underpricing and strategic blockholding is greater for foreign strategic ownership than it is for domestic strategic ownership. Theoretical Implications: This paper examines the level and determinants of IPO underpricing in the MENA region. It provides evidence on the role played by foreign strategic owners in reducing agency conflicts and information asymmetries within an environment where firms may be affected by the cultural issues related to political ties and family involvement. Practical Implications: Our results contribute to the existing debate on the appropriate regulations for an effective and stable financial system in Arab countries. They offer policy-makers additional evidence on the positive impact of market openness to foreign shareholders. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose The goal of this paper is to provide a broad foundation for future research in the area of strategic sourcing. Design/methodology/approach The foundation is derived by drawing from various wellestablished organizational theories. Specifically, strategic sourcing was viewed from the perspective of institutional theory, resource dependence theory, network theory, systems theory, resource/knowledgebased views of the firm, transaction cost economics, agency theory, strategic choice theory, sociocognitive theory, and critical theory. Findings By viewing strategic sourcing through the lens of ten organizational theories, this research provides multiple insights into many interrelated strategic sourcing questions, such as when to make, buy or ally, how many and which suppliers, and how to manage sourcing relationships. The paper offers a rich and diverse foundation to foster future theorybuilding activities in sourcing and supply management research. Originality/value While some of these theory bases have been utilized, to some degree, in the supply management research, the paper offers a more holistic perspective of theoretical insights for strategic sourcing. Each of these organizational theories could be utilized as a foundation for future studies. Further, the paper offers competing and/or complementary theory bases to enhance possible insights into many strategic sourcing questions such as when to make, buy or ally.

This article uses agency and stewardship theories to explain different motivations for contracted providers to properly use service monitoring tools. To examine different motivations for proper tool use, seven case studies were conducted on early childhood programs in three communities in Upstate New York. The case studies specifically focused on the reporting forms that the early childhood programs completed. Data sources included (1) interviews with government agency and contracted provider employees, (2) content analysis of key documents relating to the service monitoring tools, and (3) attendance at meetings between government agencies and contracted providers on the service monitoring tools. This article finds support for both agency and stewardship theories.

This study investigates alternative governance forms in the hotel industry. Agency theory maintains that the need for control over service quality, financial risk, and the market environment affect the choice of governance form. Prior agency research emphasizes alternative governance structures that principals employ, given local market conditions, agent incentives, and risk preferences. The study augments the established principal-agent perspective with a discussion of entrepreneurial motivations to join hotel alliances. The study analyzes the choice between independent ownership and affiliation with a voluntary chain as well as the choice between integration and franchising. Data analyses from 650 hotels indicate that the hotel size, amenities, population, and distance to headquarters influence governance. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Contracts are a ubiquitous part of the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Despite this, they are poorly understood by practitioners and academics. This paper empirically tests a conceptual model of the contract that seeks to improve our understanding of contracts. This model argues that the contract should be viewed as a managerial tool that provides the structure within which we accomplish the project tasks. The choice of the appropriate contract facilitates a process that allows the parties to achieve superior performance. The model views the contract as a multidimensional instrument that addresses three critical questions: (1) what is the structure of the organizational relationship between firms; (2) what is the disposition of risk and reward for involvement in the project; and (3) how will conflicts between firms be resolved? This paper empirically examines the first two dimensions. In order to address these distinct but intertwined questions, theories from Transaction Cost Economics and Agency Theory are brought to bear. The results of the study suggest that the conceptual model explains some of the variation in project performance, and therefore holds promise as a strategic management tool. (c) 2009 ASCE.

Our study investigates differences in CEO turnover between focused and diversified firms to determine whether diversification strategies are necessarily associated with governance efficiency in family businesses. We find that large family CEO firms are more likely to engage in corporate diversification than are small non-family CEO firms and their CEOs are seldom replaced. Large family CEO diversified firms also have lower turnover sensitivity relative to focused firms. The results imply that the CEOs of diversified firms have entrenched themselves, thereby increasing agency costs within family businesses. However, we fail to find diversification discounts in family businesses. It is interesting that CEOs tend to diversify their businesses in order to decrease firm risk. Founding families favor risk reducing decisions in order to maintain family wealth and prestige; suggesting that family businesses are more interested in survival than growth. Although family businesses may benefit from risk reduction, a negative relationship between diversification level and CEO turnover is still evidence of poor corporate governance. Agency theory may not completely account for the adoption of diversification strategies in family businesses and corporate diversification may weaken the effectiveness of internal monitoring mechanisms.

The last 4 decades have seen the transformation of food supply chains from being supply driven to becoming much more closely integrated with consumer demand. With this development, the transaction mechanism in food marketing channels has changed from an open-market mechanism to coordination through the use of contract-supply arrangements between farmers and food processors and retailers. In this article, we assess the interaction of marketing channel members through the use of contracts and its impact on incentives, coordination costs, risk aversion, risk allocation, and risk management strategies. For this purpose we specify a 3-stage principal-agent supply chain model involving producers, wholesalers, retailers, and a futures market. We compare the situation with and without a futures market. The empirical results regarding the Dutch ware potato marketing channel during 1971 to 2003 reveal that as a result of increases in incentives to producers and wholesalers, the coordination costs of the marketing channel decreased significantly, both with and without futures trade. The coordination costs of the marketing channel in the case with a futures market appear to be lower than without futures, demonstrating the informational (i.e., price discovery) role of futures markets.

Previous studies have primarily focused on the relative success of collectively owned enterprises (COEs) in China during the early years of reform, but they have ignored the agency problems inherent in this type of organizational form that may be an obstacle to further improving performance in a changing environment. Drawing on agency theory and the privatization literature, we argue that the transformed COEs in the ongoing organizational transformation process may achieve better performance by reducing agency costs. We examine a sample of COEs in Chinese manufacturing industries and track their ownership statuses from 2000 to 2005. Our findings reveal that the transformed firms achieved better performance than the traditional, untransformed COEs by mitigating agency problems. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A firm's distribution, channels represent a key portfolio of resources that can be leveraged for competitive advantage. One approach to this portfolio that has become increasingly important in recent years is multichannel distribution. (MCD). While this strategy has important benefits in terms of market coverage and firm performance, the use of multiple channels seriously affects downstream channel roles such as service delivery, as the financial rewards to channel members and the services they offer are separated. A channel member who offers poor or no service can free-ride on the services offered to the same customer from a different channel. We draw on agency theory to explain these negative consequences. Additionally, the resource-based view of the firm, along with capabilities theory provides two key means of alleviating these consequences: channel tracking capabilities and reward alignment capabilities. The study, conducted in an. industry facing serious MCD issues (the outdoor sporting goods industry), used key informant data matched to secondary data. Our results show that managers can reap the performance rewards of MCD strategies while minimizing its negative consequences. In particular, monitoring practices such as frequent site visits and phone contact with customers develop the firm's channel tracking capabilities, allowing managers to better monitor downstream activities. This becomes particularly important as the complexity from having multiple channels increases. Likewise, reward alignment capabilities such as retail price maintenance agreements and cooperative advertising enable the manager to minimize conflict among channel participants by ensuring sufficient profitability for all channel members.

Prior research has located the issue of "professional" conduct with consultancy predominantly within the relationship between the manager and the consultant. However, recent studies provide indications that dealing professionally with consultancy may fail because of goal divergences between the individual managers and the organization. The first aim of this article is to re-examine this assumption theoretically, by drawing on agency theory, and empirically, by focusing on a single case study. Through this approach certain attitudes exhibited by managers are identified, which hinder dealing with consultancy in a professional manner across the entire organization. This observation motivates the second aim of the article: since the managers' attitudes deviate from the company's goals in dealings with consultancy, the adequacy of governance measures needs to be analyzed. Several researchers have observed that companies primarily use control-based measures, like central procurement rules or policies, to govern managers dealing with consultancy. However, these measures are not readily accepted by managers. In view of the above, this study investigates alternative measures, which are summarized as incentive-based measures.

Purpose - The primary purpose of this paper is to verify the importance of psychological ownership in the organisational context of a franchise by testing predicted relationships concerning feelings of ownership towards branding, legal ownership of complementary assets, organisational commitment, and a willingness on the part of franchisees to diffuse a franchise brand to peers. Design/methodology/approach - Evidence is presented from an empirical study on the largest taxi franchise fleet in Taiwan. Two formal questionnaires/surveys were conducted in May 2005 and September 2005, from which data were collected from 147 franchisees. Regression analysis is employed to test seven hypotheses. Findings - The empirical results demonstrate that analysing the psychological ownership of a franchise brand from two dimensions (i.e. the degree of psychological ownership and the self-centred propensity towards psychological ownership) sees an increase in explained variance in organisational commitment and brand diffusion in the context of the franchise organisation. It also illustrates that both dimensions of psychological ownership are negatively affected by the ownership of the non-brand-specified complementary assets owned by a franchisee. Research limitations/implications - The majority of previous research has investigated the phenomenon of franchising from the perspective of the agency theory or of resource scarcity; and has focused on the franchisor's concerns. A major implication of this study indicates that these perspectives, while essential, are insufficient in explaining the growth through franchising strategies. Researchers need to consider how to integrate asset ownership (or property rights) and affect elements in order to influence a franchisee's cognition and behaviour entrepreneurially. A limitation of this study is that it is conducted within the respective boundaries of cultural, professional, and industrial factors. Practical implications - This study indicates that entrepreneurs can achieve better brand diffusion effects for franchise growth if they engage in merging the structures of asset ownership and psychological ownership. Originality/value - This is the first paper to examine the psychological ownership of branding within the setting of a franchise organisation and highlights the importance of a sense of ownership in entrepreneurship.

This paper studies the case of a French multinational company which doubled its size and geographical spread of activities because of acquisitions of Anglo-Saxon multinational companies. It analyses the rationale behind the introduction of a competency-based leadership model in this multinational company through the frameworks of agency and neoinstitutional theories. The interpretation of the data through agency theory leads to the following conclusion: globalization means strengthening agency problems and therefore an increase in agency costs. It is argued that the multinational company introduced the competency-based leadership model as a means of cultural control. A formalized and common reference for leadership development and evaluation makes it possible to reduce information asymmetry, diminish the possibility of opportunistic behaviour among managers and thereby reduce agency costs. While agency theory justifies the introduction of the competency-based leadership model, it does not explain the modalities of its choice. This theoretical perspective ignores the institutional context of HRM choices. The results obtained through the frameworks of neoinstitutional theory show that the choice of the competency model was based on the mimetic mechanisms of institutional isomorphism. Furthermore, the introduction of the competency-based leadership model allows the multinational company to gain both internal and external organizational legitimacy. Consequently, the paper suggests that agency theory has to be combined with insights from the neoinstitutional theory in order to explain the introduction of organizational practices. While agency theory provides the rationale of the model's introduction, neoinstitutional theory explicates the nature of the selected organizational practice.

This qualitative study examines the motivations for venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to act opportunistically toward one another. Structured interviews with 14 employees and five investors in a VC-funded startup revealed that venture capitalists expect opportunistic behaviour from entrepreneurs during investment rounds, but largely trust entrepreneurs between financing rounds. Both the venture capitalists and entrepreneurs reported that venture capitalists act opportunistically towards the entrepreneur and other venture partners during all stages of the startup development. These findings have important implications for entrepreneurship research, most notably, the applicability of agency theory as a theoretical perspective from which to view the complex relationship between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.

There exists a gap in the literature available in the area of supply chain management (SCM) studies, on providing theoretical support for explaining the existence and the domain of SCM. This study, explores eight SCM theories and views for SCM studies: resource-based view, transaction cost theory, knowledge-based view, strategic choice theory, agency theory, institutional theory, systems theory, and network perspective. The main objective of this paper is to provide a framework for the developments of SC theories, and elaborate the possible ways that these theories can be applied to the case of Business to Business (B2B) e-Marketplace (EM) enabled supply chain. The case of EM is selected as one of the most recent collaborative tools in SCM studies and describes how the current SCM theories can be employed. (c) Common Ground.

It is common for host organizations that operate conventions to employ professional conference organizers (PCOs) to perform a variety of professional services relating to the organization, management and operation of the event. As such, a productive relationship between the host and PCO is essential to the successful operation of the event. Yet, the relationship is often strained as the host organization may feel uncertain about the selection of the PCO or may have reservations about its performance. Such an arrangement represents a classic principle-agent relationship that can be examined through agency theory. This study examines this relationship from the perspective of the host organization. It found that hosts do express concerns about adverse selection and moral hazard, but that these concerns can be mitigated by a series of pre- and post-contract awarding control measures.

In this study, we examine two factors that impact managers' willingness to share private information during the project review stage of capital budgeting. Drawing on the cognitive dissonance theory and the agency theory, we find that both high perceived personal responsibility and the use of project reviews for performance evaluation result in a greater tendency for managers to withhold negative private information. However, we do not find an interaction between these two factors. Our study makes a contribution to both the academic literature investigating factors affecting project reviews and the practitioner literature looking at design and implementation of effective project reviews.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the Agency Theory in order to understand the true nature of the corporation by determining the respective roles of shareholders and directors/managers within a corporation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper compares the economists' depiction of the firm with the legal conception of the corporation. It then analyses the legal concept of ownership and proves that the shareholders are the owners of their shares only and not of the corporation which is a separate legal person. The theories of corporation and relevant case law are also analysed. Findings - The analysis reveals that currently there are two distinct models of the corporation. The economists view a firm in terms of a nexus of contracts like a partnership where shareholders are the owners of the firm and the directors/managers are their agents. The law, on the other hand, regards the corporation as a separate legal entity with rights and liabilities of a natural person that is not subject to ownership. This doctrine of legal personality is the grund norm of corporate law from which other principles like limited liability, perpetual succession, transferability of shares and independent board are derived. However, both economic and legal models converge upon the purpose of corporation i.e. maximization of shareholders value. Originality/value - The paper highlights the distinction between economic and legal models of the firm. It points out that from a legal perspective, neither the shareholders are the principals nor the managers are their agents as proposed by the Agency Theory. The economists assume conflict of interests between the shareholders and directors and devise mechanisms to reduce agency costs. Law, on the other hand, determines manifestly the rights and liabilities of each participant in corporate structure. The directors owe their duties to the corporation and manage it without interference from the shareholders. Such arrangement is a product of historical process and qualifies a corporation as a sui generis form of business organization. (c) 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

This paper analyzes the role of compensation methods in the process of fostering corporate entrepreneurship. Drawing on agency theory and expectancy theory, hypotheses relating compensation methods to employees' entrepreneurial behavior are empirically examined in the context of defense products firms aiming at encouraging their employees' innovations at the civilian markets. The results show that entrepreneurs prefer compensation that is related to the internal venture's performance. Managers' willingness to take on civilian projects is higher if they are assured that they will be personally compensated for the project's success. Surprisingly, the more entrepreneurial employees preferred staying in the defense market rather than converting to civilian markets. (c) 2009 M.E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved.

How do export producers and intermediaries structure their dyadic relationships? This study examines the factors that guide the behaviour and relationships between export producer and intermediary dyads. We examine both sides of a dyadic transaction and develop an export producer-intermediary behaviour typology by using a grounded theory method through qualitative interviews. We propose three forms of export producer-intermediary dyads based on the degree of information sharing, intensity of price negotiation, level of transaction costs, and partner satisfaction and propensity to export directly. These three forms are as follows: (1) competitive, (2) cooperative and (3) mismatched relationships. Copyright (c) 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This work focuses on analyzing the economic factors that influence the consumer's distribution channel choice. With this aim, we use the Agency Theory in order to understand the influence of related problems such as information asymmetries and opportunism. All of this is taken into account to examine the booking process of a particular tourism service: a hotel overnight. The analysis of a sample of 1,029 tourists who had made their booking either through Internet or through traditional channels has revealed interesting findings: (1) the main sources of uncertainty in the phases prior to the purchase choice are determined by the lack of trust towards the Internet, (2) signals emitted by firms to mitigate information asymmetries contribute to build trust towards the company chosen, and (3) trust towards selected firms shows how the buyer makes the reservation through the channel with the lowest perceived risk.

This study investigated the intermediation of expropriation in the linkage between corporate governance and firm value. We manifested the triple principal-agent relationships among minority shareholders, majority shareholders and the board of directors, and conceptualized the expropriation as rents demanded by majority shareholders to compensate their agency function in a theoretical framework of internal and external corporate-control mechanisms for firms with concentrated ownership structure. By using related party transactions as a direct measure for expropriation, and the data of related party transactions between 2002 and 2006 on China's stock market, we corroborated the negative value effect of expropriation, and found that the controlling capability of controlling shareholders, ownership balancing, identity of controlling shareholders, stock incentives for the board/executives, and the proportion of tradable shares are significantly associated with expropriation. Our work on expropriation would provide insight to understand the relationship between corporate governance and firm value, and lay a basis for future theory building on corporate governance.

This paper examines the link between equity compensation and executive risk taking in the merger process. We develop our hypotheses based on agency, prospect, and behavior agency theories. Based on a sample of 668 mergers during the period of 1993 to 2005, we find that acquiring firms'CEOs and executives have significantly higher equity compensation as a ratio of total compensation and their value of equity compensation enjoys a higher sensitivity to share price and return volatility compared to target firms prior to the initiation of the merger. When management is compensated with more stocks or options and the pay-for-performance sensitivity of their compensation is higher, they are more likely to acquire risky and high growth targets. This implies that stock and option grants induce risk-taking decisions for management, suggesting that equity compensation provides management with incentives to align with a firm's desired risk taking behavior.

As a consequence of the paradigm shift from an industrial society to an information society, the role of the entrepreneur ought to change from being an inventor of product/services to become a value creator. Hence, the focus of entrepreneurial ventures should be shifting towards creating viable business models rather than superior product/services. One major implication of the shift of entrepreneurial endeavour from product/services towards creating new business models is that hands on investors behind companies' have to be involved closer to the inception of new ventures in order to contribute to their portfolio companies.

The implementation of teamwork has been growing steadily in the last decade. Companies suppose that the use of teams improves their performance and supports the achievement of their strategic goals. The high relevance of teams in the business world is reflected by an increasing literature on teamwork, team success and the management of teams. One central question concerning the management of teams is the design of pay systems, especially of performance-based pay systems for teams. This aspect has not yet been fully explored in the literature with regard to the agency problems that are associated with managing teams and teamwork. This paper aims to close that gap by exploring how performance-based pay systems for teams should be designed from an expanded agency theory perspective with regard to possibly arising agency problems.

In this study, we view the contracts of top managers from an integrated agency theory-trust perspective, arguing that two conditions reflecting CEO risk bearing, top management team (TMT) behavioral uncertainty and CEO vulnerability, are negatively related to a CEO's perceptions of TMT benevolence toward him-/herself, which in turn influence the protective features of TMT contracts. Model tests on data from 122 family-owned firms in Spain support our hypotheses overall. Agency theory may be enhanced by accounting for a CEO's perceptions (as principal) of TMT benevolence and for the effect of those perceptions on contracts with TMT members (as agents).

This paper focuses on talent management failure by multinational enterprises (MNEs). It examines barriers to corporate advancement of talents located in subsidiaries and more specifically on promotion of talent already employed by the MNE to be part of the upper echelon management team at its centre. Drawing on agency and bounded rationality theories, we discuss the underlying causes of talent management failure in MNEs. At the subsidiary level, we draw on agency theory to delineate self-serving mechanisms displayed by subsidiary managers that might hinder effective talent management systems throughout the MNE. At the headquarter level, we use bounded rationality to explain how decision-making processes, and information top management teams use to make decisions about talent management results in overlooking talents at subsidiary level.

This research extends agency theory by exploring the influence of varied, competing, principal interests on executive actions. Findings reveal that ownership of a firm by dedicated institutional investors, who hold concentrated portfolios over time, is positively associated with firm use of strategic competitive actions. Ownership by transient institutional investors, who hold broad portfolios and make frequent trades based on current earnings, is negatively associated with strategic competitive actions and positively associated with tactical ones. Appreciable ownership of the same firm by these two classes of investors influences both strategic and tactical competitive actions. These results have broad implications for executives, investors, and policy makers. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Agency theory suggests that managerial mischief may occur when the interests of owners and managers diverge and that a solution to this agency problem is alignment of owner and agent interests through agent compensation and equity ownership. We develop the theoretical concept of CEO return and measure and estimate financial alignment as the relationship between CEO and shareholder returns. Our results, based on this new conceptualization and corresponding measurement, suggest stronger alignment than reported in previous work. The magnitude of this alignment is associated with subsequent firm performance, but in ways not clearly articulated or tested in prior research. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

We provide an overview of the articles and commentaries devoted to theories of family enterprise in this special issue and link them to the concept of trust. Trust is a governance mechanism and theoretical construct of particular relevance for family firms, encapsulating some of their advantages and disadvantages. Trust is also linked to theoretical frameworks such as agency theory, stewardship theory, social capital theory, and transaction cost economics that are often used in family business studies, including those found in this special issue. Consequently, we advance trust as a bridging concept to reconcile and enhance our understanding of family firms as a unique organizational form. (c) 2010 Baylor University.

Purpose: In view of a lack of understanding of the consequences of performance-based contracting (PBC), this paper aims to reveal deeper insights into the mechanisms inherent to PBC and explore which benefits and uncertainties may result for providers and customers. Design/methodology/approach: Conducting a comprehensive literature review and drawing on insights from agency theory as a framework, the auhtors analyzed a broad range of academic publications on the benefits and uncertainties of PBC and developed testable propositions from the provider's and the customer's perspective. Findings: With PBC, in comparison to the conventional selling and supporting of machinery or equipment, the manufacturers are more likely to acquire customers for highly innovative technologies, to increase their profit, and to improve customer loyalty. Manufacturers, however, have to deal with uncertain revenues and costs which affect their profit. The customers are more likely to receive increased performance at decreased costs. Concerning the performance, however, the customers enter into an uncertain relationship of dependence. Originality/value: This is the first paper to analyze the benefits and uncertainties of PBC in manufacturing industries systematically from an agency theory perspective. The paper further develops extant research by outlining the mechanisms of PBC and relating the benefits and uncertainties that are scattered over a broad body of literature. The paper proposes several promising avenues for further research. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The purchase of business services has become an important part of organizations' acquisition of external resources, and is therefore receiving growing scholarly attention. The supply management function is increasingly supporting more complex service purchases, including a wide range of marketing services. The trend to involve supply management in the purchase of these complex business services is partially being driven by increasing awareness of the value of applying standard purchasing techniques to the purchase of these non-standard items. The purchase of such services has historically been managed by content experts, with limited involvement of supply management. However, the involvement of supply management in these purchases is driving the content experts to adopt a more facilitating relationship in which both areas interact with the supplier. This research uses Agency Theory as a lens to look at the Agency Triad among supply management, marketing, and suppliers. Elaborating on prior seminal work, the basic tenets of Agency Theory and its assumptions regarding human behavior are combined with the results of a focus group and case studies to develop propositions on the design of contractual arrangements between two Principals (marketing and supply management) and a single Agent who provides marketing services.

Understanding the nature of family representation in public firms has been an important topic for entrepreneurship research. Because CEO compensation is a key tool that boards use to align the interests of shareholders and managers, researchers have taken steps toward understanding how family representation affects CEO compensation. Prior research has painted family-member CEOs as stewards who accept lower compensation. Based on agency theory, we describe a different scenario wherein family representatives engage in strategic control that reduces family-member CEOs' compensation. Thus, family-member CEOs accept lower compensation only when additional family members are represented in management or on the board. In comparison with CEOs at nonfamily firms, we find that family-member CEO compensation is 13% lower when multiple family members are involved, but 56% higher when the CEO is the lone family member.

abstractBy combining insights from relational network theory and agency theory we identify the boundary conditions to the embeddedness approach to partner selection decisions in interfirm collaborations. Employing a longitudinal dataset comprising the investment syndicates for the population of UK management buyouts between 1993 and 2003, we find that relational embeddedness is less important for selecting partners when agency risks are low, allowing firms to expand their networks. Furthermore, reputational capital may act as a partial substitute for relational embeddedness, again permitting firms to expand their networks. Our findings enhance understanding of the boundary conditions associated with the relational network approach to partner selections and network behaviour. (c) 2010 The Authors.

We examine contract choices in the provision of "software-as-a- service" (SaaS), which is a business innovation that transforms information technology (IT) resources into a continuously provided service. We draw upon agency theory and modularity theory to propose that one of the central challenges in service disaggregation is that of knowledge interdependencies across client and provider organizations. The resulting lack of verifiability of certain tasks results in a multitask agency problem. Our key research questions involve (1) the suitability of high- versus low-powered incentives in SaaS contracts when the outsourced tasks involve business analytics that are difficult to verify, and (2) how such contract choices are affected by the modularity of interfaces between the client and the provider. Analysis of data collected from 154 providers of SaaS offering a range of IT services supports our contention that when contracting for business analytics characterized by knowledge interdependencies across clients and providers, incentives should be "low powered." Modularity in the interfaces of the service provider increases the desirability of high-powered incentives in such situations. Our results are robust after accounting for endogeneity issues arising from unobserved matching between service providers and the nature of IT services outsourced by clients. With the increasing importance of information systems in services, this paper suggests that arm's-length relationships and high-powered incentives may be ineffective in incentivizing providers to perform on complex business analytic tasks, unless accompanied by the modularization of interfaces.

It has been argued by researchers that agency theory has limitations as the underpinning theory for governance given its inability to recognize the wider environmental influencing forces impacting on organizations. This paper provides a case for incorporating a number of management-based theories to augment agency theory in recognizing these wider environmental influencing forces and the consequent extended governance paradigm it creates. Through a theory building approach that reviews and critically analyses the extant literature, a case is built to integrate four existing theories that complement each other to recognize these wider influencing forces. The paper argues that the proposed approach will narrow the theoretical practical gap in governance and will consequently have policy implications on governance guidelines. Further research is suggested to validate the approach with a wide range of real life organizational settings. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose using agency theory for assessing the likelihood of quality fade in buyersupplier relationships and prescribing contractual mechanisms for reducing quality fade. In this paper, quality fade, an element of supply chain vulnerability, is defined as the unforeseen deterioration of agreed to or expected quality levels with respect to product and/or service requirements. The use of outcomebased, behaviorbased, or mix contracts can be used to reduce the likelihood of quality fade and illustrate preferred scenarios for buyer and suppliers. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a conceptual model for using agency theory to explain and address a type of supply chain vulnerability called quality fade. A 2x2 matrix is proposed that contrasts outcome measurability with outcome uncertainty to illustrate buyer and supplier vulnerability and to suggest contractual mechanisms that can be used to mitigate vulnerability for both parties. Findings - A typology of governance mechanisms is presented and described with the use of a manufacturer thirdparty logistics provider example to illustrate the theoretical framework. Four different scenarios are discussed and described. Contractual mechanisms are provided to mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce quality fade. Originality/value - Quality fade is a term that has not been described extensively in academic literature but is a term that is relevant in the broader discussion of supply chain vulnerability. Given that quality fade is a behavioral, as opposed to process oriented, approach, it requires a theoretical framework rooted in behavioral considerations. Agency theory is an appropriate framework for studying governance options. (c) 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Agency theory offers a foundation for explaining the impact of project monitoring on project success. This study applied agency theory to survey 428 information systems project managers concerning their project monitoring, shirking by systems developers, and project success. Greater project monitoring via planning and meetings predicted less shirking, while greater monitoring via responsibilities and comparison did not. Less shirking via poor focus predicted increased project success, while less shirking via loafing did not. These findings have implications for project managers and project management researchers.

We examine how small and medium enterprises manage their international partners across different market servicing modes, namely exporting, joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries. The international business literature has placed emphasis on soft issues of international partner management (such as trust, cultural sensitivity etc.) in each mode category independently. Since network arrangements and knowledge sharing are involved in all these modes, we contribute to the literature by providing evidence on the mechanisms of international partner management across market modes. Specifically, based on agency and knowledge-based theories, we seek to understand the extent to which small and medium enterprises assign rights to make decisions to partners abroad, and the types of incentives and performance monitoring schemes they use. These mechanisms are drawn from agency theory. In-depth case studies were carried out in 14 Greek small firms that employed different modes to collaborate with their partners abroad. Seven of these firms had high levels of international performance while the other seven had low levels. We identify two distinguishable combinations of governance mechanisms being implemented by these two sets of firms: high performers pursue situational decision-making with outcome-oriented incentives/performance monitoring schemes, whereas low performers pursue centralized decision-making with behaviour-oriented incentives/performance monitoring schemes.

This study examines if the CEO duality influences firm performance in Bangladesh. It also examines the interaction of industries in influencing the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. From an observation of 825 firm years the study uses a 2-stage least square regression (2SLS) analysis. The finding is that there is a negative (non-significant) relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. However, when the industry interaction terms (the role of industries as moderating variable) are added, the CEO duality and firm performance is found to vary across industries. The findings of this study suggest that the CEO duality and firm performance is contingent; no single leadership structure is universal; both the leadership structure has cost and benefits. It is beneficial in some situation supporting the stewardship theory while it is not in other situations supporting the agency theory. This study contributes to the literature on CEO duality and firm performance in the context of developing countries.

In this chapter we present a natural open system approach to organizational control, as opposed to dominant approaches, which can be typified as either rational system approaches, closed system approaches (Scott,1987), or both. Our aim is to promote scholarly understanding of organizational control by drawing on a wider range of possible insights than dominant approaches do. Two scholarly traditions, both with rather strong foci on certain aspects of control, have been prominent in the field. The first tradition, represented by agency theory and rational choice models of human behavior (Eisenhardt, 1989), focuses on rational choice of control mechanisms by managers, with the underlying assumption that control choices are driven by effectiveness and efficiency concerns. This focus typifies a rational system approach. The second tradition, represented by bureaucracy studies, draws on agency theory and the critical management tradition (for an overview of this tradition see Delbridge, Chapter 4) to focus on reactions to managerial control by those subjected to it. The studies in this tradition have mainly highlighted the constraining, harnessing, distrust-signaling perceptions of control. Both traditions can be typified as closed system approaches, since factors outside the organization, such as organizational environments, are not included in the analysis of employee reactions. We propose to move from these rather narrow rational and closed system approaches to a more encompassing understanding of factors involved in shaping managerial choices and reactions of employees.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: We examine how various types of shareholder activists (such as pension funds and large blockholders) impact the relative use of equity incentives at the middle management level of the firm and compare this with the impact on CEO incentive alignment. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of 124 US technology firms over the period 1997-2001, we find evidence indicating voice activist shareholders, using communication pressure, are associated with the greater use of equity incentives, and higher total compensation at middle managerial levels, relative to exit activists, who exert economic pressure. The results for CEO equity incentives are similar. We also find that as the presence of institutional ownership siding with management (banks and insurance companies) increases relative to voice activists, the use of equity incentives at middle managerial levels declines. Results for CEO equity incentives are not the same. Theoretical/Academic Implications: In agreement with contingent agency theory, we predict and find evidence of differing governance mechanisms used by voice activists (e.g., public pension funds) and exit activists (e.g., large shareholders). Voice activists face a higher cost of monitoring managers as compared to exit activists, and thus they will advocate for the heavier use of equity incentive compensation at the middle managerial level. In agreement with a managerial power perspective, however, we also find the use of equity incentives for middle managers decreases as the proportion of institutional ownership siding with the CEO increases. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Shareholder activism plays a key role in aligning managerial interests below the CEO level; however, different types of shareholders have different economic and political interests in how equity compensation is shaped to achieve this. Exit activists use monitoring and voice activists substitute equity compensation for monitoring. Shareholders siding with management may also reduce the use of equity incentives for middle managers. These differing interests should be considered in crafting policy responses. (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

While much has been written on specificity (e.g., in texts on new institutional economics, agency theory, and team production theory), there are still some insights to be learnt by business ethicists. This article approaches the issue from the perspective of team production, and will propose a new form of corporate governance: enlightened corporate governance, which takes into consideration the specific investments of employees. The article argues that, in addition to shareholders, employees also bear a residual risk which arises due to their specific investments. This residual risk presents a valid and legitimate basis for residual claims. In this way, employees can be seen as residual claimants due to the fact that their income depends upon a hazardous quasi rent. Therefore, this article will call on the fiduciary duty of board members to protect those employees who are exposed to such residual risks and may thus be vulnerable as a result. This leads to a fundamental change of perspective on the "theory of the firm" - a change which will adopt the theories of new institutional economics, agency theory, and team production theory in order to promote business ethics research. Against this background, enlightened corporate governance aims to follow the criterion of specific investments as a legitimate basis for residual claims. Furthermore, it seeks to understand the consequences for board members, and to promote the sharing of control and ownership. The article will close with some discussion of the implications and future prospects for business ethics. (c) Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

This study examines the impact of ERP systems on earnings management. We use the absolute value of discretionary accruals as a proxy for earnings management, comparing levels for 143 firms in 32 industry groups that implemented ERP systems between 1994 and 2003 to levels for a control group. We find that over a ten-year period surrounding the implementation date, ERP implementers show a significant decrease in the absolute value of total discretionary accruals, while the control group does not. We further find that short-term discretionary accruals are driving the results, while long-term discretionary accruals show no significant change for either group.

We develop a theory of advertising agency compensation, client evaluation and switching costs, with extensions to agency theory. When clients are exposed to high switching costs, they become more vulnerable to the risk of agency costs. In response, clients can select compensation and evaluation decisions that convey fairness, signal their commitment, and invite agency reciprocity. With high switching costs, outcome-based compensation and formal evaluation procedures are likely. High switching costs are associated with signifi'cant relationship investments, mature relationships, large clients, formal evaluation, and with clients that use their agencies as strategic partners. Clients surveyed in North America support the theory. (c) 2010 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

In this paper we use agency theory to present a process of the dichotomization of the Israeli workforce into two structures, each representing distinct organizational cultures. The first structure is the private sector, led by the high-tech industry; a model where the principal has strong control over the activities of the agent. The second is the public sector, an opposing model in which the principal has virtually no control over the activities of the agents and as a result, the effectiveness within this sector deteriorates. We argue that such conflicting systems cannot exist side by side without affecting each other and we suggest a role for human resource management (HRM) in future developments. Within the public sector it is the responsibility of the principal, the Israeli government, to gain more control over the agent and employ professional HRM systems for this purpose.

Theory and practice of technology transfer and entrepreneurial behaviour of academics are novel. We draw upon the literature of business models, transaction costs, professional and organisational culture and of agency theory to formulate a framework for a technology transfer business model. We present the range of options used by universities and we examine the spin out option, as context and contrast to the MUAS approach. The case of the MUAS is presented. It illustrates the conceptual framework developed and has thus far been successful in its specific environment. Replication might require adaptation, but this particular approach can offer useful lessons. Tentative hypotheses for research on business model adaptation are derived from the study.

This study derives an improved model of managers' decision-making behavior regarding possibly failing projects. Instead of adopting cognitive moral development used by Rutledge and Karim (Accounting, Organization and Society 24, 173-184, 1999) this investigation uses the agency theory framework to consider individual moral philosophy for the improvement of decisions regarding possibly failing projects. This research hypothesizes that a manager with low relativism has a stronger tendency to discontinue a possibly failing project than one with high relativism when agency problem are present or absent. Also, this study suggests that a manager with high idealism has a stronger tendency to discontinue a possibly failing project than one with low idealism. Through experiments this work finds that agency problem is a significant factor on decisions regarding possibly failing projects in all circumstances. This result is consistent with prior literature and shows agency problem universality. Next, the empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that a project manager with low relativism tends to discontinue a possibly failing project more than one with high relativism, showing that individual moral philosophy can partially mitigate the phenomenon of escalating managers' commitment.

Motivated by the inconsistent findings of the linkage between early supplier involvement practice and new product development success, this study adopts both the resource-based perspective and agency theory to investigate dynamic relationships between the manufacturer and supplier during the collaboration process. Survey data were used to empirically examine the impact of the resource factor (i.e. collaboration effect) and agency factors (i.e. interaction effect) on project team effectiveness. The results showed that selecting suppliers with appropriate knowledge and resources is necessary yet insufficient to improve project team effectiveness. The agency problem plays a dominant role in determining the quality of collaboration. In particular, the study identified information sharing and task programmability as two key governance mechanisms to curb suppliers' opportunistic behaviour. The study provides insightful managerial and policy implications for firms considering early supplier involvement practice in their innovation process.

Internet-based affiliate marketing programs have emerged as one of the fastest-growing methods for online retailers to acquire customers and increase sales by tapping into the power of independent web sites to reach a large, diverse audience of potential customers. However, while these programs have proven effective in increasing website traffic and sales, illegal or inappropriate activities on the part of affiliates could negatively impact a retailer's brand in the eyes of customers. This study is an exploratory analysis of governance mechanisms (formal contracts, partner selection, incentives and monitoring) in one-to-many affiliate programs in Spain. Agency theory and transaction cost analysis provide the theoretical background. The conclusion is that there is a significant lack of transparency in the guidance and restrictions communicated to affiliates, and a lack of systematic monitoring of affiliate behavior, which increases the risk of opportunism or misconduct. General recommendations for managers of affiliate programs are considered. Copyright (c) 2010, IGI Global.

Theoretically, business networks can be defined and characterized based on diverse perspectives, such as sociology, psychology, economics, technology, organizational theories or the field of strategy. This thoughtful article is the result of exploratory research from an analytical-critical perspective of a theoretical nature and proposes a complementary and interdisciplinary theoretical interaction to analyze and characterize business networks, based on theoretical work by different authors on resource dependence theory, transaction costs theory and network theory, in the institutional context of agency theory. The main contribution of this theoretical development is the possibility to analyze not only the structure but also the dynamic of business networks. The proposal includes the conceptual construction of a definition of business networks, a reflection on the impact of the levels of analysis of business networks, and finally the selection and relationship between the variables resulting from the theoretical interaction for their characterization. The theoretical result of this research will make it possible to characterize diverse business networks in any sector in practice.

While the process of pursuing an initial public offering (IPO) provides new capital with which new ventures might pursue significant opportunities, research suggests that many IPO firms decrease in value subsequent to the new offering. Using an agency perspective, we argue that the IPO process itself may not only raise direct governance costs (due to increased monitoring and bonding), but may also create a distraction for managers who need to remain focused on the strategy to effectively use a large infusion of capital from the IPO. Likewise, we argue that governance participants, especially board members, will be distracted by the work necessary to take the firm public and, as such, may not be focused on the strategic monitoring necessary for continued firm's viability. This lack of monitoring may also allow managerial opportunism to be more prevalent, especially given the large amount of capital available to managers once the IPO is completed. Accordingly, we argue that excessive governance costs (both direct and indirect) may be associated with the IPO process and subsequent IPO firm performance.

Radical strategic change, a common event in high technology new ventures, presents a conflict between potential opportunity and the risk of departing from a planned and approved strategy. This study explores investors' perspectives regarding RSC in their portfolio companies, based on interviews of 13 private investors who are active venture capitalists or business angels. The study explores the investors' views based on three theories of VC-entrepreneur relationships: agency theory, stewardship theory and game theory. The findings indicate three approaches taken by investors: avoidance, expectation and passivity. Since the success of radical strategic change is critical to venture performance, it is suggested that investors adopt the expectation approach, which optimises the prisoner's dilemma inherent in the VC-entrepreneur relationship during such events. The findings of this exploratory study indicate the need for further research. (c) 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The study investigates the relationship of corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structure and the Egyptian firm performance. This study utilizes a sample of 50 firms using the accounting and market data available for the period 2004-2006. The sample firms are all listed in either the Cairo or Alexandria Stock. The cross-sectional regression analysis is employed to test the hypotheses of the study. The results indicate a positive significant relationship between firm performance and the percentage of outside directors in boards and the existence of institutional representatives in boards. Furthermore, a significant negative relationship exists between firm performance and board size, role duality and the existence of firm's website. The results also reveal a significant, positive relationship between firm performance measures and the percentage of women members in boards of directors in Egyptian firms. Our results support previous literature and show consistency with the agency theory.

In the first decade of the 21st century, China's Research Community (CRC) is struggling to achieve better performance by increasing growth in knowledge quantity (e.g., publications), but has failed to generate sound growth in knowledge quality (e.g., citations). An innovative E-government project, Internet-based Science Information System (ISIS), was applied nationwide in 2003 with a variety of embedded incentives. The system has been well received and supports the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) to implement managerial control to cope with pressing demands relating to China's research productivity. This paper explores the impact of Information Systems (IS) from the perspective of agency theory based on CRC empirical results. Since the nationwide application of ISIS in 2003, CRC outcomes have markedly improved. The discussion and directions for future research examine implications of IS for E-government implementation and business environment building in developing countries. Copyright (c) 2010, IGI Global.

The diffusion of public agencies seems to characterize the European approach to public management. We analyze the governance mechanisms and, according to agency theory, the related accountability requirements in order to investigate if there is a conflict between public agency autonomy and political targets achievement. According to a multiple case study analysis, we consider three Italian public agencies: the Revenue Agency (AE), Social Security National Institute (INPS), and National Procurement Agency (CONSIP). Thus, we propose a model highlighting, for each public agency, the factors that are crucial to verify both the decision-making autonomy and coherence with public policy.

This paper tests the effect of managerial (inside) and block-holders (outside) ownership in relation to agency theory in Malaysian business environment. This study tests the agency relationship in different culture and social contact and provides evidence whether agency theory in non-western organizations have equal impact in Asian organizations. Consistent with agency theory and the convergence of interest hypothesis, managerial ownership (insiders) in Malaysia indicate a negative relationship with the demand for monitoring. This finding may be due to the fact that as the managers are also the owners, there is less conflict, less information asymmetry and less hierarchical organization structure in the companies, which lead to lower monitoring costs. However, another ownership structure, outside block-holders appear to demand more monitoring. This positive relationship may be explained by their effort to compensate their lack of involvement in the daily transactions and internal decisions of the company, especially in the concentrated business environment in the country.

This paper offers a new explanation of the gender pay gap in leadership positions by examining the relationship between managerial bonuses and company performance. Drawing on findings of gender studies, agency theory, and the leadership literature, we argue that the gender pay gap is a context-specific phenomenon that results partly from the fact that company performance has a moderating impact on pay inequalities. Employing a matched sample of 192 female and male executive directors of U.K.-listed firms, we corroborate the existence of the gender pay disparities in corporate boardrooms. In line with our theoretical predictions, we find that bonuses awarded to men are not only larger than those allocated to women, but also that managerial compensation of male executive directors is much more performance-sensitive than that of female executives. The contribution of attributional and expectancy-related dynamics to these patterns is highlighted in line with previous work on gender stereotypes and implicit leadership theories such as the romance of leadership. Gender differences in risk taking and confidence are also considered as potential explanations for the observed pay disparities. The implications of organizations' indifference to women's performance are examined in relation to issues surrounding the recognition and retention of female talent.

Extant research considers the IT governance choice to be a trade-off between the cost-efficiency of centralization and the responsiveness provided by local information processing. This view predicts that firms tend to decentralize IT governance in more uncertain environments. We investigate this issue by studying the relationship between environmental uncertainty and IT infrastructure governance in a sample of business units from Fortune 1000 companies. The key proposition in this paper is that the relationship between environmental uncertainty and decentralization in IT infrastructure governance is best characterized as a curvilinear relationship. That is, when environmental uncertainty increases from low to high, firms tend to first decentralize their IT infrastructure decisions to the business units to enhance their responsiveness; and then centralize their IT infrastructure decisions to the headquarters as uncertainty increases further, to achieve the benefits of coordination and to mitigate the potential agency problem in uncertain environments. Moreover, the study proposes that business unrelatedness between business units and their headquarters moderates the curvilinear relationship between environmental uncertainty and IT infrastructure governance. We find that both the propositions are supported by the data. (c) 2011 INFORMS.

As corporate managers interact with nonshareholder stakeholders, potential tradeoffs emerge and questions arise as to how these interactions impact shareholder value. We argue that this shareholder-stakeholder debate is an important issue within the overall corporate governance and corporate policy domain and examine one such stakeholder group - employees - by studying labor-friendly corporate practices. We find that announcements of labor-friendly policies are associated with positive abnormal stock returns. Labor-friendly firms also outperform otherwise similar firms, both in terms of long-run stock market returns and operating results. In addition, we find that the probability and benefits of labor-friendliness increase with the demand for highly skilled labor. Our analysis of excess executive compensation suggests that top management derives no pecuniary benefits from labor-friendly practices. We interpret our results as consistent with a genuine concern for employees translating into higher productivity and profitability, which in turn facilitate value creation. It appears that the benefits of labor-friendly practices significantly outweigh the costs and that what is good for employees is good for shareholders. (c) Springer 2010.

This paper contributes to multiple agency theory by examining how the compensation schemes awarded to outside directors and the CEO jointly affect firm-level risk taking. Using data of the S&P 1500 firms from 1997 to 2006, we find support for earlier arguments that providing the CEO, the outside directors, or both with stock options increases risk taking. More importantly, we find that compensating outside directors with stock options has significantly stronger effects than CEO stock options. Finally, contrary to what one would expect, we find that these effects are mutually substituting; that is, if both the outside directors and the CEO are provided with stock option compensation, outside directors' incentives weaken the effect of the CEO's incentives on firms' risk taking.

In this study, we examine whether the presence of a founder influences the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and company performance in a sample of European, publicly traded, family firms. Our findings contradict the widespread belief that smaller and more independent boards as well as nondual leadership structures always lead to better firm performance, suggesting that agency theory is limited in its explanation of the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. We find a positive effect of board size on business performance in nonfounder-led family firms and a negative effect of board size on founder-led family businesses. The presence of independent directors on the board has a positive effect on performance when a firm is run by its founder. However, when descendants lead the firm, the presence of independent directors has a negative effect on performance. Although the effect of board meetings on firm performance is positive, this relationship is weaker when the family business is run by its founder. Finally, CEO duality improves firm performance when descendants run the business, although CEO duality has no effect on performance when the firm is led by the founder. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Organisations increasingly outsource service delivery to specialist subcontractors. These buyers, their subcontractors and their end customers operate in a triadic service relationship. In these triads, the buyer lacks direct control over service delivery and completely depends on the subcontractor for its performance towards its end customers. Subcontractors are confronted with two principals (buyer and end customer) who may have conflicting objectives.Although traditionally focusing on dyadic buyer-seller relationships rather than triads, Agency Theory provides valuable suggestions on the type of contract to be used and the type of monitoring to be employed. We adopt Agency Theory as a theoretical lens to look at the buyer-subcontractor-end customer triad and develop propositions on the design of contractual arrangements and monitoring activities. We use the results of two cases of service triads to provide some initial validation for these propositions. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose: This paper aims to explore the complex relationships between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, pay satisfaction and job satisfaction at the retailer that uses a pay-for-performance plan for front-line employees. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on a single organization case study across seven stores, and uses a survey, archival documents, open-ended questions and researcher interaction with employees and managers. Findings: The results provide some support for the complementary nature of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation was positively associated with pay and job satisfactions, whereas extrinsic motivation was negatively associated with job satisfaction, and not associated with pay satisfaction. The qualitative insights indicate that pay fairness is important, and those who perceived pay was not fair generally made comparisons with others or felt that pay did not reflect their effort. It is also found that the majority of employees perceived that goals were clear. Research limitations/implications: The dominance of extrinsic motivation without including behavioural, social, and psychological factors in agency theory research is questioned. The research finds no support for "crowding out", but rather finds some evidence of "crowding in" where intrinsic motivation is enhanced, to the detriment of extrinsic motivation. Practical implications: The findings highlight that managers should enhance both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and pay employees well to increase job satisfaction. Originality/value: Few studies examine incentives for front-line employees, and there is evidence that minimum wage employees can have high intrinsic motivation. Perceptions of pay fairness can vary across motivation levels, age, and gender. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Little research has examined the performance implications of the parent-child relationship post spin-off. Although the parent provided oversight of the child prior to the spin-off, effects of post spin-off links to the child remain unclear. Applying transaction cost and agency theories, our study of 142 firms spun-off between 1986 and 1997 examines how oversight and ownership by the parent firm influence stock market performance post spin-off. We find that while child firms benefit from some links to the parent, having too many links is negatively related to performance. The findings suggest that there is a balance between having too much parental involvement and not enough. Our study extends understanding of post spin-off child firm performance and provides valuable insights for both parent and child firms. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study uses organizational theory to explore why nonprofit organizations conduct evaluations and how they use evaluation information. According to rational choice theory, managers of nonprofit organizations will conduct evaluations to make sure they are making good decisions about how to improve their services and achieve their goals. Yet, according to data gathered about the experiences of 31 nonprofit organizations, this assumption about the evaluation practices of nonprofits rarely holds true. Rather, other organizational theories, such as agency theory, institutional theory, resource dependence theory, and stewardship theory, which make different assumptions about how organizations operate and how managers behave, provide a more accurate description of why nonprofits engage in evaluation and how they use evaluation information. The findings from this study are important because they help to identify strategies that would encourage nonprofit organizations to use evaluation in more productive and meaningful ways.

The broad range of activities undertaken in a hotel, combined with its high labour intensity and volatile demand, signify a predisposition particularly suited to outsourcing. In this paper, transaction cost economics (TCE) theory, agency theory and the broader outsourcing literature are drawn upon to inform the distillation of 20 outsourcing/insourcing motives. The relative significance of these motives is examined using interview and survey data. While broad support is provided for the TCE model, it is apparent that the model does not constitute a robust framework with the capacity to comprehensively account for outsourcing behaviour.

For decades, managers' powers and their freedom to make strategic decisions were taken for granted in the field of corporate governance. The present crisis has revealed that their managerial latitude is in reality much weaker than thought. The growing influence of shareholders has undermined the historical and professional legitimacy of managers, who are now viewed as 'agents' controlled by 'principals'. This paper makes two contributions. First, we hold that the crisis is not a purely economic or financial crisis but a fundamental crisis of management, with its function of regulating the relationship between the firm and society. Second, we show that this crisis is rooted in law, since corporate law does not actually protect the autonomy of management. Until now, management theory has underestimated the role of law in the evolutions of corporate governance; we argue that management research needs to open its boundaries and specifically to re-examine corporate law. We suggest new governance rules to ensure managers have the latitude to organize collective creation processes in a way that is both efficient and legitimate. And we discuss some avenues for reflecting on a post-crisis business law. (c) 2011 The Author(s). British Journal of Management (c) 2011 British Academy of Management.

Offshore outsourcing of administrative and technical services has become a mainstream business practice. Increasing commoditization of business services and growing client experience with outsourcing have created a range of competitive service delivery options for client firms. Yet, data from the Offshoring Research Network (ORN) suggests that, despite increasing market options and growing client expectations related to service quality and cost efficiency, clients typically renew provider contracts and develop longer-term relationships with providers. Based on ORN data, this paper explores drivers of this phenomenon. The findings suggest that providers promote contract renewal by making client specific investments in software, IT infrastructure and training, and by involving clients in outsourcing operations, thereby increasing relation specific joint equity and creating opportunities for client monitoring and control. Interestingly, these strategies apply to routine rather than knowledge-intensive tasks, and are more likely to be applied by large rather than small providers. Surprisingly, high degree of contract specification makes contract renewal less likely. The paper contributes to the growing literature on strategic outsourcing of business services and the importance of governance mechanisms addressing "hidden costs" as well as "hidden benefits" of offshore outsourcing relationships.

In developed markets including the United States, family-controlled firms, in particular founder-controlled firms, have been associated with higher firm performance than their nonfamily counterparts. Such family-controlled firms have concentrated ownership, which, according to agency theory, reduces agency costs and leads to superior firm value. Extant research, however, is not clear whether it is the family control or concentrated ownership that bestows the advantages that lead to enhanced firm performance. By examining different types of concentrated ownership, this study evaluates whether family ownership adds value beyond that provided by concentrated ownership. Based on analyses of panel data from the Indian corporate sector, we find that, in general, firms with concentrated ownership outperform firms with dispersed ownership. Surprisingly, and more importantly, however, we find there are no significant performance differences among family-controlled firms and firms controlled by either foreign corporations or the state. This result is consistent with the notion that concentrated ownership, not family control, is a key determinant of firm performance. (c) 2011 Strategic Management Society.

In the slipstream of several large-scale corporate scandals, the board of directors has gained a pivotal position in the corporate governance debate. However, due to an overreliance on particular methodological (i. e. input-output studies) and theoretical (i. e. agency theory) research fortresses in past board research, academic knowledge concerning how this important governance mechanism actually operates and functions remains relatively limited. This theoretical paper aims to contribute to the promising stream of research which focuses on behavioural perspectives and processes within the corporate board, by delving into one of the research areas perhaps plagued most by these predominant approaches: board leadership. In adopting a team perspective on the board of directors our study goes beyond traditional board leadership research, which has turned a blind eye on actual leadership dynamics, by examining leadership processes and behaviours inside the board team. Specifically, we develop a conceptual framework addressing a novel and ethical approach to team leadership within the board, i. e. shared leadership, which has previously been demonstrated to result in performance benefits in various other team settings.

The aim of this study is to understand the ability of stewardship theory, as compared with agency theory, to explain motivation of the staff in a Not-for-Profit (NFP) organisation. Agency theory is seen as providing an explanation of motivation in the business sector however we argue that the different cultural and organisational conditions weaken the explanatory power of agency theory in the NFP sector. In pursuing this investigation, we were mindful of Brinberg's (2009) encouragement for a more outward-looking approach to management accounting issues and in particular his call for the use qualitative research methods and to allow practice to inform theory.Interviews were conducted with staff of a NFP organisation to gauge the impact of the introduction of a bonus scheme. The interviews sought to provide answers to three questions: what is the main source of motivation in the organisation? Were tensions created in the organisation by the introduction of the bonus scheme? Was there a change in the culture of the organisation, comprising camaraderie between staff, having fun at work, trust between management and staff, and an attitude of service to clients? Practical implications: This finding has important implications for the management of NFPs. To maintain and improve motivation, management needs to look to the goals, or mission, of the organisation - in particular, to see that the goals include care of and service to clients. Originality/value: The originality and value of this paper stems from the fact that the data was gather in a NFP organisation that had introduced an extrinsic reward scheme. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Application service providers (ASP), who host and maintain information technology (IT) applications across the Internet, emerged as an innovation in the way IT services are delivered to client firms. In spite of many potential benefits of this model, ASPs experienced business failure and high rates of exit. Drawing on agency theory, we argue that the efficiency of contracting arrangements between ASPs and client organizations is an important determinant of ASP survival. We test this prediction using a unique data set combining multiple sources that allows us to track an ASP from the year of founding through the beginning of 2006. Contractual misalignment, or adopting contracts mismatched with the underlying agency costs, significantly lowers the probability of survival of service providers in the ASP marketplace. The impact of misalignment is particularly severe when coupled with adjustment costs that impede the transition to aligned contracts. To account for potential heterogeneity in ASPs' knowledge of contracting, we test for endogenous self-selection of ASPs in the relationship between contractual misalignment and survival. Our results are robust to a variety of model specifications as well as alternate explanations of survival from multiple theoretical domains. (c) 2011 INFORMS.

Successive layers of supervisor-subordinate relationships in organizations often distort information, increase monitoring costs, and lead to a cumulative loss of control. This paper discusses how some organizations can reduce their internal hierarchy by slicing it into two components and substituting the supervisor-subordinate relationship with an independent contract. This substitution allows the organization to shift its lower-level hierarchy to the contractors. These contractors are less likely to indulge in moral hazard, which can further reduce the size of hierarchy required. The paper examines this theory in the domain of multi-unit franchising and tests the hypotheses with a longitudinal data set. (c) 2011 New York University.

How can the internal governance of civil society organizations be conceptualized more adequately by accounting for the dual and simultaneous requirements of controlling and coaching in board behavior? Empirically, we seem to agree that effective governance of a civil society organization is crucial to its sustained viability. Conceptually, however, we observe a lack of consensus on how to best understand CSO governance. By critically juxtaposing two major theoretical lenses to conceptualize governance, namely, agency and stewardship theory, we identify a number of challenges when dealing with board-management relations that deserve our attention. While agency theory privileges controlling behavior, stewardship theory emphasizes the coaching behavior of boards. The purpose of this article is to offer a concept of governance that is informed by a paradox perspective advancing a subtler, more adequate conceptualization of board governance that accounts for these often conflicting demands on CSO governance. Drawing on illustrations from a longitudinal interpretive case study, we exemplify our propositions empirically. The article concludes with discussing the implications of our argument for CSO governance research and practice.

We revisit the relationship between attendance and performance in the undergraduate university setting and apply agency theory in the instructor-student context. Building on agency theory propositions in the educational setting advanced by Smith, Zsidisin, and Adams (2005), we propose that the student and instructor must align goals to promote the student's achievement of performance learning outcomes, and attendance functions as a behavior-based alignment mechanism to encourage the convergence of faculty and student interests. Further, we propose that attendance does not equally affect lower- and higher-performing students and that absences are also negatively related to students' cumulative grade point average. We test these hypotheses with data from undergraduates enrolled in management courses at a state university in the southeast. Our results show that attendance is positively related to exam performance, there are more pronounced negative effects of an absence for lower-performing students than for higher performers, and absences are negatively related to a student's cumulative grade point average. We discuss the implications of our findings for students, instructors, and universities as well as practice in teaching and learning.

Whether or not to adopt and how extensively to use a newly legitimized practice are discrete decisions made by firms undergoing institutional change. The aim of this paper is to identify the distinct effects of economic, social, and political factors on the adoption of performance-related pay practices and their coverage (i.e. the proportion of employees covered by the practices) by integrating institutional and agency theories. An empirical analysis is performed with a unique sample of Korean firms that experienced the East Asian financial crisis of 1997. The results show that while performance-related pay adoption was influenced by economic and social factors, performance-related pay coverage was related to political factors as well as economic and social factors. This finding suggests that while firms adopt performance-related pay practices in search of legitimacy, they do not blindly imitate such practices but rather proactively adapt them based on economic efficiency considerations. This study makes valuable contributions to research on institutionalism and remuneration by empirically identifying the conditions under which a pay practice adopted for social legitimacy fits or fails to fit the economic needs of the adopters. 2011 The Authors.

This work shows how tenets of agency theory can be linked with institutional analysis to improve their explanatory power in the context of an emerging country such as Brazil. This study assessed the authors' propositions in a single-case analysis of a Brazilian multiple family firm. The results show that in the initial phase, characterized by less severe agency problems, the firm's competitive advantage matured, supported by the strong presence of trust derived from an extended family structure. As the company grew in complexity, the informal monitoring mechanisms that characterize collectivist societies allowed agency problems to escalate. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

This study attempts to highlight the paradoxical aspects of top management power contests within customer firms that outsource information technology (IT) work. Intraorganizational power theory forms the overarching theoretical basis for this study. The focus is on the antecedents and consequences of the relative power of business executives (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer) versus IT executives (Chief Information Officer, Head of IT) in the governance of IT outsourcing. Evidence from a field survey supports the existence of a paradox. When a firms financial performance has been poor and the firm did not have a sizeable IT workforce, the business executives give themselves greater power and sideline the IT executives. Paradoxically, rather than leading to positive consequences, such power play weakens outsourcing performance. Outsourcing performance is best when power is solely with the IT executives group, a close second best when power is divided between the two groups (joint decision making), and worst when it is solely with the business executives group. Overall, when it comes to the outsourcing of IT work, business executives might find reasons to justify increasing their own power and reducing the power of IT executives, even though this can ultimately be detrimental to outsourcing performance. These findings lend credence to case studies and practitioner articles that have reported such occurrences. Managerial relevance statement: Under pressure due to their firm's poor performance, business executives often blame IT executives by labeling in-house IT as a cost burden. IT executives are sidelined in decisions related to IT outsourcing due to suspicions that IT executives would be overprotective of their turf. Here, business executives might argue that they are acting in the interest of their firm. Paradoxically, findings suggest that an increase in dominance by business executives leads to a decrease in outsourcing performance. Hence, IT executives need to make a strong case with various stakeholders that they deserve considerable power in the governance of IT outsourcing. (c) 2011 IEEE.

Purpose: The growing prominence of knowledge workers in contemporary organisations has led to a considerable amount of research into their role and activities, however, despite this growing interest, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the relationship of knowledge workers to management. This paper aims to respond by investigating the features of knowledge work that impose barriers to traditional managerial control methods and exploring the extent to which alternative approaches to influence are available to knowledge work managers, and the circumstances under which these different approaches are indicated. Design/methodology/approach: The paper utilised agency theory to investigate the implications of knowledge asymmetry in principal-knowledge worker exchanges, and argues against the utility of models of control based on principles of scientific management on which agency models are typically based, towards models of control based on reciprocity and commitment. Findings: The paper has two main outputs. First, it argues that situations in which knowledge-based specialists are hired to perform tasks requiring expertise can be viewed as principal-agent exchanges (Mills) and are therefore open to analysis through an agency theory lens. The second endeavour is to discuss the implications of knowledge asymmetry in principal-knowledge worker relationships for managerial control and influence, and posit alternative modes of managerial control based on normative influence and valiant rewards. Further, it develops propositions relating to the factors likely to moderate the utility of each managerial influence strategy. Originality/value: By undertaking this investigation, the paper responds to calls by Frenkel et al. to understand process and dynamics of control in managing knowledge workers. It moves away from models of control based on principles of scientific management on which agency models are typically based, towards models of control based on reciprocity and commitment. It develops testable propositions regarding specific sources of influence in knowledge work and the circumstances under which the employment of these influence strategies is indicated. This responds to calls by authors such as Tampoe; and Lord to develop a detailed understanding of the manner and extent to which influence strategies need to complement specific knowledge worker characteristics.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: This paper seeks to complement agency and stewardship perspectives regarding the governance of top managers by using insights from social categorization theory. Research Findings/Insights: This paper looks inside the black box of the control-performance relationship. We acknowledge that boards can positively influence organizational functioning by monitoring the top management team. However, we also argue that board control contains a hidden cost. The model we develop describes how control can highlight the distinction between principals and agents thereby causing the top management team to adopt a biased and less cooperative "us vs. them" orientation towards owners and their representatives. We contend this results in an increase in negative discretionary behavior and a decrease in positive discretionary behavior, which dampen the positive influence of control on firm performance. We also describe techniques for mitigating this unintended outcome of control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Agency and stewardship theories offer alternative views of human nature and provide divergent prescriptions for governance. This paper presents social categorization theory as a complementary lens emphasizing a situational and social view of human nature that helps explain top managers' discretionary behaviors that influence firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Ongoing governance scandals are costly illustrations of unchecked managerial opportunism. They demonstrate the need for vigilant control. A control approach to governance, however, does not consistently improve firm performance. This paper offers an explanation. It acknowledges that board control is necessary, while arguing that it can have unwanted side effects. We describe two tools (individualization and social recategorization) that can be used to ameliorate these effects. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: During the last decade, there has been an increasing focus on commercialization of knowledge and technology from universities. However, universities report financing as being the main impediment to successful university spin-off companies (USOs) creation, leaving valuable inventions un-commercialized. The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual model in order to explain financing challenges experienced by USOs. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a conceptual model illustrating financing challenges met by USOs, and provides an explanation why TTOs report that obtaining financing is their biggest impediment to spin-off creation. Two different theoretical perspectives back this conceptual development: Knightian uncertainty and agency theory. Findings: This theoretical examination suggests that increasing levels of uncertainty affect the investor's willingness to fund new companies in a negative way. Through the literature review, clear indications were also found for the increased uncertainty with which USOs are faced. It is therefore natural to conclude that investors are more reluctant to invest in USOs because of the level of uncertainty compared with other entrepreneurial companies. Research limitations/implications: This study made a generalization of USOs as a homogeneous group of companies, which is an oversimplification. Further research should address how different business models, types of resources and their institutional link affect USOs' capital requirements and their problems in raising the required capital. Originality/value: The main contribution from this paper is the combination of theoretical insights from the concepts of Knightian uncertainty and agency theory. These combined with insights from previous empirical studies explain why USOs face specific challenges in order to raise risk capital. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Supply chain security presents numerous challenges to governments interested in defending against terrorist threats. While most approaches stress technological solutions, scholars and policy-makers tend to overlook economics, labour market issues, and industrial relations. Applying agency theory from behavioural economics, this article analyses threats to the US supply chain and opportunities for efficient solutions. Using data from a sophisticated web-based survey of owner-operator cost-of-operations, it shows that drayage1 drivers are among the lowest paid truck drivers and workers in the US. We provide evidence that low pay is associated with both safety and security risk. Low-wage labour and subcontracting present challenges to US and foreign supply-chain security because the market attracts workers who have few other employment options. In this environment, principals and agents currently make inefficient and inequitable contracts because markets do not reflect the complete costs associated with low-probability/high-impact events like cargo theft and transport security.

Franchisors monitor their franchisees to ensure that the latters' performance is consistent with the franchise agreement. Though agency theory suggests that monitoring and subsequent corrective action lead to improved performance and reduced opportunism, the psychology literature argues that, in certain circumstances, monitoring can "crowd out" the very behavior it was designed to eliminate (i.e., opportunistic behavior). Our results show that the extent and ease of monitoring reduce the crowding out effects of monitoring, whereas monitoring enforcement heightens these effects. Our findings also show that the exchange norm of relational solidarity fully mediates these effects. (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The non-profit sector of the US economy is a special class of entities with an expansive array of organizations and activities dedicated to the common good and well-being of others. Even though this sector has constructed creative and forward thinking initiatives, obstacles remain which interfere with the accomplishment of significant achievements. In order to stay competitive, non-profit organizations are constantly assessing their current capacity to deliver unique needed services. Today, many umbrella associations of non-profits have implemented accreditation and certification programs intended to improve organizational contribution to member organizations. Throughout the sector, non-profit organizations are now seeking to become more ethical, accountable and credible in the eyes of stakeholders. Guided by institutional and agency theories, the research reported herein is designed to offer preliminary insights regarding the organizational and economic implications of pursuing accreditation. Technological enhancements in this context are also examined. (c) 2011 Eastern Academy of Management All rights reserved.

In the agency theory literature, output and behavioral controls have been quite thoroughly explored. However, input control (IC) that emphasizes personnel selection and staffing has only been discussed theoretically. Literature outside the agency theory, nonetheless, corroborates IC when competitions increase. With an empirical approach to strategic human resource management, this study explored the relationships between controls and work performance under the influences of two agency factors principal-agent relationship and task programmability. Results show that controls are generally associated with work performance but more important are their moderating effects with the two contingent agency factors. Furthermore, hierarchical regression analyses reveal that IC is a vital factor for work performance. These findings suggest that IC deserves more attention under the conditions of increased competition. (c) 2011 Taylor & Francis.

This article considers the 'obvious' relationship between human capital (HC) and agency theory (AT) with two goals in mind. First, to show how principal-agent theory (PAT) - the AT variant most understood by agency theory - clarifies HC as a way of describing individuals in the organizational context. Second, to explore how PAT's own shortcomings illuminate possibilities implicit but underexplored in the HC literature; for while a workplace relationship between PAT and HC seems obvious, it is conceptually complicated. The article begins with a review of the two concepts' history and the research programs from which they emerged. After considering the PAT-HC interaction, it shows how HC might contribute to the theory of the firm. Many see the firm as a socioeconomic context in which HC and agency issues collide under management's direction as other forms of capital enter the mix. (c) Oxford University Press 2011.

Purpose: This paper seeks to add historical perspective to the contemporary debate concerning the efficacy of executive bonuses. That debate has become particularly significant in the USA as a result of the recent economic collapse and the federal government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, turning the government - at least temporarily - into a shareholder of numerous companies. Design/methodology/approach: The article is primarily an intellectual history of an idea: that executive bonuses are required to achieve top performance. The main primary source is two sets of articles from the Harvard Business Review from the 1930s and the 1950s. These are supplemented by other primarily and secondary material. Findings: Arch Patton, a McKinsey Consultant and the most published author in the Harvard Business Review during the 1950s, constructed a defense of executive bonuses based on ideology rather than empirical evidence. Social implications: Constituents of the current debate on executive bonuses should be aware of the degree to which statements of support for efficacy are often presented as universally and exclusively correct which may result in distortion and concealment of real interests. Originality/value: Despite the ubiquity of executive bonuses, no study has looked at the historical roots of the debate. Agency theory, which is presented as a rational and legitimate argument in favor of such bonuses, fails to address the historical context in which bonuses actually took root in corporate America.

Purpose - This research seeks to investigate the role of key corporate governance mechanisms in determining a firm's post-bankruptcy performance following reorganisation. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on agency theory and uses a unique sample of 111 filing companies whose reorganisation plans have been confirmed by the Thai Central Bankruptcy Court during the period 1999-2002. Findings - The results indicate that monitoring and incentive mechanisms are significant determinants of a firm's post-bankruptcy performance. The key monitoring mechanism is ownership concentration, measured by shares held by the largest shareholder, whereas the critical incentive mechanisms are cash compensation and percentage of common shares held by the plan administrator. The results indicate that these mechanisms can mitigate agency problems in previously insolvent companies and increase post-bankruptcy performance over a three year period. Originality/value - The study is timely given that many organisations are facing rebuilding programs following the impact of the global financial crisis. Prior research in Thailand and elsewhere has not measured bankruptcy reorganisation outcomes in terms of the difference of actual financial performance to predicted performance and in relation to the governance factors of the reorganisation process. Neither has this aspect been considered within an agency theory framework. This provides a unique opportunity to consider these variables based on the theoretical framework of agency theory and to evaluate the importance of governance mechanisms in reorganisation proceedings.

Agency theory has been discussed widely in the business and management literature. However, to date there has been no investigation about its utility and implications for problems in training & development. Whereas organizations are still struggling to develop and implement effective training programs, there is little emphasis on the self-interest behaviors of the trainers and how these motivations may impede the training process. Agency theory can help inform our learning and understanding of possible outcomes in this scenario. Consequently, this article is the first to explore agency theory within the training & development framework and offers propositions for research and practice. Implications for organizational policy and performance outcomes are also discussed. (c) SAGE Publications 2011.

The objective of this study is to explain the franchisor's choice between single-unit and multi-unit franchising. We employ a comparative case analysis method to compare the theoretical patterns with the empirical patterns of the governance forms. We selected two multi-national franchise networks based in Austria. Our findings suggest that franchisor's multi-unit franchising strategy can be explained by monitoring costs, franchisee's transaction-specific investments, franchisor's system-specific assets, and franchisor's financial resources scarcity.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the most important economic factors that determine choice of distribution channel when booking a tourism service. The theoretical framework applied to meet this objective is agency theory, as it provides insight into the effects arising from problems such as information asymmetries and opportunism. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis of a sample composed of 805 tourists who made their reservation through either the internet or traditional channels has provided interesting conclusions, allowing different hypotheses to be contrasted using a structural equation analysis. Findings - This study has shown how the main source of uncertainty in the stages leading up to the choice of purchase channel is due to a lack of trust towards the internet. In this regard, the signals emitted by firms in order to mitigate information asymmetries contribute to generating trust towards the selected firm; however, they neither reduce the risk differential existing between channels nor the associated transaction costs. In addition, trust in the chosen firm shows that the buyer makes the reservation through the channel with the least perceived risk. Research limitations/implications - The research has underlined that the greater the differential in transaction costs between the internet and the traditional channels, the greater the propensity of buyers to make their purchases through alternative distribution channels. In addition, clients perceive greater internet transaction costs with respect to the traditional channels, a fact that may be contrasted with the purpose behind its creation. Practical implications - The differences between the information provided by economic agents and the information that is requested by the client reveal a need for greater awareness among those offering the services, in order for them to improve the way in which they target the consumer, especially in relation to the management of information flows. Furthermore, steps should be taken to improve internet security systems and undertake joint actions that are formalised and coordinated by all of the agents involved so that clients perceive internet as a secure channel. Finally, internet-related skills should be developed to allow the consumer to search for information in a more efficient way. Originality/value - The study deals with a recent line of new research. It is also performed in the context of Mediterranean countries, which represents a further important contribution, given that very few empirical studies focus on this geographical region.

Purpose - Firms that pursue invention face special conditions that heighten the potential conflict between managers and shareholders. High R&D spending increases the information asymmetry between managers and shareholders because the invention process is rooted in tacit knowledge. Because tacit knowledge is difficult to communicate to external parties, shareholders will have problems monitoring whether managers are spending R&D in a manner that maximizes firm value. Design/methodology/approach - Using agency theory, it is argued that managerial ownership is one solution to this problem and that high levels of R&D intensity will necessitate high levels of managerial ownership to counteract agency problems. However, it is also argued based on signaling theory that a firm's patenting activity reduces ownership requirement as well as moderating the managerial ownership-R&D relationship. Findings - Using a sample of firms from the knowledge-intensive biotechnology industry, a positive relationship was found between R&D spending and managerial ownership. It was also found that this relationship is most strongly moderated by patenting activity. Research limitations/implications - The findings would be strengthened by replication using samples from other knowledge-intensive industries. Future research should examine how the critical determinants of success in other industries affect managerial ownership of firms in those industries. Practical implications - The study shows that top managers have some control over the contracting environment. By aggressively pursuing patents managers can reduce their level of ownership in the firm. Originality/value - The study finds evidence that in order to prevent agency problems firms undertaking inventive activity may require their managers to take larger ownership or aggressively pursue patents. High managerial ownership levels and patents can provide a signal to shareholders about the growth potential of the firm. (c) 2011, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study examines if the CEO duality influence the firm economic performance in Bangladesh and the moderating effects of board composition in the form of outside independent directors. While doing so, it examines the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance during the pre appointment of outside independent directors and post appointment of outside independent directors (the role of other corporate governance mechanism as moderating variable). The finding is that there is there is a negative (non-significant) relationship between CEO duality and firm performance before appointment of outside independent directors in the board. However, independent leadership structure and firm performance is found to be positively related following the acquisition of resource (outside independent directors in the board) supporting the 'resource dependence theory'. The findings of this study partially support the 'agency theory' and 'resource dependence theory' but do not support the stewardship theory. This study contributes to the literature on CEO duality in the context of less a developed country.

The purpose of this conceptual paper is to provide a brief description and review of the agency theory literature in ultimately proposing that agency theory may provide a novel and potentially useful foundation for analysing (for researchers) and influencing (for managers) the nature of contractual relations between government departments that secure the services of commercial market research firms. The methodological approach involves a non-exhaustive review of literature addressing agency theory and public sector procurement from commercial sources. Although this paper is primarily targeted at academics with an interest in studying the relationships between market research providers and public sector market research users, there are some practical managerial implications that are discussed. Thus far in the extant marketing literature, there has been no suggestion that an agent theoretical perspective can contribute to both the study and management of government/business relationships related to the procurement of market research.

Based on stakeholder theory, agency theory and control mechanisms, the individual competency model has been put into wide practice in Chinese government and enterprises, especially with the separation of the enterprises' right of management from the right of ownership. The related research in this field defines our research direction and choice of management practices, as all kinds of organizations in China are trying to recruit, select, cultivate, utilize and develop talents found to be scarce by human resource evaluation practices. By reviewing the competency models of the position of sales managers, this contribution compares the current application of their evaluation in China and the U.S., setting out the conclusions on the differences between the two countries, and further discusses its application in different fields of human resource management, such as recruitment, training and development, career planning, development and management. The research results help us to establish the difficulties in the current situation and improve the efficacy of human resource evaluation systems in both Chinese government and enterprises.

Drawing on Agency Theory this article investigates the relationship between board size and European firms' performance. The focus is on the implicit differences between financial and non-financial firms. In particular the paper addresses the following questions: does board size influence firm performance? Is financial intermediaries' corporate governance different from that of non-financial companies? The study analyses the governance of the largest listed European companies which make up the Eurotop 100 index. Companies come from 12 different countries and are subject to different regulatory and self-discipline codes. Referring to the Eurotop index the focus is on the relation between the overall size of the board of directors and the level of performance measured as Tobin's Q and Return on Assets. Diverging results emerge depending on the typology of the firm. In particular, results suggest that for non-financial companies large boards negatively influence firm performance, whereas financial intermediaries seem to be different because of the non-relation between their board size and performance.

Purpose: Reward research has focussed on level (what individuals are paid) and structure (relationship between different levels of reward). Less emphasis has been given to reward mix decisions, i.e. the relative proportions of each element making up overall reward. This paper seeks to examine the determinants of reward mix. Design/methodology/approach: Interview based research with reward consultants as key organisational observers and participants in reward mix decision making. Findings: Benchmarking has led to the development of reward mix norms. Organisations are under pressure to conform to these norms, moderated by leadership beliefs, the occurrence of events and the extent to which organisations' change capability can overcome strong institutional forces. Research limitations/implications: The results question agency theory based explanations of reward mix determination and point towards resource dependence and institutional theory perspectives being more suitable theoretical frameworks. Practical implications: The model developed allows reward managers to consider how the moderating variables, to the dominant mimetic pressure faced, could be manipulated for their firm to allow greater differentiation of the reward mix. Originality/value: Academically the work contributes to a programme of research into reward determination from a constructionist perspective and aims to provide greater theoretical robustness to the subject. Practically, the findings may prompt practitioners to think more consciously about the drivers of their firm's reward mix. Policy makers may use the stronger theoretical base for understanding the determinants of reward mix choices and the extent to which organisational free choice and institutionally determined choice influence final choices in reward policy decision making.

Performance assessment in profit and not-for-profit organizations has been on the agenda for scholars and practitioners for the last thirty years or so. Despite this effort we still do not have a comprehensive model of organizational performance for all kinds of organizations. This paper aims to contribute to this field by presenting findings from a constructive and interpretative investigation carried out in public organizations at the local level. The research presented here aims to identify the dimensions of performance that would address stakeholder interests in public organizational performance. Data were collected through semi structured interviews and analyzed using content analysis. The theoretical framework is based on resource dependence, institutional theory, agency theory and social network theory. Evidence from the investigation indicates that stakeholders assess public service performance on criteria of efficiency, effectiveness and equity. This paper provides a practical and theoretical contribution by suggesting ways of assessing performance in public organizations, which can contribute to strategic planning by setting milestones related to stakeholder expectations and by defining the dimensions of stakeholders' assessments of the performance of public service organizations.

Using two theoretical approaches-agency theory and trust theory, this paper analyzes the banking relationship between branch manager and loan officer of a bank branch in India. The analysis is performed across five dimensions-supervisor subordinate relationship, delegation of authority, assumption of risk in lending, goal congruence and mutual dependence. This analysis provides a theoretical foundation for examining bank relationships in India. The role of culture in this relationship is also examined as it is an important contributing factor in business relationships in India. Since Trust theory can explain situations involving multifaceted relationships such as one between branch manager and loan officer using stakeholders' perspective, this study concludes that the trust theory is a better descriptor of the banking relationship between branch manager and loan officer in Indian banks.

The family firm preparing generational change, the partnership that welcomes new partners, and the shareholders of a firm that chooses to go public are making decisions that will have an impact on strategy and management. Conversely, a change in strategy such as a move to diversify or a decision to take on more risk in a business can make the firm more attractive to some shareholders and less attractive to others and is therefore not ownership neutral. Opening the black box of agency theory, Korine and Gomez show how management and ownership interact to shape the strategy of the firm. In their view, the critical question to ask is not what is the best strategy, but rather, who is the strategy for? With numerous detailed examples, Strong Managers, Strong Owners is an invaluable resource for company owners, board members and executives, as well as their advisors in strategy and governance.

The business and public policy arena began a paradigm shift towards more competition and efficiency about 1980. The lure of innovation, creativity and more freedom captured our spirit. Deregulation, privatization, contracting out, franchising, reengineering and reinventing followed. Entrepreneurial management was thriving. Along the way dysfunctions of excessive competition and efficiency became increasingly apparent. In the world of business, public policy and finance, we had to deal with the savings and loan crisis which many argue cost taxpayers $500 B. Then came: Enron, Andersen, Worldcom, Tyco, Global Crossing, Qwest, Adelphia and more. Increasing standards have been applied to control these problems, such as new legislation like Sarbanes-Oxley and McCain Feingold, and legal actions like those of Elliot Spitzer in New York and Attorneys General in other states as well. Our seeming passion to save a few dollars with efficiency management led to overuse of under trained Argenbright and Wackenhut security screeners at airports contributing in part to the terrorism disaster of 9-11. Implementing more effectiveness and collaboration oriented organizations to enhance security and safety was realized with the development of the Transportation Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. FEMA's collapse with Hurricane Katrina is an example of abandoning the effectiveness and collaboration emphases that had made FEMA a strong organization not long before. Overemphasizing efficiency at the time of Katrina became a model for organizational collapse. The authors in the first edition of this book were contacted and given an opportunity to update their material or decline to be included in the second edition. They all reviewed and modified their material as appropriate. Several new authors and their manuscripts were also added. This second edition has changes by the following. Al Hyde and Dorothy Olshfski have a chapter on Service Quality in the Internet Economy. Linda de Leon has added Enron, Andersen and similar cases to her Ethics and Entrepreneurship chapter. Arie Halachmi has substantially increased his chapter on Agency Theory and Transaction Analysis. And Bill Waugh has updated his chapter dealing with perceptions of evil from hurricanes to his chapter dealing with university governance. Van Johnston and Claire-Lauren Shultz have a new chapter on Hurricane Katrina and FEMA. Chapters on Entrepreneurial Budgeting, Information Technology and Reinventing Government by Tom Lynch with his colleagues Peter Cruz and Cynthia Lynch; and on Privatization by Paul Seidenstat; And on Optimizing Productivity through Privatization and Entrepreneurial Management by Johnston remain much as they were, and provide a solid base for the rest of the book. An addition that brings a new dimension to the book is a chapter on The Greening of Industry Through Government Supervised Self Regulation by Dan Mazmanian and Daniel Press. Dan Mazmanian is the current President of NASPAA and the Bedrosian Chair in Governance at the University of Southern California. He is also the former Dean of the School of Policy, Planning and Development at USC. Daniel Press is Professor and Chair of Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz. The Second Edition of ENTREPRENEURIAL MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY also has a new Part IV featuring a new chapter by Wendy Haynes, President of the American society for Public Administration, and her colleague Robert Wright. Haynes and Wright use the new Entrepreneurial Management and Public Policy Integrative Model developed for this edition of the book for an extraordinary analysis of the development of the Department of Homeland Security. In the final chapter, Johnston develops the integrative Entrepreneurial Management and Public Policy Model and applies it to: NASA (the Challenger and Columbia disasters; Terrorism (1993 World Trade Center attack and the 9-11 disaster); business, public policy and finance (the S & L Bailout and the Enron, Andersen et al financial ethics collapse; and FEMA (the Northridge Earthquake and Hurricane Katrina). The Model is then adjusted to demonstrate how moving from extreme efficiency towards more effectiveness, and from extreme competition towards more collaboration can provide more professional and more productive organizational performance in the 21st century.

Family business researchers and practitioners have long been confused about the way of governing family managers in family firms, especially those under the influence of Chinese family culture. Agency theorists assume a self-interested nature of family managers and suggest imposing control mechanisms on them to improve performance. Stewardship theorists, however, believe a self-actualizing nature of family managers and argue against the use of control mechanisms. Based on a sample of 186 family businesses in China, this study investigates their ways of controlling family managers, and the effects of control mechanisms on firms' performance. Our results indicate that family business owners in China adopt a series of control mechanisms on their family managers, and obtain higher performance by doing so. The findings empirically validate the assumptions of agency theory in the context of Chinese family business, thus suggesting the existence of agency relationship between Chinese family business owners and their family managers.

The present work summarizes the theoretical foundations and empirical findings regarding the relation between family involvement and firm performance. From a theory-based perspective we integrate evolutionary psychology and agency theory and describe how conflicting predictions can be made regarding the relation between family involvement and firm performance. Similarly, we describe how the empirical landscape is equally conflicted. Findings from this meta-analysis summarize the observed effects from multiple studies and provide an estimate of the relation across the entire population. Results illustrated that family involvement did not significantly impact firms' financial performance (r= .006). Based on these data, there is no relation between family involvement and a firm's financial performance. Furthermore, we examined multiple conceptual and methodologically-based potential moderating influences-none was statistically significant. Overall, these findings provide the foundation for multiple new areas of inquiry as the domain of family business studies evolves. Moving forward, we advise future research in this area to search for additional moderator effects and explore the defining characteristics, other than performance, that make family businesses distinct from non-family businesses.

We challenge critics of agency theory who suggest that agency theory's value does not extend outside a narrow context dominated by egocentric agents seeking only to maximize wealth at the expense of the principal. Instead, we argue that agency theory's flexibility allows for its application to a variety of non-traditional settings where the key elements of agency theory, such as self-interest, information asymmetry, and the mechanisms used to control agency costs can vary beyond the narrow assumptions implied in traditional agency-based research. We suggest that extending agency theory to diverse settings using a deductive approach can be accomplished by formally recognizing and incorporating the institutional context surrounding principal-agent (P-A) relations into agency-based models. Thus, criticisms that agency theory fails to acknowledge the social context in which P-A relations occur provides not a barrier but an opportunity for extending our understanding of P-A relations to a variety of diverse contexts.

Purpose: The paper aims to explain how agency theory can be used to inform our understanding of the dynamics surrounding supply chain behaviours and relationships. Design/methodology/approach: A structured review of the literature using a three-stage refinement process is used. The articles were sourced through online databases and keyword classifications, such as "agency theory", "principal-agent relationships" and "supply chain management". The search initially identified over 86 articles. After further screening these were reduced to 19 for final assessment and comparison. Findings: Despite agency theory's prevailing descriptive and predictive qualities there is scarcity in its application to the SCM discipline. The authors posit that agency theory provides valuable insights for relationship engineering within supply chains where social, political, legal and behavioural dynamics dominate. Practical implications: It is a critical task for managers to understand and mitigate abnormal behaviours across the supply chain. Agency theory serves this need by providing them with a useful tool to respond to transaction cost dilemmas through contractual and non-contractual remedies. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies that examines the current state of agency theory application in the SCM literature and suggests potential avenues for future research.

Purpose: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, the study aims to link board demographic diversity and independence to corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from various sources for a sample of 475 publicly traded Fortune 500 companies between the years 2007 and 2008. Findings: It is found that board gender diversity is positively related to institutional and technical strength ratings, while board racial diversity is positively related to institutional strength rating only. Both the proportion of outside directors and CEO non-duality were negatively associated with institutional and technical weakness ratings. Research limitations/implications: The sample was predominantly large, publicly traded national and international corporations, which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Management personnel should be cognizant of how board configurations and leadership structure may influence their corporate reputation for social responsibility. Efforts should be made to foster a group dynamic that is conducive to effective board functioning. Originality/value: Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between board characteristics and corporate social performance. This study contributes to the literature by examining such associations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is two-fold: to examine two approaches buying firms can utilize to manage supplier quality; and to investigate the ways in which factors inherent in supply chain relationships affect the use of these approaches in supply chain quality management. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on agency theory, this paper proposes a conceptual framework that relates the underlying factors of a supply chain relationship to the use of quality management approaches. Two types of approaches, outcome-based and behavior-based, are discussed in terms of their focuses, purposes, and methods. Propositions are developed about the effects of these factors on the decisions buying firms make about supply chain quality management. Findings: This study suggests that rather than relying on one generic supply chain quality management approach for all suppliers, firms need to choose different management mechanisms for different suppliers based on the salient attributes of individual suppliers and their relationships with the buyers. Five types of agency-based factors are discussed. These factors - information asymmetry, goal conflict, risk aversion of suppliers, length of relationship, and task characteristics - can be expected to influence how firms design and manage their quality management systems for supply chains. Practical implications: A better understanding of the distinction between outcome-based and behavior-based approaches helps managers evaluate which approach is best suited to managing the quality of their suppliers. The propositions pertaining to the key factors provide managers with some guidelines about the critical conditions they should consider when building their firm's supply chain quality management system. Originality/value: Having an effective quality management system of a supply chain is essential for maintaining a smooth supply of high quality products and services to customers. However, little is known about how a firm should design this supply chain quality management system. The paper addresses this gap by applying agency theory to examine the two essential approaches to managing supplier quality and to explore the critical factors that should be taken into account when considering the appropriate approaches for different suppliers.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: In this paper we discuss three assumptions of agency theory: (1) conflicts of interest between principal and agent, (2) nature of risk, and (3) the proposed internal mechanisms to reduce agency costs. We review criticisms of agency theory's pessimistic assumptions of human behavior and its simplistic view about individual risk preferences to argue how the context may influence both the interest and mechanisms for aligning interest of principals and agents. Research Findings/Insights: We draw on alternative theoretical perspectives from behavioral and organizational sciences to describe circumstances under which honesty, loyalty, and trust in agents' behaviors are possible and also the development of cooperative rather than contentious relationships. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study explores the boundary conditions of traditional agency theory in the hope of extending agency theory outside its current contextual boundaries. In doing so, we provide a more robust and exhaustive view of the economic exchange between principals and agents. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to managers about how intrinsic incentives may provide an alternative mechanism of control over agents' behavior to extrinsic incentives prescribed by traditional agency theory. Indeed, intrinsic incentives of personal satisfaction and identification with organizational objects, combined with implicit social obligations and reciprocity may, under certain circumstances, provide stronger restraints on agent opportunism than the use of traditional extrinsic rewards in the form of incentive alignment.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: To what extent can group faultlines and their potential value-destroying effects be detected on corporate boards? Task-related attributes of the type of directorship, education, board tenure, and financial background of board members are considered as directors' characteristics that give rise to the faultline phenomenon. The impact of task-related faultlines on firm performance as well as the moderating effects of busy boards, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) tenure, executive directors' (EDs) compensation structure, and the average non-executive directors' (NEDs) involvement in board committees are examined. Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel of FTSE 350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find a strong negative effect of task-related faultlines on firm performance. Further exploration of the moderating effects demonstrates that the condition of a busy board and CEO tenure exacerbate the negative effects of faultlines. At the same time, the executive pay contingency is found to have a remedying effect on boardroom cohesiveness, whereas the involvement of NEDs in board committee work is not likely to make the adverse effects of board faultlines less pronounced. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the arguments of social identity theory, this study shows that task-related faultlines on corporate boards have strong negative value-creating implications. The positive moderating impact of the executive compensation structure renders support to agency theory predictions about executive incentive alignment. This work also underlines the usefulness of the concept of faultlines in the corporate governance literature, because unitary boards, where NEDs and EDs share board responsibility, exhibit pre-existing factions, similar to top management teams of family-controlled firms and teams managing international joint-ventures. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This research points to the importance of a careful selection process of directors by nomination committees. It also underlines the role for active leadership on boards, who should be aware of available strategies to ameliorate the negative consequences of board schisms, such as accentuating superordinate board identity and/ or informal meetings.

Plural forms exist when managers use two owners to perform one activity. Franchising is a plural form explained by agency theory, however, the theory is unable to explain two franchisor actions: 1) allowing franchisees to own multiple outlets and 2) co-locating company-owned and franchised outlets. We use research that describes a symbiosis between company-owned and franchised outlets to extend agency theory and explain these actions. Our investigation of ownership patterns among 4,339 outlets of 16 plural form franchisors is consistent with our theory that multi-outlet franchising is cost efficient and that co-location occurs when franchisors fill market gaps left by franchisees.

The paper contributes to research on sustainability in dyadic buyer-supplier relationships of logistics services. It presents deeper knowledge on why and how suppliers choose to behave sustainably. The research analyzes how shippers stimulate their LSPs and how LSPs respond by conducting sustainability activities. Agency theory and the stimulus-organism-response model are applied as the theoretical foundations for an explorative case study analysis of three large and five small and medium-sized European logistics service providers (LSPs) active in road transport services. Significant differences are found between the sustainability efforts of SMEs and large LSPs and a tentative taxonomy of the sustainability response types of LSPs is derived. The taxonomy contributes to theory-guided research in sustainable supply chain management and procurement. Thereby, mismatches of stimuli and responses are identified and related agency problems in dyadic relationships in terms of sustainability are discussed. From a managerial point of view, the findings may serve as a starting point for purchasers of logistics services to develop adequate sustainability selection criteria and incentives.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines the relevance of currently accepted best practice recommendations regarding board structure on the survival likelihood of new economy initial public offering companies. We argue that industry context determines governance outcomes. Research Findings/Insights: We study 125 Australian new economy firms listed between 1994 and 2002. Each firm is tracked until the end of 2007 for monitoring their survival. We find that board independence is associated with an increase in the likelihood of corporate survival. We also find that the benefits of board independence increase at a decreasing rate. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The standard best practice recommendation of board independence stems from the monitoring role of directors and is based on agency theory. The results from our study suggest that the recommendation regarding board independence does not work well for new economy firms. While the agency theory based model implies a monotonic relation between board independence and performance, our research suggests that the relationship is nonlinear. This variation occurs because of increased monitoring costs faced by outsiders due to higher information asymmetry and complexity of new economy firms. Our empirical results suggest that inside directors play a complementary role to outsiders in mitigating firm failure. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research offers insights to policy makers who are interested in setting best practice standards regarding board structure. Our research suggests that firm/industry characteristics play a crucial role in determining the optimal board structure. In firms/industries where outsiders face significantly higher information processing costs, insiders can play a valuable complementary role to outsiders in enhancing the effectiveness of the board. Thus future hard or soft regulations related to board structure should consider industry context. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Purpose: Recently, an increasing number of Internet users have begun to purchase various products, both secondhand and new, from online auction websites. However, some Internet users are still hesitant to purchase products from these websites. Moreover, the factors affecting male and female users' intention to shop on the websites may be different. Past studies have indicated that uncertainty is a major determinant of online shopping behaviors and may have different effects on men's and women's purchase intentions. Therefore, to explore the differences, this study seeks to propose a research model based on uncertainty and agency theory. Design/methodology/approach: This study included members of the Yahoo! and PChome online portal sites in Taiwan as research subjects. A web survey was conducted, and data were collected from a total of 313 bidders of online auctions. The casual model was validated using partial least squares (PLS) techniques. Findings: Gender moderated most of the relationships in the research model. The analysis results showed that the factors influencing men's and women's uncertainty are different. In addition, uncertainty has stronger influence on men's intention to purchase products from online auction websites. Practical implications: This study contributes to a theoretical understanding of the factors that promote men's and women's intention to purchase products from online auction websites. From a practical perspective, insights provided by this study can help online auction service providers understand buyers' concerns and eliminate the sources of the uncertainty. Originality/value: The primary value of this paper lies in providing a better understanding of male and female behaviors on online C2C market, and investigating the gender differences in the factors that influence the consumers' purchase in online auctions.

Although research on corporate entrepreneurship (CE) has attracted increasing attention, risks of CE are not well examined. In this paper, we examine direct and indirect agency risks associated with providing middle and operational managers with autonomy in the hopes of encouraging CE. The key ideas behind our discussion involve two dilemmas of CE. (1) To solve the risk-averseness problem of middle and operational managers and unleash their entrepreneurial ideas, top management needs to encourage autonomous behaviors, which can also exacerbate a different type of agency problem: opportunistic behaviors. (2) Although the generation of new ideas to explore new strategic directions and/or opportunities is important, the very newness of the ideas make them difficult to evaluate, and thus the selection process may be perceived as unfair by some managers. We propose that (a) stock options, (b) passive monitoring, and (c) perceived procedural justice would attenuate the negative side effects associated with CE, such as opportunistic behaviors and perceived unfairness. Although research in CE often stresses autonomy of middle and operational managers for new idea generation as important, examining the whole process in terms of idea generation, selection, and implementation with respect to potential risks will extend the CE literature.

Corporate political activity (CPA) represents a strategy whereby firms attempt to influence government policymaking, to advance their strategic goals; firm owners may benefit from it. However, other research indicates that CPA is uncertain and increases information asymmetries between owners and managers. Hence, this study avoids the assumption that owners and managers have similar views regarding CPA and focuses on the relationship between institutional investors, large investors' ownership and investors' portfolio characteristics on firm CPA. The results reveal that institutional ownership is associated with reduced CPA among S&P 500 firms across five election cycles, but that investors' portfolio concentration is associated with increased CPA. The implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This paper examines venture capital (VC) governance in innovation processes. The VC literature often presents the relationship between a VC firm and a start-up as dyadic and analyzes it with agency theory. In contrast, this paper deploys the resource interaction framework presented in Hakansson and Waluszewski (2002) to governance and innovation in networks. The paper reports an in-depth case study of Pyrosequencing, a Swedish biotech firm financed with VC. The results from this study reveal how the relationship between a VC and a start-up company is embedded in a wider network and how the governance of the VC spreads in the surrounding network and influences a start-up's possibilities to develop organizational and technical resource interfaces to critical counterparts such as suppliers and customers.

We investigated the effect of financial incentives on performance in a professional organization. Whereas agency theory treats tangible rewards such as money as a potentially powerful motivator for improving performance, the professional control perspective posits that the motivational effects of financial incentives will depend on the intended recipients attitudes toward the incentives relative to their professional values. The study setting was a large network of physician practices that adopted a financial incentive program to improve physician performance in the management of diabetic patients. Consistent with agency theory, performance did improve following the introduction of the incentive. However, consistent with the professional control perspective, physicians' psychologically based attitudes toward the incentive program regarding its impact on their own work autonomy and the importance of the performance goals moderated the effect of the incentive on performance. Study findings indicate that agency theory and professional control are complementary theoretical perspectives for understanding how professionals will respond to the imposition of performance-related financial incentives. In terms of practice, pay-for-performance programs aimed at professional organizations should be designed to take into account the values and goals of an organization's professionals to maximize the effect of financial incentives on performance.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to critically rethink the concepts and the theoretical foundations of IT governance in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on multiple case studies. In total, eight cases of outsourced information system projects where failures occurred were selected. An outsourced information system failure (OISF) is suggested as a failure of governance of the IT in a SME environment. A structure for stating propositions derived from two competing theories is proposed (Agency Theory and Theory of Trust). Findings - The results reveal that trust is slightly more important than control issues such as output-based contracts and structured controls in the governance of IT in SMEs. Practical implications - The world of SMEs is significantly different from that of large companies, and therefore, the concept of IT governance in SMEs needs reconsideration. For researchers and practitioners, it would be more meaningful to focus on actual, working SMEs instead of on a version of their activities derived from those of large companies. Originality/value - The paper offers two contributions. First, it elaborates the limited research on IT in SMEs and second, it brings theoretical foundations for their IT governance. The value of IT governance in SMEs is explained. (c) 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Research to date has identified CEO pay structure as an important factor in the environmental and social performance of the organization but has not considered how pay may influence these sustainability efforts at the middle-management level. We address this void with an experimental manipulation of direct and indirect pay incentives for an environmental sustainability project and production cost savings project. Counter to our predictions, investment in sustainability versus cost savings is significantly lower when incentives for both projects are equivalent, and investment is only comparable when incentives for the sustainability project are superior. Further investigation using qualitative data attributes this to differences in the salient social norms that individuals hold and an apparent undervaluing of the indirect incentive derived through sustainability's contribution to cost savings. The results shed light on primary ways in which human resource management practices may be used to embed support for sustainability initiatives throughout the organization.

Family firms without able and willing family successors are frequently sold to non-family managers through management buy-outs (MBOs). Whether MBOs create value is thought to be dependent upon the ability to reduce owner-manager agency costs. In this article we examine the agency costs of MBOs that acquire family firms. We contribute to theory by arguing that in such situations, value creation by reducing agency costs will depend upon pre-MBO agency costs, the ability to solve the double agency problem, and the relationship between the cost of agency control mechanisms and the residual losses from opportunism before and after the MBO.

The comply-or-explain principle is a common feature of corporate governance codes. While prior studies investigated compliance with corporate governance codes as well as the effects of compliance on firm behaviour and performance, explanations for deviations from a corporate governance code remain largely unexamined. This paper intends to fill that gap. The paper draws on the voluntary disclosure literature and agency theory to examine the association between firm characteristics and the informativeness of explanations for deviations from the Dutch corporate governance code. Applying content analysis to corporate governance statements for a sample of Dutch listed firms for the period 2005-2009, the study finds that ownership concentration and number of analysts following the firm are positively associated with informativeness. Furthermore, there is indicative evidence that board strength and informativeness are positively associated. The study also finds a negative association between leverage and informativeness. Institutional investors, however, do not seem to affect this type of disclosure. Taken together, the findings suggest that certain firm characteristics are associated with a firm's choice to provide either generic and uninformative explanations or more firm-specific and informative explanations. On the basis of the study's findings, I argue that firms having weaker boards, firms followed by fewer analysts, firms having more dispersed ownership and firms relying more on debt finance tend to approach comply-or-explain more symbolically than substantively.

The ability of firms to attract qualified job applicants is a critical component of the human resource management process. However, while a large body of research has examined the relationship between firm recruitment practices and applicant pool attributes, very little research has investigated what factors are associated with organizational decision makers' utilization of specific recruitment tactics. We draw on labor economics, sociological, and agency theoretical perspectives to make predictions regarding the use of screening-oriented recruitment messages in actual web-based job advertisements. Results suggest that perceptions of labor supply, recruiting firm reputation, and the use of quality-based compensation incentives are associated with use of screening-oriented messages, which in turn are associated with applicant pool quality. These findings hold important theoretical insights into the factors shaping firm recruitment activity and provide practical strategic implications for managing firm recruitment objectives.

Background: Community hospitals in the United States are almost all governed by a governing board that is legally accountable for the quality of care provided. Increasing pressures for better quality and safety are prompting boards to strengthen their oversight function on quality. Purpose: In this study, we aimed to provide an update to prior research by exploring the role and practices of governing boards in quality oversight through the lens of agency theory and comparing hospital quality performance in relation to the adoption of those practices. Methodology: Data on board practices from a survey conducted by The Governance Institute in 2007 were merged with data on hospital quality drawn from two federal sources that measured processes of care and mortality. The study sample includes 445 public and private not-for-profit hospitals. We used factor analysis to explore the underlying dimensions of board practices. We further compared hospital quality performance by the adoption of each individual board practice. Findings: Consistent with the agency theory, the 13 board practices included in the survey appear to center around enhancing accountability of the board, management, and the medical staff. Reviewing the hospital's quality performance on a regular basis was the most common practice. A number of board practices, not examined in prior research, showed significant association with better performance on process of care and/or risk-adjusted mortality: requiring major new clinical programs to meet quality-related criteria, setting some quality goals at the "theoretical ideal" level, requiring both the board and the medical staff to be as involved as management in setting the agenda for discussion on quality, and requiring the hospital to report its quality/safety performance to the general public. Practice Implications: Hospital governing boards should examine their current practices and consider adopting those that would enhance the accountability of the board itself, management, and the medical staff.

Where does the study of hybrids stand at present? Through a review of existing research, this paper provides a number of contributions to the literature on inter-organizational relations, or hybrids. For one, basing ourselves on the traditional theories used in the study of hybrids, we propose an integrative definition and classification of hybrids. We classify explanations of the formation, functioning and implications of hybrids using agency theory, property rights theory, transaction cost economics and the resource-based view. For another, based on a review of recent qualitative studies on hybrids, we extend our classification to include the more recent theories used in the study of hybrids. These recent studies combine the traditional theories on hybrids with network and evolutionary theories, and literature on strategy and trust. Our review also provides new insights on the dynamics and environment of hybrids, and suggests avenues for future research. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the increasing resources being allocated from marketing budgets to sponsorship, effective evaluation is relatively rare, and sponsorship evaluation methods are often proprietary in nature. This paper reports on a research project designed to develop a process model for evaluating sponsorships. An initial version was conceived from agency theory, the evaluation literature, and sponsorship writings. This draft was then assessed by sponsorship experts during a series of 14 in-depth interviews. Based on these analyses, a final version of the process model was proposed. The revised version was then adopted to evaluate-as a demonstrative example-a specific sponsorship. Results of this case and recommendations for future research and practice in sponsorship evaluation are presented. Copyright (c) 2011 ASAC.

The transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into efficient entities has been an important approach in transition economies. However, the transition literature reveals little about how control structure affects firm performance of transformed SOEs. Drawing on agency theory, we distinguish three modes of control in transformed SOEs: state-controlled, dispersedly controlled, and privately controlled modes and argue that actual control after transformation plays a critical role in determining performance. Examining the impact of different control modes in China, we find that the key is who controls the transformed firm. Non-state-controlled (dispersedly controlled and privately controlled) firms are more likely to have enhanced post-transformation performance and reduced agency costs than state-controlled firms.

The aim of this paper is to identify why independent hotels decide to affiliate and give up their highly valued independence. Based on interviews with 12 independently owned hotels and five affiliations active on the Swedish market, it became evident that independence is important, but factors such as development with technical solutions, internet, the use of smart phones, social media, sales and marketing, central purchasing and loyalty cards are difficult to pursue as an independent hotel. The results also showed that marketing organisations and referral chains are the preferred options, as their offerings are more in line with the view of strategic entrepreneurship that the hoteliers expressed. Even agency-related aspects such as control rights affected the entrepreneurs' aspiration to affiliate, at the same time as the respondents thought their way of running the business was the most efficient. The results from the research add to the knowledge associated with agency theory, strategic entrepreneurship and resource-based view of the firm. More practically, it gives the independent hoteliers a possibility to assess the current situation and decide what options could be valuable, while the affiliations would be able to better align their offerings to attract new hotels.

This study researches the influences of CEO compensation on firm behavior to examine the interactive relationship between the behavioral momentum of innovation in R&D and CEO compensation. The models presented in this study are based on evolutionary, institutional, and agency theories to test hypotheses using data from 107 companies in the high-technology sectors in the United States. The results indicate that the pre-succession innovative behavior of these high-technology firms on R&D can positively affect these firms' post-succession innovative behavior towards R&D. That is, positive momentum in R&D innovation prevails in a firm across a change of the CEO. However, for the role of CEO compensation, short- and long-term compensation does not positively moderate this behavioral momentum in R&D. Hence, the moderating impact of short- and long-term CEO compensation to enhance the momentum of innovation in R&D can be romanticized. These findings provide boards of directors with evidence as to how a CEO succession matters to a firm's behavioral momentum in R&D, and whether CEO compensation can be strategized to change a firm's innovation and momentous behavior.

This paper investigates the impact of corporate board diversity on the financial performance of Nigerian quoted firms using a panel data of 122 quoted Nigerian firms. The aspects of board diversity studied comprise board nationality, board gender and board ethnicity. The Fixed Effect Generalised Least Square Regression is used to examine the impact of board diversity on firm performance for the period: 1991-2008. The results show that gender diversity was negatively linked with firm performance, while board nationality and board ethnicity were positive in predicting firm performance. The study provides insights for practitioners and policy makers on the need to view the board as a strategic resource in line with the resource dependency theory instead of viewing the board solely from agency theory perspective.

Purpose: There is no previous systematic and theoretical investigation of the interim CEO succession practice. This research attempts to fill the gap by studying this phenomenon and hence advance executive succession research/practice. Design/methodology/approach: Based on agency theory, the authors propose a model and several propositions to predict what determines the origin of interim CEOs, the length of the interim tenure, and the career prospects for the interim CEO after the interim tenure. Findings: Both firm performance and environmental uncertainty play an important role in the dynamic interim CEO succession process. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides the foundations for future empirical research on interim CEO succession. Practical implications: Board members at companies experiencing sudden CEO departures should choose a loyal non-aggressive veteran to be the interim CEO so as to minimize disruption and to smooth the transition. They should use caution when choosing an internal candidate because if such a candidate is not chosen to be the permanent CEO later, a talent may be lost. Originality/value: The research is the first to systematically examine the phenomenon of interim CEOs. The authors make a unique contribution to the literature on CEO succession.

This article analyses the appointments of outside directors to family firm boards within a sample of 423 observations (year/firm) regarding Italian publicly listed companies. The aim is to test predictions which suggest that efficient performance of control and service tasks by outside directors has positive effects on a company's capacity to raise capital and to grow. Unlike agency theory, which affirms that independents are efficient when performing functions of control, this article suggests that the adoption of outside directors who are also independent has no effect. The results of this research demonstrate that outside directors who have close ties with banks maintain valuable social capital with bankers in periods when such social capital is threatened by large investment policies requiring a great amount of bank financing.

Boards have become increasingly independent, to the point where some firms have removed all of the insiders except for the CEO. The authors call this phenomenon a "lone-insider board" and submit that it constitutes a fundamentally distinct governance arrangement worthy of inquiry. This paper describes institutional pressures that give rise to increasing reliance on loneinsider boards, and investigates likely outcomes. According to agency theory, the greater the proportion of independent directors, the more effective boards are in monitoring CEOs. The authors submit, however, that a lone-insider board creates a fundamental shift in board effectiveness due to a loss of mutual monitoring and an increase in information asymmetry. Mutual monitoring occurs when members of the top management team actively monitor the CEO. Information asymmetry refers to the disparity in knowledge between the CEO and the board of directors. The authors propose that reduced mutual monitoring causes increased information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and increases rather than decreases CEO power. The authors hope this article will stimulate fruitful inquiry in the area of lone-insider boards.

Upon completion of overseas acquisitions, Western firms typically hire Chinese locals or expatriates to run their Chinese operations. This action is an important consideration because a Western executive's managerial style may impact Chinese employee behavior differently than a Chinese executive's managerial style. Utilizing an experiment with Chinese managers as participants, we examine the effect of the agency problem (when both an incentive and opportunity to act in line with one's self-interest are present) on Chinese managers' discretionary accrual decisions, as well as the role that their executives' culturally based management style (Eastern versus Western) plays in affecting their propensity to manage earnings. We find that Chinese managers tend to override corporate concerns and recommend higher discretionary expense accruals in an effort to maximize their two-year bonus potential when the agency problem is present. Conversely, they tend to recommend lower discretionary expense accrual figures to help achieve corporate goals when the agency problem is not present. Interestingly, we also find that an executive's culturally based management style moderates the impact of the agency problem in that Chinese managers' willingness to manage earnings across agency problem conditions is significantly more pronounced in the presence of a Western (U.S.) executive than in the presence of an Eastern (Chinese) executive.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to ascertain and explain the prevalence of financial and non-financial rewards in Swedish real estate firms. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws upon insights provided by agency theory, social exchange theory and resource dependence theory to explain the results of a questionnaire survey of reward practices of Swedish real estate firms. Findings: Differences in the types of financial rewards are exacerbated by differences in the benefits used at various levels of the firm. The adverse impact of that is limited by government provided social welfare protections. Learning and development programs, coupled with flexible work hours are social exchanges that could drive reciprocal discretionary effort by employees. Originality/value: This paper provides the first comprehensive description of reward management in the Swedish real estate sector. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Agency theory is used to explain many firm marketing activities. However, its assumptions are founded in characteristics of North American actors, particularly in the United States. As such, it is not surprising that work employing agency theory in other national contexts often fails to find support. Taking a comparative institutional approach, this article theorizes how the human assumptions and prescriptions of agency theory differ across countries by utilizing the three pillars (i.e., regulative, normative, and cognitive) set forth by institutional theory. In particular, attenuations of the human assumptions of self-interest, risk-aversion, and bounded rationality of agents are theorized to influence goal alignment, risk sharing, and information processing in the agency relationship and in turn, effect prescriptions of governance and contracting given by the traditional agency model. A series of research propositions are developed to provide insight into the contractual implications in the principal-agent relationship across different institutional contexts. The theoretical attenuations presented provide guidance for marketing academics and practitioners engaged in cross-national agency relationships. (c) 2012, Academy of Marketing Science.

Virtual community was designed to organise different communities and getting people involved in creating and sharing knowledge. It was also called e-information exchange system. Bock et al. argued that the research perspectives of knowledge sharing should be classified into economics, social psychology and sociology perspectives. We present a conceptual framework based on economic, social psychology and social ecology perspective and propose a set of propositions for knowledge sharing in virtual community. Finally, we introduce punctuated equilibrium as third theoretical perspective to understand whether the factors affecting knowledge sharing may change with time.

This present work is an exploratory analysis of network governance models that are characterised by widespread distribution of decision-making and control, auditing and supervisory functions in company structure, frequently through stakeholder engagement in the management system. In the study, we verify the way in which NG can involve stakeholder representatives in the governance bodies and in the decision-making process, also preventing opportunistic behaviour of management, according to the stakeholder-agency theory. A case study of network governance is presented regarding the Spanish cooperative Eroski - a self-governing organisation, with direct participation by representatives of the various stakeholder categories in the main governing bodies. In the conclusions, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the network governance system and its implications for theory and practice and we describe an incremental approach, on an entirely voluntary basis, for implementing this governance model in other corporations, including non-cooperative ones.

Research comparing family businesses and public companies has generally ignored the economic influence. We examine how public and family businesses fare in different economies. We argue that governance mechanisms may work for large public companies, but may not be suitable for family businesses. We find that during economic slowing down, family businesses tend to perform better than public companies because they have better control of their businesses and hence can make quick and decisive decisions. Another finding is that during economic upturn, duality is negatively related to company performance, however, that negative impact can be offset by family business status.

This article contrasts three views or paradigms of the business enterprise and of critical management issues regarding governance. The first two are the agency and contracting paradigms. These dominate most discussion of the governance of corporate activities. The third is the capabilities perspective, which is starting to gain attention in the literature. Agency theory highlights how incentives should be crafted and governance activities focused to bring about better performance for shareholders when ownership and control are separated. Transaction cost economics highlights, as does agency theory, the importance of opportunism. But it adds asset specificity considerations that are also relevant to organizational design choices, including governance mechanisms. The capabilities perspective focuses less on managing opportunism and more on harnessing and managing opportunity. In that sense, it is closer to the essence of capitalism.

Agencification is a widely seen process which has important budgetary consequences. Competence delegation to agencies is associated with an opportunistic behaviour which must be kept under control using different solutions identified by practitioners. Any of these solutions require a particular budgetary treatment because different tools are used: incentives, penalties, monitoring etc. in our paper we propose to investigate the way agency problems are reflected in budgets (both, principals' and agents' budgets).

The purpose of this article is to review and systematize prior work on technological innovation in family firms and to open up an agenda to guide future research into this promising area. The study shows that family involvement has direct effects on innovation inputs (e.g., R&D expenditures), activities (e.g., leadership in new product development projects), and outputs (e.g., number of new products), as well as moderating effects on the relationships between these steps of technological innovation. The article uses theories applied in family business research (e.g., agency theory) to discuss opportunities for extending technological innovation frameworks by considering family involvement.

We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory and propose that cross-national comparison of corporate governance should consider how the nature and extent of agency relationships differ across different institutional contexts. Building on prior governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory we argue that performance outcomes of boards of directors, ownership concentration, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Institutions may also affect the extent of complimentarity/substitution among different firm-level governance practices producing patterned variations in firm-level governance mechanisms. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational outcomes of various governance practices.

Despite increased attention given to family firms in the theory of organization and management, the value of family governance in emerging markets is not clearly understood. We draw insights from agency and institutional economics perspectives to address the debate on whether family governance fills or abuses the void left by weaker market and legal institutions. We propose a dual focus on the pattern of family control and weak institutions to reconcile these opposed assessments. We analyze how various combinations of family control over ownership, strategy, and operations yield different benefits and costs for the operational performance of firms in the absence of strong market and legal institutions. The uneven development of market institutions across industries and the impact of independent directors reinforce the importance of separating different patterns of family control. We find support for our hypotheses when tested on a data set consisting of all publicly listed firms in Taiwan between 1996 and 2005. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of family businesses in emerging markets, highlights the importance of weak institutions in shaping relative agency costs, and illuminates the differential effects of independent directors.

This article aims to increase our understanding of family firms' entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior by looking at the differences between family and nonfamily firms and by studying variations among family firms. We find empirical support for a positive influence of a nonfamily CEO on the family firm's level of entrepreneurial risk taking during the initial years of his or her CEO tenure and a leveling out of entrepreneurial risk taking as the CEO tenure of the nonfamily CEO is extended. We build on the concept of psychological ownership to explain these new findings. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Several unique characteristics of ventures distinguish them from public firms and lead to distinctive monitoring issues. In this article I develop a theoretical framework that links the attributes of the venture and the board composition with venture board monitoring and its implications for firm performance. Contributing to the strategy literature on corporate governance, the framework offers counterintuitive deviations from how agency theory is typically conceptualized, highlights that an unexpected "principal problem" could emerge as the separation of ownership and control is reduced, and presents novel insights about the interdependence between agency theory and resource dependence theory. This framework also adds to the research on entrepreneurial firms by complementing the extant emphasis in the literature on resource provisioning and by offering a richer view of key actors through opening the black box of strategic action in ventures. More broadly, by focusing on an underexamined but important context beyond public firms, this article highlights rich opportunities for developing a contingency theory of corporate governance.

Principals who delegate tasks to agents face the perennial challenge of overcoming agency problems. We investigate whether feelings of ownership among senior managers in the absence of formal ownership can align agents' interests with those of principals, thus turning agents into psychological principals. Using a moderated mediation model, we find that psychological ownership is positively related to company performance through the mediating effect of individual-level entrepreneurial behaviour. We also find that the effect of psychological ownership on individual-level entrepreneurial behaviour and, ultimately, company performance is weaker for high levels of monitoring compared to low levels. These findings offer important contributions to agency, psychological ownership, and entrepreneurship literatures.

This study addresses a major gap in our knowledge about the allocation of information technology (IT) decision rights between business and IT units at the application level, including the governance of applications delivered on-premise versus those delivered with a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model. Building on the findings from a multicase qualitative study of organizations that had adopted the same SaaS application, we draw on three theoretical lenses (agency theory, transaction cost economics, and knowledge-based view) to develop a theoretically grounded model with three organization-level factors, three application-level factors, and application-level IT governance. Hypotheses derived from the model, as well as a set of differential hypotheses about factor influences due to on-premise versus SaaS delivery, are tested with survey responses from 207 firms in which application-level governance is operationalized with two dimensions: decision control rights (decision authority) and decision management rights (task responsibility). Three antecedents (origin of the application initiative, scope of application use, business knowledge of the IT unit) were significantly associated with application governance postimplementation, and the on-premise/SaaS subgroup analyses provide preliminary evidence for the mode of application delivery as a moderator of these relationships. Overall, this study contributes to a growing body of research that takes a more modular approach to studying IT governance and provides theoretical explanations for differing application-level governance designs.

Drawing on a framework from agency theory, we examine the relation between the decision-making power of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and the financial performance of 468 United Kingdom (UK) publicly listed companies (plcs) using a dynamic panel data estimation method for the six years 2003-2008. We measure CEO power using a 'power index' which captures the extent to which the autonomy of the CEO to make unilateral decisions could influence firms' financial performance. To test for robustness, our analysis is conducted using different measures of financial performance. Our results reveal that, consistent with previous UK research, CEO power, as defined by CEO-Chair duality, CEO-tenure and CEO share ownership, is negatively related to financial performance. We also find that concentrated ownership is inversely related to the performance of UK plcs. CEO's compensation and board structure, however, do not appear to be related to the financial performance of the UK plcs. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Corporate investors can provide valuable resources to their new venture investees, but their interests may conflict with those of independent venture capitalist (IVC) coinvestors. We explore how the preferences, resources, and influence of corporate investors vis-a-vis their IVC coinvestors affect their selection of investment opportunities and subsequent nurturing of new venture investees. We show that corporate investors tend to fund new ventures with greater pre-funding innovative capabilities and new ventures receiving corporate funding exhibit greater post-funding rates of innovation compared to those funded solely by IVCs, particularly when their corporate investors are highly reputable relative to their IVC coinvestors.

Quality-related incidents involving contract manufacturers (CMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent. The quality management (QM) literature, however, has focused mostly on QM within a single firm. Thus, the need for data-driven research on managing quality with outsourced production is evident. We investigate the use and effectiveness of external failure penalties and audits of CMs' facilities to manage inter-firm quality. Building on agency theory and extant QM literature, this study addresses two research questions: (i) whether the control mechanisms of quality audits and contractual external quality failure penalties are substitutes or complements in use and (ii) whether they are substitutes or complements in their effectiveness at aligning the quality interests of customers and their CMs. Our analysis uses dyadic data gathered from brand-owning firms and their CMs representing 95 contract manufacturing relationships in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated industries. The results indicate that more severe external failure penalties correspond to a lower use of facility audits (i.e., they are substitutes-in-use). We also find that both external failure penalties and facility audits have a unique positive effect on the CM's perception of relative quality importance. Finally, some evidence supports the hypothesis that each mechanism is more effective in the presence of the other (i.e., they are complements-in-effectiveness).

Purpose: Companies implement corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices along their supply chains to fulfil stakeholder requirements. In doing so, failures in which CSR aspects are violated also emerge, caused by single supply chain members. In these situations, quite often the other supply chain members also appear responsible although they mostly do not have complete control over suppliers and sub-suppliers due to information gaps. Therefore, the malpractice of one single company can harm the reputation of related companies. This paper aims to analyse recent CSR failures along food supply chains with the aim of evaluating why these occurred and what possibilities exist to avoid similar failures in the future. Design/methodology/approach: Agency theory analyses information asymmetries in relationships in which one party delegates work to another party. In the considered failures, the downstream company can be regarded as principal by ordering products from the suppliers (agents). Consequently, agency theory contributes towards understanding failures in CSR implementation and highlighting solutions. Findings: The cases analysed illustrate that CSR failures can have negative impacts on the companies' reputation and therefore also financial effects. Implementing a successful CSR policy should therefore be a primary interest of companies. Agency theory proved suitable to illustrate supply chain relationships and point out implications for companies. The instruments of agency theory can help to avoid CSR failures in food supply chains. Originality/value: The paper combines agency theory with failures in CSR along food supply chains. In doing so, new insights into supply chain relationships are gained and implications for supply chain members to avoid CSR failures can be deduced. One special characteristic of the analysed failures is that the principal is not aimed at increasing the quantity of the agent's output but the quality. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

A significant amount of research has examined firms' decisions to adopt poison pills; however, firms today are increasingly repealing or allowing poison pills to expire. Based on agency theory, the authors examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than substitutes. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

This study examines if Chief Executive Officer (CEO) duality reduces the firms' agency cost in Bangladesh. The agency costs are measured as two efficiency ratios: 'expense ratio' and 'asset utilization ratio'. The finding is that, there is no significant relationship between CEO duality and agency costs. These findings imply that, duality may have given the CEOs enormous powers; it may have reduced the check and balance or board's ability to exercise the governance (monitoring) function, which is not helpful to enhance firm efficiency. This study contributes to the global debate on CEO duality and provides a new avenue of knowledge on CEO duality and firm efficiency in the context of an emerging economy.

Can internal corporate governance mechanisms (such as boards of directors) and external corporate governance mechanisms (such as institutional reform) promote risk-taking behavior in family firms? This paper argues that conflicts between majority and minority owners, known as principal-principal conflicts, and cronyism in the board of directors affect firm risk taking. Moreover, institutional corporate governance reform to appoint outside directors may not have an immediate effect on reducing these problems. Based on a sample of family firms in Taiwan, we find that outside directors reduce the negative relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking. However, when their influence is examined further, it is found that in those sample firms that went public after institutional reform, outside directors did not improve the relationship between family ownership/involvement and risk taking.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Question/Issue: Given its position as a dominant logic in corporate governance, this paper evaluates the theoretical and practical implications of agency theory on good governance. Agency theory is presented as consisting of two layers, one resting on the assumption of oppositional shareholder-manager interests and the other resting on the assumption of supportive shareholder-society interests. Given the dominance of the simple economic depiction of agency theory, its first layer is heavily researched and supported, while the second layer is largely unsubstantiated and often exploited to obscure inefficiencies in the first layer. Research Findings/Insights: Agency theory is shown to fill a highly institutionalized position in governance, despite often violating the second layer's assumption of aligned shareholder-society interests. We assert that the relationship between societal benefits and value maximization must be reconceptualized from interdependent to correlated but independent. Otherwise, when the second layer of agency theory is undercut, shareholders can eschew their role as societal guardians to partner with managers and engage in mutual managerialism at the expense of society. We detail how inefficiencies in first layer mechanisms (market regulation, monitoring, and contracts) impact agency theory's second layer and present the new mechanisms of oversight boards and expanded founding firm documents to reintegrate a societal orientation. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Aligned shareholder-society interests are shown to be frequently undermined, artificially substantiating the second layer assumption that societal betterment can be sufficiently promoted via financial rewards and sanctions. We discuss agency theory's underlying logic and present the possibility that a violated second layer can be exploited to obscure first layer inefficiencies. Ineffectiveness in the first layer's key mechanisms is shown to potentially undercut agency theory's promotion of good corporate governance on an organizational and societal level. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Oversight boards and expanded founding firm documents are presented to make agency theory's second layer explicit, ensuring the assumed supportive nature of the shareholder-society relationship is substantiated. Specifically, oversight boards formalize how members of boards of directors are vetted, oversee societal claims to ensure that appropriate ones are sufficiently presented and addressed, supervise reporting, and sanction firms who fail to enact these duties. Revised founding documents ensure that both economic and social goals are enshrined in the mission of incorporated firms. Together the two help establish the foundation of a measurable approach to socially responsible actions. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Incentive clauses within contracts, referred to as incentive contracts in this paper, based on a sharing of the project outcome are regarded as an important vehicle to align contractor interests with that of the owner. However, discussion is ongoing as to what is the optimal incentive arrangement. This paper derives an optimal incentive contract for a risk-neutral contractor; the owner may be either risk averse or risk neutral. An incentive is established based on a sharing of a project's equivalent monetary outcome (expressed relative to a benchmark or target that is desired by the owner), while aligning the contractor's interests with those of the owner. The derivation is based on solving an optimization problem. The paper shows that at the optimum and expressed relative to the target, any favorable or adverse outcome associated with both the contractor's effort and events beyond the contractor's influence should, respectively, be wholly received by or wholly borne by a risk-neutral contractor. Practitioners were interviewed to validate this result. This paper gives an original solution to the optimal sharing problem in incentive construction contracts, contributing to current practices in contracts management. The solution follows an ordered argument and is usable by practitioners. Additionally, this paper extends agency theory on risk-averse principals. This paper will be of interest to academics and practitioners concerned with the design of incentive contracts. (c) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Human resource shared service centers (HR SSCs) are foreseen as improving HR service delivery for their end-users: employees, line managers and decentralized HR professionals. Although the concept expects the benefits of HR SSCs to come from centralizing knowledge and decentralizing the control exercised over an HR SSC, research into these two fundamental shared service characteristics is scarce. The purpose of this research is therefore to explore whether resource bundling, combined with business unit control over an HR SSC, is sufficient to improve HR service delivery to its end-users. Using concepts from intellectual capital and agency theory, we find that the combination of these two characteristics of shared services is not sufficient to improve HR service delivery. Rather, we suggest that (1) HR SSCs have to update the knowledge and skills of their staff; (2) end-users have to effectively maintain the codified knowledge centralized in the HR SSC; and (3) business units and the HR SSC need to collaborate in order for the benefits of an HR shared service to be realized.

This work reports on an investigation of the dynamics of governance over breakthrough innovation within Fortune 1000 firms. The primary research question investigates the boundary of agency theory within the firm. Using agency and stakeholder theoretic perspectives, the study tests the hypothesis that innovation will thrive in firms that combine a board of directors operating in accordance with a high agency theoretic focus in addition to an innovation governance board operating deeper within the firm that employs a strong stakeholder theoretic orientation in its behavior. The model is tested with data from 98 large firms. Results suggest that the relationship between board of directors' behavior and the firm's overall innovativeness is mediated by innovation decision-making boards that (1) promote projects that are breakthrough in scope, (2) incorporate input of diverse constituencies within the firm, (3) exhibit patience with financial results, and (4) engage in frequent, informal interactions with project teams. Firms exhibiting high board of director agency orientation in combination with loyalty to mandate, patient financial capital disposition, inclusiveness, and project team interaction as described above for innovation governance board decision-making prove to be the most innovative as measured by external indicators. For firm innovativeness, consolidated managerial power and behavior is frequently present at the upper levels of the firm, but must be broken down at deeper levels of the firm. This research offers implications to innovation decision-makers as to how to proceed if the intent is to offer commercializably successful breakthrough innovations.

This study integrates the research on corporate political strategy and corporate governance. Using the agency theory perspective, this study examines how corporate governance mechanisms such as institutional ownership, insider ownership, and long-term executive compensation affect a firm's political strategy approach. This study proposes that an agency problem may occur between owners and managers in regard to firms' approach to corporate political strategy. Since a relational approach to corporate political strategy, such as establishing a government relations office in Washington, DC, requires significant resource commitments without guaranteeing a favorable policy change, shareholders might be reluctant to approve such an approach. In a sample of 3,417 U.S. manufacturing firms, over 5 years of data, the results show that institutional ownership and insider ownership are negatively associated with firms' propensity to engage in a relational approach to political strategy.

Practice-oriented publications have recently suggested a movement in the Chief Financial Officer's (CFO) role towards a more strategic role. In a family business, the CFO position is often the first into which a non-family manager is hired. However, the role of the non-family CFO in a family business is underresearched. Hence, this article uses previous findings as well as social role theory, agency theory, stewardship theory, and the resource-based view to investigate the role of the non-family CFO in family businesses compared to that in non-family businesses. Nine propositions are developed, which suggest not only a more traditional role for CFOs in family businesses, but also fewer monitoring efforts for the CFO in this setting. The article concludes with avenues for further research and concrete future research questions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to concentrate on the prevailing agency theory along with its complementary theory of stewardship as foundations for the authors' research. Recent economic turmoil within the USA has resulted in stakeholders demanding change within governance policies of corporations. One such adjustment has been the separation of the CEO and Chairman positions within organizations. The authors' study seeks to uncover the extent to which duality CEO relationships exist in large corporations within the USA. In light of the push towards splitting the dual roles, the authors further investigated new CEOs recently appointed into the CEO position. Companies selected for this study were the top 500 revenue-producing companies in the USA as published by Fortune magazine in 2008. For comparison purposes, the authors' database included newly appointed CEOs coming on board with the original 2008 companies that had remained on the listing for both years as published by Fortune in 2010. The authors' 2008 database included 500 companies and their 2010 database included 86 companies. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) was the product classification used in order to establish the principal industry sector for companies under analysis. The authors' 2008 analysis reveals that 303 CEOs hold a combination title of CEO and Chairman. The most frequent title combination is CEO and Chairman, with 156 executives holding this combined title. The authors' 2010 analysis reveals that 33 new CEOs hold a combination title of CEO and Chairman. The most frequent title combination is CEO and President with 43 executives holding the title. The authors' analysis of retired CEOs reveals that 15 retired CEOs continue serving in the capacity of Chairman of the Board of Directors. Using the top 500 companies in the USA, based upon sales revenue, did limit the study to large corporations within the USA. The agency theory does provide an explanation of the duality movement witnessed in corporations. The practice of splitting duality roles of CEO and Chairman within public corporations appears to be becoming a reality within the USA, whether on a voluntary or a mandatory basis in order to enhance corporate independence and transparency.

Extant research examining the capital structure-performance relationship has been undertaken primarily in developed economies. These studies integrate agency theory considerations with the contingency perspective and suggest a positive interaction between sector dynamism, equity, and performance. Our study extends this research stream by examining the capital structure-performance link in a sub-Saharan economy, an underresearched but economically emerging region. Using logic undergirding a substantial stream of institutional theory-based studies that we term the institutional difference hypothesis, we argue that the implications of the capital structure-performance relationship are contingent on the extent of national-level institutional underdevelopment. Taking into account institutional differences between developed economies and those in the sub-Saharan region, we hypothesize a negative interaction between sector dynamism, equity, and firm performance in sub-Sahara. Using longitudinal data from Ghanaian corporations for 1996-1999, we find substantial support for our hypothesis. Contrary to findings from developed economies, sector dynamism negatively moderates the firm equity- performance relationship: a strongly positive effect of equity on performance in stable sectors becomes slightly negative in highly dynamic ones. We unpack the implications of these results for theory and research. (c) 2013 INFORMS.

Alliances are popularly used in delivering infrastructure. However, discussion is ongoing as to what is the optimal gainshare/painshare arrangement. This paper derives a result for the optimal gainshare/painshare between risk-averse parties, where the level of aversion may range from very large to being risk neutral. The derivation is based on solving an optimization problem using concepts from agency theory. The influence of the parties' level of risk aversion and outcome uncertainty is examined. Practitioners were engaged in a designed exercise in order to validate the approach and propositions. The paper shows that: (i) the optimal gainshare/painshare arrangement in alliances is linear in the project outcome; (ii) the optimal gain/pain share to the contractor should decrease with increasing contractor level of risk aversion and/or decreasing owner level of risk aversion; and (iii) the outcome uncertainty has no influence on the optimal gainshare/painshare. The paper provides those who write alliance contracts with recommendations on gainshare/painshare. This study casts new light on establishing optimal alliance arrangements in the construction industry. (c) 2013 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Although outsourcing of organisational functions has become a popular practice amongst organisations, the literature provides a myopic and simplistic view of the phenomenon by focusing on either single functions or taking monadic views of a single party. The design of our study overcomes these weaknesses by including the following features: a range of organisational functions were included; the unit of analysis was the outsourcing contract; the level of analysis was at the dyadic level where both service providers and receivers presented their views and the approach was a qualitative one. In practice, this involved interviews with managers in service receiving and providing organisations that were in charge of 10 separate outsourcing arrangements. Using agency theory as a theoretical anchor, we contribute to the outsourcing debate by highlighting its complexity and areas of convergence and divergence between service receivers and providers, thereby suggesting a contingent approach towards implementation of outsourcing arrangements.

Formal controls are an essential part of organizational design, and are theorized to positively influence organizational performance. Mello and Hunt ([2009] Transportation Journal, 48:20-39) were the first to suggest using formal controls to influence truck drivers' behavior. Extending the salesperson control literature, they documented an underresearched method of formal control that we term technology control, whereby firms use on-board and communications technology to influence drivers. We build on their work by investigating the contingent effects of formal controls that influence the behavior of truck drivers and thereby influence the operational performance of firms in the U.S. motor carrier industry. Our work integrates the monitoring aspect of agency theory with the theory of operant conditioning and the theory of psychological reactance to develop a rationale for hypothesized contingent effects of formal controls on motor carriers' operational performance. We collected primary data pertaining to the controls used to influence truck drivers' behavior from a large sample of U.S. motor carrier firms. The results of our analyses using nonlinear structural equation modeling suggest a complex set of relationships between formal controls and operational performance. Our results shed light on scenarios where using technology to monitor driver behavior can result in positive and/or negative organizational outcomes.

This paper examines the impact of corporate governance and ownership structure on voluntary disclosure practices of Malaysian listed firms. The extent of voluntary disclosure is determined for a matched-sample of 100 listed firms in three different disclosure regimes during 1996, 2001 and 2006. The findings suggest that regulatory reforms over the 1996 to 2006 period resulted in enhanced corporate transparency and accountability as reflected in more extensive voluntary disclosures. We provide empirical evidence that the extent of voluntary disclosures is significantly associated with the strength of corporate governance structure in 2001 and 2006 and with ownership structure in 1996, 2001 and 1996. The findings of this study are of use to regulators in terms of guiding policy development regarding corporate transparency of publicly listed firms. Copyright (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Most principal-agent literature of nonprofit organizations has focused on the relationship between board members and managers. However, in addition to the role as an agent of the board, the manager also performs a role as principal with respect to the nonprofit employees. By using a discrete choice experiment, we identify the objectives of managers and employees in nonprofit organizations and assess the presence of agency problems in this relationship. Our sample consists of 76 headmasters, 161 teachers, and 39 administrative employees in 74 secondary nonprofit schools in Belgium. We find that the six objectives set out in the experiment play an important role for both headmasters and subordinate staff. However, the results also indicate that some of these objectives are significantly more important for the headmasters. In sum, our results suggest that agency theory and stewardship theory are not necessarily in conflict with each other but can be combined into a more general governance framework for nonprofit organizations. Consequently, we argue that incentive structures that incorporate different types of objectives can facilitate the recruitment and retention of employees in nonprofit organizations.

With growing public and private support of networks of small and medium-sized firms, many networks rely on network boards to ensure effective governance. By integrating agency and embeddedness reasoning, this article argues that network board composition aimed at effective monitoring may be at the cost of lost ability to strategize. In this study, longitudinal data of Swedish government-supported innovation networks demonstrate that network innovation improves as network board size increases, but that returns to such increases diminish when boards become overly large. Similarly, network board independence is beneficial up to a certain threshold, after which further increases in independence become detrimental. The study clarifies how agency and embeddedness theory can be combined to explain boards' abilities to combine monitoring and strategizing at the network level in increasing the levels of network innovation.

This paper builds on agency theory and contract incompleteness theory to explore the ethical relation between owners and contractors in the construction process. Using factor and multivariate analysis, it transpires that cost, quality, time/past performance, and information available about the project are important factors that should be taken into account in any future contract between the owner (the principle) and the contractor (the agent). The results provide important empirical and theoretical implications in identifying the contractual elements of incomplete contracts, which, if considered, are expected to reduce the agency theory problem, while at the same time enhancing the ethical relationship between owners and contractors.

This paper examines the connection between shareholdings by different groups of corporate officers (insiders and outsiders) and market valuation in South Africa. Specifically, we examine the effect of shareholdings by employees, chief executive officers (CEOs), chief financial officers (CFOs), other executive directors, and non-executive (outside) directors on market valuation. We find that total ownership by all corporate officers (insiders and outsiders) is positively related to market valuation. However, when we examine the link between ownership by individual groups of corporate officers and market valuation, our results suggest that firms with higher ownership by CEOs and other executive directors have lower market valuation, but we do not find any evidence that ownership by CFOs has any significant effect on market valuation. In contrast, we find that ownership by employees and non-executive outside) directors is positively related to market valuation. Our findings are generally consistent with the predictions of agency theory. Copyright (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This paper examines the effect of outside block-holders' ownership on the demand for corporate monitoring in relation to agency theory in the Malaysian business environment. The results of this study provide evidence that, given the cultural differences, the agents and the principals may act differently. The findings indicate that blockholders in Malaysia appear to demand more monitoring costs as their shareholdings increase. This positive relationship may be associated with the demand for more monitoring by minority shareholders as a balance against the power of the majority shareholders in the concentrated business environment in Malaysia and the tighten regulations after 1997/98 financial crisis. Further investigation shows that the institutional and non-institutional block-holders react and demand different level of monitoring costs. The institutional blockholders who are mostly government related institutions appear to demand more monitoring costs as their share ownership increase, while the non-institutional shareholders are associated with less monitoring costs as their shares increase.

After the 2008 economic slowdown, and with increasing assault from enterprises from emerging economies, many innovative strategic leaders of multinational enterprises are forced to radically transform their enterprises. They often choose to change from low-cost strategy to innovation-driven product differentiation strategy. In this study, we use a multi-level Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM) and agency theory to empirically illustrate such a strategic transformation at a large composite fabric and accessories enterprise. Lessons are drawn from the impact of strategic transformation at multiple levels: strategic leader level, tactical-team manager level, operational follower level, and stakeholder level. Implications for practitioners and researchers are provided by way of mindful leader orientation and value-based innovation. (c) Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economia y Negocios.

The main purpose of this study is to develop and examine the theoretical model of hospital governance. For this purpose, this study integrates the literature of organizational governance and agency theory to empirically test the relationship between hospital governance mechanisms (structure of board of directors, information disclosure, and decision making) and hospital governance effectiveness (financial, customer, internal process, learning and growth, and social responsibility). This study empirically tested hospital governance related indices from 102 hospitals by using secondary data. The results find that (1) information disclosure and decision making of hospital governance mechanisms are positively related to its governance effectiveness, and (2) the relationship between the structures of board of directors and its governance effectiveness is non-significant. The theoretical and managerial implications and suggestions of future study are provided at the end of this study.

It is claimed that information system structure can affect the coordination, monitoring and controlling of organisational activities, and in turn reduce the costs involved. This paper aims to investigate how the information system structure of an organisation affects its demand and preference for monitoring costs in Malaysian business environment. About 867 questionnaires were distributed to public listed companies in Malaysia, however, only 235 questionnaires were completed and usable for the purpose of the study. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were carried out to analyze the data. The findings indicate that companies using centralised information system structure have negative and significant relationship with total monitoring costs, this result may be explained by the fact that the agents' self interest behaviour can be monitored by the centralised system. However the information system structure is not significant when the cost of directorship and auditing are compared. But when internal auditing and external auditing costs are compared, the result indicates that companies with centralised information system structure have significantly more internal auditing costs. This paper contributes to the literature relating to the relationship between information system structures and monitoring costs, especially in Malaysian business settings.

Referring to the dual nature of "good" theories in social and management sciences, this article claims that the same theory might generate both good and bad practices, in rational and moral terms. To illustrate this argument, it relies on the positive agency theory case and on two related practices: stock-options, and the carried interest technique which is supported by the private equity organizational structure. This article concludes that management theory and practices may be decoupled. (c) 2013 Lavoisier. All rights reserved.

So selecting a suitable commercialisation strategy is considered as a strategic selection and accordingly the importance of the factors affecting this selection is more obvious. In this study, using a mix method, as well as applying agency theory; firstly, the local Factors Affecting the Selection of Iran special commercialisation strategy in 41 young biotechnology companies in Tehran province were identified through interview and then a questionnaire was prepared integrating these factors and the factors extracted fro m the existing literature and was distributed among a larger sample in order to obtain the integrity.

CEO duality-the practice of a single individual serving as both CEO and board chair-has been the subject of academic interest for more than 20 years. In that time, boards' use of CEO duality has fluctuated and the scholarly conceptualizations of the phenomenon have become more complex. As such, the need to understand CEO duality has only increased with time. We review and integrate the disparate literature on this topic so that future attempts to study it will benefit from a more complete understanding of the knowledge already produced. We review the demonstrated antecedents and consequences of CEO duality, pointing out that while much work has been done in this area, much remains that we do not understand. Finally, we offer new theoretical, methodological, and contextual directions that researchers could explore to extend knowledge about CEO duality. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

The objective of this research is to assess the impact of IT outsourcing on Information Systems' success. We modeled the relationships among the extent of IT outsourcing, the ZOT (the Zone of Tolerance), and IS success. We justified our model using the expectancy-disconfirmation theory, the agency theory, and transaction cost economics, and we empirically tested it using structural equation modeling with responses from IS users. We found significant direct and indirect effects (through the service quality) of outsourcing on IS systems' perceived usefulness and their users' satisfaction. Whereas the extent of outsourcing is negatively related to the service quality and perceived usefulness, the ZOT-based IS service quality is positively related to the user satisfaction.

Purpose -Drawing on agency theory and legitimacy theory perspectives, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of board characteristics on sustainability reporting of listed companies in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 148 listed companies was drawn from the CSE using stratified random sampling method and data were collected from the 2012 annual reports. The proposed hypotheses were tested using a hierarchical binary logistic regression. Findings - This study documents that board size and dual leadership are positively associated with sustainability reporting and boards with female directors are negatively associated with sustainability reporting. This study also found that sustainability reporting is likely to be influenced by firm size and firm growth. Additionally, the study also reveals that younger firms are likely to adopt sustainability reporting. Originality/value - This is the first study to examine the influence of board characteristics on sustainability reporting in Sri Lanka, considered as a developing economy with an emerging equity market.

Prior studies have examined the importance of economic, strategic, and human factors to decision policies of angel investors and venture capitalists. As more angels professionalize into angel funds and as markets for technologies and ideas become more competitive, it is becoming more important to compare their decision policies with those of venture capitalists. Drawing upon agency theory, we examine whether economic potential, specific human capital, strategic readiness, and passion matter differently to venture capitalists and angel investors. Our study is an experimental conjoint analysis of more than 2700 investment decisions nested within a mixed sample of venture capitalists and angel investors. We find that strategic readiness for funding and affective passion matter more to angel investors, while economic potential matters more to venture capitalists. We also find that both investor types place similar weights on the specific human capital of entrepreneurs. These findings support the agency view that differences in the investment decision policies of angel investors and venture capitalists can be explained by examining the agency costs, market risks, information asymmetry, and control mechanisms that are structured into angel and venture capital deals.

With recent legislation mandating that publicly traded corporations submit their CEOs' compensation for a nonbinding shareholder vote, a systematic understanding of shareholder preferences has never been so important. In spite of this, relatively little is known about what impacts shareholders' preferences and, subsequently, their ultimate voting behavior. We integrate two theories to help frame the question and to help predict shareholder behavior. Per agency theory, shareholders, as principals, will disapprove of high CEO rewards and poor firm performance, symmetrically assessing gains and losses. Per prospect theory, shareholders will be loss averse, responding much more strongly to being in a loss position than to being in a gain or neutral position. We combine these theories' predictions in two lab experiments in which we simulate a shareholder say-on-pay vote, hypothesizing that shareholders will be concerned with agency costs, but only when they are in a loss position. The results of these simulated votes suggest that shareholders do value pay for performance, in keeping with agency theory. However, shareholders exhibit this focus on agencynormative prescriptions asymmetrically, showing loss aversion in keeping with prospect theory. This finding has significant implications for both theory and practice as shareholder votes become a regular and high-profile occurrence. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

Extant theories agree that debt should inhibit diversification but predict opposing performance consequences. While agency theory predicts that debt should lead to higher performance for diversifying firms, transaction cost economics (TCE) predicts that more debt will lead to lower performance for firms expanding into new markets. Our empirical tests on a large sample of Japanese firms support TCE by showing that firms accrue higher returns from leveraging their resources and capabilities into new markets when managers are shielded from the rigors of the market governance of debt, particularly bond debt. Furthermore, we find that the detrimental effects of debt are exacerbated for R&D intensive firms and that debt is not necessarily harmful to firms that are either contracting or managing a stable portfolio of markets.

Purpose: A severe problem in supplier selection refers to moral hazard: suppliers not behaving in the expected way once contracted. Principal-agent theory could provide insights on how to reduce this problem. Because buyer-supplier relationships can be interpreted as principal-agent situations, the application of agency theory should facilitate improved supplier selection. Although theoretically compelling, empirical tests verifying this assumption are not prevalent. Regarding the advancement of theory, this paper tests whether both ex ante and ex post information asymmetries influence moral hazard. In particular, in the context of a globalizing economy with a subsequent increase in information asymmetries as a problem in supplier selection, this conceptual approach may be contributive.Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a set of 87 buyer-supplier relationships to conduct a test, applying a partial least squares model with latent variables. A particularity of the data set is that it contains information on ongoing as well as on discontinued relationships.Findings: The analysis indicated that both ex ante information asymmetries (operationalized by a reputation variable) and ex post asymmetries (operationalized by a monitoring variable) have shown to be significant and strong antecedents explaining the occurrence of moral hazard. Interestingly, and opposed to the common assumption, the length of a relationship and the amount of direct meetings have not revealed any explanatory significance. Buyer dependency hardly showed influence on supplier opportunism.Research limitations/implications: Data were collected from a multitude of buyer-supplier relationships from a single firm in the chemical-pharmaceutical industry. Generalizations to other industries still need to be tested. Socially desirable answering behavior cannot fully be excluded because relationship discontinuation is not a desirable situation. In terms of theory implications, this research adds to the notion that both hidden action and hidden intention can lead to moral hazard.Practical implications: An agency-based analysis can be operationalized with the help of an agency-based supplier classification portfolio. It might be of particular value to firms to discuss those suppliers that scored high in risk of opportunism but did not (yet) reveal any signs of moral hazard. Finally, the strong explanatory powerof reputation alerts buyers to pay more attention to behavioral information on the (potential) supplier available in the market.Originality/value: Analyzing the occurrence of moral hazard and including terminated relationships adds to the emerging stream of literature on relationship discontinuation in B2B markets. Further, the strong empirical results may encourage researchers to elaborate on principal-agent theory-based assumptions, adding another layer of explanation to buyer-supplier relationships. Findings show that reputation is unduly neglected as supplier selection criterion in current theory and practice. Copyright (c) Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The incentive dilemma refers to a situation in which incentives are offered but do not work as intended. The authors suggest that, in an interorganizational context, whether a principal-provided incentive works is a function of how it is evaluated by an agent: for its contribution to the agent's bottom line (instrumental evaluation) and for the extent it is strategically aligned with the agent's direction (congruence evaluation). To further understand when incentives work, the influence of two key contextual variables-industry volatility and dependence-are examined. A field study featuring 57 semi-structured depth interviews and 386 responses from twin surveys in the information technology and brewing industries provide data for hypothesis testing. When and whether incentives work is demonstrated by certain conditions under which the agent's evaluation of an incentive has positive or negative effects on its compliance and active representation. Further, some outcomes are reversed in the high volatility condition. (c) 2013 Academy of Marketing Science.

This study focuses on the relationship and identity changes within and between a project team and its organization following top management intervention in the context of a large international construction project. The study follows the project-as-practice orientation, examining the actions and behaviors of the project team through participant ethnography in the "praxis" of the project site over its entire duration. The longitudinal case allows the examination of the way the transition process established a new governance culture undermining the initial trust-based one and changed it from a virtual absence of mechanisms toward far more potent mechanisms of control, monitoring, and punishment. Simultaneously, the initial stewardship relationships and collectivist identity of the project team shifted toward agency relationships and individualistic identity. The triggers for the transformation process were identified as CEO succession, project failure, top management intervention driven changes in governance mechanisms, and perception of organizational betrayal of the project team.

Agency theory suggests that independent outside board members may have an important monitoring function of the financial reporting process. As a result, boards with more independent directors have a tendency for increased monitoring and are therefore expected to insist on better earnings quality. This study examines whether board independence improves earnings quality by reducing earnings management in Portugal, a country with significantly different institutional and legal characteristics from the Anglo-Saxon countries. Using ordinary least square (OLS) and two stage least squares (2SLS) techniques to control potential simultaneity problems between board independence and earnings quality, we find evidence that independent board members improve earnings quality by reducing earnings management for a sample of Portuguese listed firms. This result suggests that strengthening the independence of boards by appointing more independent board members is a positive step toward improving earnings quality.

This paper examines the evolution of the international franchise research with special focus on the governance modes of the international franchise firm and develops a new model for the franchisor's choice of the international governance modes. International governance modes in franchising refer to wholly-owned subsidiaries, joint venture franchising, area development franchising and master franchising. Although many studies on the governance modes of the international franchise firm have been published in the last two decades, no prior study develops an integrative framework that investigates the determinants of the international governance modes by combining organizational economics and strategic management perspectives. Specifically, this study explains the governance modes of the international franchise firm by applying transaction cost theory, agency theory, resource-based and organizational capabilities theory and property rights theory.

Family offices are organisations dedicated to the management of entrepreneurial families' private wealth. Based on agency theory, we analyse types of family offices with regard to the families' goals and the control mechanisms used to ensure goal achievement. Family-dominant management and private client structures involve stronger emphasis on non-financial goals in single and multi-family offices than in non-family-dominant management and open client structures. Variations in family involvement, ranging from family dominance to the complete absence of family ownership and/or management, and diverse client structures justify the differential reliance on formal and informal control mechanisms.

Purpose - This paper aims to develop a framework of connotative meanings afforded to the term "corporate governance". Design/methodology/approach - An examination of academic publications from 1985-2012 containing the term "corporate governance" was conducted. The articles are sorted into the theoretical constructs that influence the contemporary connotative meaning of corporate governance. Findings - That a combination of a weak definitional base coupled with strong motivational forces have aided the development of competing theoretical perspectives of the meaning of corporate governance. The dominant meaning is written from an agency theory perspective. Research limitations/implications - Theoretical analysis was restricted to articles found in academic journals published since 1985. Practical implications - This study provides a very useful analysis into the connotative meanings and theoretical bases used by academic writers in the study of corporate governance. Originality/value - This paper provides an updated and developed analysis to the theoretical dimensions that underpin the contemporary use of the term "corporate governance".

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore the franchise relationship in China, focusing on the relational constructs of power, control, support and conflict in this developing franchise environment. Agency theory has dominated franchise research. A more rounded theoretical interpretation of the franchising relationship is offered by employing both agency theory and institutional theory perspectives.
Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts an interpretive approach, employing in-depth interviews with franchisors and franchisees in nine franchise organisations operating in the retail sector in China. It contributes a fuller understanding of how to manage the research process in China.
Findings - The study reveals how the relational constructs of power, control, support and conflict are manifest in the franchise relationship in China. The explanatory power of agency theory is apparent when viewed in terms of the vertical agency problem. However, free-riding outside the franchise system, in the form of counterfeiting, mitigates against the occurrence of free-riding within it. With regard to institutional theory, we demonstrate that the regulatory institutional pillar is a crucial foundation for the franchise relationship.
Practical implications - The study offers insights for franchisors and franchisees considering franchise relationships in China.
Originality/value - For the first time in the literature, this study offers insights into key elements of the franchise relationship in China. Employing both agency and institutional theories facilitates a rounded explanation of the developing franchise environment in China. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Agency theory is one of the most important foundational theories in management research, but it rests on contestable cognitive assumptions. Specifically, the principal is assumed to hold a perfect (correct) theory regarding some of the content of the agent's mind, while he is entirely ignorant concerning other such content. More realistically, individuals have some limited access to the minds of others. We explore the implications for classical agency theory of realistic assumptions regarding the human potential for interpersonal sensemaking. We discuss implications for the design and management of rewards, and trace implications for value creation in principal-agent relations. (c) 2014 European Academy of Management.

The world-wide inflation in executive compensation in recent years has been accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of long-term incentives. This article demonstrates how the subjectively perceived value of long-term incentives is affected by risk aversion, uncertainty aversion, and time preferences. Based on a unique empirical study which involved collecting primary data on executive preferences from around the world, and using a theoretical framework which draws on behavioral agency theory, we conclude that, while long-term incentives are perceived by executives to be effective, they are not in fact an efficient form of reward, and that this outcome is not significantly affected by cross-cultural differences. We conjecture that boards of directors, acting on behalf of shareholders, increase the size of long-term incentive awards in order to compensate executives for the perceived loss of value when compared with less risky, more certain and more immediate forms of reward.

This study introduces the concept of perceived salesperson transparency to the sales literature. It addresses how recent technological developments impact traditional agency theory concerns, while simultaneously creating a conceptual definition of perceived transparency for application on an individual level. Salesperson perceptions regarding managerial use of behavioral information obtained through technological means are empirically found to have a mediating effect on the relationship between managerial access to such information and the likelihood of unethical salesperson behavior. It concludes that salesperson ethical behavior is not influenced by management's ability to obtain behaviorally relevant information, but rather by the use of this information. Further, it is found that the mediating influence of use of information accessed via technology is itself moderated by the salesperson's job performance. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this research is to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for interpreting Shariah governance mechanism in Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). After reviewing existing theories that were used to explain the phenomenon of corporate governance, three most commonly used theories in the corporate governance and Shariah governance area namely agency theory, stewardship theory and stakeholder theory were used and integrated based on their interrelated concepts and their relationship with Shariah governance. The constructed theoretical framework includes five concepts, namely accountability, disclosure and transparency, competency, confidentiality and independency among the key functionaries in Shariah governance, which are perceived to be the principles of Shariah governance. This research is among the first attempts to build an integrated theoretical foundation for Shariah governance in IFIs and the developed theoretical framework can be used as the basis for interpretations and comparisons on the ideal versus practical situation of Shariah governance in IFIs.

Are there country-level differences in the use of pay-for-performance in executive compensation contracts? We investigate how formal country-level institutions affect pay-for-performance directly and if institutions have a moderating effect on the relation between ownership structure and pay-for-performance contracts. Based on agency theory arguments, we show that substitutionary and complementary relations are conceivable, for the direct and the moderating effect. We conduct an empirical analysis based on 2766 firm-year observations for the years 2005-2008. Our empirical results show that whereas strong shareholder protection substitutes pay-for-performance, disclosure requirements complement pay-for-performance. Additionally, strong shareholder protection complements the effect of concentrated ownership on pay-for-performance while disclosure requirements substitute effects of ownership concentration. Overall, our results provide evidence for the relevance of formal institutions as determinants of executive compensation contracts. Additionally, our results indicate the general complexity of integrating institutions and internal governance mechanisms. (c) 2014.

Professional institutions are increasingly confronted by fiscal constraints and political pressures to improve and increase their accountability in a competitive consumer-driven market. Accordingly, the need to ensure efficiency and accountability is of strategic importance. This article reports on a qualitative study of medical professionals that assessed the utility of financial incentives and external control methods derived from agency theory to ensure accountability of professionals. The authors argue that approaches derived from stewardship and institutional theories can extend the principal-agent perspective to sustain greater social and ethical accountability.

This article examines the determinants of the value-added contribution offered by advisors to entrepreneurs seeking venture capital (VC) funding. It hypothesizes that the contribution of advisors is particularly helpful in addressing problems of asymmetric information and uncertainty. The study develops seven hypotheses derived from agency theory using data from questionnaire responses given by entrepreneurs that used advisors to acquire VC. The results indicate that advisor value-added contributions are substantial when entrepreneurs have limited experience in dealing with venture capitalists (VCs). Other determinants are stage of venture development, level of innovation and the entrepreneur's industry sector experience. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of offering customer decision authority on customer satisfaction in credence services, and the moderating effects of customer persuasion knowledge and service provider credibility. Design/methodology/approach: A video-based experiment is conducted to achieve high similarity to real service encounters. The video comprises three levels of customer authority while service provider credibility is manipulated. In a subsequent questionnaire, customer response and customer persuasion knowledge are measured. Findings: Results suggest that greater decision authority increases customer satisfaction. However, customer persuasion knowledge and provider credibility together were found to moderate these effects. Offering decision autonomy is most important when source credibility is low and persuasion knowledge is high. Research limitations/implications: The study setting is an initial healthcare encounter. Other service settings and service provider communication behaviors, such as empathy, responding to customer queries, and length of encounter are not considered in this study but should be further studied. Practical implications: The study confirms that offering decision authority to customers increases satisfaction only under certain circumstances. Customers are willing to relinquish authority to credible service providers who then direct customer decisions in order to maintain service quality. Offering decision autonomy to customers is suggested when provider credibility is low and customer persuasion knowledge is high. Originality/value: Analysis of credence service encounters is based on agency theory. Specifically, this study highlights the role of customer (principal) persuasion knowledge, which acts as a qualifier for the principal-agent problem because it alerts the customer to possible persuasion attempts by the service provider, whereas agent credibility eases customer suspicion.

This research compares the performance of spinoffs and buyouts divested to commercialize innovations. The authors study 145 spinoffs and 121 buyouts that occurred in the United States between 1996 and 2005. Analysis provides three critical findings. First, spinoffs have higher profits in the two years after divestiture; afterwards, buyouts have higher profits. Second, strategic emphasis (investment in R&D versus marketing) is the mechanism that explains the diverging profitability of spinoffs and buyouts over time. Third, this occurs through two routes: a one-step mediated effect via strategic emphasis; a two-step mediated effect via strategic emphasis and radicalness. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The current study examines the relationship between executive compensation and firm performance in the U.S. lodging industry. It is not clear-cut whether performance leads to compensation or compensation drives firm performance. Our contention is that cash and lagged equity-based compensation drive the firm performance. Our findings suggest that chief executive officer's (CEO) contemporaneous cash-compensation and one-year lagged equity-compensation positively affect the accounting performance measures return on assets and Tobin's Q; but neither compensation components affects the market-performance measure, stock returns, in the lodging industry. Quantitatively similar findings are found for the chief financial officer (CFO). Further robustness test show that further lags of equity compensation of both named executives do not result in increased stock performance in the lodging industry. (c) 2013.

This study analyses whether or not the effect of board independence on a firm's strategic performance is moderated by family involvement in ownership and control. Moderation of the board's size and the independent director ratio are tested under quadratic specifications. The effect of CEO duality with family involvement on long-term sales growth is also measured. The empirical analysis is conducted in the Southern European context using a sample of publicly traded firms that have concentrated ownership structures. The main findings indicate that when nonlinearities are considered, family involvement moderates the relationship between the independent director ratio and firm performance. The optimal proportion of independent directors is lower in family businesses than in non-family ones. However, the results fail to support nonlinearities for board size. We find positive linear relationships between both board size and CEO duality with firm performance, which are not moderated by family involvement.

Agency theory is used to investigate the relationship between top management team involvement on not-for-profit hospitals' boards of directors (BODs) and hospital financial performance. Governance data collected in 2011 by The Governance Institute was merged with hospital financial performance data from the 2011 Medicare Cost Reports. Then, an ordinary least squares regression model, using propensity score adjustments, was used to evaluate the relationship between management involvement on the BOD and three financial performance profitability ratios: total margin, operating margin, and return on assets. The sample included 637 not-for-profit hospitals, most of which (74.1%) were not government owned. As hypothesized, we found that having a larger number of managers with voting rights on the BOD was associated with lower total margin (b= -0.011, p < .065). Similarly, we found that having a greater percentage of voting BOD members who were managers was associated with lower total margin (b= -0.296, p < .002) and return on assets (b= -0.337, p < .072). We did not find support for the notion that CEO involvement on the BOD is associated with poorer hospital financial performance (b= -0.008, p < .437). Consistent with agency theory, our findings suggest that management involvement on the BOD is associated with poorer hospital financial performance. This finding suggests that management involvement on the BOD may impair the BOD's ability to effectively monitor the actions of management, which may lead managers to make decisions that are more consistent with their own interests than those of the organization.

Background: Despite continued scrutiny over executive earnings in the health care industry, the evidence for executive pay determinants is uncertain and inconclusive. Theoretical motivations for executive compensation practices have been debated, and questions remain about the explanatory power of previously applied theoretical models. Purposes: Our systematic review considered evidence of executive compensation determinants among health care organizations and sought to identify factors affecting executive pay that are commonly supported by previous studies. We also aimed to survey the theoretical perspectives employed in health care executive compensation studies to address how organization theory may explain executive remuneration practices at health care organizations. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Twenty-one eligible studies were identified after a search of the MEDLINE/PubMed and CINAHL electronic reference databases and the reference lists of relevant studies. Eligible studies included those examining health care organizations and providing empirical, regression-based outcomes regarding the determinants of executive compensation. Each eligible study was coded to identify pertinent information, including study settings, executive compensation measures, executive compensation determinants and their measures (e.g., financial performance measured as profit margin), outcomes (direction and level of statistical significance of regression model coefficients), and theoretical applications. Findings: Studies are mixed in their findings regarding the statistical significance of various determinants of executive compensation. Many studies indicate that, in addition to firm financial performance, other factors may influence health care executive compensation, including organizational size and human capital attributes. Agency theory was the predominant framework applied, yet the findings suggest a complementary theoretical perspective may better explain health care executive compensation. Practice Implications: To address critics who assert health care executive compensation levels are not consistent with organizational performance, health care organization CEOs, board members, and consultants would benefit to carefully consider and effectively communicate the numerous factors influencing executive compensation beyond firm financial performance.

This study proposes a revised agency theory for the nonprofit sector, distinguishes between the extent of agency and the extent of monitoring, and compares the magnitudes of the two impacts. Using panel data for 1998-2003, the paper tests whether monitoring by principal-stakeholders such as donors, clients, the government, and the board reduces the opportunity for executive misconduct such as extravagant spending on compensation and perquisites. Given the theory, the findings show that two effects influence CEO salaries. First, while nonprofit endowments provide a fiscal cushion in tough financial situations, by offering "organizational slack" they also increase the CEO's opportunity to steal or raise her compensation (i.e., agency effect). Second, donors utilize monitoring mechanisms such as auditing or direct observations, which limit the opportunity for misconduct and reduce executive pay (i.e., monitoring effect). In the final analysis, the monitoring effect is greater than the agency effect, which implies that even if agency problems are present, the monitoring that donors provide offsets them.

This paper investigates the agency costs of multinational companies (MNCs) in relation to agency theory, in the Malaysian business environment. Using the data of 235 MNCs, this study explores their demand for monitoring costs and these companies' preferences between the monitoring costs components. The result indicates that MNCs incur significantly higher monitoring costs compared to domestic companies. However, the relationship between these companies and their preference between the components of the monitoring mechanisms, that is between directorship and auditing as their monitoring mechanism, is not significant. When the auditing components are further investigated, it reveals that MNCs incur more external audit costs compared to internal audit costs. (c) 2014, University of Malaya. All rights reserved.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

This research provides an accurate picture of situations in which founder-CEOs are replaced (or not) by venture capitalists. Our analysis aims to go further than the schematic case of the founder being simply dismissed by investors in a conflictual context. We first review the literature dedicated to this subject in the light of the agency theory (AT) and the resource-based view (RBV). However, the limits of these theoretical frameworks lead us to investigate their extensions: the entrenchment theory (ET), the dynamic capabilities approach (DCA) and the cognitive governance perspective (CGP). In a second phase, in order to decode the replacement process, we designed an exploratory methodology based on qualitative data, thus deepening our understanding of the issues it entails in venture-backed companies. Finally, this field analysis allows us to build a typology of replacement scenarii, with each scenario being interpreted by combining relevant theories to explain all aspects of it. In line with the AT, the ET focuses on the FCs strategy to retain their position. The DCA analyses the CEOs' resources from a dynamic angle, in accordance with the RBV. The CGP is mobilised to characterise a conflict originating in a lack of skills. These results lead us to rethink the role of time and the nature of conflicts in the relationships between FCs and venture capitalists. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Software platform providers are increasingly opening up their platforms to take advantage of external resources and innovations. This research, based on existing theories, empirically analyzes the drivers of platform providers' decision to open up their platforms. Based on resourcebased view and control mechanism, we developed a set of hypotheses which explain the degree of platform openness adopted by the platform providers. We performed qualitative interviews and quantitatively validated the results. Thus, we developed an online survey targeting software platform providers. The results show that absorptive capabilities of platform providers play an important role in the degree of platform openness. We also found that the implementation of informal control modes influence the decision to use a higher degree of platform openness. (c) Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

Family governance is a typical governance structure in publicly traded firms in Taiwan and around the world. The founding family of a firm can choose direct ownership or a pyramidal ownership structure to achieve control over a publicly traded family business or a family business group. In addressing performance issues in family businesses, the family ownership structure could generate positive or negative impacts on performance. Thus, determining the contingent condition that will moderate the relationship between family ownership and performance is a key concern in family businesses. Utilizing longitudinal data in family businesses in Taiwan's personal computer industry, this study examines the relationships between the roles of professional managers on the board, the family ownership structure, and the firm's performance from agency theory viewpoint. The results indicate that the professional manager's position on the board will moderate the relationship between the family ownership structure and performance. Specifically, the professional managers serving as directors will enhance the positive impact from family direct ownership on performance and mitigate the negative performance impact from family pyramidal ownership. This study extends the principal-agent and principal-principal agency arguments by further considering the role of the professional manager's position in family businesses.

Researchers identify integration and devolution as two paradoxical elements of Human Resource Management (HRM). Integration is related with centralization of HRM and linking HRM strategies with business strategies. HR professionals are responsible for integrating HRM that is widely referred as strategic HRM. On the other hand, devolution is the involvement of line managersto take administrative or technical HRM decisions. Thus, both HR professional and line managers are found agents for HRM and performing differing HRM. However, both agents need to cooperate each other in performing their contradictory HR tasks. For strategic contribution, HR managers need to work with line managers for understanding business strategy and aligning HR strategy with them. Conversely, line managers require HR managers assistance and support in developing line competency to perform administrative HRM consistently. The present study reviews extant literatures on integration and devolution and accumulates the scattered comments on HR-line relationship. HR professionals and line managers are found to work in a partnership relation while performing differing HRM. Moreover, this study contributes to relate agency theory as a theoretical basis for creating partnering relation between HR professionals and line managers (c) 2014 Medwell Journals.

Low labor costs and market access are no longer competitive differentiators; increasingly companies are looking to design and develop new products and services as a crucial source of competitive advantage. As the pressure to innovate increases, so does the tension between shorter-term exploitative development and longer-term exploratory innovation activities. We explore this tension using interview data from software SMEs and venture capitalist firms who invest in technology-driven companies. Findings indicate that, despite firm's having established solid innovation plans, short-term exploitative demands crowd out their longer-term exploration innovation during the development phase. Agency and resource dependence theories are used to start to explore some of the reasons for this shift. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

The distinctiveness of Islam and the reaction toward the domination of the Western ideologies on the rest of the world especially on Islamic nations generated a movement among many scholars toward applying Islamic principals in the field of corporate governance. Islam is the dominant religion in the Middle Eastern region. This region consist of two major blocs the Arab League and most importantly the GCC. Thus, the cultural, political and legal environments have a significant impact on both profit and non-profit organisations. The proposed concept is generated by considering; the narrowness of the Agency theory illustrated by its limited explanations of such complexity associated with corporate governance issues yet its greatness of simplicity in regards to accountability; the Stakeholders theory serves wider views and shares many aspect with Islam yet this theory by nature suffers from practical complexity; Institutional theory are considered to ensure some degree of stability in the concept by considering the importance of the Islamic corporate supervisory institution in developing a sustainable Islamic corporate governance standards.

This Chapter aims at analysing the role of the incentive and rewarding mechanism in the loose coupling PMS. Thus, it firstly identifies the purposes of the incentive and rewarding mechanism in the PMS, namely motivation, information, and recruitment and retention. After a brief introduction to the incentive theories, the discussion starts from the investigation of the incentive and rewarding process, which is composed of three main phases; the selection of the performance measures to be used in the assessment phase, the assessment and its frequency, and the model selection. Finally, the last sections provide theoretical and practical insights into the assessment of the incentive and rewarding mechanism and the dysfunctional effects resulting from the use of biased incentive and rewarding mechanisms.

The purpose of this paper is to generate theory using total interpretive structural modelling. In this paper, an extensive review of extant literature was undertaken to identify research gaps. To bridge the existing gaps, an approach has been undertaken to further alternative methods in theory building in the field of operations management. This paper presents our arguments supported by extant literature to adopt total interpretive structural modelling technique to generate theory. The total interpretive structural modelling and cross multiplication impact matrix output were synthesised to generate a sustainable manufacturing framework which is the integration of three independent theories. The sustainable manufacturing framework is the unique contribution of this paper, which suggests how human agency theory, institutional theory can contribute to ecological modernisation theory. In future the theory developed can be tested using multivariate analysis using data, gathered through structured questionnaire. Finally, the research limitations and further research directions were outlined which may help operations management community to extend the current theoretical framework to next level.

This article describes new micro-foundations for theorizing about executive compensation, drawing on the behavioral economics literature and based on a more realistic set of behavioral assumptions than those that have typically been made by agency theorists. We call these micro-foundations "behavioral agency theory." In contrast to the standard agency framework, which focuses on monitoring costs and incentive alignment, behavioral agency theory places agent performance at the center of the agency model, arguing that the interests of shareholders and their agents are most likely to be aligned if executives are motivated to perform to the best of their abilities. We develop a line of argument first advanced by Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia and put the case for a more general reassessment of the behavioral assumptions underpinning agency theory. A model of economic man predicated on bounded rationality is proposed, adopting Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia's assumptions about risk preferences, but incorporating new assumptions about time discounting, inequity aversion, and the trade-off between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. We argue that behavioral agency theory provides a better framework for theorizing about executive compensation, an enhanced theory of agent behavior, and an improved platform for making recommendations about the design of executive compensation plans.

By complementing agency theory with behavioral assumptions, we explore the effects of family involvement on small and medium enterprises' (SMEs) performance. We identify three separate dimensions of family involvement and hypothesize nonlinear, direct, and interaction effects on the performance of an SME. The evidence on 787 SMEs suggests that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between family ownership and performance, and ownership dispersion among family members negatively affects performance. Balancing family and nonfamily members in the top management team (TMT) is found to be beneficial to SMEs' performance, but the family ratio in the TMT becomes crucial only at high levels of family ownership.

Organizational performance can be enhanced by effective project benefit generation. Although it identifies the project owner as the single point of accountability for the realization of project benefits, the literature does not comprehensively discuss this role in the project governance model, nor the management approaches that can support this role. Based on principal-agent theory and a control-trust-risk approach, we have conducted an empirical study across various managerial contexts. Results suggest that trust of the project owner in the project manager is more effective in a turbulent environment, whereas more control by the project owner of the project management process is a superior management approach in a more stable project setting. Finally, a project governance model is introduced and the management role of the project owner is discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

Collaborating with a supplier in a buying firm's new product development (NPD) project is commonly advocated and adopted, but does not always improve project performance. Some pre-existing collaboration contexts, such as buyer-supplier NPD projects, are especially exposed to supplier opportunism due to the uncertain nature of the collaboration process. Adopting agency theory and transaction cost theory perspectives, we examine: (i) contextual antecedents and project consequences of supplier opportunism and (ii) if these causal influences vary in different cultural and institutional contexts. Using a survey sample of 214 United States (U.S.) and 212 Chinese buying firms' responses about buyer-supplier NPD projects, we find that supplier opportunism is significantly influenced by the task and relational contexts. We also show that supplier opportunism damages both design quality and efficiency, two aspects of project performance. When comparing U.S. to China, we find that task and relational contexts have a greater impact on supplier opportunism in the U.S., but design efficiency is less hurt by supplier opportunism there. Finally, we show challenges of preventing supplier opportunism in certain NPD collaboration contexts, and offer solutions for overcoming these challenges. (c) 2015 Decision Sciences Institute.

To develop further insight into antecedents of the CEO's psychological orientation toward the firm, we investigate what might lead CEOs to identify with their firms. Although research suggests that CEO organizational identification can be quite consequential for the firm, little research attention has been paid to its determinants. To predict how the special context of the CEO position might lead to identification, we consider a set of motives that members have for identifying with their organizations and consider how unique features of the CEO position might be relevant to those motives. Our theory and supportive findings help explain how the context of the CEO position, including variables often conceptualized as control mechanisms in agency theory research, can have important effects on subsequent CEO organizational identification.

Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries--often labeled "lack of transparency"--between top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high.

Corporate political activity (CPA) is an important nonmarket strategy aimed at advancing a firm's interests by influencing public policy. Yet studies report mixed results as to the impact of CPA on firm outcomes. Building on recent extant research we suggest that one reason for the ambivalent evidence regarding the impact of CPA on firm performance is the moderating role of CEO discretion on the CPA-firm performance relationship. In a longitudinal study of S&P 1000 firms over 10 years, we test competing perspectives regarding the moderating impact of CEO discretion on the CPA-corporate performance relationship. We find that some aspects of CEO discretion, in particular CEO duality, moderate the relationship between CPA and performance. The findings provide some support for an agency view of the impact of CEO discretion the CPA-performance relationships, which carry implications for both scholarship and regulation in the areas of CPA and corporate governance.

Purpose - Communication of risk management (RM) practices are a critical component of good corporate governance. Research, to date, has been of little benefit in informing regulators internationally. This paper seeks to contribute to the literature by investigating how listed Australian companies disclose RM information in annual report governance statements in accordance with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) corporate governance framework. Design/methodology/approach - To address this study's research questions and related hypotheses, the authors examine the top 300 ASX-listed companies by market capitalisation at 30 June 2010. For these firms, the authors identify, code and categorise RM disclosures made in the annual according to the disclosure categories specified in ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (CGPR). The derived data are then examined using a comprehensive approach comprising thematic content analysis and regression analysis. Findings - The results indicate widespread divergence in disclosure practices and low conformance with the Principle 7 of the ASX CGPR. This result suggests that companies are not disclosing all "material business risks" possibly due to ignorance at the board level, or due to the intentional withholding of sensitive information from financial statement users. The findings also show mixed results across the factors expected to influence disclosure behaviour. While the presence of a risk committee (RC) (in particular, a standalone RC) and technology committee (TC) are found to be associated with some improvement in disclosure levels, the authors do not find evidence that company risk measures (as proxied by equity beta and the market-to-book ratio) are significantly associated with greater levels of RM disclosure. Also, contrary to common findings in the disclosure literature, factors such as board independence and expertise, audit committee independence and the usage of a Big-4 auditor do not seem to impact the level of RM disclosure in the Australian context. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited by the sample and study period selection as the RM disclosures of only the largest (top 300) ASX firms are examined for the fiscal year 2010. Thus, the findings may not be generalisable to smaller firms or earlier/later years. Also, the findings may have limited applicability in other jurisdictions with different regulatory environments. Practical implications - The study's findings suggest that insufficient attention has been applied to RM disclosures by listed companies in Australia. These results suggest RM disclosures practices observed in the Australian setting may not be meeting the objectives of regulators and the needs of stakeholders. Originality/value - The Australian setting provides an ideal environment to examine RM communication as the ASX has explicitly recommended RM disclosures areas in its principle-based governance rules since 2007 (Principle 7). This differs from other jurisdictions where such disclosure recommendations are typically not provided and provides us with a benchmark to examine the nature and quality of RM disclosures. Despite the recommendation, the authors reveal that low levels and poor RM communication are prevalent in the Australian setting and warrant further investigation.

Purpose - How family businesses (FBs) manage to survive in the long term is still not well understood in FB research. A promising concept to explain survivability, that is currently heavily discussed in the management literature is organizational ambidexterity (OA) - the ability to balance exploring and exploiting activities at the same time. However, FB research has not yet taken sufficient advantage of the potential of OA to contribute to explaining the ability of later-generation FBs to survive. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - Using central tenets of agency theory, this conceptual paper draws together findings from the FB literature and the OA literature to create a framework for the relationship between family involvement and the ability to reach high levels of OA. Findings - Seven propositions are developed which suggest that the level of family involvement in ownership and management affect the ability of later-generation FBs to reach high levels of OA. They further suggest that the number of family shareholders, the existence of majority family shareholders, and generational involvement of the controlling family in management moderate these relationships. Originality/value - This is the first paper to theoretically analyze OA in later-generation FBs. The seven propositions and avenues for further research presented in this paper are intended to motivate FB research to take a closer look at OA. This may be crucial to better explaining and predicting one of business-owning families' most important goals: the long-term survival of the FB. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747.

Family business succession is a complex and challenging process, in which family members often build on the support of trusted advisors who can be seen as the most relied external source of advice and knowledge that family businesses draw on. Based on an extensive literature review, this article aims to synthesize prior research on both advisors and succession to systematically describe and analyze the role of trusted advisors during the succession-planning process. Based on arguments from agency theory, we discuss potential benefits and drawbacks associated with the involvement of trusted advisors along the four phases-trigger, preparation, selection, and training-of the succession-planning process and outline how trusted advisors can mitigate but also enhance agency costs-in particular goal divergence and information asymmetry-during each of these four phases. Subsequently, we discuss four typical constellations of advisor involvement, which vary in their agency costs and thus have different levels of bias and efficiency. We thereby outline several inefficiencies that result from the common setup in which an incumbent and a successor both rely on their own trusted advisors or a team of expert advisors and propose a balanced and efficient model of advisor involvement as a potential solution which reduces the agency costs. This conceptual article contributes to research on succession, agency theory, and trusted advisors in family firms. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied an underrepresented area in the international business (IB) literature: the effect of country context distance on the distribution of decision-making autonomy across headquarters and foreign affiliates. Foreign affiliates directly contribute to the competitive advantages of multinational enterprises, highlighting the importance of such intra-firm collaboration. The division of decision-making autonomy is a core issue in the management of headquarters-subsidiary relationships. The main contribution of our paper is that we confront two valid theoretical frameworks - business network theory and agency theory - that offer contradictory hypotheses with respect to the division of decision-making autonomy. Our study is among the first to examine this dilemma with a unique dataset from five Central and Eastern European transition countries. The empirical results provide convincing support for our approach to the study of subsidiary decision-making autonomy. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

What is the impact of long-term executive compensation, particularly large pension payouts, on the firm's current dividend policy? We argue that managers with high pension holdings are less likely to adopt a high dividend policy that can risk their future pension payouts. Using a hand-collected actuarial pension dataset we show that (i) dividend payments are significantly lower when manager compensation relies more heavily on pension payouts; (ii) higher compensation leverage and inside debt have a significant negative effect on dividend payments net of stock repurchases; and (iii) the negative effect of pension on dividend is significantly weaker when pensions are protected in a pre-funding rabbi trust. We show further that this agency behavior reduces firm performance. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose - This paper aims to provide an analysis of the HSBC Swiss bank accounts scandal, from the perspective of anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and considers the future AML implications for the banking sector and HSBC. It reviews the use of a whistleblower to highlight AML irregularities rather than official reporting through the current AML compliance system. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses secondary data to offer a viewpoint on the HSBC issues from a money laundering and financial crime perspective. The paper extracts key statements from staff at HSBC and regulators and examines how AML risk assessment was undertaken at this time and what changes need to occur in the future. It considers the implications of the current theoretical context for AML from an agency theory perspective. Findings - The main findings are that AML compliance needs to be embedded into a proactive corporate social responsibility approach rather than relying solely on regulation to improve detection and reporting of money laundering activity. Research limitations/implications - The research topic is new, and therefore, analysis papers and other academic writing on this topic are limited. Future research could consider the outcomes of the Swiss bank's attempts to prosecute the whistleblower and whether this would have implications for future internal reporting and whistleblowing approaches to support AML compliance. Practical implications - The implications from the research are the recommendations to the banking sector on addressing AML deficiencies especially within the context of an evolving level of criminal sophistication towards money laundering. Social implications - The paper supports the argument for integrating social corporate responsibility and AML compliance to produce a whole bank response to financial crime. This is in contrast to the current systems, which seem to be prevalent within the financial services, of profit and business being seen as separate rather than integral to regulation and control. Originality/value - The originality of this paper is the current example of the HSBC Swiss case and the focus specifically on AML compliance rather than tax evasion, which has been the media angle on the issue.

This study identifies barriers to realizing a stewardship relation instead of a classic principal-agent relation between client and vendor through implementation of an innovative procurement and risk management method, the Best Value approach. This approach focuses on calculus-based trust development through the use of metrics and alignment of goals and risks between client and vendor. Barriers to realizing a stewardship relation are analysed with the use of a theoretical framework that incorporates agency theory and stewardship theory. Data was collected in 2013 and 2014 through project documentation and interviews for four case studies at the Dutch Highways Agency. Collected data was used to analyse the roles of the client and vendor, the scope and level of the products and the overall process of the clarification phase of the Best Value approach to identify barriers in practice. Case study findings are analysed and explained by agency theory and stewardship theory. From a theoretical perspective the Best Value approach shows large similarities with stewardship theory. In practice, however, the cases show that the often traditional background of project teams and the lack of experience with Best Value result in a control-oriented relationship between client and vendor characterized by information asymmetry, lack of transparency and distrust. These characteristics of the relationship between client and vendor inhibit the realization of a stewardship relation using the Best Value approach. (c) 2015 Taylor & Francis.

Recently, outside blockholders, external owners that hold 5% or more of their firms' outstanding common stockholdings, have been pressuring their firms to engage in divestiture activities. This study considers whether the influence of those owners also extends to how the divestiture is implemented, whether through spin-off or sell-off. Tests of an agency theory model using data from 205 divestitures show that the adoption of spin-offs or sell-offs is associated with the amount of outstanding common stockholdings held by outside blockholders and the size of the unit divested. Spin-offs are used more frequently when outside blockholders own more of the divesting firm's stockholdings and the divested unit is larger, while sell-offs tend to be selected when outside blockholders own less stock and the divested business is smaller. Consistent with agency theory expectations, spin-offs would allow the blockholders to decide whether to hold or sell their interests in the divested firm, a decision they could make in accordance with their individual portfolio risks. Sell-offs of small units could be used to preserve organizational diversity and produce proceeds that would help the divesting firm's managers pursue their self-interests. Overall, outside blockholders appear to shape how divestitures are done, even if they cannot directly intervene in their firms' operations. (c) The Author(s) 2012

In this article we examine the extent to which fairness considerations are salient to senior executives, and consider the implications for agency theory, tournament theory and the design of top-management incentives. We look for patterns in a unique data set of senior executive preferences and seek explanations for these patterns using a model of fairness first advanced by Fehr and Schmidt in 1999. We propose a number of amendments to Fehr and Schmidt's model. We challenge some of the standard tenets of agency theory and tournament theory, demonstrating why equity considerations should be taken into account. We add to the growing literature on behavioural agency theory. (c) 2015, (c) The Author(s) 2015.

To examine the bribing behavior of firms, we developed a cross-level moderation model using agency theory at the firm level and anomie theory at the societal level to investigate the relationship between manager control of firms and firm bribery activity. The results of this cross-cultural analysis using a sample of 1,799 firms from 38 nations showed that at the firm level, manager-controlled firms (MCFs) have a higher propensity to bribe than shareholder-controlled firms. At the country level, bribery is higher in MCFs (relative to shareholder-controlled firms) in societies with a low level of institutional collectivism, a high level of uncertainty avoidance, economic change, and income inequality. Contrary to the hypothesis, the relationship between bribery and manager control is stronger rather than weaker in societies with press freedom. Implications for future research and practices are discussed. (c) 2015 The International Association for Chinese Management Research.

This paper reports on an exploratory investigation into the concept of managerial wisdom. Six senior managers from diverse and large organisations in New Zealand were interviewed about their conception of managerial wisdom. The findings show that senior managers have a practical and positive conception of wisdom consisting of four factors: experience and knowledge, emotional intelligence, mentorship, and deliberation and consultation. The findings show that concepts of 'spirituality', 'religiosity', and, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, 'ethics', are all absent from the participants' descriptions of wise managers. A tentative definition of managerial wisdom is proposed based on these findings as well as an explanation for the absence of ethics. As interest in wisdom and management continues to grow, this exploratory empirical research serves as a base for further research on the understanding and place of wisdom in management.

This chapter provides a synoptic description of the main theories that see inter-organizational relationships as coordination and control issues: the Transaction Costs Economics theory, the Agency theory and the Resource Dependence theory. These three theories share the idea that inter-organizational relationships are founded on opportunism and bounded rationality, and that organizations seek to control the critical aspects of their business network interactions in order to pursue their goals. These three theories are often considered as complementary in literature, since they often provide opposite predictions in similar cases. Scholars interested in e-marketplaces and in the inter-organizational impacts of the Internet have mainly focused on the Transaction Costs Economics theory so far; this theory has undergone important evolution and hybridization processes, and is then more thoroughly described than the other two in this chapter.

Purpose - This study aims to develop a theoretical model that specifies the most important factors hypothesised to facilitate reciprocal knowledge transfer between nationals and non-nationals in the context of workplace quotas. Design/methodology/approach - Expatriate labour is viewed as a form of contingent employment that provides firms with ready access to experienced and specialised knowledge. We argue that in a knowledge economy, the successful use of workplace quotas for nationals depends on effective management of both nationals and non-nationals. By drawing on scholarly contributions in the areas of strategic management, agency theory, knowledge management and absorptive capacity, this paper consolidates extant knowledge and proposes a new framework aimed at developing a more integrated agenda for future research. Findings - Three broad categories are posited as strategic enablers to effective knowledge management. First, senior leadership has a direct role in developing appropriate policies, promoting transparency and fostering a culture of trust and an indirect role through the establishment of incentives. Second, the influence of incentives on both knowledge management and process improvement is addressed. Third, the characteristics of each group with regard to qualifications, motivation and receptivity are discussed. Optimally, these factors work in concert to build competencies that ultimately satisfy customers and meet organisational goals. Originality/value - There is a gap in scholarly research that explicitly links important organisational and management concepts to the study of expatriate-national interactions. This article contributes to understanding how policy makers and leaders can strengthen the transformative forces that will drive successful development of human capital.

There has been a trend of large professional service firms (PSFs) to move from the partnership form of ownership to alternative ownership forms. As part of this trend large, publicly-quoted accounting companies have emerged in Australia, the US and the UK. Research on how publicly-owned PSFs, including accounting companies, are governed, whether aspects of the governance of partnership persist, why particular governance interpretive schemes and associated structures and systems are implemented and implications for performance is sparse. This study explores the interpretive scheme of governance in two Australian publicly-quoted accounting companies and finds one of the companies to have mimicked the major attributes of the partnership interpretive scheme while the other company moved to a corporate form of governance eliminating all vestiges of the partnership interpretive scheme. Governance was found to have significant implications for the performance of the companies with moving from a partnership interpretive scheme contributing to the ultimate failure of one of the companies. The cases suggest that failed experiments in the governance of publicly-owned PSFs, a relatively recently emerged ownership form in some professions, may contribute to conflicting prior findings on the implications of ownership form for the performance of PSFs. Two alternative approaches to the introduction of corporate style governance structures and systems were identified with the findings suggesting potential benefits of evolution rather than revolution. Based on the findings, a theoretical model of the interpretive scheme of governance of publicly-traded PSFs is developed including factors affecting the interpretive scheme implemented and the introduction of more corporate-like governance structures and systems, potential performance implications of PSFs moving away from a partnership interpretive scheme and the conditions and contingencies under which the relationship may hold. The paper also extends the application of agency theory to publicly-owned PSFs. (c) The Author(s) 2015

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider the way in which agency theory has crowded out other approaches to understanding the governance of modern businesses. The paper rescues the meaning and context which informed the American corporate governance reform movement originally and demonstrates how the economically predicated agency approach became dominant in academic considerations of corporate governance. Design/methodology/approach - Both primary and secondary sources were considered in a Foucauldian history of ideas approach. Findings - Other approaches to corporate governance have been pushed out of the mainstream of corporate governance discourse by an economic model which excludes many of the key issues which informed the notion originally. Practical implications - Dominant academic attitudes to corporate governance have occluded other ways in which the governance of corporations can be understood. Originality/value - Previous accounts of corporate governance have ignored the alternative approaches represented before agency theory became dominant. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to revisit Schein's proposed process-consultation approach as a general framework for management consulting in the light of some premises of the agency theory, namely the behavior induced by the asymmetry of information between the principal (leader-client) and the agent (consultant). Design/methodology/approach - Empirical research consisted of an in-depth, qualitative and phenomenological analysis of 13 cases of organizational intervention based on the practice of four senior consultants in a Canadian management consulting firm whose philosophy is based on organizational development principles and practices. All the cases chosen are characterized by a situation of strategic change as a result of governmental reforms in the healthcare sector between 2005 and 2008. Findings - Overall, the study shows that the relationship between leaders-clients and consultants varies from one stage to another throughout the consultation process and that the information asymmetry does not always benefit the agent as stated in the agency theory. The consultants are required to play diverse roles, either in combination or alternation, during the consultation process; the facilitator's role, stated as the more efficient role in Schein's perspective and the more altruistic from the point of view of the agency theory, is not necessarily the role preferred by managers. Moreover, results highlight the idiosyncrasies of healthcare organizations, namely the phenomenon of escalating indecision that comes into play during the implementation phase of change, worth taking into account in the practice and theories of management consulting. Practical implications - This analysis raises a number of questions about the general understanding and applicability of the process consultation as defined by Schein. Perhaps the four consultants have not perfectly mastered the interpersonal skills that Schein's model presupposes. One may also conclude that the model does not always respond to the expectations and needs of leaders and managers and that, for many consultants, it is difficult to adopt only one role model throughout the consulting process. One may also question its realism in a context of interventions in public organizations, with a plurality of interest groups and ambiguity of goals, where governmental reforms are pressuring managers to control costs. Originality/value - According to Eisenhardt (1989) and Hendry (2002), the agency theory offers promising avenues if combined with other theoretical anchors such as the field of organizational behavior. This study scrutinizes the leader-consultant relationship, and more specifically the type of assistance requested by healthcare leaders as they experienced strategic change and how consultants responded to these requests.

Purpose - This paper aims to explore the differing attitudes of salaried chief financial officers (CFOs) that can be associated with agency theory and stewardship theory. CFO attitudes are investigated because CFOs typically face additional agency conflict in their roles as overseers of the financial and accounting functions that are responsible for the production of numerical information used as a basis for incentive compensation. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative field study of 14 large privately held Austrian manufacturing companies was conducted. The findings rely on information retrieved from 18 semi-structured interviews conducted with individuals from these companies. Findings - The findings reveal a number of contextual factors that influence stewardship and agency attitudes of salaried CFOs. CFOs, who mainly report formally to owners, perceive more control in the hands of the owners. Short-term management appointments appear to facilitate agency-like behavior, whereas the existence of owner-managers and the typical CFO's maturity in terms of age and wealth seem to nurture stewardship behavior. Research limitations/implications - Further (quantitative) research is needed to corroborate the findings in this study, which are derived from a qualitative research approach. Further research on agency and stewardship behavior should also include the view of principal with respect to agent actions, as this paper shows that principal opinion strongly affects the way agents perceive control. Practical implications - The findings suggest that the behavior of company owners can influence and change a manager's agency or stewardship attitude. Owners who desire a culture of stewardship should set long-term goals and facilitate long-term management appointments. Moreover, owners can lower a manager's perceived level of owner control by adopting an active role in management. Originality/value - This paper is the first to analyze stewardship and agency attitude of salaried CFOs in privately held companies. It, therefore, adds to the current literature on the role of the CFO, as well as to the literature on governance issues in privately held firms. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

It is well known that firms with low price to earnings ratios (value firms) earn higher stock returns in the long term than high price to earnings firms (growth firms). This study investigates how insider ownership affects this relation. We show that when insider ownership is high, returns decline for low P/E firms and improve for high P/E firms. These findings are rationalized in the context of entrenchment and alignment of incentive effects. For low P/E firms, low stock returns reflect the inability of boards of directors and outside shareholders to influence poorly performing entrenched management. For high P/E firms, boards of directors and outside shareholders are less likely to intervene since higher returns reflect increased agency incentives for value-creating managers.

Purpose - This review paper aims to compare the various dimensions in the finance literature pertaining to the Anglo-Saxon Model (Stockholder Model) prevalent in the USA and the UK with the German Model (Stakeholder Model) of corporate governance prevalent in Germany and continental Europe. The present study identifies different strands of research on the various dimensions of these models, along with aspects of governance in emerging economies and the phenomenon of the convergence of these governance mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The literature review on corporate governance models has been carried out on the themes of internal and external governance mechanisms. The review considers agency theory along with principal-principal (PP) conflicts as the fundamental blocks explaining the need for governance structures. Findings - The traditional models of governance, along with the incorporation of PP conflicts, will result in a hybrid model inculcating the best of both the traditional models. However, convergence in the true sense may not be possible owing to fundamental differences pertaining to cultural, economic, legal and socio-economic aspects of the firm. Originality/value - This paper proposes a framework incorporating the interplay of managerial talent and controlling shareholders to understand the governance system that may be applicable for firms in emerging economies.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to draw on agency theory (AT) to develop and validate a scale to investigate customers' loyalty towards salespersons under agency problems. Especially with credence services, customer-salesperson relationships are beset by problems that stem from personal differences and conflicts of interests. Design/methodology/approach - The context is financial investment services in Indonesia. Following Churchill's (1979) procedure, initial qualitative surveys generated a pool of 44 items for the three AT asymmetries of risk, goal and information. Expert panel validation and exploratory factor analyses of a dataset (n = 429) confirmed a four-dimensional structure of 30 items. Finally, confirmatory factor analyses using a second dataset (n = 299) tested the effects of the four asymmetries on customer loyalty, and how the effects are moderated by customer trust and relationship duration. Findings - Overall, agency problems negatively influence customer loyalty. Information asymmetry has two discriminantly distinct dimension, quality and timeliness. Low trust amplifies the effects of all asymmetries, whereas relationship duration reduces the effects of only risk asymmetry. Comparison with a three-factor model shows that the four-factor scale is superior. Research limitations/implications - Service firms desiring long-term customer relationships need to be cognisant of potential asymmetries created by salespersons, and develop initiatives to minimise potential fallouts from each asymmetry. These include proper alignment of compensation structures, accurate and timely communications of product information, and matching risk profiles between customers and salespersons. Regular customer feedback regarding perceived asymmetries would also help early problem detection. Finally, the findings would inform the development of policy matters and industry best practices. Originality/value - Besides contributing to the small stream of research that applies AT to marketing, this study is the first to develop and validate an AT scale that incorporates all three asymmetries.

Purpose: This paper aims to explore organizational structure, efficiency and evolution, and its relationship to bureaucracy. A new mathematical model is utilized to generate theoretically consistent relationships between economic performance and organizational scale and structure, and to develop a taxonomy of organizational structure. Design/methodology/approach: A systems approach is used to model structural evolution and generate consistent, testable hypotheses concerning organizational sustainability and financial performance. This theoretical treatment seeks to reconcile contradictory views of bureaucracy, modeling both positive and negative impacts on performance and behavior. A variant of agency theory is used as an organizing paradigm, based on three competing organizational needs: control, autonomy and ownership of consequences. Findings: Simulations reveal that organizations evolve through five stages of development: from an entry (flat/parallel) stage, through a hybrid or mixed stage, to the massively serial (hierarchical) stage. As firms evolve, the risk/return ratio first falls as employment expands, but later rises as higher levels of hierarchy appear. Eventually, organizational complexity rises sufficiently to produce lower levels of managerial ownership of consequences and professional autonomy, as well as higher levels of control, leading to a collapse of organizational efficiency. A subtle variation of agency theory is revealed: upper-management may maximize organizational depth, increasing salary differences between levels. Originality/value: This paper uses an internally consistent, deductive framework to elucidate relationships between task complexity, skill level, industry life-cycle and firm age - providing the first known attribute-based metric for organizational complexity. This approach is reminiscent of Perrow's (1999) non-mathematical treatment of organizational systems complexity. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate employers' recruitment strategies to address distinct job-related agency problems before establishing an employment relationship. Insights from agency theory and the social embeddedness perspective are combined to hypothesize whether and why employers adapt their recruitment strategies to the job type (differing in level of discretion) for which they are externally hiring. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are empirically tested using data from a survey of 288 Dutch employers. Questions were asked about the two types of jobs. Multi-level logistic regression analysis is applied to investigate the effect of social context on the choice of recruitment strategy. In addition to that, separate analyses are conducted for the two job types, using logistic regression analysis. Findings - As predicted, employers have the tendency to use informal recruitment channels more often for jobs with high degree of discretion (i.e. managerial, professional, and specialists jobs (MPS)) than for jobs with low degree of discretion (i.e. administrative and supporting jobs). In addition, the type of information transmitted through employers' social contacts matters for their recruitment strategies. In particular, the reliable and trustworthy information from contacts with friends and family is more important for MPS jobs. This seems to be the way employers deal with the high agency costs characterizing this type of jobs. Originality/value - This study extends prior research as follows. First, while earlier studies more closely looked at why organizations use formal or informal recruitment, this study specifically focusses on the role the job type plays in the hiring process. Second, it provides an extension of agency theory by including job type in the analyses. And, third, the study examines how the networks of employers, rather than employees, affect the hiring process. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In a novel approach using agency theory, we conceptualize export pricing as price manipulations an exporter initiates to cope with the distributor-level, internal competition with the other product lines the distributor carries. We argue that suppliers can influence foreign resellers' behaviors and therefore manage export channel relationships with prices. Using a sample of 283 exporter-importer relationships, we uncover the export price manipulations used to cope with internal competition, and we examine their impact on the exporter economic performance. We show that the performance effect of this pricing policy is achieved through the adequate role performance of the importer. Moreover, using a small but rare dyadic data set, we offer an additional test of the effectiveness of this form of pricing. Finally, by comparing the results of our study to exporters' practice we show how they tend to overuse price discounts to motivate their overseas distributors. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite their alleged communication, control, coordination, and learning-related benefits, little is known of factors that affect language policies in multinational corporations (MNCs). In this paper, I draw on agency theory to focus on the effect of MNC subsidiary top manager nationality on subsidiary language policy. Specifically, I hypothesize that subsidiaries with expatriate top managers have more language policies than subsidiaries with host country national top managers. In addition, I hypothesize that subsidiary age and size moderate the effect between subsidiary top manager nationality and language policy, such that older and larger subsidiaries with expatriate top managers have more language policies than younger and smaller subsidiaries. Survey data from 547 subsidiaries in Japan provide support for these hypotheses. Theoretical implications and suggestions for future research are provided. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study provides an overview of the research in the field of agency theory and corporate governance. This research is aimed to extend existing research contributes to the agency theory literature and particularly, the growing body of literature of corporate governance mechanisms. The agency theory suggests that corporate governance can reduce agency costs which in turn leads to improved firm performance. The problem that occurs is known as the principal-agent problem where two parties, the principal and the agent. The separation of ownership and control in the open financial system can result in the agency problem between management and shareholders. The separation of control and ownership in corporations has caused agency problems and a series of corporate governance mechanisms have been implemented to mitigate them. The primary objective of corporate governance can play an important role in minimizing the agency problem and ensuring that management's interests are aligned with those of shareholders. The agency theory implies that the board of directors is elected to manage the potential conflict of interests between management and shareholders. (c) Medwell Journals, 2015.

Using resource-based logic as well as stewardship and agency theories, we address a paradox when governing young firms-how to design governance structures to encourage top managers to generate rents while minimizing the threat of rent appropriation. Some corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) enhance empowerment and encourage managers to generate rents for the firm. But these CGMs may also allow managers to appropriate rents excessively. The solution appears to be combining CGMs that empower managers to generate rents with CGMs that either (a) motivate stewardship behavior or (b) reduce information asymmetry between management and other stakeholders. Our empirical analyses provide substantial support for our predictions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the implications on former accounting firm partners becoming employees of a publicly owned accounting corporation, the responses of the former partners and impacts on the acquiring company. Partners of accounting and other professional service firms selling their firms to publicly owned companies often remain with the acquiring company as employees and receive company shares as consideration for their firms. Agency theory suggests public ownership will result in changes to the roles of senior professionals with potential resistance and motivation consequences. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a case study approach involving the review of publicly available information and interviews with executives and senior professionals of an Australian publicly owned accounting company, Stockford Limited. Findings: The Stockford case indicates that selling their firm to a publicly owned company can have significant negative implications for accounting firm partners. The former partners struggled to adapt to their new roles as senior professional employees and shareholders. Their responses had significant impacts on company performance, which ultimately contributed to the collapse of the company, thus reflecting the power senior professionals retain regardless of the change of ownership form. Research limitations/implications: Care is required when generalising findings of a single case to other professions and other geographic jurisdictions. Practical implications: This paper has significant implications for entrepreneurs and executives consolidating professional service firms, partners considering selling their firms and investors in publicly owned professional service firms. Originality/value: Despite the emergence of publicly owned accounting and other professional service companies and the importance and power of senior professionals in professional service firms, this is the first study to explore the implications on senior professionals of selling their firms to public companies.

This study examines how organizational form (corporate or franchised store) and local market characteristics (competition, size and risk of sanctions) influence retail stores' likelihood of selling alcohol to minors. Drawing on agency theory, we hypothesize that franchised stores are more likely than corporate stores to sell alcohol to minors. We also examine whether local market competition, risk of sanctions, and market size influence the relationship between franchising and alcohol sales to minors. We test the hypotheses with data collected by minors attempting to purchase alcohol in retail stores. The results offer partial support to the theoretical predictions and have implications for retail chains and regulators. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The intellectual underpinning of much contemporary executive pay practice is to be found in agency theory, made famous by various scholars in the 1970s. Yet standard agency theory has been found wanting in various respect and has been criticised for supporting pay practices which may have contributed to the financial crisis. The Economic Psychology of Incentives proposes a revised theory of agency, drawing on ideas from behavioural economics and built on more robust assumptions about human behaviour than the standard principal-agent model. Incorporating evidence from a unique empirical study of executives from around the world, the book explains the mechanisms which link the performance of an individual senior executive, the performance of other executives who are part of the same top-management team, and corporate performance. The book proposes new design principles for executive pay, but also explains the difficulties in changing current executive pay practices. (c) Alexander Pepper 2015.

This chapter is based on research (Van Meerveld, 2012; Van Meerveld et al., 2012) and the practical experiences of the second and third authors of this chapter in facilitating forward commitment procurement projects conducted as part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) Innovation for Sustainability Programme and the Low Carbon Building (LCB) Healthcare Network. Although the application of forward commitment procurement (FCP) is limited to a few pilot projects, the outcomes demonstrated are most promising in that they have delivered innovative solutions into the market. Two of the case studies have led to the development of new and innovative solutions and one is progressing towards early adoption of an innovative solution. The chapter applies a theoretical framework in order to examine in more detail how the FCP methodology works, and to provide insights into how the process could be improved and replicated. Its focus is on the role of the market engagement phase of the FCP process. The chapter adopts a case study approach following Yin (2009), and is aimed at answering the following question: What are the effects of adopting the forward commitment procurement framework on the risks perceived by public sector customers and suppliers in projects concerning public procurement for innovation? Procurement involves transactions which involve agencies in the form of customers and suppliers. Therefore, agency theory and transaction cost economics are used to develop the theoretical framework.

Salespersons represent an important and challenging set of employees for organizational management. Given frequently high autonomy levels and varied job roles, boundary spanning agents have ample opportunity and motivation to modify/ignore organizational directives. Based on a multi-theoretical perspective, this research sets forth a three-dimensionalconceptualization of directive modification intentions and develops and empirically tests a scale designed to better explainthis phenomenon while empirically validating its occurrence. Results indicate that boundary spanners have three distinctand relatively stable motivations for modifying/ignoring organizational directives, including customer-, organization-, andself-focused motivations, and that each motivation may potentially relate differently to important antecedent and outcomevariables. Managerial and theoretical implications are discussed. (c) 2015 Taylor & Francis.

Nonprofit organizations play a role in the creation of a society that is civil, and it is an important one that neither the state nor for-profit organizations undertake. This raises the question of governance and accountability, which is often addressed by looking to agency-based models from the private sector. The acknowledged problem is that the agency's notion of owners does not translate well to nonprofits. Adapting the concept of leasehold (wherein the managers and organization operate with broad autonomy, using resources supplied by supporters in exchange for the promise that specific societal value will be created, and are accountable for doing so) allows for a more flexible and responsive arrangement. It also suggests a mechanism whereby many independent nonprofits taking multiple approaches help civil society evolve. (c) 2015 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore product adoption beliefs and actions of a large retail food organization with both corporate-owned stores and privately held franchise stores. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used a case study approach involving survey data collection from 190 corporate-owned and licensed retail outlets that were members of a large, single organization. Ordinary least squares regression and mean differences (t-tests) were used to test the data. Findings were elaborated upon based upon structured interviews. Findings - Corporate-owned retail outlets invested heavily in food safety innovation, while franchised retail outlets pursued minimal investment to retain product flexibility. The level of adoption is contingent upon ownership structure, as well as institutional forces emanating from the corporate environment, the customer, and peer organizations. Research limitations/implications - The findings offer greater insight into methodological issues associated with measurement of new product adoption in particular. The authors have shown that it is critical for researchers to clarify the level of analysis of the study. Quantitative survey analysis revealed both safety and economic motivations to be desirable issues in product adoption considerations. However, when quantitative and qualitative results were combined, very different outcomes were realized as ownership structure differences appear to dominate product adoption decisions. Therefore, when conducting plural organizational form research, the data gathering efforts must be carefully undertaken to ensure that critical drivers of phenomena explored are not overlooked. Practical implications - Adoption of new product adoption involves the complex interplay between ownership structure/control, economic cost/benefit, managerial choice, and societal norms. Often, organizational research relating to adoption of new processes and innovations collects individual-level data. However, this study shows that adoption decisions occur at multiple levels and that the ownership/structural context must be considered. Social implications - The study has implications from social innovation/responsibility perspectives. Recent press regarding food safety has put pressure on food processing establishments to consider methods of reducing food safety breaches. No doubt, this has alerted the consumer to potential risks in food processing and influenced their preferences in favor of food safety innovations. Nonetheless, perceptions of the importance of "safety" can be interpreted in a variety of ways, leading to differingcourses of action. Interviews with corporate-level executives revealed that they preferred both corporate-owned and franchised retail outlets adopt case ready (CR) meats to stem safety concerns. Yet, this aspiration diffused throughout the organization differently. Originality/value - Multiple organizational structure forms operating within the same organizational entity, or "plural form" organizations, offer unique opportunities for examination. Applying various theoretical lenses, including agency theory, the resource-based theory, and institutional theory, the authors offer rationale for why different structural types within the same corporate entity may differ in their beliefs and actions concerning product safety, cost, and adoption.

A number of family business researches affirm benefits of family involvement to the business while some of other studies assure only detriments of family involvement. When comparative studies of family businesses begin to surface on the family involvement in business, there is that irritating question on what effect is brought about by family involvement to the business. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore business advantages and disadvantages generated by family involvement in businesses in Sri Lanka. The present study attempted to address the above knowledge gap, using qualitative research approach and multiple case studies as the strategy of inquiry. Purposive sampling technique was used to select both cases and respondents. Privately held, successfully conducted four family businesses were selected as cases and, existing business owner and one family related manager from each case were taken as respondents. Data was collected mainly via semi-structured, in depth interviews, observations, and secondary documents. Data collection from interviews consisted of 15 interviews with 09 different people from four cases. Before the data analysis, coding and categorization of respondents' views from interviews helped to identify common patterns and themes from both within the case and across cases. The analysis was carried out in the light of Agency Theory and resulted in a rich understanding of business advantages and disadvantages of family involvement in businesses in Sri Lanka. The findings of this study indicated that the agency cost is created not only on business matters but also on family matters. Further, findings revealed that agency benefit also can be obtained by family business by handling the family matters carefully in line with business matters. Findings of this study clearly indicated that an extension to Agency Theory is required to explain owner agent relationship in family businesses.

Purpose - This paper aims to assess the impact of the presence/absence of risk management practices on the risk of merger and acquisition (M&A) failure. Design/methodology/approach - An agency theoretic perspective is adopted, along with a mixed-methods approach to study managerial complexity beyond simply "good" and "bad". The focus is on an agency conflicts. Findings - The authors first present an integrated framework that classifies managerial behaviour and risk management, where M&A bids can become vehicles for maximising managerial benefits rather than shareholder value. The authors proceed to consider M&A activity that benefits both managers and shareholders in the presence of risk management strategies. Research limitations/implications - The paper highlights the benefits of multiple paradigms and research paths that address dimensions captured by an agency theoretic perspective. Practical implications - The authors regard this paper as having particular significance in that the global financial crisis has impactedM&Aactivities and objectives, shifting the employment and related risks faced by managers. Originality/value - The paper suggests future research paths to advance the understanding of the complex behaviour of managers involved inM&Aactivities that go beyond the classification of "good" and "bad" managers.

In the last few decades, policy makers around the world have focused on corporate governance reform since the Asian financial crisis and scandals in the United States such as the Enron debacle. In addition, there is no doubt that banks have significant position in the welfare of any economy. Corporate governance involves in how banks' businesses and affairs are governed by its board of directors that raises a fundamental question of how this could affect banks' financial performance. The focus of this research is to investigate the relationships between some of the corporate governance variables that are related to the board of directors on the financial performance of these banks working in the Egyptian market. Thirteen banks that are listed in the Egyptian Stock Exchange were selected with data collected for the period from 2011 till 2013 which is the post Egyptian revolution era. Research analyses adopted in this study are descriptive, correlation and regression analyses to test the research hypotheses. Findings of this research provide evidence that some of these variables such as board independence, foreign board members ratio, women board members ratio and board educational ratio have significant effect on the financial performance of these banks; however, board size and CEO qualities do not have any significant effect on banks' performance. The research reaches some implications that are important to different stakeholders on practical and academic levels. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All right rserved.

Accounting standard-setters suggest a normative framework to measure value creation. They are opposed to the fact companies try to escape this framework, as they fear confusion and a lack of comparability among users. This paper aims to highlight value creation representation and to identify the determinants of its disclosure. At first, we interview a sample of companies' managers to identify the information disclosed on value creation. Then, a quantitative study examines the determinants of information disclosed on the value creation in the Annual Report of 84 SBF120 index firms in 2010. Three disclosure scores are used to consider the presentation, visibility and recurrence disclosures. Thhey are then aggregated into a global score. Thhe results show that performance, leverage, ownership structure, cross-listing and firm's size are determining factors. However, the influence of these variables depends on the dimensions of disclosures.

The joint venture (JV) form of business organisation has become a critical part of corporate strategy in worldwide markets, but its high failure rate presents a great challenge to potential investors. Using an inductive case study method, the authors explored the question of how the organisational structure of JV parent companies impacts the joint venture project's risk profile. We found that there can be sub-units or individuals within an organisation whose goals are incongruent with the goals of the parent companies and their joint venture projects who can act against the JV project without consequence due to organisational injustice and agency issues. These sub-units can create risks and uncertainties and undermine cooperation and trust between the parent companies in the joint venture project. To increase the likelihood of success of future JV projects, the authors combined organisation, stakeholder, and agency theories to propose a conception framework in which parent companies were defined as the primary stakeholders and their functional departments as the secondary stakeholders. The JV project team can use this framework to analyse the organisation structure and control mechanisms of each parent company, to classify the functional departments and their employees as positive or negative secondary stakeholders, and to identify their impact on project risk and uncertainty.

In light of the growing complexity of globally dispersed, multi-tier supply chains, the involvement of first-tier suppliers has become instrumental in the quest for achieving sustainability compliance along the supply chain. We describe this new responsibility as the double agency role. We employ agency and institutional theory arguments to explore the conditions under which first-tier suppliers will act as agents who fulfill the lead firm's sustainability requirements (i.e., the primary agency role) and implement these requirements in their suppliers' operations (i.e., the secondary agency role). The findings from three in-depth case studies embedded in different institutional contexts highlight the importance for lead firms to incentivize each agency role separately and to reduce information asymmetries, particularly at the second-tier level. In addition, our inductive analysis reveals several contingency factors that influence the coupling of the secondary agency role of the first-tier supplier. These factors include resource availability at the first-tier supplier's firm, the lead firm's focus on the triple-bottom-line dimension (i.e., environmental or social), the lead firm's use of power, and the lead firm's internal alignment of the sustainability and purchasing function. We integrate our findings in a conceptual framework that advances the research agenda on multi-tier sustainable supply chains, and we subsequently outline the practical implications of assigning the double agency role to first tier suppliers.

Based on a survey and content analysis of 462 peer-reviewed academic articles over the period 1990-2014, this article reviews theories related to the external drivers of corporate social responsibility (CSR) (such as stakeholder theory and resource-dependence theory) and the internal drivers of CSR (such as resource-based view [RBV] and agency theory) that have been utilized to explain CSR. The article discusses the main tenets of the principal theoretical perspectives and their application in CSR research. Going beyond previous reviews that have largely failed to investigate theory applications in CSR scholarship, this article stresses the importance of theory-driven explanations of CSR and the complementarity of different theories. The article demonstrates that the current mainstream theorizing of CSR is dominated by theories related to the external drivers of CSR and is less developed with regard to the internal dynamics. The article outlines several productive avenues for future research: the need for multi-theory studies and more research at multiple levels of analysis, particularly at the individual level of analysis. It suggests that CSR scholarship can benefit from combining theoretical insights from a range of established theoretical lenses such as institutional theory and RBV, and can gain new insights from theoretical lenses such as Austrian economics and micro-level psychological theories.

Agency theory draws attention to certain behaviors of CEOs and boards that, in aggregate, create losses for society. The empirical literature, however, characterized by contentious findings, suggests that the current form of agency theory is not supporting a clear understanding of these behaviors and their costs. We propose a change to one assumption, with potentially profound implications. Expanding on the assumption of narrow self-interest underlying agency theory, we apply an empirically wellestablished refinement that self-interest is bounded by norms of reciprocity and fairness. The resulting logic is that perceptions of fairness mediate the relationships derived from standard agency theory through positively and negatively reciprocal behaviors. This mediating variable provides a parsimonious new way to help explain extreme results found in prior studies. Rather than aiming to limit CEOs' self-serving behaviors, boards that apply these arguments improve social welfare by initiating positive reciprocity and avoiding unnecessary, welfare-reducing "revenge" behaviors.

Agency and stewardship theories are prominent perspectives to examine myriad issues within family firms. Although considered opposing theories, both address the same phenomena: the individual-level behaviors and firm-level governance mechanisms that predict organizational outcomes. Accordingly, we review and synthesize these theories concurrently, using the concepts of behavior and governance as our organizing framework. Our review encompasses 107 family firm articles grounded in agency and/or stewardship theory, published between 2000 and 2014 in 24 journals across several disciplines. Additionally, we identify future research areas that provide scholars opportunities to push theoretical boundaries and offer further insights into the family firm. (c) 2015, (c) The Author(s) 2015.

This study looks at the relationship between project governance and project success from an agency theory and stewardship theory perspective. For that project governance was operationalized respectively as a) the extent of shareholder versus stakeholder orientation and b) the extent of behavior versus outcome control, both exercised by the parent organization over its project. A cross-sectional, worldwide online survey yielded 254 usable responses. Factor and regression analyses indicate that project success correlates with increasing stakeholder orientation of the parent organization, while the types of control mechanisms do not correlate with project success. Results support the importance of stewardship approaches in the context of successful projects.

This study takes a conceptual theory building approach to develop a framework for managing supplier sustainability risk-the adverse impact on a buying organization from a supplier's social or environmental misconduct. Using anecdotal evidence and the literature, we present four distinct risk management strategies that supply managers adopt: risk avoidance, monitoring-based risk mitigation, collaboration-based risk mitigation, and risk acceptance. Drawing on agency and resource dependence theories, we study how the interactions of two key risk management predictors-that is, the supply managers' perceived risk and the buyer-supplier dependence structure-affect supply managers' strategy choice. Specifically, we propose that a collaborative-based mitigation strategy, involving direct interaction and solution development with the suppliers, is selected by supply managers in a high perceived risk-buyer dominant context. In a low perceived risk-buyer dominant context, however, a monitoring-based mitigation strategy is preferred. When the buyer and the supplier are not dependent on each other and there is a low perceived risk, the supply managers accept the risk by taking no actions, whereas in a high perceived risk-independent context the supply managers would avoid the risk by terminating the relationship with the supplier. We conclude the study by describing the theoretical contributions and managerial implications of the study as well as the avenues for future research. (c) 2016 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.

The ownership of corporations has been studied in multiple disciplines and using diverse theoretical frameworks for several decades. Despite a wealth of research, both research gaps and contradictory findings are common. This is partly due to the fragmentation of the foci of individual studies. We synthesize the work done to date through a content analysis of 145 articles and 523 effect size estimates. On the basis of this review, we develop an integrated perspective to understand how institutional, government, family, executive, and board ownership affect a variety of firm outcomes. We conclude by offering new theoretical and contextual directions to better understand the role of ownership in shaping firm outcomes. (c) 2016, (c) The Author(s) 2016.

In prior research which explores the relationship between organizational slack and corporate social performance (CSP) it is implicitly assumed that slack is homogeneous and positively affects CSP. In this study we build on recent research which argues that slack is heterogeneous and can be conceptualized as financial, human resources, and innovational in nature. We view the slack-CSP relationship from both organizational and agency theory perspectives. We propose that different slack conceptualizations and the contrary assumptions of aforementioned theories hold divergent implications for CSP. We test our hypotheses on a longitudinal sample of public corporations in the United States and confirm this divergent impact. Our results suggest that the relationship between organizational slack and CSP is more complex than previously understood. We discuss the implications of our findings for the slack-resource hypothesis of CSP. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Agency theory-grounded research on boards of directors and firm legitimacy has historically viewed CEO power as de-legitimating, often taking this fact for granted in theorizing about external assessors' evaluations of a firm. With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be. Data from 151 U.S. semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms over a 10-year period generally support our predictions. (c) 2016 Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose - Theories develop over time and are influenced by both events and people. Looking primarily at the applications between contracting principal-agent relationships, the purpose of this paper is to explore how agency theory emerged from a number of economic and social developments. In doing so, the authors explain how this once dominant theory comes up short regarding varying realms of entrepreneurship as well as with multiple modern business phenomena. Design/methodology/approach - The authors first present a brief overview of agency theory. Second, the authors identify major events and people and address how they impacted the development of agency theory. Third, the authors provide insights on agency theory across three contexts (strategic entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, and family business). Implications, limitations, and future research directions are then offered. Findings - The authors provide a deeper understanding of agency theory, thus broadening its underpinnings and enabling readers to more readily understand why agency theory is limited in its explanation of certain and modern business phenomena. The authors find that some of the seminal influences to agency theory are quite dated which has limited its explanatory power in terms of the modern day business and with more recent disciplines such as entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications - The authors are limited by their choices of major events that influenced agency theory at the expense of not being able to include everything that may have impacted the theory over time. These limitations, however, are offset by the research implications. As the authors highlight the underpinning of agency theory, the authors subsequently provide scholars and practitioners with five primary boundary conditions, each of which are in need of attention for agency theory to maintain relevant explanatory power. Originality/value - A deeper understanding of agency theory can be gained by looking at its underpinnings. By presenting numerous principal-agent conflicts and demonstrating areas in which it has fallen short (i.e. entrepreneurship and more recent business phenomenon), we shed light on the obstacles agency theory must overcome in order to maintain its position as a prominent theory.

Purpose: While anecdotal evidence suggests that performance-based contracts (PBCs) may foster innovation in buyer-supplier relationships, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms is limited to date. The purpose of this paper is to draw on transaction cost economics and agency theory to develop a theoretical model that explains how PBCs may lead to innovation. Design/methodology/approach: Using data on 106 inter-organizational relationships from the Dutch maintenance industry, the authors investigate how the two main features of PBCs - low-term specificity and performance-based rewards - affect incremental and radical innovation. Findings: The authors find that term specificity has an inverse-U-shaped effect on incremental innovation and a non-significant negative effect on radical innovation. Furthermore, pay-for-performance has a stronger positive effect on radical innovation than on incremental innovation. The findings suggest that in pursuit of incremental innovation, organizations should draft contracts with low, but not too low, term specificity and incorporate performance-based rewards. Radical innovation may be achieved by rewarding suppliers for their performance only. Originality/value: The findings suggest that in pursuit of incremental innovation, organizations should draft contracts with low, but not too low, term specificity and incorporate performance-based rewards. Radical innovation requires rewarding suppliers for their performance only. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: By revisiting the agency theory literature, this paper aims to both incrementally advance historical viewpoints and reveal four prominent influences on agency theory: Weber and Simon, The Great Depression, Cooperation and the Chicago School. This is critical given that understanding the history behind the authors' major theoretical lenses is fundamental to using these theories to explain various phenomena. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a plethora of archival sources and following the influence-mapping approach used by other management history scholars, this manuscript synthesizes historical accounts and archival information to provide a clearer picture of the major historical influences in the formation of agency theory. Findings: We shed light on four areas related to management history that helped propel agency theory. Whereas past scholarship has not recognised them as influencers, we find and show how the industrial revolution, unionization, the stock exchange and other management approaches all played a role in the development of agency theory's core tenants. Originality/value: We extend upon the influential people and events that shaped agency theory, thus providing a fuller understanding of the theory's usefulness. Moreover, we fill in gaps enabling scholars to better understand the context in which the core tenants of agency theory were developed. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Why are some entrepreneurs able to start a new firm more quickly than others in the venture creation process? Drawing on pecking order and agency theory, this study investigates how start-up capital structure influences the time to either new firm founding or quitting the start-up process. The temporal aspect of the start-up process is one that is often discussed, but rarely studied. Therefore, we utilize competing risk and Cox regression event history analysis on a nationally representative sample of US entrepreneurs to investigate how start-up capital structure impacts the time in gestation to particular kinds of start-up outcomes. Our findings suggest that external equity has an appreciable impact on new firm emergence over time, and that the percentage of ownership held by the founders attenuates the benefits of external equity.

This study examines the influence of managerial ownership on firm agency costs among listed firms in Bangladesh. This is an institutional setting that features a mixture of agency costs. This institutional setting has a concentration of ownership by managers, but the firms are not solely owned by managers. The extant literature suggests that the sacrifice of wealth by the principal and potential costs associated with monitoring the agents is known as the agency cost. This study uses three measures of agency cost: the 'expense ratio', the 'Q-free cash flow interaction', and the 'asset utilisation ratio'. The finding of the study is that managerial ownership reduces the firm agency cost only under the 'asset utilisation ratio' measure of agency cost; this is robust with regard to a number of robustness tests. Furthermore, the non-linearity tests suggest that the convergence of interest is evident with very high and low levels of managerial ownership. The entrenchment effect by the owners is evident at moderate levels of managerial ownership. Although there has been great scepticism among management researchers on the validity of agency theory, overall, the findings of this study do not reject the validity of agency theory. Given that the entrenchment by managers is evident at certain levels of ownership and that the agency problem may still exist between insiders and outsiders, legislative guidelines for controlling share ownership may be required.

Purpose - Maintaining cooperation and avoiding opportunism is essential for a healthy venture capitalist (VC) - entrepreneur relationship. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the role of control and trust for developing a cooperative VC-entrepreneur relationship in an agency environment in the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a multiple case study approach to investigate ten VC-entrepreneur dyads. It uses data collected from both primary and secondary sources. Content analysis was used as the data treatment technique. Findings - The empirical evidence indicates that VC-entrepreneur relationships emerging in the early stages suffer from low agency risks and use more of relational mechanisms to curb opportunism and develop cooperation while relationships at an advanced stage suffer from higher agency risks and employ more of control mechanisms to address it. Practical implications - The findings can be utilized to enhance cooperation in VC-entrepreneur relationship by identifying the appropriate context to apply relational or control mechanisms, which would eventually lead to better performance of the venture. Originality/value - This distinction results in the development of a theoretical model which shows how the dual governance mechanisms of control and trust interact with one another to affect confidence in partner cooperation as an entrepreneurial venture raises multiple rounds of venture capital across various stages. The data collected from Indian VC-entrepreneur dyads offers a rich description of the relationship dynamics across the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem.

In the public sector, the strategic quest for IT-based innovation often starts by hiring a successful private sector CIO and hoping his or her prior experience will transfer. However this often ignores the existence and influence of other entities and IT governance structures that form the innovation ecosystem. Applying the legal view of agency theory to the U.S. state innovation ecosystem and using a crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (csQCA) approach, we investigate factors that are associated with public sector IT-based innovation. We find that CIO characteristics, structural oversight mechanisms, CIO relationships with authorities, and the state environment combine to form configurations that lead to both high and low performance.

Because security analysts, who serve as brokers between public firms and investors, arrive at their forecasts by incorporating guidance from managers, there is immense pressure on the managers to meet or beat analyst earnings forecasts; moreover, investors reward (penalize) firms for exceeding (missing) analyst forecasts. Reasoning that decisions taken in response to analyst forecasts involve discretionary budgets, the authors study four contingent conditions under which quarterly analyst forecasts drive unanticipated adjustments to advertising and R&D budgets, and the long-term consequences of these budgetary changes. The choice of contingent conditions is related to agency theory-driven concepts of monitoring and bonding costs. Results from a panel data set of 515 firms and a hierarchical Bayesian model that provides firm-level coefficients show that both artificially imposed incentives on managers (monitoring costs) and personal career management concerns (bonding costs) moderate the extent to which managers react to analyst forecasts. Specifically, (1) bonus versus equity proportion of CEO compensation enhances the likelihood of managers reacting to analyst forecasts with unanticipated decreases in advertising and R&D budgets; (2) output experience of CEOs decreases this likelihood; (3) throughput experience of CEOs increases this likelihood; and (4) increasing marketing and R&D intensity decreases this likelihood. The authors also find that the unanticipated adjustments in advertising and R&D budgets adversely affect long-term firm returns and risk. (c) 2016, American Marketing Association.

Buyer-supplier relationships are often framed as principal-agent relationships, based on contractual arrangements that temporarily align the goals of both parties. The underlying notion is that the relationship between buyers and suppliers is adversarial in nature and that the supplier, acting in the role of the agent, will take advantage of the principal if not sufficiently controlled. We propose that there is empirically also another type of partnership which reflects the propositions of stewardship theory. According to this theory, suppliers are motivated to work autonomously towards contractually agreed objectives. We analyse how the agency and stewardship theories differ regarding their descriptions of autonomy, motivation, identification, authority, stakeholder orientation and short- versus long-term collaboration. We analyse the case of a first-tier supplier and four second-tier suppliers situated in Turkey in the area of Istanbul which collaborate with the aim of improving their social and environmental performance. The results show that the relationship between the partners in this case has become more collaborative over time and can now be described in terms of stewardship theory rather than in terms of agency theory. We conclude that the distinction between agency and stewardship relationships is empirically meaningful in the context of supplier-buyer relationships and adds a new aspect to our understanding of how to achieve more sustainable supply chains.

Manuscript type: Empirical. Research question/issue: We empirically examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. Because campaigns for increased gender diversity may be driven by either economic efficiency or social legitimacy concerns, we condition our analysis on activists' motivations for achieving their objectives. Research findings/insights: Based on a sample of US S&P 1500 firms over 1997-2011, we find that female board representation and board independence are negatively associated with the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. We further document that financially motivated activists are more likely to target firms with extremely low female board representation than are socially motivated activists. Targeted firms significantly increase their female board representation in the two-year period following proposal initiation, relative to that of a matched sample of non-targeted firms, with no significant differences observed across activist motivations. Theoretical/academic implications: Our findings provide empirical support for the effectiveness of shareholder activism in shaping corporate governance. Our work also suggests that shareholder activists' underlying motivations are an important conditioning variable in governance research, with both agency theory and institutional theory providing insight into differing motivations. Practitioner/policy implications: Our findings suggest that shareholder proposals are an effective mechanism for increasing board diversity, irrespective of activist motivations. However, we note that mean female board representation for both targeted and non-targeted firms remains far below the level of representation sought by various activist groups. For policy-makers, this suggests that legislative action may be necessary to achieve these corporate board diversity goals in the US. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Using principal-agent theories, this study examined differences in the perceptions of nonprofit chief executive officers (CEOs) and board chairs on key governance aspects, including board performance, leadership, satisfaction with diversity, and board meetings. Using data from the CEOs and board chairs of 474 nonprofit organizations, we found statistically significant differences in the governance perceptions of these leaders of nonprofit organizations. The findings provide support for an agency theory explanation about the differing interests of principals (board chairs) and agents (CEOs). The findings suggest that these two sets of nonprofit actors frequently operate from different perspectives, potentially affecting the governance of their organizations.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper addresses the effect of having multiple large shareholders on shareholder protection. More specifically, we examine to what extent this effect depends on whether such large shareholders are beneficiary or fiduciary. Research Findings/Insights: Analyzing longitudinal, hand-collected data covering Swiss listed companies, we find that having several large shareholders leads to overall higher shareholder protection (i.e. adoption of more formal corporate governance mechanisms). This is because large shareholders have an interest in putting more formal governance mechanisms in place when there is another large shareholder that might try to extract rents at the expense of others. Moreover, we find that this effect is driven by the presence of several beneficiary shareholders, i.e. shareholders that invest their own wealth in the company in contrast to dispersed ownership and fiduciary shareholders, i.e. shareholders acting on behalf of others. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Building on recent developments in agency theory, this paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by empirically showing that potential "principal-principal" conflicts among large shareholders lead to overall better shareholder protection in terms of more formal governance mechanisms being adopted. This finding contrasts with situations in which there is only one large shareholder that does not have an interest in strengthening formal corporate governance. Our findings imply, however, that the characteristics of the large shareholders matter: Fiduciary shareholders in the Swiss setting are mostly passive buy-and-hold shareholders and therefore do not engage extensively in improving shareholder protection. Beneficiary shareholders, in contrast, directly intervene in the governance of the firm (i.e. governance by voice), so that in the presence of multiple beneficiary shareholders, more formal governance mechanisms help to monitor not only management but the other large shareholders as well. In addition, more formal governance mechanisms serve as a platform to coordinate their diverging objectives. Practitioner Implications: We demonstrate the influence of a second (or several) large beneficiary shareholder(s), on corporate governance and the benefit to all shareholders. In addition, we propose the strengthening of governance mechanisms as a platform to reconcile conflicting interests among prominent shareholders and contribute to the debate on the allocation of certain voting privileges to long-term shareholders.

Purpose - Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) serves as the essential cross-functional process for organizations to match supply in the form of production, inventory, and procurement with customer demand. Given recent studies revealing that S&OP is ineffective for most firms, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the critical antecedents of effective S&OP. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on agency theory and stewardship theory, the authors develop and test a conceptual model that includes organizational integration, organizational priorities, standardized processes, and organizational engagement. The authors apply partial least squares structural equation modeling of survey data from S&OP practitioners to test the model. Findings - The results confirm the relationships among S&OP antecedents. Organizational integration positively influences a standardized S&OP process, and both the S&OP process and prioritization lead to stronger organizational S&OP engagement. Ultimately, organizational S&OP engagement is positively linked to enhanced operational, market, and profitability outcomes. Practical implications - The findings create a strong practical foundation for executing S&OP. The results also reveal a formal process for operationalizing the link between organizational integration and firm performance that is espoused but not detailed in existing literature. Originality/value - Existing research supports the potential performance impacts of S&OP but has yet to validate how to specifically operationalize S&OP. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

CEO succession is a key theoretical and empirical issue in the fields of organizations and strategic management. Previous studies investigating the influences and effects of CEO succession mostly focus on post-succession contexts. This study focuses on the pre-succession context and offers a comprehensive theoretical framework based on agency theory and stewardship theory. Specifically, this study empirically tests the influence of several pre-succession factors on the founding CEO's decision to either sell the family firm or hire a professional manager as a successor. The results show that executive compensation schemes and industry dynamism separately influence the degree of stewardship through perceived pay premium and industrial growth potential. The findings help explain CEO succession decision-making in family firms, and provide empirical evidence for the incentive mechanisms between executive compensation schemes, industry dynamism, and professional managers' stewardship behaviors. This study broadens agency theory, stewardship theory, and upper echelons theory's explanation of CEO succession decision-making in family firms. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study aims to understand the antecedents of export performance at the firm level. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, the authors investigate how the board composition determines the export competitiveness of the firms operating in an emerging country from the point of view of corporate governance mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations. The separation of chairman of board of directors and chief executive officer (CEO) positions has significantly positive impact on export performance. On the other hand, the authors find no support for the position that inside director professional representation neither reduce nor increase all measures of export performance of firms. In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Findings: Using data from 221 exporting firms for four years (2007-2010), the authors find that there is a significantly positive relationship between board size and all measures of export performance, while a higher presence of outside directors on the board is a negatively associated with export performance, consistently with expectations.

In other words, the convergence with Western practices and consistently with agency theory's claims is evident for both board size and CEO duality. However, the effects of inside professional and outside directors are no consistent with agency theorists' expectations. Research limitations/implications: Export performance is one of the most widely researched areas within international marketing research but least reached topic of management. However, exporting continues to be an important mode of internationalization for multinational companies, especially operating an emerging economy. This study is one of the first studies on the impact of governance factors such as board structure on only export performance rather than overall (firm) performance in light of international management. In other words, the study of the determinants of exports in the context of an emerging economy is an important contribution to the literature, given that our understanding of how the board composition determines the export competitiveness from the point of view of firms operating in an emerging country such as Turkey. Moreover, this research investigates this relationship at objective export performance dimensions using primary data set from listed and non-listed export firms. Practical implications: The current study offered in-depth information to multinational companies that aim to gain a competitive exporting advantage in Turkey. Further, the results of this study give managers an opportunity to see the reasons behind the success of the exporting firms from the point of view of corporate governance mechanism. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors contribute to this recent stream of research providing evidence on the effects of governance mechanism on the export performance from the point of view of emerging countries. Building on agency theory but taking into account emerging market settings and institutional differences, and international management, the authors provide a new framework that models the linkages between board composition and export performance. This work helps us to gain a deeper understanding of how board dynamics contribute to the internalization of firms. Research in this area has been sparse, although some studies have linked governance with export intensity. In this effort, the authors differentiate from previous studies in several ways.

Deadlines are common in product development and are often felt to be too harsh-many development efforts are still worth continuing at the time of mandated termination. We examine the value of deadlines from the agency-theoretic perspective. We consider a firm that pays an agent to lead product development activities. The chance of success depends on the viability of the project and the effort of the agent. As the project proceeds without success, doubts grow as to whether the project is viable. To motivate continued effort, the firm must promise the agent a generous reward if success is achieved during the late stage of development. However, rewarding late success undermines effort incentives in the early stage. The firm may find it more profitable to impose a hard, early deadline to eliminate the agent's dynamic incentive to procrastinate. We derive conditions under which the firm should impose such deadlines. (c) 2016 INFORMS.

By investigating managerial objectives, we test the simultaneous need for both control (agency theory) and collaboration (stewardship theory) in public and non-profit governance. We construct a discrete choice experiment to elicit preferences of managers in Belgian public and non-profit nursing homes. The results confirm that boards of nursing homes may experience pressure to simultaneously control and collaborate with their managers, thereby suggesting that agency and stewardship theory can be combined into a more general internal governance framework. We conclude by providing some policy implications to improve public and non-profit governance. (c) 2014 Taylor & Francis.

Empirical findings on the relationship between CEO shareholdings and earnings manipulation are inconclusive. In response, this study attempts to shed more light by suggesting that this relationship is influenced by situational contingencies that affect CEO perceptions of the costs and benefits associated with earnings manipulation. To support this perspective we draw on the prospect theory and the approach/inhibition theory of power to examine the relationship between CEO shareholdings and earnings manipulation in light of CEO power. We test this relationship on a sample of 16,873 observations from 2,257 US public firms. Findings show that increasing CEO shareholdings has a negative effect on earnings management, and on re-statements due to irregularities, and that duality positively moderates these relationships. The findings contribute to the corporate governance practice since they have implications for the design of CEO remuneration packages. (c) 2016 European Academy of Management.

Purpose: Borrowing from arguments of agency theory, the present study aims to investigate the moderating effect of the deviation from optimal franchising on the relationship between corporate governance provisions and firm financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 35 publicly listed US restaurant firms for the 1990-2008 period. The study uses a hierarchical regression with cross-sectional time-series fixed effects. Findings: The results show that the deviation from optimal franchising worsens the negative relationship between corporate governance provisions and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The availability of governance data restricts our sample to large publicly listed firms in the US restaurant industry, limiting the ability to generalize results for small and privately held restaurant firms. Practical implications: Firm executives should not only pay attention to which corporate governance provisions they adopt but also strive to maintain an optimal level of franchising. Originality/value: The key contribution of this study to governance literature is that this study demonstrates how the presence of multiple governance mechanisms influences firm performance.

In this study, we examine how board characteristics, such as the independent director ratio, board size, and the number of interlocks, influence the investment of slack resources into research and development (R&D) by a firm. Both the agency theory and resource dependence theory predict a positive influence of independent director ratio on the financial slack-R&D investment relationship. However in the case of board size and number of interlocks, resource dependence theory argues for a positive moderating effect, while agency theory predicts a negative effect. The hypotheses are tested on the seven-year panel data of 172 firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry, an emerging economy, high technology industry. We find broad support for the resource provisioning role of the board of directors, which is attributed to the emerging economy context of the Indian pharmaceutical industry, where firms face high levels of opportunity but lack resources to make use of them effectively.

Purpose: Although the concepts of family business, internationalization, and agency theory have received some attention in the relevant literature, these concepts and theories have been used independently. The purpose of this paper is to help close the gap between what is known and what needs to be known about the decision-making processes of internationalization of family managers (FM) and non-family managers (NFMs). Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyzes the story of Busscar, a Brazilian firm that began internationalization under an FM and ended it under an NFM. The management transition took place suddenly, as the family CEO died in a tragic accident, and the company appointed an NFM to replace him virtually overnight. These circumstances, as well as the fact that Busscar accelerated its internationalization process after the transition only to go bankrupt a few years later makes this case critical. Findings: The paper concludes that under NFMs, the speed and scope of the firm internationalization processes were accelerated and the financial risks were augmented, which is in line with the agency theory hypothesis and contradicts suggestions that NFMs tend to be more structured. Research limitations/implications: Many researchers argue that it is important to professionalize the management of family firms. It is expected that an NFM leads to a more structured strategy. The study shows otherwise; changing the manager leads to opportunistic internationalization using emerging strategies rather than deliberate ones. Originality/value: This study suggests that firms, networks, entrepreneurship, and ownership are not the only important variables. Manager origin (inside or outside the family) can change everything.

With the aim of achieving an advanced understanding of current research on unrelated diversification and providing fruitful groundwork to foster active interchange between disciplinary traditions, this paper detects articles from two relevant research streams; i.e., strategic management and financial economics. We first provide a brief overview of management thinking on unrelated diversification strategy. Then, we present a conceptual map that offers a comprehensive appreciation of unrelated diversification strategy antecedents (i.e., environmental and institutional, organizational value-enhancing, and managerial drivers), implementation process (i.e., managerial complexity, misallocation of resources, and structural inertia), and consequences (i.e., diversification premiums and discounts). Finally, we unpack the major gaps in our current knowledge that may help refocus the research agenda on unrelated diversification strategy and revamp the apparent waning proclivity of this issue.

Purpose: Many sales organizations use traditional control systems such as agency theory, which entails motivating salespeople using rewards and punishments, as if they are mechanical beings that are devoid of emotions and spirit. Research shows that such control leads to dissatisfied customers, disengaged salespeople and poor organizational reputation. The purpose of this study is to present governance based on workplace spirituality as an alternative approach, wherein salespeople's emotional and spiritual development is given primary importance. This is proposed to result in favorable performance and behaviors in alignment with organizational and customer goals. Design/methodology/approach: The study builds a conceptual model from an extended literature review. Findings: The developed conceptual model for workplace spirituality-based governance in sales organization consists of organizational structural factors, such as control and reward systems, as antecedents of psychological experiences of workplace spirituality in salespeople. These experiences are then proposed to result in salespeople's increased customer orientation and objective performance, with organizational commitment as a mediator. Practical Implications: The study has implications for organizations that govern salespeople by fiddling constantly with their salespeople's incentive plans but find that most of these changes have little effect. The study proposes that companies will have more satisfied customers and successful salespeople, if they manage their salespeople's emotional and spiritual side. Originality/value: This study is the first to devise a governance system in selling organizations that is based on workplace spirituality. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The highly successful franchising approach contains features of both large and small firms. We develop a 'diverse accountabilities' model of franchise organisation of employment relations, acknowledging the limitations of agency theory in explaining differences between franchisors' treatment of product and employment matters, particularly those associated with compliance with industrial legislation and awards. The model was broadly consistent with existing literature and our own multiple-case study of Australian food franchises. High rates of compliance with industrial relations (IR) standards were unlikely. The involvement of franchisors in franchisees' IR activities appeared to vary substantially, but was always well below that provided in other human resource management (HRM) or product-related issues. Evaluation and monitoring of franchisee behaviour is often neglected, and instead the consequences of non-compliance, if discovered, are potentially serious for the franchisee. Our approach helps explain the treatment of IR in terms of financial benefits for franchisors of operating a business model with marketing and product management features - and to some extent HRM features - of a large business, but the IR characteristics of small businesses.

This study aims to investigate the influence of board interlocking in income smoothing practices in public companies with shares traded on the BM&FBOVESPA. To achieve this objective we adopted a sample comprised of 58 Brazilian companies included in the Bovespa index. The study is classified as empirical and analytical and uses as a proxy for income smoothing a metric called the "smoothing factor" (SF), obtained through the factor analysis technique using the metrics EM1 and EM3 from Leuz, Nanda and Wysocki (2003). As independent variables we employed indicators of social network analysis. From a theoretical point of view, the study is relevant and innovates in making the connection between the resource dependence theory, the agency theory and board interlocking. In practical terms, the study shows the effects of the constitutive elements of corporate social networks, arising from the board interlocking structure, on income smoothing accounting practices. Regression with panel data using fixed effects showed that the constituent elements of corporate social networks tend to influence the practice of smoothing in the sample used. The results of the study show that companies that share board members with other organizations which smooth their results tend to adopt this organizational practice more easily, which can be explained by: (i) companies causing variations in performance due to operational decisions or financial reporting choices; and (ii) managers making use of discretionary practices in the reporting of profits.

Relative to relational governance, research into the use and effects of formal governance is scarce. Recent contributions suggest that a specific type of contract that has intentionally been left incomplete, the performance-based contract (PBC), fosters innovation. However, it is unknown how this effect occurs. To address this gap, we draw on transaction cost economics and agency theory to develop propositions on how PBCs affect innovation. PBCs are characterized by low term specificity and rewards that are tied to performance. We propose that low term specificity, that is, not stipulating how the focal firm's partner should deliver the performance and which resources to use, enhances the partner's autonomy, which in turn fosters innovation. However, excessive low term specificity inhibits innovation, since it may lead the partner to display opportunistic behavior. We furthermore propose that performance-based pay incentivizes the partner to engage in innovation. This suggests that linking rewards to performance attenuates the negative relationship between term specificity and innovation when the former is very low. Finally, we propose that a more risk-averse partner will engage in fewer innovative activities as such a partner will be less sensitive to the pay-for-performance clause.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between boards and board activity and subsequent business performance, in the context of high-growth companies, through the lens of decision making and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: A critical realist approach was used to conduct a longitudinal multiple-case study of two medium-sized, quasi-public high-growth companies. Data collection included first-hand observations of boards in session, semi-structured interviews with key actors and the inspection of board and company documentation. An iterative approach to analysis was used to gain an in-depth understanding of how the boards worked and how they sought to exert influence. Findings: The paper provides empirical insight about board involvement in strategic management. A proactive involvement by boards in the strategy development process and assessment of strategic options, and a collaborative form of board involvement in strategic management together with management is indicated as being important if the board is to exert influence beyond the boardroom. A conceptual model of a collaborative form of board-management interaction is developed. Practical implications: The paper provides guidance for boards, suggesting that a more direct level of involvement in strategic management by the board together with management may be material to improved business performance. Originality/value: The paper responds to calls for more research on the relationship between boards and business performance. It contributes much-needed first-hand evidence from within the boardroom.

Despite the increasing use of the agency perspective in studies of headquarters-subsidiaries relations in the multinational corporation (MNC), opponents fundamentally question its utility. In an attempt to contribute to this debate, we evaluate prior studies and develop considerations for future research. Our review of extant studies of headquarters-subsidiaries relations that make (explicit) use of the agency perspective reveals two significant shortcomings. First, we identify a need to validate the underlying assumptions when using the agency perspective in studies of headquarters-subsidiaries relations. Second, we detect a need to better account for the complex nature of headquarters-subsidiary relations in the MNC. A focus on these two areas can improve the use of the agency perspective and, ultimately, help resolve the contentious debate over the utility of the agency perspective.

This paper examines the effects of board quality on the relationship between corporate bankruptcy and nomination committee effectiveness. We argue that the proportion of outside directors, a proxy of board quality, arguably captures the extent of board control and resources. Based on dataset from 1835 firm-year observations for 98 bankrupt and 269 non-bankrupt UK listed non-financial firms between 1994 and 2011 and using the agency and resource dependence theories, we predict and find that nomination committee effectiveness negatively affects corporate bankruptcy and that board quality mitigates the negative effects. The results lend support to the notion that firms benefit from board quality in terms of outside directors' ability to monitor CEO on behalf of shareholders and also provide advice, counsel and legitimacy to the firm. This study extends the present research on corporate bankruptcy by providing evidence on the impact of board quality and nomination committee effectiveness on UK corporate bankruptcy.

The records pursers were required to keep suggest that the RN was at the forefront of the development of cost and materials accounting, and in the keeping of detailed accounting records. We provide fresh insights in to the purser's role and his association with the gestation of materials waste controls, standard costing, and audit and accountability processes.

A key decision for the design of principal-agent agreements is how much control or authority the buyer (or principal) should be allowed to exercise in relation to the seller (or agent). Historically, agency theory has viewed exchange agreements as ranging from those in which the buyer has very high authority over the seller (formal authority) to those in which the buyer and seller are relatively independent so there is little or no authority relation (market exchange). However, some principal-agent agreements reverse the authority relationship usually assumed in agency theory by allowing the seller to exercise authority over the buyer. The authors study this unexplored type of agency agreement and refer to it as "authority relinquishment." Using data collected from interviews with clients and guides on commercial high-altitude mountain expeditions, the authors identify conditions that make authority relinquishment likely. They also identify the benefits and drawbacks of authority relinquishment and compare them with the benefits and drawbacks of two frequently studied approaches to managing agency relationships - formal authority and authority decentralization.

We propose a model of security governance that draws upon agency theory to conceptualize the InfoSec function as a fiduciary for business users. We introduce a ternary typology of governance and test the efficacy of governance on goal congruence and information asymmetry. Our survey of information security managers finds that: (1) governance enhances goal congruence but does not impact information asymmetry, and (2) perceived information security service effectiveness is positively related to both information asymmetry and goal congruence. Contrary to what agency theory suggests, in the InfoSec context, information asymmetry can be exactly what is needed to enhance the principal's welfare. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications of these findings. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: Franchising is one of the fastest-growing operating modes in Brazil. In 2014, the Brazilian Franchising Association reported 2,492 active brands in the country. Some theories with an economic point of view, such as the agency theory, plural forms theory, or scarcity principle, explain why companies choose franchising. However, did the decision makers and founders of these franchises decide on this strategy taking only economic reasons into consideration? The purpose of this study is to understand the a priori criteria (prior to the decision) that executives took into account when adopting this strategy and the key motivations for this decision. Originality/gap/relevance/implications: The literature emphasizes the economic reasons for the success of the franchise model, but it does not focus on the founders' motivations when they choose this strategy. This is the gap that this study seeks to address. Dissonance could arise between economic reasons and entry motivations that could result in consequences for the management of new franchises. Key methodological aspects: Ten companies of different industries and different life cycle stages involved with the franchise model were scrutinized using a semi-structured questionnaire based on the literature on decision theory and franchising. Summary of key results: Behavioral factors significantly influence decision makers when choosing the franchise model. Key considerations/conclusions: This study distinguishes the economic reasons from the executives' motivations when choosing the franchise model and highlights the importance of non-economic factors in this decision.

This paper asks the question whether international executives receive higher pay than their non-international peers. Building upon human capital theory and agency theory, we assume that highly international executives achieve higher market value in terms of their level of compensation than less international executives. To investigate this relationship, we use a multidimensional construct of internationalisation and differentiate between fixed and variable pay components of top executives. Based on a comprehensive sample of top executives from Germany's DAX firms, we find empirical evidence that 'being international' pays off for the individual in terms of variable compensation but not in terms of fixed compensation. We also demonstrate that the structure of compensation is affected by the internationalisation level of the supervisory board members. Hence, we show that governance bodies who are deciding on management board members' compensation should not be neglected in top management research. Copyright (c) 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The study analyzes the characteristics that motivate the voluntary disclosure on intangible representing organizational structural capital of the banking organizations registered on stock exchanges: Brazil and Spain. Traditional accounting is not approaching the real value of the organizations, obtained by its intangible capital. To mitigate the marked difference between the book value and the market price of these organizations, the trend to voluntary disclosures on their intangible resources has emerged. The asymmetry of information, resulting from not accounting for the organizational structural resources is studied by 2 theoretical perspectives. Agency theory suggests that the voluntary disclosure of information reduces agency costs. The theory of the cost of the owner assumes that reveal information generates additional costs, as well as the possibility of loss of its competitive advantages. This research examines 174 annual reports of 29 banks, from 2006 to 2011. The technique of multiple linear regressions using the method of least squares with panel data was used. The test results confirm the hypothesis that large banks, the most profitable and the oldest are more motivated to voluntarily disclose information representing organizational structural capital.

The degree of auditor independence is an important issue in the performance auditing literature. However, little attention has been paid to the influence of the context in which an audit body operates. This paper investigates how an audit model with a high degree of auditor independence, which is consistent with agency theory's rather formal view of relationships in organizations, functions in a context with more informal relationships, as implied by stewardship theory. Based on two case studies and a survey, the paper concludes that Dutch councilors are more satisfied with audit reports if in their municipality there is a fit between context and audit model.

This study assesses the link between nomination committees' presence and size as well as male directors on nomination committee and gender diversity in Ghanaian boardrooms. We use a dataset of 25 listed and 20 unlisted Ghanaian firms for January 2006 to December 2012; nine years after the Ghana Government endorsed an Affirmative Action Plan to achieve 40% representation of women on all boards by the year 2000. We employ probit and logit regressions to test our hypotheses. Listed firms and financial institutions are more likely to have more gender diverse boards. By contrast, we have no evidence to support the link between board gender diversity and board size, firm age, firm size, firm ownership, board composition and nomination committees' presence and size as well as male directors on nomination committee. Overall, our results raise questions on the appropriateness of the continual use of both the agency and resource dependency theories in explaining board gender diversity in developing economies' perspective. This study is the first of its kind, particularly within developing economies. (c) Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Tension often arises when Chapter 6 business rescue practitioners (BRPs) are appointed by directors to rescue their distressed businesses. Regulating by means of standard agency contracting becomes irrelevant in the resulting multiple relationships. Looking through the agency lens, using analytic autoethnography and compiling narratives, this paper explains the perceptions of what appear to be quasiagency relationships and obtains a better understanding of these. The findings suggest that the apparent principal-agent relationships suffer from asymmetries of goals, information access, informal power and diverging perceptions of moral hazard, transaction costs and adverse selection. As a solution, contracting has been shown to have limited value owing to outcome uncertainty and measurability. This is because the tasks of the BRP are non-programmable and term-dependent. The findings provide filing directors, shareholders, creditors, regulatory authorities and BRPs in this newly instituted regime, with enhanced understanding of how the relationships manifest in practice and overcome the non-contractibility of the newly formed relationships.

This paper employs agency theory and resource dependence theory to explore relationships between Australian national sport governing bodies and commercial tour operators. These relationships produce domestic and international travel packages to major sport events and can provide commercial revenue to sport governing bodies. The research identifies agency challenges inherent in the relationships and how these are managed by sport governing bodies. Findings indicate that while sport governing bodies and tour operators interact to generate revenue, the two parties have divergent attitudes toward risk, particularly risks associated with pursuit of profit. The sport governing bodies manage interaction with tour operators through control of event tickets, a perishable and finite resource. The research contributes insights into the challenges confronting sport governing bodies attempting to diversify revenue into commercial sport tourism, as well as the underexplored role of sport bodies in facilitating major event tourism.

In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

Purpose: This paper aims to explore an alternative approach to regulation for addressing governance problems relating to director and executive remuneration in publicly listed firms. The author investigates the development of hybrid regulatory framework, composed of state regulation and self-regulation, for remuneration governance in Australia. Design/methodology/approach: The synthesis of constructs borrowed from agency and institutional theories and its contextual analysis examines the effectiveness of formal (state regulation) and informal (self-regulation) institutions for the development of a hybrid of regulation. Thereafter, the author examines the impact of hybrid regulation on remuneration disclosure behavior in Australia. Findings: The author finds that improvement in disclosure is primarily driven by the establishment of remuneration committees and separate role of chief executive officer (CEO) and chairperson but weakened by the presence of CEO at remuneration committee and presence of remuneration consultant. Originality/value: Global crises have called for greater transparency and protection of investors through state regulation alone. However, corporate governance, being a social practice that is shaped by diverse interests, calls for a holistic approach. A useful contribution of this study is that through an in-depth examination into the stages and actors of the government interventions involving the balancing of tension between conflicting forces, it provides insights for developing an effective regulatory hybrid which has greater acceptance for corporate governance. In conclusion, it implies the significance of priming the social arena through active engagement of diverse market forces prior to introducing state regulation.

Based on Ajzen (1985) Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the concept of agency theory as well as moral development, this study proposes a behavioral intention model consisting of agency situation, moral development, and the three dimensions of TPB, including attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. This study decomposes the above three factors into multi-dimensions in examining accountants' behaviors with regard to earnings management, moral development, and agency problem conditions to provide a comprehensive understanding of the behavioral intentions of earnings management. The main results of this study indicate that the "attitude" dimension is the only significant variable of TPB that explains the earnings management intention of accounting practitioners. Further analysis also suggests that the accounting practitioners' "attitude" could be more effectively influenced through inculcation of the concept of "altruism". In addition, the behavioral intention of accounting practitioners engaged in earnings management is significantly affected by agency situation and moral development. We find significant interaction between the two variables. (c) 2016, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

Based on the Behavioral Agency Theory and the socio-emotional wealth model proposed by Berrone, Cruz & Gomez-Mejia (2012), this work focuses on measuring and validating the model and its relationship to family firm's results. It also analyzes some characteristics such as size and age of the family businesses to determine their influence on the relation between socioemotional wealth and family firm's results. Unlike other studies, an empirical study was made in private family firms (not listed in the stock market). The study suggests that family firm's outcomes are positively related to socioemotional wealth. Furthermore, the 5 dimensions model of socioemotional wealth is valid but requires adjustments in some dimensions. (c) 2016, Allied Academies. All rights reserved.

Previous research has established that, in addition to provision of financing, venture capitalists (VCs) may add value to new ventures via different types of management support. In this paper, we propose that transaction cost economics (TCE) may complement other theoretical frameworks (e.g., agency theory, the resource-based view, knowledge-based theory, and resource dependence perspective) in explaining CEOs' polar and ambivalent appraisals of the benefits and costs of different types of VC support and the overall value of VC assistance. Following TCE, we approach VC-funded new ventures as hybrids of markets and hierarchies. Hence, we assume that VCs help their portfolio companies both to externalize, or learn to better operate under the market mode of governance, and internalize, or learn to better operate under the hierarchy mode of governance. We propose that VCs use external support to facilitate venture externalization and use internal support to facilitate venture internalization. Based on structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis of data from an online survey that generated 104 valid responses from CEOs of VC-funded new ventures, we establish that CEOs associate VCs' external support positively with the perceived benefits of VC assistance and negatively with the perceived costs of VC assistance. In contrast, CEOs associate VCs' internal support positively both with the perceived benefits and costs of VC assistance. We also demonstrate that CEOs' assessments of the perceived benefits and costs of VC assistance are, respectively, associated positively and negatively with their appraisals of the overall value of VC assistance. Finally, we ascertain that CEO experience is related negatively to CEOs' appraisals of the overall value of VC assistance. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze certain organizational changes that occur after privatization. More specifically, the authors analyze from an agency theory perspective how changes at the corporate governance level (ownership type/structure and board of directors) influence firm strategy, and what implications these issues have for the design of compensation mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology employed in the study can be described as a longitudinal multiple case study approach. A multiple case study enables the comparison of pre- and post-privatization periods in five Spanish companies. This methodology is especially suitable to track the organizational changes occurring in relation to the firms' internal management. Findings - First, the variables that traditionally relate to greater board independence in monitoring do not suffer from variation after privatization. Second, the interests of the firms' new ownership have an impact on firm strategy after privatization. Finally, compensation system design clearly aligns with firm strategy after privatization. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on a multiple case study approach, which limits the scope and generalizability of the findings. Originality/value - Whereas research in privatization generally adopts a macroeconomic or political perspective, organizational and managerial implications are current aspects in need of further examination. This research offers a study that integrates three sets of variables (corporate governance, strategy and compensation) that have been rarely analyzed in this context.

The aim of this chapter is to project the agency theory about triple helix; being more specific, corporate governance mechanism about the entity's organizational structure that emerge as intermediaries partnerships within the triple helix (structured as a spin-off, business incubator, business accelerator, science park, among others), having as a base the agency theory. In this context it is proposed a governance framework starting with two drivers that make part of is known as governance throughput: the macro-structure of power and the organization's management macro-processes. In this framework has built an array of classification of governance environment, based on information about the implementation of normative governance mechanisms and supervision generating quadrants with favorable and unfavorable levels of each dimension of governance drives. The proposed framework does not predict optimal decisions about key issues in governance (accountability, disclosure, compliance and fairness), but lists mechanisms to secure theoretical foundation that can mitigate the agency problems, hoping thereby to contribute to better understand the governance environment in partnerships within the triple helix.

Traditional agency theory (principal-agent conflict) has been a widely-accepted theoretical perspective for understanding corporate governance practices in developed economies. Institutions in these economies are characterized by effective contract enforcement, disperse ownership, separation of ownership, and control and protection of minority shareholders' rights. However, the principal-agent relationship, alone, may not be appropriate for analyzing corporate governance in emerging-economy institutional contexts, in which these institutional characteristics are often absent, weak, or poorly implemented. Scholars characterize corporate governance in emerging economies as having a conflict of interest between controlling and minority shareholders, known as the ''principal-principal agency model''. This relatively new sub-field has attracted the attention of scholars across disciplines including finance, economics, and strategy. The present chapter attempts to synthesize and review conceptual and empirical developments regarding principal-principal conflicts, and suggests possible directions for future studies.

Agency theory and socio-emotional wealth theory are central when explaining family firm advantages. However, research has not uncovered the extent to which reasoning from these two theories can also explain family firm advantages linked to the homeland production mode. This paper addresses this issue, building on the above-mentioned theories through an illustrative single case study of the family firm Weibel Scientific. The case study stresses that characteristics of family firms can be exploited in the homeland production mode and lead to reduced agency costs and social capital benefits. Furthermore, the case study highlights that there are important aspects to consider regarding the way in which these characteristics affect agency costs and social capital, and how these effects are influenced by the production locational mode. From this, it is concluded that arguments from agency theory and socio-emotional wealth theory can explain family firm advantages associated with the homeland production mode.

This chapter investigates the antecedents to the development of the three components of subsidiaries' absorptive capacity (ACAP): recognition, assimilation and application of transferred knowledge in the context of the vertical flow of social and environmental accounting and reporting (SEAR) knowledge from the HQ to acquired subsidiaries. Our analysis is based on an embedded multiple case study of a UK-based MNC, informed by 44 semi-structured interviews and capitalising on agency theory and socialisation theory. Prior knowledge is not a sufficient explanation to the development of ACAP but it is also dependent on organisational mechanisms that will trigger the learning processes. Depending on the nature and degree of the social, control and integration mechanisms, the effects of prior stocks of knowledge on ACAP may vary. Our propositions only hold for one direction of knowledge transfer. The study is based on an embedded multiple case study in one sector which restricts its generalisation. It excludes the specific relationships between the three ACAP learning processes and the existence of feedback loops. Our findings suggest that the HQ's mix of social, control and integration mechanisms should account for initial stocks of SEAR knowledge. The contribution lies in uncovering the interaction between heterogeneous levels of prior knowledge and organisational mechanisms deployed by the HQ fostering ACAP. We address emerging issues regarding the reification of the ACAP concept and highlight the potential of agency theory for informing studies on HQ-subsidiary relations.

Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to philosophically address the issue of managerial opportunism and to describe the paradox of the opportunistic executive, particularly when the CEO could be considered as a "criminal-to-be". Design/methodology/approach-It will be seen to what extent governance mechanisms really contributeto prevent managerial opportunism, particularly through compensation packages ("financial carrots"). Then, Oliver E. Williamson's viewpoint will be analyzed on opportunism, as his theory has largely influenced the way agency theories actually define managerial opportunism. Williamson was thinking opportunism without referring to philosophical works. The gap in exploring three basic types of opportunism will be filled: the Smithian egoist, the Hobbesian egoist and the Machiavellian egoist. Findings-The Smithian egoist tries to reach an equilibrium between self-interest and compassion, while the Hobbesian egoist is motivated by self-interest, desire of power and the attitude of prudence. The Machiavellian egoist is always searching for power and makes followers' fear arising. The way governance mechanisms and structures should be designed and implemented could be quite different if the CEO actually behaves as a Smithian, Hobbesian or Machiavellian egoist. CEO's propensity to commit financial crime could largely vary from one type to another: low risk (Smithian egoist), medium risk (Hobbesian egoist) or high risk (Machiavellian egoist). Research limitation/implications-Smith's, Hobbes' and Machiavelli's philosophy was chosen because the agency theory sometimes refers to it, when defining the notion of opportunism. Other philosophies could also be analyzed to see to what extent they are opening the door to opportunism (for example, Spinoza). Originality/value-The paper analyzes managerial opportunism from a philosophical viewpoint. Whether executives are Smithian, Hobbesian or Machiavellian egoists, their opportunism cannot give birth to similar behaviors. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a model explaining the roles of right-hand person and the factors contributing to the successful relationship between the top executive and the right-hand person. Design/methodology/approach - In-depth qualitative case studies are conducted. Longitudinal observations, interviews with six right-hand persons and the top executives in three organizations are conducted to test the propositions of the model. Findings - Results indicate that different types of congruence between the top executive and the right-hand person are required when the right-hand person is performing the roles of an implementer and joint decision maker. Research limitations/implications - This study extends the leadership literature by investigating the phenomenon of right-hand person of the top executive, which has seldom been studied systematically or scientifically. It provides insights and serves as a stepping stone for future research in this area. One key limitation is that it is a qualitative study with limited samples under investigation. Practical implications - Practical implications concerning how to build up a successful relationship between the top executive and the right-hand person can be drawn from the proposed model. Insight concerning how to collaborate between the top executive and the right-hand person can be drawn from the in-depth case analyses. Social implications - The phenomenon of right-hand person is not limited to business organizations. The collaboration between the key decision maker and his chief assistant should be applicable to other contexts such as non-government organizations. Originality/value - To the best of the knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates the right-hand person phenomenon in the literature. As the right-hand person of the top executive can have important influence on organizational performance, the study may serve as the stepping stone for further understanding of this important phenomenon.

This study investigates the role of external monitors, in the form of analyst recommendations, on CEO pay cuts. We use the theories of signaling and optimism to arrive at propositions that predict the relationship between analyst recommendations as external monitors, and CEO pay cuts. CEO pay cuts - which constitute a strong incentive for CEO behavior - have received only limited attention in extant research. Analysis of data for US public firms from 1998 to 2013 suggest that firms with strong external monitoring mechanisms, such as public analyst recommendations, are more likely to implement pay cuts. Our findings reveal that analyst recommendations serve as important and objective external signals and a monitoring mechanism for determining CEO pay cuts. Specifically, low-performing firms and firms with high CEO pay before analyst recommendations are more likely to integrate the analyst downgrades in their decision process regarding CEO compensation. From our analysis, practitioners could learn that - even though they might find it difficult to implement CEO pay cuts - such pay cuts are not only effective but also could be implemented based on external signals from analysts. A takeaway for external analysts is the powerful effect that their negative signals have on CEO pay cuts, thus questioning the optimism bias that is so prevalent in the industry. In order to serve as truly 'objective' external monitors, analysts should use ratings judiciously as signaling mechanisms. (c) 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

This paper discusses the cause of the conflict between principal and agent, looking for answers in the disciplines of biology, particularly in the science of criminal anthropology. A setting has been made between the findings of the agency theory and white-collar crime theories, reinterpreting the actions of the agent from their configuration between instinct, heritage and personality. The results in the biological sciences could provide new interpretations and explanations in administration science, moving towards better interpretations of the conflict through more empirical content theories. Overall, despite the ongoing conflict between the parties, their dynamic boosts the results sought by the principal. (c) 2016 Universidad ICESI. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

This paper attempts to presents a literature review on Agency Theory and its relevance in understanding the relationship between Government and the HEIs. It discusses the general aspects of the theory and also reviewed some previous studies that have applied the theory. Theories as we know help us to accomplish many important outcomes in academia. They help us to organize our thoughts and ideas about the world and also help us generate and explain relationships, complex or otherwise, between individuals or among groups. Theories also help us improve our predictions and expectations about people, groups or organizations, while at the same time giving us a better understanding of the world around us. Attempt has also been made to relate the application of the Principal - Agent theory to Higher Education, especially public universities with regards to their governance and funding. It is a well-known fact that Governments provides the greater part of funds required by the public universities. In this case therefore the Government has some expectations on these universities, especially with regards to the utilization of the funds provided and also the need for accountability, as the funds so provided, is tax payers' money and must therefore be accounted for. The theory is also expected to provide a useful framework for performance funding procedures in the public universities. Copyright (c) 2016 International Business Information Management Association

Historical accounting research provides evidence, within the framework of agency theory, of the conflict of interests produced in the organisation. By means of a longitudinal study based on primary sources, the present study aims to examine how agency relationship is regulated by means of formal contracts, as well as to explore the function performed by accounting within that relationship. The case study on which our research is based, and which might constitute an important contribution to the field, examines the leasing of the State tobacco monopoly to a private corporation, from the beginning of this process (1887) until this monopolistic activity starts to decrease (1986). The findings underline that the specific contracts established lead to a significant control of the principal over the agent, and that not all conditions required in order to consider them as "good contractual agreements" are met. On the other hand, accounting appears as a key factor in State control of the lessee corporations. The main conclusion of the study is that the agent takes more risks in the leasing, and that the principal maintains an opportunistic behaviour throughout the whole process, which questions the most widespread assumptions on the theory, and suggests the possibility of softening of the initial assumptions.

Purpose: Nowadays with the rapid growth of futures market, trust issues are increasing, especially, for individual traders because of the existing risks. However, to date there is no study that focuses on trust issues within online futures market and risks that threaten individual traders. This paper aims to understand trust issues in online futures market. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts an in-depth qualitative approach of online futures market in Malaysia through 30 interviews include senior managers, managers and individual traders who involve in futures online trading from three brokerage firms. Using agency theory, a new scale model, this study provides understanding on trust issues for traders in online futures market. Findings: The paper provides empirical insights about trust issues that will occur as a result of information, risk and goal asymmetries between traders and brokers in online futures market. It suggests licensed and registered broker, platform familiarity, platform accessibility and usability, flexible contract size and leverage, providing segregated account and appropriate devices as key elements to overcome the mentioned asymmetries. Originality/value: This is the first paper to investigate existing risk in online futures market and provide valuable implications for both traders and brokers to reduce the risk and increase the traders' trust.

Managerial risk taking is a critical aspect of strategic management. To improve competitive advantage and performance, managers need to take risks, often in an uncertain environment. Formal economic assumptions of risk taking suggest that if the expected values for two strategies are similar but one is a greater gamble (uncertain), managers will choose the strategy with a more certain outcome. Based on these assumptions, agency theory assumes that top managers should be compensated or monitored to achieve better outcomes. We review the theory and research on agency theory and managerial risk taking along with theories that challenge this basic assumption about risk taking: the behavioral theory of the firm, prospect theory, the behavioral agency model and the related socioemotional wealth perspective, and upper echelons theory. We contribute to the literature by reviewing and suggesting research opportunities within and across these theories to develop a comprehensive research agenda on managerial risk taking.

We show that firms with younger CEOs are more likely to experience stock price crashes, including crashes caused by revelation of negative news in the form of breaks in strings of consecutive earnings increases. Such strings are accompanied by large increases in CEO compensation that do not dissipate with crashes. These findings suggest that CEOs have financial incentives to hoard bad news earlier in their career, which increases future crashes. This negative impact of CEO age effect is strongest in the presence of managerial discretion. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of CEO age for firm policies and outcomes.

This article intends to review the theoretical aspects and empirical evidences made on agency theory. It is aimed to explore the main ideas, perspectives, problems and issues related to the agency theory through a literature survey. It discusses the theoretical aspects of agency theory and the various concepts and issues related to it and documents empirical evidences on the mechanisms that diminish the agency cost. The conflict of interest and agency cost arises due to the separation of ownership from control, different risk preferences, information asymmetry and moral hazards. The literatures have cited many solutions like strong ownership control, managerial ownership, independent board members and different committees can be useful in controlling the agency conflict and its cost. This literature survey will enlighten the practitioners and researchers in understanding, analysing the agency problem and will be helpful in mitigating the agency problem.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG, 2007 and 2012) on the performance of the listed companies in Malaysia. The agency theory and resource dependency theories indicate that the firms with strong corporate governance outperform firms with weaker governance. This paper explores this relationship in a developing country like Malaysia having different institutional environment compared to western countries. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a sample of 113 listed companies in Malaysia. The study incorporates the endogenous relationship between corporate governance, firm performance and leverage. Findings: The study analyzes how the corporate governance framework affected firm performance in Malaysia with the help of self-developed corporate governance index (MCGI). The authors' findings show that the performance of the firm is positively and significantly related with corporate governance measured by MCGI. Secondly, corporate governance of sample firms shows marked improvements after implementation of MCCG 2012 as compared to MCCG 2007. Originality/value: The findings of this paper support the agency and the resource dependency theories. The study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the corporate governance and firm performance in emerging economy and builds a case for enforcement of strong corporate governance code by government agencies.

Despite the growing research evidence on the effect of powerful CEOs on organizational outcomes, their role in shaping the firm's innovation agenda has received little scholarly attention. This study examines the effect of CEO power on exploratory and exploitative innovation. Drawing from core arguments of Behavioral Agency Theory, this study proposes that firms led by powerful CEOs are likely to pursue more exploratory and less exploitative innovations. Furthermore, these relationships are significantly strengthened by CEO Outsider Status. Using data from 150 U.S. firms, the results reveal a significant positive relationship between CEO power and explorative innovation. Contrary to predictions, firms led by powerful CEOs engage in more not less exploitative innovation when the CEO is appointed from outside the firm. Overall, the findings provide a more nuanced explanation of the link between CEO power and organizational innovation. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We identify how barriers to absorptive capacity limit success in integrating external technology by firms in emerging markets. We refine previous barriers to absorptive capacity and classify them into internal (managerial biases and weak social integration mechanisms) and external (muted activation triggers, conflicting source relationships, and feeble appropriability regimes). We also identify how particular conditions in emerging markets (higher restraints on incentives, higher information asymmetries, and weaker contract protection) heighten the barriers. Using agency theory as the theoretical base, we provide a better understanding of absorptive capacity and of the influence of the home country on capability upgrading. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This paper examines the relationship between board structure and corporate risk taking in the UK financial sector. We show how the board size, board independence and combining the role of CEO and chairperson in boards may affect corporate risk taking in financial firms. Our sample is based on a panel dataset of all publicly listed firms in the UK financial sector, which includes banks, insurance, real estate and financial services companies over a ten year period (2003 - 2012). After controlling for the effects of endogeneity through the application of the dynamic panel generalized method of moments estimator, the findings of this study suggest that the presence of non-executive directors and powerful CEOs in corporate boards reduces corporate risk taking practices in financial firms. The negative relationship can be explained within the agency theory context, where managers are regarded as more risk averse because of the reputational and employment risk. An increased power concentration is therefore expected to enhance the risk aversion behaviour of directors. The findings however, do not show any significant effect of board size on corporate risk taking in financial firms. As this study covers recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code on the role of corporate boards in managing firms' risk, the empirical evidence could be useful for corporate governance regulation and policy making.

The Emergence and Implications of Increasingly Disaggregated and Dispersed Headquarters Activities in Contemporary Firms'. The purpose is two-fold. First, we propose a conceptualization of headquarters activities as a dynamic system in which activities can be distributed organizationally and spatially. We explicitly break with the dominant view of the prior research on 'the headquarters' as a single, identifiable unit in one specific location. Second, building on the manuscripts accepted for publication in this Special Issue, we outline research implications and put forward an agenda for research on the emergence and continuous management of disaggregated and dispersed headquarters systems.

The relationship between HRM and well-being has received a significant amount of research attention; however, results are still contested. Our study addresses this phenomenon in the Higher Education sector. We specifically investigate the association between performance management and the perceived well-being of academic staff. Our research finds that the application of a directive performance management approach, underpinned by agency theory ideas as evidenced by a high reliance on performance measures and targets, is negatively related to academics' well-being (i.e. the more it is used, the worse people feel). In contrast, an enabling performance management approach, based on the learnings of stewardship theory, emphasising staff involvement, communication and development, is positively related to academics' well-being. We also find the positive relationship between enabling practices and well-being is mediated by how academics experience their work (i.e. their perceptions of job demands, job control and management support). These results indicate that current trends to intensify the use of directive performance management can have consequences on the energy and health of academics, which may influence their motivation and willingness to stay in the profession. This research suggests that an enabling approach to managing performance in this context, may have more positive effects. (c) 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

We examine the longitudinal relationship between ownership structure and firm internationalization, in a sample of Indian firms. Drawing on principal-principal (PP) agency theory and the resource-based-view (RBV) of the firm, we argue that divergent preferences (motivations) of a firm's owners affect the firm's propensity to internationalize, while resource heterogeneity among these owners (owners' capability to access and provide resources) affects the firm's capability to internationalize. We argue that both motivation and capability are required for firms to pursue internationalization and that when either of these is missing in an owner, that owner's shareholding will be negatively associated with internationalization. Additionally, our results uncover an interesting dichotomy. While family owners with lower levels of ownership favor their firms' internationalization, they do not favor it at higher levels of ownership. Our results indicate that foreign owners appeared to adjust their roles to accommodate the preferences of the dominant family owners. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This article theoretically and empirically intertwines agency and stewardship theories to examine their distinct and combined influences on family firms. Primary matched triadic data from CEOs, family employees, and nonfamily employees in 77 family firms suggest that agency and stewardship governance affects individual-level behavior and firm-level performance. Specifically, agent behavior is highest under conditions of coexisting low agency governance and high stewardship governance and is lowest when agency and stewardship governance coexist at high levels. Furthermore, when high levels of agency and stewardship governance coexist, family firm performance is the highest. Theoretical implications and future research directions are discussed.

We analyse business-NGO (B2N) alliances through the lenses of multiple agency and behavioural agency theories to identify the sources of agency problems and the most effective choice of mitigation mechanisms. We contend that three types of agency relationships constitute B2N alliances: the relationship between the firm's managers and B2N alliance employees; the relationship between the NGO's managers and the B2N alliance employees; and the novel 'claimed principal-agent relationship' involving the external beneficiary, the NGO's managers and the alliance employees. We argue that B2N alliances' three types of agency problems stem from (1) the relative emphasis on public vs. private goods, both at the employee and at the partner levels, and (2) the level of the external beneficiary's voice. We then predict the mechanisms to mitigate these problems: hiring altruistic over self-interested individuals; narrowly specifying the employees' activities; emphasizing input-based and intrinsic incentive mechanisms; and investing significantly into non-intrusive monitoring mechanisms.

More and more boards are tapping interim CEOs to temporarily fill the corner office. Prior research indicates the negative performance implications of this decision; yet, little is known about the rationale behind this decision. Our aim is to fill this research gap. Drawing on agency and human capabilities frameworks, we examined the contextual elements that influence a board's decision to pursue temporary leadership. Within a sample of 375 successions occurring between 1998 and 2005, we found that boards of directors were more likely to select interim CEOs under certain succession conditions, namely, when the prior CEO was forced out and there was no heir apparent or when the prior CEO had served for a short tenure. Our results highlight the importance of context in succession selections and provide insights into why a board would pursue a decision with seemingly negative repercussions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

We identify employee outcomes, such as commitment and competence, as mediating processes that explain the effects of incentive pay on firm performance. We further propose procedural justice climate and environmental turbulence as boundary conditions that determine the strength of the effects of incentive pay on employee outcomes. The research model is tested using multisource data collected at three time points over a five-year period from 227 Korean companies. Our analysis confirmed that incentive pay enhanced employee commitment and competence, which, in turn, improved the operational and financial performances of firms. The effect of incentive pay on employee commitment was negative for firms with a low procedural justice climate, but positive for firms operated under a highly turbulent environment. By contrast, the effect of incentive pay on employee competence was positive only for firms operated under a stable environment. This study enriches the literature by presenting and validating plausible underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions under which strategic performance-contingent incentive pay affects firm performance.

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

This study uses both a functionalist paradigm of social theory and agency theory assumptions to examine whether CEO remuneration is performance sensitive and, vice versa, whether companies that pay their CEOs more perform better. Our analysis is based on the sample of 330 large European firms for the period from 2009 to 2013. The findings of panel data analysis confirm that CEO compensation is positively associated with corporate performance, and vice versa. The simultaneous estimation, in which we treat both compensation and firm performance as endogenous using a two-stage least squares method, shows that companies tie bonuses to accounting-based measures and this incentive pay enhances corporate internal performance. However, compensation linked to market-based measures does not improve firm performance. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: This paper aims to present the first systematic review of the literature relating to the relationships between organisations and their marketing agencies, the agency-client relationship, and presents a concept matrix that identifies the key areas of investigation, and topics where further research would be beneficial. As agencies play a pivotal role in operationalising marketing strategy, this relationship is central to marketing theory, management and practice. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of the literature was performed using key databases and search terms, and filtering on the basis of criteria relating, for example, to relevance and format, to create a core set of refereed papers on the agency-client relationship in the marketing and advertising domains. Bibliographic and thematic analysis was used to profile the literature in the dataset, and to draw out key themes. Findings: The paper provides an analysis of the extant knowledge base, including key themes, journals and research methods. The following themes emerged from the literature, and are used to elaborate further on the existing body of knowledge: conflict, client account management, contracts and agency theory, cultural and international perspectives and co-creation. An agenda for future research is proposed that advocates a focus on theoretical foundations, research strategies and research topics and themes. Originality/value: This is the first systematic review of the literature on agency-client relationships, which is scattered across disciplines and informed by several theoretical perspectives. Given the increasing complexity of agency-client relationships in the digital age, and increasing need to understand "marketing-as-practice", the coherent overview offered by this paper is of particular value for guiding future research.

Conventional agency theory typically focuses on a unidirectional problem, in which an agent behaves opportunistically against the interests of a principal. Yet, this conceptualization is too limited to fully describe all aspects of principal-agent relationships. This article presents a more comprehensive framework explaining a potential three-directional problem--that is, (i) agents behave opportunistically against the interests of principals, (ii) principals behave opportunistically against the interests of agents, and (iii) relationships between agents and principals representing confluence of interests affect the interests of third-party stakeholders. The article provides evidence of these problems, describes their unique characteristics, and outlines implications for society. It concludes with a discussion focusing on the implications of the proposed framework for purported governance solutions, the ongoing debate between shareholder and stakeholder views of the firm, and business practices.

Purpose - The aim of this study is to advance research on the position of the CISO by investigating the role that CISOs play before and after an IT security breach. There is a dearth of academic research literature on the role of a chief information security officer (CISO) in the management of Information Technology (IT) security. The limited research literature exists despite the increasing number and complexity of IT security breaches that lead to significant erosions in business value. Design/methodology/approach - The study makes use of content analysis and agency theory to explore a sample of US firms that experienced IT security breaches between 2009 and 2015 and how these firms reacted to the IT security breaches. Findings - The results indicate that following the IT security breaches, a number of the impacted firms adopted a reactive plan that entailed a re-organization of the existing IT security strategy and the hiring of a CISO. Also, there is no consensus on the CISO reporting structure since most of the firms that hired a CISO for the first time had the CISO report either to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Information Officer. Research limitations/implications - The findings will inform researchers, IT educators and industry practitioners on the roles of CISOs as well as advance research on how to mitigate IT security vulnerabilities. Originality/value - The need for research that advances an understanding of how to effectively manage the security of IT resources is timely and is driven by the growing frequency and sophistication of the IT security breaches as well as the significant direct and indirect costs incurred by both the affected firms and their stakeholders.

Purpose: Using a contingency approach, the purpose of this paper is to study how organizational factors (such as the organizational life cycle, firm size, firm ownership concentration and firm technology) determine the relative importance of the monitoring and provision of resources roles provided by board members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights the importance of contingency factors in carrying out board's roles using a sample of 579 European firms registered in the STOXX Europe 600 index. The authors used a longitudinal analysis for the period from 2002 through to 2011. Findings: The results show that the monitoring role is more relevant for companies that are large, are operating at the mature and stagnant stages, have a dispersed ownership and are low-technology. However, the provision of resources role is more relevant for companies that are in the growth and stagnant stages, and have a concentrated ownership. Originality/value: The traditional analysis that relates the board's structure and composition to the board's roles focuses on determining what board should be the best. It plays little attention to analyzing which organizational factors affect the importance and presence of monitoring or resource dependence roles. In this regard, this work adds significant insights to agency theory and resource dependence theory as, with a contingency framework, the research aims to find what functions the board needs to develop in order to get better firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: Family firms, as insider-controlled companies, should be less likely to exhibit CEO turnover after poor performance and may thus promote enhanced focus on long-term goals. However, when a non-family CEO is in charge, the relatively limited empirical evidence is contrasting. Some studies find that only family CEOs are immune from the threat of dismissal following poor financial performance, while other studies show that family firms discipline their CEOs for poor financial performance regardless of their family status. In this work, we try to reconcile these contrasting findings and investigate what ownership and governance conditions influence the owners' pressure on the CEO to achieve short-term financial results. Research findings/insights: Drawing on a longitudinal dataset that covers the entire population of Italian medium and large family companies, we find that when family ownership is concentrated in the hands of few family shareholders or there is a low number of family members involved in the board of directors, non-family CEOs are less likely to be dismissed after poor performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study, adopting the behavioral agency theory as the guiding framework, highlights the importance for governance decisions of the potential goal divergence among principals in closely held ownership structures. Our results also add to the still scant literature on the relationship between family owners and non-family CEOs. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research suggests that, in the decision to hire a non-family CEO, family business owners should not only assess their gaps in managerial skills but also carefully consider the ownership structure and family involvement conditions. On the side of professional non-family managers, our results offer insights on ways to address the employment relationship with the controlling family. (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

The increased research focus on the networked perspective of the multinational enterprise (MNE) reflects a greater delegation of responsibility from corporate headquarters (CHQ) to subsidiary and intermediary units such as regional headquarters (RHQ). This shift has increased the intensity of political interactions between key actors within the MNE. Despite the recent rise in studies on the micro-political perspective of the MNE to date, little empirical work has explored this issue in the context of the CHQ-RHQ relationship. Drawing insights from agency theory and micro-politics, the authors focus on the context in which RHQs develop micro-political strategies in order to manage the flow and exchange of knowledge with CHQ. They show how RHQ may exhibit a 'dual agency' role when dealing with CHQ, in that it is characterized as a principal and agent, each requiring different micro-political knowledge strategies. As a principal, RHQ will develop micro-political knowledge strategies to increase alignment with CHQ. As an agent, RHQ develops micro-political knowledge strategies to pursue its self-interests. Having identified different RHQ agency roles, the authors develop a conceptual model that outlines how alignment and self-interest-seeking behaviours from RHQ are manifest through different micro-political knowledge strategies in its agency relationship with CHQ.

Contract farming (CF) agreements are presently being restructured to form part of more complex Inclusive Business (IB) set-ups. Additional instruments, alongside CF, are implemented to overcome the challenges of CF and to adapt to the policy environment in which the different stakeholders operate. This paper develops a theoretical framework that gives insight into how these complex entities are structured and operate in a developing country context. This theoretical analysis takes a holistic approach by adopting elements of existing theories to form a new critical research paradigm: (i) Resource Dependence Theory to incorporate the wider operating environment in which the two cases operate, (ii) Transaction Cost Economics to explain the internal efficiency of the different models, and (iii) Agency Theory to account for the safeguard mechanisms. This new framework is then tested on two complex IBs that aim to integrate smallholder farmers into the commercial value chain, but which have each implemented a different institutional set-up developed around CF arrangements. It finds that a high dependence by the offtaker in the first case study stimulates a higher level of commitment and investment by this stakeholder in the contract arrangement. In turn, this increases the asset specificity aspect, which then requires safeguards to ensure the smallholders adhere to the contractual agreement. A higher dependency in this particular study also resulted in a higher number of smallholders being engaged in the contract, requiring mechanisms to efficiently monitor and coordinate them.

The purpose of this study is examine how agency theory and stewardship theory lead to different firm-level outcomes on an array of different outcomes. Based on these differences, we argue for the development of an agent-steward measurement scale, which will help researchers classify chief executive officers (CEOs) along an agent-steward continuum. This, in turn, will spur research to predict and test CEO behaviors and firm-level outcomes. Agency theory suggests CEOs take advantage of their powerful positions to maximize their personal economic utility, whereas stewardship theory suggests CEOs are motivated through intrinsic awards and will balance their interests with those of other stakeholders. We use these theories to examine possible differences in CEO behaviors. This is important because different CEO behaviors might lead to differing impacts on important firm-level outcomes. This paper reviews the relevant agency and stewardship literatures, then offers propositions regarding CEO behaviors from agent and steward perspectives.

Taking into account that it is in the nature of the modern corporation that risks are distributed over several agents, we discuss in this paper the organisational behaviour as it results from such dispersal of responsibilities for both the principal and the agent. We explore the hypothesis that dispersal of responsibilities could be the result or a cause of a lack of consensus between the principal and the agent. Our findings suggest that a dispersal of responsibilities has a negative impact on the principal-agent relationship and that it represents a foundation for theoretical and empirical approaches to organisational behaviour. We find that agent perceptions of a dispersal of responsibilities are linked to his/her resistance to the principal's interests, but this relationship is deeper than was suggested by previous research. However, if the sharing of responsibilities does not run parallel to that, we may have as a result what we call an agency problem.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the presence, expertise, independence, size and meetings of the audit committee (AC) have an effect on corporate insolvency. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use 1,835 firm-year observations for 98 insolvent and 269 solvent UK-listed non-financial firms from 1994 to 2011. Findings: The authors find that corporate insolvency is negatively related to thenieetings and independence of the AC but not to AC's presence and size. The authors also observe that financial expertise on the AC is not related to corporate insolvency. These associations are robust to different specifications, while after controlling for board composition, board size, the number of board meetings, CEO duality, financial and firm characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The study's approach has two main limitations: neglect of small and medium private unquoted firms and more regulated corporate governance environment. Practical implications - The findings lend support to the continual use of the agency theory as an explanation in understanding the role of the analytical lens through which to study the efficacy of the AC in reducing the likelihood of insolvency. Social implications: The findings support continued efforts to strengthen boards' ACs in the wake of high profile insolvencies. The findings will assist regulators and firm management to design appropriate ACs (e.g. independence) and processes (e.g. number of meetings). Originality/value: The authors provide empirical evidence on the impact of the AC on firm insolvency in the UK context, an important but neglected area in research.

Currently, it is commonly accepted that the not-invented-here syndrome (NIHS) refers to internal resistance against external knowledge, and that it has devastating consequences on innovation performance (IP). Nevertheless, studies on organisational practices that neutralise NIHS are incipient. Moreover, it is accepted that innovation capabilities (ICs) are perhaps the organisational routines with the highest positive influence on IP. In this study, based on the organisational routine framework and agency theory, we propose a model in which ICs (i.e., client-focused, marketing-focused, and technology-focused ICs) have a confounding effect on an NIHS-IP relation. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the proposed model with survey data from a sample of 161 service firms. We find that (1) NIHS influences IP negatively, and (2) ICs weaken NIHS-IP relation, practically turning it null. Finally, this paper provides insights for researchers and managers regarding a possible overestimation of the negative effects of NIHS on the literature.

It is a common belief that CEOs must delegate to be successful. We hesitate to support this generalization and investigate how the distribution of responsibility within top management teams (TMTs) can influence the likelihood of a CEO's dismissal. Consistent with an agency theory perspective, our results indicate that CEOs may choose not to delegate their responsibilities to other executive TMT members, so as to benefit from an increased information asymmetry vis-a-vis the board of directors. Taking the resource-based view as a complementary theoretical perspective, we find that non-delegating CEOs benefit from their greater firm-specific knowledge, which the board of directors considers as a valuable resource that should be retained. Our work also demonstrates that a more intense CEO-TMT interaction weakens the relation between non-delegation and the likelihood of CEO dismissal. In sum, our research shows that the CEO's delegation decision does not necessarily lead to a competence distribution that is in the firm's best interest; rather, it reflects a complex interplay between the potentially opportunistic career interests of the CEO, the involvement of other TMT members and the board of directors.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the topic of agency problems in service ecosystem for innovation. It specifically explores the corporate policies aimed at encouraging collaboration, so as to prevent opportunistic behaviors within the innovation hub, where service exchange is central for innovation creation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply the agency theory framework to the hub as a service ecosystem in order to understand how it would be possible to address agency problems between the firm (principal) and the other actors of the hub (agents), involved in peer-to-peer interactions. The research explores the case study of a high-tech leading company, which is a pioneer in the use of the hub for supporting its innovation process. Data are collected through semi-structured interviews to some key informants of the Hub Program regarding structure and organization; participation; incentives and monitoring. Findings - In service ecosystems, corporate policies are based on commitment, psycho-social incentives and social control may encourage collaboration among the actors, thus contributing to align their own interests to the hub's innovation common goals. Research limitations/implications - Given the exploratory nature of the research, the paper is based on a single case study. Thus, it is not possible to either generalize the results or evaluate any statistical correlation. Practical implications - The paper provides a wider awareness about the benefits and risks related to service ecosystems for innovation, and advise both managers and practitioners about appropriate corporate policies to better address the agency problems. Originality/value - This study enhances the literature on service ecosystems, highlighting the importance of corporate policies in preventing opportunistic behavior of actors in order to ensure the value co-creation process. It also extends the agency theory application to informal and not-hierarchical contexts. Besides, it suggests practitioners a way to reconcile the different interests of the firm and the other hub's participants. (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

The article tries to examine the relationship between equity ownership held by the foreign institutional investors and firm performance both in a static and a dynamic framework. We also examine how the relationship differs between group-affiliated and stand-alone firms. By employing the 2SLS panel data estimation technique on 137 BSE listed Indian firms, the study finds that foreign institutional investment has a positive influence on the firm performance as measured through Tobin's Q and ROA.Application of linear dynamic panel data estimation in a dynamic framework also yields similar results.The latter method also shows that FII has a positive significant effect on Tobin's Q in group-affiliated firms. The results are analysed from the perspective of a multi-theoretic approach consisting of agency theory, information asymmetry theory, institutional theory and resource dependency theory.

This paper examines how family firms substitute corporate governance with family governance and self-governance at different stages of their development. We argue that the types of agency problems that family firms face as they pass from one generation to the next determine the extent to which these mechanisms can be used as substitutes for one another. Our empirical investigation provides evidence that in the early stages of a family firm's life cycle, instruments of self-governance lessen the need for mechanisms of corporate governance, whereas in the later stages, instruments of family governance can substitute for mechanisms of corporate governance.

Diversification is a common goal for many small firms, yet research examining whether small firm ownership structure influences their use of the tactic is limited. As such, this paper provides one of the first empirical investigations of the subject by examining whether the presence of a corporate parent positively influences the likelihood that small firms will utilize diversification. Results indicate that small firms with corporate parents are more likely to use both related and unrelated diversification than comparable firms that are independently owned. Such findings are noteworthy because diversification may be more beneficial for small, independently owned firms, yet small, subsidiary firms appear to be better able to utilize diversification. Implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2017 Small Business Institute.

Research question: While marketing outsourcing may offer a clear means for revenue generation and cost efficiency, there is a need to go beyond the outsourcing decision itself to address 'how' outsourcing can be managed successfully. Differing to existing studies, this study examines the dynamic nature of marketing outsourcing from the rights holder and agency perspectives in an overlooked setting. Research methods: Qualitative data were generated from semi-structured interviews with marketing managers from 30 English Premier League (EPL) football clubs and with 10 marketing agency account managers. The clubs included in this study had all participated in the EPL, and all 10 marketing agencies interviewed had been contracted at some point in time to these clubs. Results and findings: By capturing both sides of the rights holder/agency interface, this study includes a neglected perspective (i.e. agency) to more accurately examine the principal-agency relationship in marketing outsourcing. The findings add greater nuance to the drivers/motivations and barriers/constraints that are typically cited in sport management and marketing studies, providing a new framework to understand the relationship dynamic and guide successful sport marketing outsourcing initiatives. Implications: Though outsourcing can be an impactful business decision, the success of marketing outsourcing in football is dependent upon the balance of conditions across the rights holder/agency interface. Specifically, while pushing factors may contribute to effective marketing outsourcing, resisting factors undermine the rights holder-agency relationship. However, in nurturing key necessary features both parties can limit resisting factors and emphasise push factors for shared value creation. (c) 2017 European Association for Sport Management.

Some business ethicists view agency theory as a cautionary tale - a proof that it is impossible to carry out successful economic interactions in the absence of ethical behaviour. The cautionary-tale view presents a nuanced normative characterisation of agency, but its unilateral focus betrays a limited understanding of the structure of social interaction. This article moves beyond unilateralism by presenting a descriptive and normative argument for a bilateral cautionary-tale view. Specifically, we discuss hat swaps and role dualism in asymmetric-information principal-agent relationships and argue that the norm of reciprocity can function as a moral solution to agency risks in adverse-selection and moral-hazard problems. Our bilateral cautionary-tale formulation extends the normative boundaries of agency theory, while leaving the fundamental economic assumptions of agency theory intact.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine an association between board demographics and corporate performance using a sample of Pakistani firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange in the 2014 year. Design/methodology/approach: This study is unique in that corporate performance is examined using a mixture of performance measures: accounting-based measures (return on assets), market-based measures (Tobin's Q, earnings per share, and total return) and economic profit measures (economic value added). Findings: The results of this research show a significant positive relationship between board size, minority representation on the board and the appointment of a family director and enhanced firm performance. However, contrary to expectations, the authors also find that instead of adding value, the appointment of independent directors to Pakistani firm boards negatively impacts firm value. Originality/value: This study adds to a growing body of empirical evidence that suggests that agency theory-based corporate governance recommendations adopted in developed economies may not be relevant to emerging economy firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the importance of socioemotional wealth (SEW) to family firms in Poland viewed through the lens of the events surrounding the first hostile takeover bid of the post-communist era on the Warsaw Stock Exchange when the clothing company Vistula & Wolczanka (V&W) made an unsolicited, leveraged bid for the family-controlled jewelry company W. Kruk. Design/methodology/approach: The 2008 takeover and its aftermath are described in the context of the corporate governance and legal environment in Poland. The case study events demonstrate the connection between firm behavior and SEW theory. Findings: After the acquisition of W. Kruk by V&W, the Kruk family purchased stock in the newly named Vistula Group and gained influence over the supervisory board in concert with a business ally, eventually wresting back control of the company in the style of a Pac-Man "defense." The case study illustrates the importance of SEW in family firm takeovers. Research limitations/implications: The case study design has limitations for generalizability. Nevertheless the research highlights the important role of SEW preservation in understanding the market for corporate control of listed family firms in Poland. Practical implications: Understanding the reaction by family firms to takeover bids requires recognition that there is a tradeoff between financial and SEW considerations, not just financial gains and losses. Originality/value: The case study demonstrates the importance of SEW to family firms and suggests that the balance of power in takeovers on the Polish stock market rests with incumbent management.

Purpose: Based on agency perspective on temporary agency workers, the purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between firms' agency problems and agency cost on agency workers; moreover, intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation are considered in seeking to understand how they moderate this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Hsinchu Science Park directory of corporate affiliations as a sample frame, the authors adopted a paired questionnaire which included two parts in order to consider the possible problem of common method variances. The first part is completed by the manager of the firms and the second part is completed by his/her temporary agency workers. Finally, 94 firms completed questionnaires, providing a total sample of 94 R&D managers and 458 temporary agency workers. The rate of participation was 31.65 percent. Findings: Using a questionnaire survey of 94 high-tech firms, from which a total of 94 R&D managers and 458 temporary agency workers participated, the results show that firms' agency problems have a positive influence on the agency cost of monitoring temporary agency workers. In addition, while this relationship is negatively moderated by extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation has a non-significant moderating effect. Originality/value: The managers of firms should consider not only the short-term flexibility of employing temporary agency workers, but also the long-term cultivation of promoting great agency workers. This could maximize the efficiency of the interaction between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Of course, the firms should think about how to reduce the agency problems created by goal conflict, information asymmetry and risk sharing with temporary agency workers, because this could also provide a chance for the firms to decrease agency costs spent on monitoring.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how executive pay schemes influence managerial efficiency, which the authors measure as the risk-adjusted firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilized hierarchical regression to test the hypotheses. Findings: The authors find that as options constitute a higher percentage of total compensation packages, subsequent firm risk-adjusted performance declines. The authors also find an inverse relationship between TMT stock ownership and risk-adjusted performance. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that the firm stakeholders should reconsider the likely influence of option-based incentives and equity holdings on the risk-adjusted performance. Originality/value: Most executive compensation research focuses on either the pay-to-performance or pay-to-risk links. However, in this paper, the authors combine both the performance and risk dimensions simultaneously. (c) 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand how higher education institutions (HEIs) in developing countries can migrate their physical administrative work environment to a virtual platform to improve information management. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs an interpretive case study approach and a combined lens of activity and agency theories to understand how a developing country HEI attempted to improve its information management by migrating from a physical to a virtual administrative work environment. Findings: The findings show how contradictions caused by role conflicts, administrative staff's fear of elimination and external consultants' limited understanding of administrative rules and procedures can hamper work environment virtualisation. Such challenges should be resolved in order to achieve a successful virtual work environment that supports timely and accurate information management. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by its single case perspective in one developing country. However, future studies can compare the experiences of HEIs from developed and developing countries in order to account for contextual differences. Practical implications: The study provides practitioners with insight into how to address conflicts between employees (as potential users) and external consultants during virtual system development and implementation. In particular, role conflict, fear of eliminating some administrative staff and consultants' limited understanding of administrative work procedures should be resolved for successful work environment virtualisation. Originality/value: The study is the first attempt to offer rich insight into the challenges associated with administrative work environment virtualisation for improved information management in HEIs, through the principal-agent relationship.

Grounded in agency theory, this study explores whether the separation of ownership (by shareholders) and control (by managers) in firms is an essential determinant of the valuation effect of joint ventures (JVs). This is achieved by examining the efficacy of incentive alignment mechanisms and their contingency effects. Based on a sample of 963 U.S. firms' JV investments, the results show that poor JV performance is linked to lower levels of executive ownership and reduced equity compensation. The possibility of managers acting for their own self-interest in corporate JV investments is further supported by the stronger positive performance effect of incentive alignment mechanisms documented when firms have a higher level of free cash flow or undertake JVs in unrelated business domains. Both performance measures of short-run announcement effects and long-run stock returns yield similar results. Our results underscore the importance of governing executives' self-interested actions in their JV engagements. (c) 2017

Purpose: This paper aims to present case study evidence on the changes in the relations between chief executive officers (CEOs) of large firms and shareholders in the past three decades of the twentieth century. In line with insights from agency theory, the CEOs have experienced increased scrutiny from their principals, the shareholders. This development has affected financial communication and investor relations as well as stock market prices. Design/methodology/approach: The Dutch electronics firm Royal Philips NV in the transition period of 1971-2001 has been studied using publicly available disclosures and stock market prices. A descriptive case study approach is combined with event study methodology. Findings: It was observed that the increased emphasis on shareholder interests has affected the interactions between Philips' respective CEOs and the shareholders' reactions to strategic decisions as measured by stock price changes. Around the beginning of the twenty-first century, clarity and openness in CEO communication was the norm and deviations were punished with volatile stock prices. Research limitations/implications: The study relies on publicly available data. Originality/value: The case study of Philips can be extrapolated to other exchange-listed firms in the late twentieth century, which faced changed expectations about the role of the CEO, investor relations and the CEO's accountability toward shareholders.

The purpose of this research is to test whether management compensation and auditor reputation motivate management perform earnings management, its effect on companies stock return. This research use companies size, sales growth and financial leverage as control variables. The research hypotheses were tested using ordinary least square regression. The sample of this research are companies listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange from year 2011 to 2015. The amount of samples that fulfill the criterion are 134 companies. This research take 54 companies as other samples for process of comparing with criterion that the companies were equal size firm and same industries. The theory that based this research is agency theory and signaling theory. The independent variable of earnings management is proxied by accrual discretionary and calculated by Modified Jones Model. This research reveal indeed the management compensation and auditor reputation motivate companies management performed earnings management, and influence negatively toward earnings management. Furthermore, earnings management influence negatively toward companies stocks return.

To this day, corporate governance remains the topic of the most intense discussions among scholars, especially concerning its legal and regulatory development over the past few years. Since most of the current developments deal with global concerns about the impact of recent financial crises and their related scandals, academics have not yet been able to settle the score with long-standing matters of corporate governance. Indeed, under the significant influence of an Anglo-Saxon culture, largely disseminated among the literature, the prevailing theoretical framework of corporate governance is still based on a series of preposterous presumptions. These outdated presumptions appear to originate more from rhetorical statements than any deep analysis of the issues characterizing the early era of modern corporate governance. Because over the years they have fulfilled their task of supporting the development of capitalism throughout the industrial world and providing a legitimate rationale for corporate owners to adopt certain aggressive and reckless behaviors, these corporate governance presumptions have since been held up as the cornerstones of an efficient social economy, profitable for all and everyone. With the global economy having encountered a few unfortunate setbacks over the past decades, it is important to question the legal value of these presumptions, as they might have more to do with unsubstantiated myths than any extensive legal or scientific work. The aim of this article is not to present the paramount truth on this topic, but rather to highlight the discrepancies between what have always been considered as the foundations of corporate governance, and what corporate governance should have been had it not been implemented with the sole intention of nurturing certain illegitimate purposes of modern capitalism, such as shareholder primacy or financial profitability. Therefore, this article explores five typical corporate governance myths: (1) the corporation as a nexus of contracts, (2) the shareholders as owners of the corporation, (3) the shareholders as the only residual creditors of the corporation, (4) the effectiveness of shareholder activism, and (5) corporate governance as a legitimate rationale for shareholder primacy. The aggregate theory of corporations - which maintains that the corporation is nothing less than a nexus of contracts and that it may only benefit the shareholders - held its own throughout most of the twentieth century, but now finds itself faced with some more inclusive and realistic theories of unprecedented rigor, such as the consideration of the corporation as an institution pursuing a social purpose. Considering shareholders as the owners of the corporation might therefore be a thing of the past as well. Undeniably, what the recent ups and downs on the financial markets have shown the world is that corporate directors ought to be considered as the central core of the corporation, acting collectively, but independently from the shareholders, and promoting the success of the company, in the interests of all corporate stakeholders. Consequently, shareholders can no longer be considered the owners of the corporation, dictating to directors how they must govern, because the corporation has its own legal personality, effectively managed and controlled by the board of directors. Subsequently, neither can they be considered as the only residual creditors of the corporation, as all the other stakeholders' investments are also at stake. More importantly, while shareholders have become more active over the years, the effectiveness of their involvement in the management of the corporation has been questionable, as they often lack long-term vision and considerations for other stakeholders' interests. Finally, it is quite arguable to still promote shareholders' primacy in today's world, as law, jurisprudence and doctrine have, timidly but still, embraced the stakeholder theory which states that the board of directors has to consider the whole corporation's interests first, rather than simply focusing on short term profitability for the shareholders.

While agency theory has been an important part of accounting academic research, many researchers have suggested that other theories should also be considered. One such theory is the theory of cognitive dissonance. In this study, the authors develop competing hypotheses based on agency theory and the theory of cognitive dissonance regarding the decision to record an impairment of goodwill. Using an archival research methodology, they test the hypotheses on a sample of 2,274 firm-year observations. The results are consistent with the theory of cognitive dissonance even after controlling for variables that have been found to be significant under agency theory. The authors conclude that there is strong evidence to suggest that agency theory does not uniquely explain the results of management decisions as seen through financial reporting data.

Purpose: Previous research leads to contrasting hypotheses about the relationship between extra effort of employees and the level of job security. According to agency theory, job security leads to lower levels of extra effort and social exchange theory argues that extra effort requires job security. The purpose of this paper is to formulate a set of hypotheses based on these theories. Besides considering them as mutually exclusive, they are integrated into a single theoretical framework that argues that both theories can apply, depending on the conditions and social context (in terms of the social security system). Design/methodology/approach: Data from the International Social Survey Program (2005) including 22 countries from around the globe are analyzed using multilevel analysis. Findings: The study provides evidence that social security moderates the relationship between job security and extra effort. Originality/value: This study differs from previous research as it focuses on two sides of insecurity in the workplace and because it analyzes a large data set to include institutional factors.

This paper extends Jensen and Meckling's agency cost theory. A clockwise rotation of their budget constraint represents better performance by agents compared to owners and higher firm values. This extension incorporates Alchian and Demsetz's view of the firm, wherein firm values increase when managers are employed. It is then sub-optimal for owner-managers to directly expropriate non-pecuniary benefits through the firm as in Jensen and Meckling. It is instead Pareto optimal that owner-managers who seek to expropriate non-pecuniary benefits do so using the firm's higher value, and trading it for the non-pecuniary benefits they desire in the open market.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between board dependence, antitakeover provisions and their influence on corporate entrepreneurship (CE). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses agency theory as a framework to expand on the board dependence-CE relationship by injecting the moderating role of antitakeover provisions to the model. Using data collected from 350 publicly traded firms, a panel regression analyses was conducted on both innovation and venturing components of CE. Findings: The findings of this study show a negative relationship between board dependence and CE. Further this study shows that such a negative relationship becomes weaker when higher levels of antitakeover provisions are injected into the model. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of large publicly traded firms within the information and manufacturing sectors, and so our findings may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other variables representing CE (e.g. new product introductions) may add to this line of research in the future. Practical implications: Understanding the role of board of directors within a firm may help foster CE throughout the organization. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by incorporating the influence of environmental factors (e.g. antitakeover provisions) and examining the relationship between corporate governance and CE using both measures of innovation and venturing.

Policy development and implementation is not only an attribute of a political administration, but also ofits bureaucracy. The natures of, and connection between, a political administration and its bureaucracyis important if one is interested in creating a comparative measure of that efficacy across administrationsor political systems. A traditional blueprint model of a bureaucracy comes from Weber, seen to be a servicingbody for the implementation of political policy decisions resulting from a process of governance.An alternative model arises from the fictional works of Kafka, which is underpinned by a firm conceptualbasis of a bureaucracy that confronts that of Weber. This paper explores the nature of bureaucracies,representing them as complex and dynamic. Agency theory will be used to model bureaucracies, andcomparisons will be made between the Weber and Kafka conceptualisation. The outcome suggests thatany attempts to measure comparative efficacy across political systems or administrations may well leadto failure due to the distinctions in the nature of the bureaucracies that they maintain.

This chapter explores the possible connections between Behavioural Accounting Research and agency theory. To begin, we describe agency theory and its origins. Given our focus on behavioural accounting, we concentrate on how the individual is influenced by accounting processes and reports, rather than on how accounting leads to outcomes based on the aggregate behaviour of market participants. In our view, Behavioural Accounting Research is linked to agency theory by explaining the role compensation, information, contracts and monitoring play in agency theory. A sample of research is used to illustrate how behavioural accounting researchers have employed agency theory in their papers. Finally, possible research directions are discussed.

Corporate entrepreneurship requires senior executives to evaluate proposals for investment and projects from corporate entrepreneurs. Properties of technology make this evaluation difficult, creating a knowledge gap. Whether through opportunism, overconfidence, and overconfidence, corporate entrepreneurs are likely to induce overinvestment in projects, perhaps at the expense of corporate goals. In this paper we analyze this problem using the tools of agency theory, and identify a solution, staged commitment, used and useful in many areas of business. (c) 2018 ACRN Oxford Ltd.

This study develops a combined agency-resource dependence perspective and applies it to the study of interlocking directorates. It suggests that interlocking directorates may exert either a positive or a negative effect on subsequent firm performance, depending on the firm's relative resources, power imbalance, ownership concentration, and CEO ownership. A test on a sample of 145 Italian companies provides support for hypothesized effects. This study suggests that integrating agency and resource dependence theories provides a higher-order explanation of firm performance and helps advance both agency and resource dependence theories.

Research Summary: We investigate whether and how family ownership and management influence firms' internationalization strategies in an emerging economy in which family firms are dominant. Anchoring on the willingness and ability framework and drawing on the socioemotional wealth perspective and agency theory, we theorize how the heterogeneity among family firms in their ownership structures, concentration, and family involvement in management shapes the firms' internationalization strategies. We also theorize how certain contingencies, such as the presence of foreign institutional ownership and family management, moderate the relationship between family ownership and internationalization strategy. We test our predictions by using a proprietary, longitudinal panel dataset of 303 leading family firms from India and find support for most of our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Internationalization has emerged as a dominant strategy for firms in a globally interconnected world. We observe that ownership structure and management have significant bearing on internationalization strategies of family firms, as family owners and managers are more averse to internationalization. Family firms' aversion to internationalize is more pronounced when families can exercise greater control on firms' actions through the combined effect of higher family ownership (primarily through strategic control) and family's participation in management (through strategic, administrative, and operational control). However, certain contingencies, such as the higher ownership of foreign institutions and presence of professional managers, help business families improve their understanding of international markets, reduce the fear of the unknown, and better appreciate the benefits of internationalization, thereby aiding greater internationalization of family firms.

This paper proposes an agency model for headquarters-subsidiary relationships in multinational organizations with headquarters as the principal and the subsidiary as the agent. As a departure from classical agency theory, our model is developed for the unit level of analysis and considers two root causes of the agency problem--self-interest and bounded rationality. We argue that in the organizational setting, one cannot assume absolute self-interest and perfect rationality of agents (subsidiaries) but should allow them to vary. We explain subsidiary-level variation through a set of internal organizational and external social conditions in which the headquarters-subsidiary agency dyad is embedded. We then discuss several agency scenarios reflecting various levels of self-interest and rationality that lead to different manifestations of the agency problem. The proposed framework can inform more relevant applications of the agency perspective in organizational studies and motivate future research. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Management researchers have investigated how corporate governance mechanisms influence corporate social responsibility (CSR). The previous literature has been largely based on agency theory, which emphasizes the roles of effective monitoring and incentive alignment, but the empirical evidence has been mixed. This inconsistency may result from the assumption that each governance mechanism functions independently, even though they interact with one another to affect CSR. On the basis of a perspective of bundle of governance mechanisms, we examined whether multiple governance mechanisms act as complements or substitutes for each other in promoting CSR. Using a panel sample of U.S. firms for the years 2004 to 2010, we found that multiple governance mechanisms mainly act as substitutes to promote CSR. Our findings suggest that a similar level of CSR can be achieved with different combinations of governance mechanisms. Our study contributes to the fields of both corporate governance and CSR in theory and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Different design choices in the controls used to manage performance often lead to a range of unintended consequences, which have profound effects on individuals and organizations. This paper presents a mixed review (both systematic and eclectic) of the literature on the unintended consequences of performance management systems, and develops a typology to explain how and why they occur. It finds that the most salient unintended consequences of directive performance management systems are gaming, information manipulation, selective attention, illusion of control and relationships transformation. It argues that these consequences exist as a result of limiting factors such as ignorance, error, short-term concerns, fundamental values, self-fulfilling forecasts and changes in social relationships. The emerging typology-based theory suggests that the choice of control mechanisms is based on two key assumptions concerning goal-alignment and goal-uncertainty that relate back to ideas in agency theory and stewardship theory. It concludes that, in the design of performance management systems, the more the 'assumed' reality about the state of goal-alignment and goal-uncertainty diverges from the 'real' state of affairs, the more the resultant system is likely to create perverse unintended consequences, leading to poor organizational outcomes.

Management literature is currently giving growing conceptual and empirical attention to the peculiarity and relevance of entrepreneurial attitudes in family firms, with divergent outcomes. Aiming at concretizing the effects of these attitudes, denoted by the entrepreneurial orientation construct, on family business performance and considering that family dynamics come into play in this relationship, we particularly investigate the impact of control mechanisms and family-related goals. Findings are based on a sample of 180 family firms and show that Proactiveness and Autonomy are particularly relevant to financial performance. Agency-problems avoiding control mechanisms moderate the effect of Innovativeness and Autonomy, while socioemotional wealth (SEW) goals moderate the effect of Risk-Taking, respectively. The usage of these mechanisms and managing SEW goals provide opportunities for a more efficient exploitation of entrepreneurial attitudes. (c) 2017, The Author(s).

Research Summary: Though research has focused on the ascent and acceptance of female CEOs, the post-promotion circumstances female CEOs face remain unclear. In this study, we focus on a critical post-promotion circumstance: the board chair-CEO relationship. Drawing on the gender stereotype literature, agency theory, and stewardship theory, we posit that firms appointing a female CEO are more likely to adopt a collaboration board chair orientation and less likely to adopt a control orientation. We further predict this effect is attenuated by female board representation. Using a sample of new S&P 1500 CEOs, we find support for our predictions regarding the collaboration orientation but not the control orientation. This research provides some evidence of benevolent sexism in the boardroom, with female directors acting as a countervailing influence. Managerial Summary: Whereas the notion that females encounter a glass ceiling on their path toward CEO is well documented, the conditions female CEOs encounter after promotion are less understood. The relationship between the board chair and the CEO is one important post-promotion condition. Board chairs can focus on monitoring and/or working together with the CEO. We suggest board chairs are more likely to work in close collaboration with female CEOs than with male CEOs. We attribute this to benevolent sexism, which explains that board chairs are more likely to collaborate with female CEOs because they view females as more conducive to, and in need of, this type of relationship. We also suggest this benevolent sexism is less prevalent when there are more females on the board. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to resolve a core issue in project management research and practice - inconsistent terminology of key project roles. This inconsistency has negative consequences on the quality and impact of research in this area. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an analysis of the literature and project management standards to identify both agreed-upon and inconsistent project role terms. Based on role and agency theories, the authors propose a consistent terminology. Findings: The authors found consensus regarding four terms: project manager, project team, project management office, and program manager. However, the authors also found conflicting definitions and misuse concerning other terms, as well as use of the same title for different roles (e.g. customer, sponsor, champion). The authors define the ten core project roles and the two project entities with which they are associated. Originality/value: The proposed role definitions and clear distinction between the two project entities offer clarity, reliance on existing consensus, avoidance of conflicts of interest, and clear separation of principal and agent roles. The implementation of these definitions will improve communications and enhance quality within and between both the research and the practice communities. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Offering product-service systems (PSS) arguably results in economic, environmental and social benefits but also entails significant challenges related to relational dynamics between the provider and the customer. Although prior studies suggest that adverse customer behaviour during PSS provision is likely, they provide a limited theoretical understanding of the conceptualization of such relational problems and, more importantly, offer few possible ways to address these problems. By applying the lens of agency theory, this study examines PSS provider-customer relational problems and solutions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify agency problems and propose mechanisms to mitigate adverse customer behaviour in PSS provision. Based on a multiple case study approach involving two manufacturing companies, several results are presented. First, we identify and describe two underlying reasons for adverse customer behaviour. These reasons are associated with goal differentiation and monitoring challenges. Second, different agency mechanisms (i.e. sharing, monitoring and trust) are presented as approaches to mitigate the likelihood of adverse customer behaviour. The matching of agency problems with agency mechanisms to mitigate these problems lays the groundwork for developing a framework for agency situation evaluation during the formation and ongoing phases of the PSS agreement. In addition, the choice of agency mechanism is found to be correlated with the maturity and type of customer relationship and can change over time as new customers become known and then become loyal. The proposed framework has major theoretical implications for the PSS literature as well as managerial implications for large manufacturing companies engaged in PSS provision. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The dynamic capabilities approach explains how firms create and sustain competitive advantages in dynamic environments if they exhibit technical and evolutionary fitness. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are not only exposed to industry dynamism, but also to dynamism in the different country environments in which they operate. Understanding the dynamic capabilities of MNEs thus requires analyzing not only the firm dimension, but also the country dimension and firm-country interactions of international business. Building on the analytical disaggregation of dynamic capabilities into: (1) sensing opportunities (or threats), (2) seizing (or neutralizing) them via expedient investments, and (3) transforming the firm and its resources and capabilities accordingly, we conceptualize the relationships between the dominant logics behind MNEs' sensing, seizing, and transforming and evolutionary fitness. First, we propose that a dominant logic behind sensing, based on an application of resource-based view thinking to the international business context (which we develop to separately explain the three component parts of MNEs' competitive advantages, i.e., non-location bound firm-specific advantages, country-specific advantages, and location bound firm-specific advantages), positively moderates the effect of sensing processes and routines on evolutionary fitness. Second, we propose that a dominant logic behind seizing, based on internalization theory thinking, positively moderates the effect of seizing processes and routines on evolutionary fitness. Third, we propose that a dominant logic behind transforming, based on a broad agency perspective extended to the international business context, positively moderates the effect of transforming processes and routines on evolutionary fitness.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of internal corporate governance mechanisms on insurance companies' risk-taking in the UK context. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a panel data of all listed insurance companies on FTSE 350 over the 2005-2014 period. Multivariate regression techniques are used to estimate the effect of internal corporate governance mechanisms on insurance companies' risk-taking. Findings: The results show that the board size and board meetings are significantly and negatively related to risk-taking. In contrast, the results show that board independence and audit committee size are statistically insignificant but negatively related to risk-taking. The findings are robust to alternative measures and endogeneities. Research limitations/implications: The findings have important implications for investors, managers, regulators of financial institutions and effectiveness of corporate governance reforms that have been pursued. Investors may further rely on internal corporate governance attributes to form expectations about risk-taking behaviour. Insurance companies need strong governance, as well as effective accounting and financial reporting standards, to enable proper insights into the company's financial position. Originality/value: This study contributes to the corporate governance literature and creates significant evidence regarding the role of corporate governance in constraining risk-taking behaviour in an industry with significantly complex context.

This systematic literature review analyses the determinants and consequences of executive compensation-related shareholder activism and say-on-pay (SOP) votes. The review covers 71 empirical articles published between January 1995 and September 2017. The studies are reviewed within an empirical research framework that separates the reasons for shareholder activism and SOP voting dissent as input factor on the one hand and the consequences of shareholder pressure as output factor on the other. This procedure identifies the five most important groups of factors in the literature: the level and structure of executive compensation, firm characteristics, corporate governance mechanisms, shareholder structure and stakeholders. Of these, executive compensation and firm characteristics are the most frequently examined. Further examination reveals that the key assumptions of neoclassical principal agent theory for both managers and shareholders are not always consistent with recent empirical evidence. First, behavioral aspects (such as the perception of fairness) influence compensation activism and SOP votes. Second, non-financial interests significantly moderate shareholder activism. Insofar, we recommend integrating behavioral and non-financial aspects into the existing research. The implications are analyzed, and new directions for further research are discussed by proposing 19 different research questions. (c) 2018 University of Florida, Fisher School of Accounting

In this study, we draw upon insights from agency theory to examine the impact of managerial political ties on cost of debt and also to explore whether corporate governance mediates this impact. We hypothesize that political ties reduce financial reporting quality, disclosure of non-financial information and board independence, and are therefore associated with higher interest rates. We also hypothesize that the negative effect of political ties on the cost of debt will be stronger if firms borrow from privately-owned banks versus government-owned banks. Using data from Ghana, we find support for our direct and moderation hypotheses; political ties are associated with high interest rates and poor corporate governance. However, we do not find evidence of mediation. Altogether, the findings reveal the dark side of political connections and highlight the cost of political embeddedness in emerging credit markets.

Purpose: A shortage of skills is recognized as a major source of risk in supply chain networks. This study uses two independent organizational theories to explain how to build applicable skills for continuous availability of appropriate supply chain talents. The purpose of this paper is to propose an integrated framework that links human agency theory, social capital theory and supply chain skill. Design/methodology/approach: This framework is analyzed in third party logistics (3PL) organizations by confirmatory factor analysis and tested using a survey. After pre-testing by six academics and six practitioners, and following the total design method, the data were collected from 183 3PL organizations in India. Data were checked to ensure no non-response bias. Research hypotheses were tested using WarpPLS-structural equation modeling. Findings: A primary finding offers guidance to 3PL managers. Their driving role and mediating role of access to information and access to resources facilitate building supply chain skill. Leaders who invest in library, acquiring e-resources, offer financial support and create trust among employees are enablers of building supply chain skill. Originality/value: This study classified 14 supply chain skills into three categories as: managerial skill, quantitative skill and supply chain core skill. The study could be extended to similar companies in other developing countries. (c) 2018, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to provide a twofold empirical comparison: first, a comparison between the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on agency costs proxies and firm performance measures, and second, this comparison was used before and after the 2008 financial crisis, capturing two different economic states. Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression methods were applied to two data sets of non-financial firms incorporated in the FTSE ALL-Share index over the period 2005-2011. Findings: The results provide evidence that not all mechanisms lead to lower agency conflicts and/or higher firm performance. Ownership identity has a significant impact and the role of the governance mechanisms changes with the changes in the economic conditions surrounding the firm. Research limitations/implications: The results lend support to the notion that forcing a certain code of practice on firms to follow could compel them to move away from conflict reduction governance structures. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a comparison of empirical evidence for the impact of board characteristics and ownership identity on agency costs and firm performance by using a comprehensive set of corporate governance mechanisms. This comparison challenges the prior studies that use performance as an indirect proxy for lower agency costs. Additionally, it compares the impact of the governance mechanisms during two different economic conditions. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Agency theory emphasizes the role of outside directors in mitigating free cash flow (FCF) problems, such as overinvesting FCF's into negative NPV R&D projects. In this paper we draw on and extend agency theory to argue that the underinvestment of financial slack towards a persistently high R&D-intensity is actually a greater problem for high-tech firms. Specifically, we claim that inside directors play a critical role for the board in safeguarding R&D investment by monitoring the CEO, and mitigating informational asymmetries for independent directors. We test our theory using a panel-data set of S&P 1500 firms in R&D-intensive industries from 1997 to 2007. Our empirical analysis reveals that inside directors positively influence the relationship between financial slack and R&D-intensity, and that their ability to ensure cash holdings are used to preserve R&D matters the most during periods of financial distress.

Purpose: Agency theory suggests that divergences will occur when a principal, e.g. client, and agent e.g. a project manager, interests are different in the execution of a project. The purpose of this paper is to explore if the agency theory can explain the subtleties integral to the behaviours and relationships between players delivering a public-private-partnership (PPP) in the context of an international development (ID) project. The intra-/interpersonal dynamics include governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and private commercial service providers. The authors develop a conceptual framework and provide evidence from a case study of the testing of a Road Safety Toolkit in Kenya to explore several propositions. Design/methodology/approach: Extant literature identified application of the agency theory, and the development of a conceptual framework. A case study describing an ID project was used to validate the propositions prior to the expansion of a research instrument for data collection in the field. Findings: Through the lens of the agency theory and the limitations imposed by exploring a series of propositions, several insightful conclusions have been derived from the case. ID projects have particular nuisances that make them unique when compared to the majority of commercial applications. An added dimension and level of complexity is a consequence of the PPP incorporating government, NGOs and private corporations. The case exemplified the need for PPP ID projects to build on partner networks to influence and disseminate outcomes. Some agency problems were far less prominent than would normally be seen in a commercial project. Research limitations/implications: The methodologies presented in this paper need to be adapted and practiced in different kinds of ID projects in order to get confirmatory analytical results. The limitations imposed by the use of the single case, whilst drawing insightful conclusions, would necessitate greater testing in the field. Practical implications: Although the problems of the agency theory are well researched in the operations management literature, there is limited application to ID projects and no previous research within the context of a PPP. Therefore, this work is important for greater understanding of the specific issues associated with project delivery of an ID. Social implications: Conflicting goals between principals and agents are common for organisations, which in turn affect inter-relationships on an international footing. The agency theory has had little attention in the project management field, yet is fundamental to relationships and communication. Originality/value: There has been little research that explores the agency theory in the context of a PPP involving governments, NGOs and private commercial service providers, executed as an ID project. This work, therefore, exhibits new and novel findings. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The focus of this article is on public-private partnerships (PPPs). The aim is to both theoretically and empirically illustrate PPP agency problems in four PPP stages, as well as to identify potentially relevant solutions to the agency problems. The study employed a longitudinal case study of one PPP in a municipality in southern Sweden. Through an analysis based on interviews, observations, and documents, the study illustrates a number of agency problems faced by PPPs and highlights the importance of resource allocation, stakeholder management, and the creation of a common identity in reducing these problems.

This study examines reverse supply chains in the electronics industry. The analysis characterizes the flow of resources among firms in a reverse supply chain in the Norwegian electronics industry. The study subsequently examines influences of governance mechanisms and culture on the social, ecological, and economic performance in the supply chain. Based on principal-agency theory, the authors implicate collaboration, monitoring, and specific assets as determinants of the interfirm culture operating in the reverse supply chain. The interfirm culture and collaboration serve as antecedents to triple bottom line performance. Data collected with Norwegian electronics collectors indicate that collaboration and interfirm culture influence ecological, economic, and relational components of sustainable performance.

While academic researchers continue to debate the effect of board independence in increasing performance, its efficacy could also be reflected in whether firm performance is made more stable. Board governance activities are a constellation of actions aimed at managing agency costs and ensuring the viability of a company over time. The efficacy of such actions would, therefore, be reflected in a distal outcome, specifically, in lower firm performance variability. Boards that can control agency costs and limit both underinvestment and overinvestment would reduce a firm's deviation from its mean performance trajectory. Using a longitudinal sample of publicly traded companies in the United States, we find that board stability, board resource provision, and CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability. Board independence is not associated with performance variability. With increasing board independence, greater board stability and greater CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability, however, greater board resource provision is not associated with performance variability.

When citizens are actively engaged in e-government processes as co-creators it leads to e-government development. Citizen participation in e-government is a recent phenomenon where government is seeking more involvement of citizens through different platforms. Whether citizens' participation through social media platforms leads to e-government development has been a debate in literature. In this research study, the authors investigate whether social media usage influences government's role in e-government development. Power distance between government and citizen also plays a role in deciding the extent of e-participation in e-government. In this study, the authors examine the relationship between social media, power distance, citizen engagement and e-government development. Using customer focus theory and agency theory, this study establishes that e-participation initiative by government acts as a mediator in the relation between social media usage by citizen as well as power distance to e-government development.

Employee engagement via corporate social responsibility (CSR) involves conflicts of interest between firms, employees, and political institutions. We examined the international transfer of employees of an airline company as a case study of a CSR strategy based on human resource management. From the dual approach of multiple agency theory and a resource-based perspective, we found that by increasing worker mobility costs, the European Union hindered the firm's CSR strategy of employee engagement. This contrasts with the stated aim of the European Union to promote worker mobility. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

We investigate if agency theory effectively explains agency conflict in the context of a developing country namely, Pakistan. Utilising data from 26 semi-structured interviews, we found that in Pakistan, there is no variation in risk preferences of principals (minority shareholders) and agents (majority shareholders). We also found that remuneration packages and board independence are not effective tools for governing owner managers in Pakistan. Thus, policy makers must shift their focus from soft internal governance mechanisms of appropriate remuneration and board independence. We propose for a rigorous external audit function, and appointment of independent directors and external audit firms by regulator. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd

CEO compensation in family firms is affected by certain corporate governance characteristics, such as the generational stage of the firm (founder or descendant-controlled firms), the level of family involvement on the board of directors (lone or multiple family members sitting on the board) and the family status of the CEO (family or professional CEO). In this paper, we argue that moderating effects arise among these dimensions of heterogeneity. The results show that in firms owned by descendants, the presence of multiple family members is beneficial in lowering family CEO compensation, while the opposite is true in the presence of the founder. Moreover, within founder and descendant firms, the number of family representatives on the board exerts a strong influence on the compensation of family CEOs, whereas it does not affect the compensation of professional CEOs. The results also show that in certain family clusters, CEO compensation is higher than in nonfamily firms, thereby emphasizing that when comparing CEO compensation in family and nonfamily firms, it is important to consider the intersections among the heterogeneity dimensions of the governance of family firms. The findings of the paper contribute to the literature on the governance of family firms by showing that certain family firm types are more effective than others in keeping CEO compensation under control.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the doer effect of service failure (SF), good prior experience (GPE) and recovery on overall customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions for multi-agents in tourism service supply chain (TSSC). It specifically focuses on internal and external failure and recovery. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a 2x2x3 between-subjects experimental design with 12 diverse scenarios. It aims to examine the main effects of GPE and the interaction effects of SF and recovery on overall customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions. Findings: The main findings show that consumers do not show favorable behavioral outcomes when they have GPE with an affiliated party. Results of the experiments demonstrate that for hotels, there is no interaction effect between failure and recovery regarding overall customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions; however, for travel agencies, an interaction effect has been found. This indicates that an internal failure (by travel agency) should be recovered internally to increase the behavioral outcomes for travel agency. However, if there is an external failure (by hotel) then the essential thing is providing a recovery. Originality/value: Although the service literature covers failure and recovery in diverse contexts, these concepts are rarely studied from a multi-agent perspective in the service supply chain literature. In such a chain, a failure by a different party may remain unresolved, and this may create a positive effect on another party, if they provide recovery for the failure. This means that the doer of the failure and/or recovery (the party responsible from the failure and/or recovery) may have an impact on behavioral outcomes. However, previous literature has neglected to focus on the important issue of which entity/party performs the failure and/or recovery, and the effect on behavioral outcomes. By focusing on a principal-agent relationship in a TSSC, the study aims to address this research gap. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Tipping represents a form of compensation valued at over $50 billion a year in the United States alone. Tipping can be used as an incentive mechanism to reduce a principal-agent problem. An agency problem occurs when the interests of a principal and agent are misaligned, and it is challenging for the principal to monitor or control the activities of the agent. However, past research has been limited in the investigation of the extent to which tipping is effective at addressing this problem. Following an examination of 74 independent studies with 12,271 individuals, meta-analytic results indicate that there is a small, positive relation between service quality and percentage of a bill tipped ((Formula presented.) =.15 without outliers). Yet, in support of the idea behind tipping, relative weights analyses illustrate that service quality was a stronger predictor of percentage of the bill tipped than food quality, frequency of patronage, and dining party size. Evidence also suggests that racial minority servers tend to be tipped less than White servers (Cohen's d =.17), and women tend to be tipped more than men (Cohen's d =.15). Still, given the magnitude of the effect, one might question if tipping is an effective compensation practice to reduce the principal-agent problem. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for future research. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This article analyses the relationship between CEO succession events and German firms' internationalization processes, which is represented by the degree of internationalization (DOI) growth and internationalization rhythm. Based on a theoretical framework combining elements of agency theory, institutionalism and upper echelons approach, we propose a longitudinal model to examine the relationships of both process variables with the number of CEO changes and succession type (internal vs. external succession), respectively. The results of our study of 102 German firms over 23 years (1990-2012) show an inverted U-shaped impact (no impact) of the number of CEO changes (succession type) on the DOI growth and a positive (negative) monotonic effect on the rhythm of internationalization.

Drawing from agency theory and the attention-based view of the firm, this study extends the understanding of the conditions under which CEO duality is negatively associated with board monitoring in a privately held firm context. Measuring monitoring in terms of board members' involvement in behavioral control, output control, and strategy control tasks (Huse), results show that CEO duality is significantly and negatively related only to the behavioral control task. In addition, we show that this negative effect is contingent on whether ownership is concentrated in the hands of a controlling shareholder as well as the type of controlling shareholder.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to articulate propositions on how collaborating multi-national corporations (MNCs) can manage their supplier base in order to reduce the risk of suppliers' non-compliance with shared codes-of-conduct. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilises a conceptual theory development approach. In doing so, it utilises key tenets of agency theory that are applied in a multi-principal-supplier relationship context and synthesised in a series of propositions. Findings: The study shows that MNCs have a variety of mechanisms for reducing the risk of suppliers' non-compliance by decreasing information asymmetry, increasing their bargaining power and simultaneously use of both rewards/sanctions, and reputation-based safeguards. Research limitations/implications: This is a conceptual theory development study, offering testable propositions, which have then to be empirically validated. Practical implications: The study showcases that managers of MNCs who find themselves in relationships with non-compliant suppliers have at their disposal a variety of mechanisms to reduce the risk of suppliers' non-compliance. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies that explore suppliers' non-compliance with codes-of-conduct at the level of a relationship, rather than a single firm. In this way it proposes a theoretical framework grounded in agency theory on managing relationships between multi-principal collaborators and their suppliers. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We study the organizational impact of internal control systems, by examining 1,593 firms with 15,606 executives over 2002-2010. We find that internal control systems explain a significant amount of executive and, in particular, CFO compensation, after controlling for other governance, executive personal characteristics, firm, and macroeconomic determinants of pay. Moreover, the negative relationship between pay and internal control systems suggests that executives operating in firms with ineffective internal control systems earn greater compensation. The results of the longitudinal analysis suggest that firms with ineffective internal control systems have greater agency problems and, consequently, greater levels of executive compensation. The CEO pay shows a nonsignificant relationship with internal control systems. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

This paper investigates the influence of corporate governance on the performance of modern Chinese firms. Prior studies were inconclusive about the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. Little research investigates the performance implications of board structure in the post-institutional-transition era in China. Based on agency and resource dependence theories, this paper examines the impacts of board composition and leadership structure on the performance of Chinese manufacturing firms that went public on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges in 2010. The findings show that separating the posts of CEO and chair promotes better performance. However, appointing a larger proportion of outside independent directors to the board insignificantly affects performance. This research provides partial support for agency theory and extended insights into corporate governance in emerging economy firms. Copyright (c) 2017 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the voluntary disclosure of risk-related issues, with a focus on credit risk, in graphical reporting for listed banks in the major European economies. It aims to understand if banks portray credit risk-related information in graphs accurately and whether these graphs provide incremental, rather than replicative, information. It also investigates whether credit risk-related graphs provide a fair representation of risk performance or a more favourable impression than is warranted. Design/methodology/approach - A graphical accuracy index was constructed. Incremental information was measured. A multi-level linear model investigated whether credit risk affects the quantity and quality of graphical credit risk disclosure. Findings - Banks used credit risk graphs to provide incremental information. They were also selective, with riskier banks less likely to use risk graphs. Banks were accurate in their graphical reporting, particularly those with high levels of credit risk. These findings can be explained within an impression management perspective taking human cognitive biases into account. Preparers of risk graphs seem to prefer selective omission over obfuscation via inaccuracy. This probably reflects the fact that individuals, and by implication annual report's users, generally judge the provision of inaccurate information more harshly than the omission of unfavourable information. Research limitations/implications - This study provides theoretical insights by pointing out the limitations of a purely economics-based agency theory approach to impression management. Practical implications - The study suggests annual reports' readers need to be careful about subtle forms of impression management, such as those exploiting their cognitive bias. Regulatory and professional bodies should develop guidelines to ensure neutral and comparable graphical disclosure. Originality/value - This study provides a substantive alternative to the predominant economic perspective on impression management in corporate reporting, by incorporating a psychological perspective taking human cognitive biases into account.

In a study of life science firms, we find that, in accordance with predictions drawn from agency theory and behavioral agency theory, CEO stock ownership is negatively associated with licensing while CEO stock options are positively associated with licensing. Furthermore, by combining theoretical insights from the capabilities literature with both agency theory and behavioral agency theory, we predict that a key measure of capabilities in the licensing context--a firm's alliance experience--significantly influences the ways in which CEO equity incentives impact licensing. More specifically, we find that, in accordance with our theoretical predictions, alliance experience positively (negatively) moderates the relationship between CEO stock ownership (CEO stock options) and licensing. Our study contributes to the wider literature on the determinants of licensing by examining whether licensing is sensitive to CEO equity incentives. We also extend the capabilities literature on licensing by examining the contrasting influences of a firm's alliance experience on the relationship between CEO equity incentives and licensing. Our findings also inform behavioral agency-based research on the effects of equity incentives by highlighting the usefulness of a capabilities perspective in augmenting our understanding of the behavioral role of CEO equity incentives.

Public services have been subjected to processes of deregulation, competition, and privatization in many countries worldwide. One popular reform has involved focusing on competitive procurement. This context, where public and private organizations jointly deliver the service in a dyad, makes the market orientation of public services highly complex. The main elements of market orientation-intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination and responsiveness- have shown themselves to be valid and of significance in both the private and public sectors. Nevertheless, the empirical context of the public sector involves a complexity that has been poorly addressed in market orientation research. In this study, we research the Swedish public transport industry and survey buyer and provider organizations in order to determine how market-orientated activities are approached in public-private service dyads. We present three theoretically-underpinned relationship types - buyer dominated, provider dominated and collaborative - which we suggest as having implications for market-oriented activities. A survey of public transport authorities' (buyers, n = 48) and operators' (providers, n = 49) market orientation activities reveals the concurrent prevalence of characteristics from all three relationship types, as both parties try to dominate the relationship while also engaging in collaborative efforts. Drawing on our theoretical framework and our empirical results, we conclude that there are legitimate differences in the perspectives of buyers and providers, and that these differences, if acknowledged and properly managed, can provide valuable resources in the development of a joint market orientation in complex public-private settings.

The results show that training and innovative capabilities influence performance, while strategic planning strengthens the relationship between human resource policies and performance. Moreover, family businesses with weak governance practices can initially benefit from innovation, but they must enhance their governance to sustain growth in performance. Family businesses should focus on the selection and training of nonfamily members to increase their innovative capabilities and enhance their performance. (c) 2018, (c) 2018 Taylor & Francis.

Drawing on social capital and agency theories and using a multi-study research design, this study examined how perceived risk and return interacts with familism to influence individuals' investment strategies in new venture financing, both capital seeking and capital providing behavior. We found that individuals high in familism are more likely to seek capital from and provide capital to family members than non-family members for new ventures. However, such relationships are more complex than prior research suggests because when individuals' risk and return perceptions are included these interact with familism to differentially influence capital financing behavior directed at family versus non-family members. Contributions to theory and potential avenues for future research are discussed. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Prior agency-theory research has presented conflicting findings regarding the importance of board monitoring in motivating R&D. We reinvestigate this literature by examining the value monitoring exerts in abating both the agency costs of underinvestment and overinvestment in R&D. We argue that monitoring that relies on board independence has both benefits and costs associated with promoting R&D. While we assert that intense monitoring by the board heightens underinvestment in the US context, it can also provide discipline over a firms free cash flows. We test our theory using a longitudinal panel data set consisting of a cross-section of S&P 1500 US-firms between 1997 and 2007. On average our study finds inside directors increase overinvestment in R&D, but facilitate better resource allocation when a firm has rich growth opportunities. Also, while too much emphasis on outside directors heightens underinvestment in R&D, a more independent board encourages better resource allocation when firms have high free cash flows that need to be paid back to owners. Thus, our results suggest a more inclusive perspective of agency-theory can help managers make better R&D investment decisions. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This article empirically examines the occurrence of price-oriented maverick buying (MB) during supplier selection, in a direct purchasing process context. Drawing on agency theory, maverick buying, and total cost of ownership (TCO) literature, the statistically significant existence of price-oriented MB is investigated and the purchasing manager (PM)-related factors that influence such noncompliant behavior are determined. A discrete choice experiment is designed to simulate a TCO-based supplier selection process in which an established purchasing framework agreement stipulates PMs not necessarily be price-oriented (i.e., select suppliers primarily based on lowest price), and then models PM choice behavior in the supplier selection process (SSP), utilizing a conditional logit model (CLM) to determine PM compliance to the established purchasing framework agreement and identify if price-oriented MB exists. Statistical tests utilizing comprehensive primary and secondary data are then conducted to determine if correlational relationships exist between PM-related factors and PM price-orientation. Results indicate that three PM-related factors bear a significant correlational relationship to PM price-orientation. (c) 2016 Decision Sciences Institute

Flexibility is often defined in terms of autonomy of actions, freedom of expression, balancing in competing opposites and agility in actions. Such flexibility assumes greater significance in the dynamic system in which business operates. In this mutually reinforcing system, Indian regulators have accorded flexibility to companies to decide the nature, type, tone and time orientation of risk disclosures (in annual reports) based on their competitive position. Accordingly, the paper strives to ascertain how this regulatory flexibility is leveraged by Indian companies. For the purpose, content analysis and textual analysis are employed on over 4000 annual reports of NIFTY500 companies, covering a period 10-year period from 2005 to 2015. In tune with agency theory, proprietary cost theory, duality theory and contingency theory, the findings indicate that companies that are in a better competitive position tend to make greater and more comprehensive risk disclosures. The results are robust at company level, industry level and sectoral level. Further, the results unambiguously reflect how this flexibility affected the strategic decision making during the time of global financial crisis. Amidst calls for increasing regulations, particularly in the domain of disclosures, these findings clearly highlight the need for regulatory flexibility in decisions that have strategic implications for firms.

Numerous studies have used agency theory (Jensen and Meckling, 1976) and capital scarcity theory (Oxenfeldt and Kelly, 1969) to explain franchising motivations. Although both theories may in part account for why firms choose to franchise, past studies have not seriously considered the potential relationship between franchising and capital structures. Using Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis, this study examined the impact of franchising on short- and long-term debt leverage. The final sample included 191 restaurant firms from 1980 to 2015. Sixty-five firms were non-franchise firms, while 126 firms engaged in the franchising business. The results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis showed that franchising has a significant effect on decreasing long-term debts and confirmed that franchising plays an important role as an additional source of long-term capital. Consequently, the capital scarcity theory is supported as one aspect of long-term debt leverage. However, franchise restaurant firms have larger short-term debt than non-franchise firms, although it is merely marginally significant. This contradicts capital scarcity theory but is in accordance with some past studies (e.g. Norton, 1988; 1995). This implies that franchisors constantly need short-term capital to support franchisees. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

We examine bargaining for long-term contracts in baseball, which usually involves agents negotiating on behalf of players. We show that when an agent represents a large portfolio of clients, the agent's interests may diverge from those of the client. Such agents face less risk than their clients and therefore may calculate a minimum-acceptable contract offer that exceeds that of their clients. Using a sample of nearly 500 eligible players, we test for the presence of this principal-agent problem and find evidence that the size of an agent's client portfolio negatively affects the probability of successfully negotiating a long-term contract. The results have important implications for both players and team management as they shed light on the circumstances under which incentive compatibility may be compromised.

Drawing on agency theory, we explore how 30 employees defined ownership effectiveness in a 100 % employee-owned Canadian-based firm. Using a qualitative case-study, remarkable similarities were found in the factors employees themselves believed contributed most to ownership effectiveness. Despite differences in job roles, employees emphasized confidence in the ownership program, participative decision-making, ownership identity, and their organization as a family unit. In light of these findings, we discuss how a broader conceptualization of employee ownership effectiveness can be applied for a more comprehensive understanding of how such programs may develop and manifest.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to enrich the finding by Aguinis et al. (2018) that there is little overlap between the extremes of firm performance and the extremes of CEO pay using a novel approach to characterize the distribution of pay and performance. The authors aim to shift the focus of compensation researchers from fruitlessly trying to link pay to performance to theory-rich accounts of pay that take into consideration the idiosyncratically motivated and socially embedded nature of CEO compensation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors' approach in this commentary is conceptual. They synthesize compensation literature from different fields such as economics, finance, sociology, strategic management and corporate law, as well as the empirical findings from the focal paper to support their characterization of the current state of the literature and future directions it should take. Findings: The authors synthesize discussion of CEO pay down to three dimensions of CEO responsibilities and motivations. They argue that a realistic pay design should take into account that CEOs have limited control over performance, they are accountable to multiple stakeholders and they are motivated by financial as well as nonfinancial incentives. Originality/value: The commentary presents researchers with high-order framing of CEO pay that goes beyond debating over methodology or narrowly focusing on limited behavioral drivers of pay setting. Instead, the authors encourage researchers to take advantage of their three-legged framework to theorize about CEO pay. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Accountability is a pivotal concern of applied social science. This article asserts that in many situations a full explanation of the sources of accountability requires the application of concepts from sociology and management science, in addition to those from the market-based approaches inspired by economics. The article describes the market-based approach to accountability exemplified by agency theory, applies it to school reform and derives several predictions about the likely success of market-based approaches to school reform, and documents the lack of evidence supporting the contention that programs for school choice will markedly improve teacher work effort and performance (as measured by student test scores). The social actor approach, rooted in sociological and management theories, is introduced and used to describe the pressures and norms operating in the public schools that foster accountability even in the absence of competition between schools for students. The article concludes with some implications for practice and research on public sector accountability. (c) The Author(s) 2015.

This paper utilizes corporate governance concepts to assess the merit of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act). The paper first compares the information flows seen in a corporate context to those seen in a governmental reporting context. The paper then utilizes agency theory to establish a conceptual link between the two reporting processes. This conceptual link is used to identify common goals between the participants in the information flows. Following this, a corporate governance model is used to outline factors that contribute to effective corporate governance. This governance model is then used as a basis for assessing the merit of the DATA Act. After this, differences between the participants in the information flows are discussed and limitations of the paper are acknowledged. The paper suggests that the DATA Act has merit due to its potential to improve transparency and monitoring in the governmental reporting process. Increased data timeliness and usability will enhance transparency, while improvements in automation, data transfer, and data analytics will improve monitoring. The conclusions of this paper have implications for the participants in the governmental reporting process including government agencies, legislators, regulatory bodies, contractors, nonvoting taxpayers, and members of the voting public.

Purpose: Adopting an integrated agency and stewardship perspective, the purpose of this paper is to understand the relationship between family businesses (FBs) and private equity (PE) investors at three stages: entry, cooperation, and exit. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study combines the perspectives of 11 FB owners and/or managers, seven PE investors, and four intermediaries. The in-depth interviews of this purposive sample are analysed at the intra- and inter-case level using a template analysis approach up to reaching theoretical saturation. Findings: Building and maintaining an effective relationship between the FB and the PE investor requires both a stewardship perspective (i.e. reciprocal principal-steward behaviour) and a necessary but insufficient agency perspective (i.e. principal-principal behaviour). Research limitations/implications: More large-scale studies with an integrated agency-stewardship perspective on FBs using PE can increase the external validity of the insights from this research to build and maintain an effective relationship between both parties. Practical implications: Providing insights into the relationship building process and best practices, this study helps reduce the knowledge and empathy gap that exists between FBs and PE. Originality/value: The results clarify the need to reconcile an agency and stewardship perspective to thoroughly understand the relationship and behaviour of FBs and PE investors, and to help the parties understand and benefit from each other's added value.

As new technologies and globalization change the vertical contracting structure of the auto industry, risk allocation in OEM-supplier relationships remain critical to ensure innovation and competitiveness. Developing previous, agency theory based research on the levels and the determinants of risk sharing, this study of Nissan Europe's supply chain shows that the OEM absorbs more risk (a) the greater the supplier's environmental uncertainty, (b) the more risk averse the supplier, and (c) the less severe the supplier's moral hazard. The study also shows that Nissan, though still absorbing risk from their suppliers to a nonnegligible degree, has moved to a more market-based approach to supplier selection and development as a consequence of technological change, the industry globalization and the merger with Renault.

This new book examines the relationship between agency theory and executive pay. It argues that while Jensen and Meckling (1976) were right in their analysis of the agency problem in public corporations they were wrong about the proposed solutions. Drawing on ideas from economics, psychology, sociology and the philosophy of science, the author explains how standard agency theory has contributed to the problem of executive pay rather than solved it. The book explores why companies should be regarded as real entities not legal fictions, how executive pay in public corporations can be conceptualised as a collective action problem and how behavioral science can help in the design of optimal incentive arrangements. An insightful and revolutionary read for those researching corporate governance, HRM and organisation theory, this useful book offers potential solutions to some of the problems with executive pay and the standard model of agency.

A returnee entrepreneur playing an important role in China market is a notable phenomenon. While their advanced knowledge and overseas networking in developed countries have advantages over local counterparts, their lack of local knowledge and connection may mitigate their advantages. This study explores the research questions how and why external management control of returnee entrepreneur is inferior to local counterpart. Based on the data collected in year 2002 from Chinese technology venture companies in Zhongguancun Science Park (ZSP), we find that the performance of returnee entrepreneur's firms is lower when they have more local subsidiaries and when they are owned by foreigners. It implies that returnee entrepreneurs may be less effective in management control over local subsidiaries which may indicate a low level of headquarters control. It also implies that foreign ownership gives rise to increase in agency conflicts between returnee entrepreneurs and foreign investors and thus has a negative impact on firms' innovation performance.

This chapter begins the discussion about earnings quality in family firms. It examines whether family firms differently manage their earnings compared to non-family firms. We show that both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective, prior research documents show that family firms manage less their earnings relative to non-family firms. Nonetheless, we also look at deviations from these results, mainly due to the differences in the institutional environment, and/or in the management structure. Moreover, there has been a shift from the agency theory to the socioemotional wealth theory to explain family firms' decisions with regards to earnings management. We conclude this chapter by suggesting future avenues for research, in particular in terms of theoretical framework and research design. The discussion about earnings quality continues in Chap. 4, where we investigate accounting conservatism in family firms. (c) Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

Purpose: Country comparative studies especially in Africa on public procurement reforms toward financial control and accountability of public expenditure are limited. Meanwhile, these kinds of studies have potential for providing useful insights on how value for money through public procurement is being ensured across Africa. This paper attempts to provide this. The purpose of this paper is to highlight several policy recommendations for public management aimed at improving public procurement and public financial management (PFM) systems in Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a qualitative case study using secondary data drawn from Global Integrity Index (GII) of the Transparency International and the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessments databases to investigate variables that influence public procurement practices in three purposively selected African countries. The comparative approach for presenting some of the experiences of countries in public procurement methods is used in this paper. Findings: The findings suggest three main variables, namely, government structure and economic variables, complicated by socio-cultural values interact to influence public procurement and PFM systems in the case study countries. Research limitations/implications: Data for the GII indicators used were only available from 2013, which restricted the discussion of those indicators to a short span (2013-2015). Social implications: The socio-cultural milieu within which public procurement takes place has implications for how governance structures function to deliver value-for-money public procurement. Originality/value: This study adds value by comparing three countries within Africa to reveal common variables which influence public procurement and PFM systems.

In the construction industry clients largely depend on contractors to deliver projects. According to agency theory problems of goal conflict and information asymmetry arise in this delegation of work because both the principal and the agent are self-interested. The control-oriented governance mechanisms that agency theorists propose as a means to resolve these problems can act counterproductive and give rise to new problems. Stewardship theory offers a counterweight to agency theory and assumes a relational reciprocity between the principal and the steward. Recently, a large group of Dutch public construction clients and contractors have collaboratively expressed their desire to improve their relationship in a manifest called 'the market vision'. This phenomenon can be interpreted as a desire to shift from a principal-agent towards a principal-steward relationship. The aim of this paper is to explore how public clients engage in stewardship relationships with contractors. This research is based on a case study of one of the most ambitious projects under the umbrella of this market vision trajectory. The analysis of the documents, observation notes and semi-structured interviews with project team members indicate that they developed a relationship which can be characterised as a principal-steward bond. By investing in relationship-building from the pre-commercial phase, throughout the tender phase and the execution phase, they put their individual differences beside in order to reach their initially defined common goal. It remains however to be seen whether this can be considered as a complete stewardship relation. (c) Proceeding of the 34th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2018.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the interaction between the structure of the top management team, takeover defense mechanisms and firms rate of collective actions. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses elements of agency theory, prospect theory and competitive dynamics research to develop a model for examining heterogeneity in the rate of collective actions among firms in the technology sector. A sample of 299 firm-year observations arrayed into panel regression analyses is used. Findings: The findings from this study show a positive relationship between the size of the top management team and the count of collective actions when takeover defense mechanisms are present. Further this study finds a negative relationship between top management team ownership and collective actions when these same takeover defense mechanisms are present. Additionally, the female ratio of the top management team is negatively related to collective actions. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of technological firms. These relationships may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other elements of the firm's governance structure (i.e. board of directors or shareholders) may play an important role in the strategic decision-making process. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by linking several blocks of literature, top management team literature, competitive dynamics literature and corporate governance literature, into a model to examine firm structural characteristics on the heterogeneity in the propensity to formulate collective actions among firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of independent non-executive directors (INEDs) in Malaysian public listed companies (PLCs), other than the control role prescribed by agency theory and reformatory documents such as the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research design, consisting of face-to-face interviews with 27 company directors of Malaysian-owned PLCs, was instigated. Findings: The interviews revealed that INEDs do more than just monitor their executive counterparts. Apart from the control role, INEDs of Malaysian companies provide a conduit for mitigating uncertainties in the environment and perform invaluable services to the host companies. Research limitations/implications: This research utilized interviews. Generalizations may be an issue when interviews are used as the method of inquiry. Also, the sample is not random as access to many of the interviewed directors depended on recommendations. In addition, respondents were consciously selected in order to obtain various board positions that include independent and non-independent directors. Originality/value: There are limited studies using qualitative research design in investigating INEDs' performing other roles apart from the control role of the board in developing countries. Many of previous studies and literature in this area of corporate governance were predominantly based upon experiences of western economies. (c) 2018, Hairul Azlan Annuar.

Agency theory suggests that problems in terms of conflicting preferences, knowledge asymmetry and different attitudes towards risks can have a negative impact on work outcome from the agent to the principal. In private internal investigations, the client is the principal, while the fraud examiner is the agent. Based on a sample of 49 reports of investigation from Norway, this article presents empirical results testing agency theory. Results indicate that agency issues do have a significant influence on the contribution from internal investigations, but the influence is not necessarily negative. While different attitudes towards risk have a negative impact, knowledge asymmetry has a positive impact on the contribution from an investigation. A possible explanation for this surprising result is that examiners are experts in other areas than the client, which is the reason why examiners are hired by clients.

The business enterprise is the prime institution in economic development and growth; yet, until recently, mainstream economics has mostly treated firms as homogeneous black boxes managed by untrustworthy agents. Using economic principles, the field of strategic management has developed a nuanced approach to understanding how firms are created, organized, and grow; how they innovate and compete; and how managers manage. That approach has yielded a theoretical framework known as 'dynamic capabilities'. Contrasts are drawn between dynamic capabilities and other approaches to the theory of the firm, including transaction cost economics and agency theory. The application of capability theory allows intellectual blinders to be removed and an understanding of differential firm-level resource allocation and performance to emerge. This brings a richer conceptual understanding of the nature of the business enterprise and its management consistent with evolutionary and behavioural economics. Policy insights into governance, inequality, economic development, and the wealth of nations follow. (c) 2017, (c) 2017 New Zealand Association of Economists Incorporated.

In this article, we review recent literature (79 articles) on the impact of corporate governance on corporate tax avoidance. Applying a stakeholder-oriented view, we find that various aspects of corporate governance, such as incentive alignment between management and shareholders, board composition, ownership structure, capital market monitoring, audit, enforcement and government relations, and other stakeholders' pressure have a strong influence on corporate tax avoidance. Findings indicate that effective corporate governance mechanisms steer tax avoidance at its firm-specific optimal level. The classical principal-agent theory, however, fails to fully explain corporate tax avoidance as an outcome. Investigating the determinants of corporate tax avoidance requires a more comprehensive approach taking into account corporate governance institutions and all stakeholders relevant to the firm. We show that corporate governance institutions not only have the potential to increase tax avoidance, making firms more profitable, but also to limit tax avoidance to a level where the arising risks do not outweigh the benefits.

Stewardship theory is a popular alternative to agency theory for studying family firm governance. Despite its contributions to management and family business studies, stewardship theory's assumptions limit its realism and relevance. Using agency theory as a standard of comparison, I discuss stewardship theory's model of man and its assumptions concerning goal alignment and control systems. I also discuss stewardship theory's lack of assumptions about bounded rationality and pre-employment situations since the neglect of those issues reduce its realism and relevance. Based on this discussion, I argue that to increase its realism and relevance, stewardship theory's assumptions should be revised. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This study examines the impact of CEO duality on firms' internal capital allocation efficiency. We observe that when the CEO is also chair of the board, diversified firms make inefficient investments, as they allocate more capital to business segments with relatively low growth opportunities over segments with high growth opportunities. The adverse impact of CEO duality on investment efficiency prevails only among firms that face high agency problems, as captured by high free cash flows, staggered board structure and low board independence. Depending on the severity of the agency problem, CEO duality is associated with a decrease in industry-adjusted investment in high-growth segments of 1% to 2.1% over the following year, relative to that in low-growth segments. However, CEOs' equity-based compensation curbs the negative effect of CEO duality on internal capital allocation efficiency. Overall, the findings of this study offer strong support for the agency theory and postulate the internal capital allocation policy as an important channel through which CEO duality lowers firm value in diversified firms.

Focal companies have to manage both first-tier suppliers and lower-tier suppliers in order to prevent reputational damage due to sustainability violations in their supply chains. However, the involvement of sub-suppliers in supplier management practices creates new challenges, which can be managed more effectively in collaboration with other firms. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore from an extended agency theory perspective how companies collaborate within assessment sharing strategic alliances (ASSAs) to manage suppliers with respect to sustainability and to reveal the resultant effects on the management of suppliers within multi-tier supply chains. Therefore, an embedded multiple case study with multiple units of analysis was conducted. Results show that, dependent on the experience in ASSAs, supplier assessment and optionally supplier collaboration practices are executed collaboratively among the members of those strategic alliances to improve suppliers' compliance with the focal company's corporate sustainability standards. However, the configuration of jointly executed activities as well as membership conditions vary between strategic alliances and consequently influence the effects on supplier management. Nevertheless, the observations revealed that the causes for agency risk, namely information asymmetry and goal conflicts, can be mitigated through collaboration within ASSAs and thus multi-tier suppliers' compliance with corporate sustainability standards is fostered.

The purpose of this study consists in analyzing the existing literature on international business from all the research papers published in Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS) during the period of time comprised between 2000 and 2015. The authors apply bibliometric methods to that end -in particular, document citation and co-citation analyses (DCAs)- so that they can try and identify the main research lines within the aforementioned scientific field or domain; in other words, the 'intellectual structure' of the discipline examined. Social networks analysis was also used to carry out the representation or visualization of such structure or knowledge base. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the research undertaken, since the study field still keeps its characteristic diversity and interdisciplinarity or the need to integrate a variety of theoretical frameworks or approaches into the development of a widely-accepted theory about the field under study become evident. Amongst these theories would be the new institutional theory, the strategic theory or perspective or others such as the transaction cost theory or the agency theory, applied to the context of internationalization and to the field of international business, on whose integration the future development of this field may largely depend.

The aim of this article is to provide an understanding of how the supplier selection process used by buying organisations to establish socially sustainable supply chains has evolved from the traditional purchasing function. Through the application of a socially responsible purchasing (SRP) approach, organisations are attempting to address the challenges of selecting appropriate suppliers to engage with. To achieve SRP, behavioural agency attributes were found to complement traditional agency forms of governance from the start of the process. Through the use of an exploratory case study approach, three focal (purchasing) firms pursuing a strong sustainability agenda, and two supply chain intermediary organisations were investigated. The results show that supplier development activities previously positioned post-selection are now performed at the pre-selection stage, moving them to the beginning of the process. Suppliers must now demonstrate commitment to sustainability through implementing improvements highlighted in corrective action reports at the pre-selection point before any financial transactions occur. The movement of post-selection supplier development activities to the pre-selection stage, to align sustainability goals and reduce risk, is a significant finding of this article that purchasing personnel and suppliers should consider in the establishment of a socially sustainable supply chain.

This article deals with environmentally-oriented crowdfunding projects. Drawing on agency-theory, it analyses the implementation of such projects, after they have been successfully financed via-crowdfunding. More specifically, this article firstly investigates whether environmental ventures implement the measures they have advertised during the crowdfunding campaign. Secondly, it examines in how far environmentally-oriented ventures disclose the environmental benefits that have been created based on the implementation of the measure financed via crowdfunding. It thereby uses data gained from a platform specialized in funding projects that serve combatting climate change. The results show that the measures advertised are commonly implemented. However, only few projects disclose information on the actual environmental benefits created. Thus, funders are unable to evaluate whether the environmental benefits advertised during the crowdfunding campaign are actually realized. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend the understanding and application of interactive ties creating value through board characteristics, ownership concentration and firms' performance by using a contingent theoretical-based framework based on the amalgamation of resource dependence theory, stakeholder theory, agency theory, stewardship theory and institutional theory in a country with weak political environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study includes a sample of an unbalanced panel of 309 non-financial sector firms listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) from 2005 to 2016. In order to address the issue of unobserved heterogeneity, simultaneous and dynamic endogeneity, the current study employed the technique Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data estimation under assumptions of GMM (Arellano-Bond, 1991). Findings: The empirical results suggest that the presence of concentrated ownership moderates and helps to overcome the agency problems through different governance mechanisms (such as board size, independent directors and CEO duality). The larger boards are found to be beneficial whereas the higher representation of independent directors in the board is found to be detrimental for Pakistani firms. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study are, first the current study has analyzed public-listed firms from the non-financial sector, and second the study has only focused on the financial aspect of the performance. The future research could include other proxies of corporate governance and ownership structure such as board diversity and meetings, audit committee and managerial ownership, etc. Practical implications: The research also helps Pakistani policy makers in numerous ways. First, the current study confirms the monitoring and expropriation effect of ownership concentration in corporate governance and performance mechanism. Thus, the Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) should make such policies which protect the corporate board against the influence of concentrated ownership so that the interests of the minority shareholders are protected. Second, SECP should ensure that all the listed firms declare a comprehensive profile of their directors (such as academic qualification, age and experience) in their annual reports for the better understanding of the governance-performance mechanism. Originality/value: The current study augments the emerging body of literature on corporate governance and firm performance mechanism through the amalgamation and testing of existing theories in an emerging economy like Pakistan by using wider and newer data set.

In this paper, we examine how one important type of relationship, research joint ventures (RJVs), is governed within the context of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. Based on agency theory, we investigate the relationship between the governance structure of an RJV and the likelihood that the venture will embrace elements of its research-based ecosystem, that is, the likelihood that the RJV will invite a university to become a research member of the venture. Using data from the National Research Joint Venture Database, we find that when the governance structure of the RJV affords the organizer/leader and research director (the principal) the ability to exert control over the activities of the other members of the RJV (the agents), universities are less likely to be invited to participate as a research member.

Prior research has advanced classical agency theory to account for various characteristics of headquarters (HQ)-subsidiary relations in the multinational corporation (MNC). In an attempt to contribute to this line of research, in this paper, we propose and test an agency model for HQ-subsidiary relations inside the MNC. Drawing on classical agency assumptions, we develop a baseline hypothesis that links informal controls (i.e., socialization), HQ-subsidiary goal conflicts, and the HQ's use of formal controls (i.e., behavioral controls). We subsequently introduce an important boundary condition, which reflects subsidiaries' internal agency relations with subsidiary CEOs as second principals. More specifically, we argue that the baseline relationship only holds under low levels of second principal power. To test our model, we employed a unique study design with three parallel surveys addressing the agents and the two principals involved in 131 agency relations within one MNC. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study explores a determinant of escalation of commitment when a personal relationship is present between managers of buying and supplying firms in the supply chain context from an agency theory perspective. As there is very limited research in this area, a qualitative, case study method, employing ten semi-structured interviews with senior managers of buying firms was undertaken. Findings from this study reveal that higher interpersonal trust which develops as a result of a personal relationship between managers of buying and supplying firms compels managers of buying firms to escalate their commitment. Results also unveil that escalation of commitment increases operational risk of buying firms. Buying firms can use this finding to understand how and why their managers engage in an escalation of commitment when they share a personal relationship with a manager from the supplying firm. The paper concludes by discussing research limitations and future research directions. Copyright (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: Recent research has proposed the position of a project owner as the individual accountable for realizing target benefits. However, there is a lack of understanding in the literature of this role - in particular, the specific responsibilities of the project owner that can enhance benefits realization and operations performance. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The paper identifies these responsibilities in practice through two studies - a qualitative study, which includes interviews with senior executives who fund projects, and an in-depth longitudinal case study, which describes a company that continuously realizes the benefits from its projects. Findings: The results suggest that a project owner should have 22 key responsibilities across four project phases and that an operations manager is often the most suitable candidate to fulfill this role in operations improvement projects. When performing these project responsibilities effectively, operations managers enhance benefits realization and operations improvement. Finally, the paper proposes five hypotheses for future research. Originality/value: Based on agency theory, the paper increases our knowledge of the role of the project owner in practice. This new knowledge can enhance the realization of target benefits from projects and ensure a smooth transition from the project to the operations environment. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The extant literature reports mixed and inconclusive findings concerning the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance. To provide incremental insight, this paper aims to investigate whether the bi-directional relationships among managerial ownership, board independence and firm performance are determined. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a data set consisting of 9,302 firm-year observations of Australian listed companies during 2005-2015 and a three-stage least squares simultaneous equation model to test the bi-directional relationships. Findings: The results indicate that both managerial ownership and board independence inversely affect firm performance and vice versa. In addition, board independence is negatively correlated with managerial ownership and vice versa. Practical implications: The convergence-of-interests hypothesis can be achieved by manipulating managerial ownership through making contingent payments. Board independence, as a voluntary regime in Australia, can provide additional flexibility to corporate decision makers. Originality/value: This study provides additional evidence by using the convergence-of-interests hypothesis vis-a-vis the entrenchment hypothesis to examine the relationship between managerial ownership and firm performance, and tests the association of board independence and firm performance using the explanation of agency theory vis-a-vis stewardship theory.

The escalation in product recalls in recent years is attributed to the rise of globalisation and associated challenges of offshoring. Extant SCM research suggests that product recalls have a significant negative impact on financial performance, but gaps exist relative to the managerial actions to minimise their impact. Recall response strategies have become more important in the press, given that a single recall may result in the mandatory withdrawal of millions of products from the market, with firms incurring enormous logistics costs and brand damage. In this study, we address this gap in the research, and using a measure of product recall defined as the volume of products withdrawn from the market due to product quality failure. We explore the scale of the recall in the context of pharmaceutical sector global sourcing strategies, exploring whether the variation in global sourcing decisions not only increases the likelihood of a recall, but also influences the capability to minimise the total cost of recall. Our results suggest that offshore outsourcing and captive offshoring have opposite effects in terms of their influence on the magnitude of product recall. We summarise the implications through a compelling set of insights for future global sourcing strategy research themes. (c) 2018, (c) 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The effectiveness of monitoring and incentive alignment as mechanisms for controlling agency costs have been explored separately and in combination, with monitoring substituting for weaknesses in incentive alignment and vice versa; this equates to positive substitution when describing how monitoring and incentive alignment interact to influence shareholder agency costs. We draw upon behavioral agency theory and findings from finance research to offer further theoretical insight into how these mechanisms interact to influence agency costs. Our results suggest that CEO earnings management aimed at preserving their equity wealth (an incentive alignment mechanism) is accentuated by higher levels of concentrated institutional ownership, thereby imposing agency costs on less informed investors. Thus, in addition to being substitutes in controlling agency costs, as previously suggested, monitoring may accentuate the perverse effects of incentive alignment, equating to negative reinforcement, rather than positive substitution. Yet this effect is negated in the absence of CEO power due to dual occupation of the board and CEO roles. We discuss implications of these findings for theory and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

The negative association between risk and return is paradoxical because risk-averse managers should only expose themselves to higher risk for higher returns. The paradox is resolved, however, if we recognize that risk-averse managers may be taking decisions that pose risk for shareholders and not for their own careers. We draw on the career concerns literature to explain why decisions that pose risk to shareholder returns can enhance managerial careers. We provide evidence that the risk-return paradox is exacerbated by agency problems that contribute to career concerns (i.e., CEO career horizon), and mitigated by various governance mechanisms that curb the agency problem by aligning managers with shareholders (such as monitoring by the market for corporate control, large block owners, institutional owners, vigilant board, and CEO incentive alignment). Our study sheds light on the role of career concerns and corporate governance in resolving the risk-return paradox. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Using the behavioral agency model, we analyze how two compensation design characteristics, pay-performance sensitivity and duration of CEO compensation (taking into account multiple vesting periods), affect corporate social performance. We find that the performance sensitivity of CEO pay is negatively associated with poor social performance but also negatively affects strong social performance. These results suggest that pay-performance sensitivity increases the relevance of potential negative consequences of poor social performance. However, the 'insurance' benefits of strong social performance may also become less relevant. With respect to the duration of CEO compensation, we find that it reduces poor social performance. This finding confirms arguments that a long-term compensation time horizon increases the perceived threat that the negative effects of poor social performance will become visible. With our findings, we integrate behavioral agency theory with the traditional stakeholder views. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Research Question/Issue: Although there is no unified theory that can explain the relationship between CEO power and corporate risk, the empirical evidence generally finds a positive association. This study argues that market competition and corporate governance play critical roles in influencing this relationship. Research Findings/Insights: Using a large panel of nonfinancial U.S. corporations for the period 1992-2015, I find that CEO power is positively associated with total and idiosyncratic measures of risk. However, this positive association remains significant only when market competition is high or corporate governance is strong. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The research design of this study combines the predictions of agency theory, the behavioral agency model, and prospect theory to further our understanding of the relationship between CEO power and corporate risk, including consideration of how competition and corporate governance influence this relationship. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The empirical evidence presented in this study can help boards to more accurately gauge when CEO power is most beneficial in terms of optimal levels of corporate risk and to better understand the relationship between power and risk. The results suggest that boards should grant more power to their CEOs when their firms operate in high-competition markets or have strong corporate governance in place. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore service triads in humanitarian logistics (HL). The study uses agency theory to understand the dynamics between principal(s) and agent(s) and how contractual arrangements influence the service buyer-service provider alignment in humanitarian service triads. Design/methodology/approach: This is a case study on a specific humanitarian service triad, with qualitative data being collected in a field study, utilising participant observation and in-context interview techniques for rich data collection. Findings: The findings highlight the importance of both contractual and relational contracts between the service buyer, service provider and end customer - here donor (government), United Nations agency and implementing partner (IP). The alignment of the three parties in the service triad is more easily achieved through hybrid contracts rather than legal arrangements focussing on outcomes only. Research limitations/implications: Results stem from a specific case study that constitutes a typical humanitarian service triad. An increased understanding of managing services and their service providers in the triadic context of outsourced service delivery adds to the body of knowledge in supply management. Originality/value: This is the first examination of governance structures in contractual arrangements in a humanitarian service triad. The research fills the gap in humanitarian literature regarding the interaction of practitioners in HL, specifically, a service buyer organisation (a donor - government), a service provider (a UN agency) and the end customer (an IP). The research is field based and is grounded in empirical observations thus adding to the literature and offering insights to practice. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been subjected to considerable public debate. In particular, this debate has concerned PPP financing and its implications. Using insights from agency theory, this study aims to develop a theoretical understanding of PPP financing. The following research question is investigated: How does the privatization of financing decrease or increase agency costs in social infrastructure PPPs? A comparative case study consisting of four Norwegian PPP projects with different financial configurations is undertaken. The findings suggest that the private sector is risk averse, increasing the cost of capital. In addition, private financing does not seem to have the intended incentive effect.

The prime objective of the current study is to explore the relationship between supply chain operational performance and firm supply chain management in the reference of agency theory. To further explain the role of agency theory, in the supply chain management we have examined the direct and indirect impact of supply chain operational performance on firm supply chain management. The SMART-PLS is used to achieve the objective of the current stud. The data is collected from the operation managers, production managers and finance managers of manufacturing firms listed in Indonesian Stock Exchange. The results of the study have shown a great deal of agreement with our proposed hypothesis. The corporate governance index comprising of board characteristics appears as a moderator in the relationship between supply chain operational performance and firm supply chain management. The results of the current study are also providing support to agency theory and resource base theory. The study which is among pioneering studies on the issue will be helpful for policy makers and managers in understanding the role of agency theory in supply chain management.

In public-private partnerships (PPPs), aligning the goals of the public sector with those of the private contractor is usually achieved using incentives informed by agency theory. However, the success of the traditional PPP model has been contested, and recently PPPs have started focusing more on collaboration and investment sharing. So far, this development in practice has barely been reflected in the research. This paper seeks to widen the theoretical lenses on PPPs by developing a theoretical framework integrating agency theory, social capital theory, and self-determination theory. The aim is to allow for a better understanding of incentives for goal alignment by including motivational and relational aspects in addition to the transactional view. A multiple case study comprising four Norwegian PPP projects was conducted to empirically apply and further develop the framework. The findings suggest several benefits of social and psychological mechanisms to goal alignment in PPPs, including trust, reciprocity, and intrinsic motivation. Early involvement of contractors combined with risk sharing and relationship building are important factors to this end. (c) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Corporate boards are responsible for ensuring that managers enact policies that are in shareholders' best interests, and managers are responsible for implementing strategies that are not only profitable but also responsive to changing legal and societal demands and the resource needs of the firm. In this paper, we use the theoretical lenses of corporate social responsibility (CSR), the resource-based view, and agency theory to investigate the relationship between corporate governance structure and the implementation of supportive lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) policies. We analyze 10,233 firm-year observations and 1,594 unique firms, and our results demonstrate that LGBT-supportive policies are positively associated with firm performance. We also offer new insight into why not all firms adopt such policies. We exploit the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as an exogenous shock that increased board independence, and our difference-in-difference estimation shows that firms forced to raise board independence in 2002 were less likely to invest in LGBT-supportive policies. Results suggest that human resource management (HRM) policies can be guided by CSR and resource-based views in the pursuit of wealth maximization, but agency conflict may also be a concern for external majority boards. We discuss implications for HRM research practice and corporate governance regarding LGBT policies in organizations. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Behavioral ethics research has focused predominantly on how the attributes of individuals influence their ethicality. Relatively neglected has been how macro-level factors such as the behavior of firms influence members' ethicality. Researchers have noted specifically that we know little about how a firm's CSR influences members' behaviors. We seek to better merge these literatures and gain a deeper understanding of the role macro-level influences have on manager's ethicality. Based on agency theory and social identity theory, we hypothesize that a company's commitment to CSR shifts managers' focus away from self-interests toward the interests of the firm, bolstering resistance to temptation. We propose this occurs through self-categorization and collective identification processes. We conduct a 2 x 2 factorial experiment in which managers make expense decisions for a company with commitment to CSR either present or absent, and temptation either present or absent. Results indicate that under temptation, managers make decisions consistent with self-interest. More importantly, we find when commitment to CSR is present, managers are more likely to make ethical decisions in the presence of temptation. Overall, this research highlights the interactive role of two key contextual factors--temptation and firm CSR commitment--in influencing managers' ethical decisions. While limited research has highlighted the positive effects that a firm's CSR has on its employees' attitudes, the current results demonstrate CSR's effects on ethical behavior and imply that through conducting and communicating its CSR efforts internally, firms can in part limit the deleterious effects of temptation on managers' decisions.

Purpose: Based on the agency theory and risk management perspective, this study aims to examine the relationship between CEOs' pay schemes and corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities in the restaurant industry. Specifically, the authors propose that CEOs with a higher proportion of equity-based compensation (EBC), which induces a greater propensity for risk-taking, are prone to indulge less in CSR. In addition, the authors investigate how institutional ownership moderates the proposed main relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study performs two-way fixed-effects models and clustered standard errors to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results of the panel analysis show a significant negative effect of CEOs' EBC on CSR. Also, the authors found a significant positive moderating effect of institutional ownership between CEOs' EBC and CSR. Originality/value: Given the lack of empirical studies that incorporate both agency theory and the risk management perspective, and given the importance of understanding the determinants of restaurant firms' CSR activities, this study expands upon the existing literature by showing the relationship between CEOs' compensation schemes and restaurant firms' CSR activities.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize corporate entrepreneurial strategy using collaborative dynamics of contingency and agency theories, and to demonstrate how some constructs of these two theories are integrated to support long-term strategies of entrepreneurial firms in sustaining their competitive advantages and enhancing their performance. Design/methodology/approach: Review of literature on strategic entrepreneurship, firm growth, contingency and agency theories were explored to support the conceptualized framework of the entrepreneurial strategy developed in this paper. The authors adopt a vignette approach to problematize theoretical gaps identified. The vignette was also used to embody the entrepreneurial strategy matrix developed. Findings: This paper suggests that the effectiveness of corporate entrepreneurial strategies is influenced by the impacts of contingent environment and agency problem of goal conflicts. It provides some propositions for qualitative and empirical research that will extend the rigours of strategic entrepreneurship literature. Practical implications: This paper highlights the implications of understanding and adopting diverse competitive and sustenance strategies. It provides avenues for entrepreneurial firms to take cognizance and use of the contingency and agency approaches to influence their long-term strategic directions to stay competitive. Institutional authorities will also benefit from having a conceptual reference and guide to further improve their entrepreneurship policies. Originality/value: The authors took three novel steps to address the existing gap in the literature. First, the theories of entrepreneurship, contingency and agency were bound together and unified as a single framework to conceptualize entrepreneurial strategy. Second, the identified gaps were embodied in a vignette to problematize the theoretical issues and lastly, some testable propositions were put forward to explain different forms of entrepreneurial strategy. The authors also developed a corporate entrepreneurial strategy matrix based on the Covin and Miles (1999) forms of corporate entrepreneurship. It forms the basis for the propositions.

Despite the extensive body of literature that aims to explain the phenomenon of consumer scams, the structure of information in scam relationships remains relatively understudied. The purpose of this article is to develop an agency-theoretic approach to the study of information in perpetrator-victim interactions. Drawing a distinction between failures of observation and failures of judgment in the pre-contract phase, we introduce a typology and a set of propositions that explain the severity of adverse selection problems in three classes of scam relationships. Our analysis provides a novel, systematic explanation of the structure of information that facilitates scam victimization, while also enabling critical scrutiny of a core assumption in agency theory regarding contract design. We highlight the role of scam perpetrators as agents who have access to private information and exercise considerable control over the terms and design of scam relationships. Focusing on the consumer scam context, we question a theoretical assumption, largely taken for granted in the agency literature, that contact design is necessarily in the purview of the uninformed principal.

Purpose: Corporate governance is a crucial factor when considering excessive corporate risk-taking. Since corporate boards play such an important role in corporate governance, the purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the impact of board composition and further board characteristics on excessive corporate risk-taking. Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates listed firms from Germany and the USA from 2004 to 2015 based on data from Thomson Reuters Data Stream. The authors apply the fixed effect and random effect estimation method to demonstrate the impact of board composition on corporate risk-taking. Findings: This study provides empirical evidence that an increase in the proportion of independent directors is associated with less corporate risk-taking. These effects are stronger among German firms. Lastly, the effects of board size and audit committee effectiveness (AUCE) on risk-taking have mixed results. Research limitations/implications: The results favor continued efforts to strengthen the composition of corporate boards and improve the effectiveness of audit committees to curb unhealthy corporate risk-taking. The recommendations from the research will provide regulators and corporate management with the necessary information needed to design an appropriate independent board structure, and board size (BOSI). The research will, furthermore, fortify the indispensability of financial experts on audit committees. Originality/value: This study contributes to the agency theory debate with these findings. Stronger board independence enables a better monitoring of the CEO, which leads to decision making based on a more appropriate level of risk. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Effective use of human resources is important for the profitability and governance of family firms. In a study of the human resource management (HRM) practices of US Hispanic family firms, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the implications of agency and stewardship governance. Design/methodology/approach: To better understand HRM practices in US Hispanic family firms, the authors present findings from 169 US firms to hypothesize the extent of HRM development in Hispanic family firms (n=70) vs non-Hispanic family firms (n=99). Findings: Results indicated that HRM practices in Hispanic family firms are less structured than those of non-Hispanic family firms; however, when Hispanic family firms effectively use HRM practices, they will have greater financial success. Originality/value: Therefore, the results suggest that Hispanic family firm leaders display relatively low agency governance and high stewardship governance. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

As outsourcing of services has grown in popularity, agency problems such as adverse selection and moral hazard have become more prevalent, leading to increased contracting costs. In this paper, we focus on how adverse selection and performance ambiguity arise in service outsourcing arrangements. We used agency theory as a theoretical lens to propose a mediated model where two antecedents, information asymmetry and goals compatibility, directly affect performance ambiguity, and indirectly through adverse selection. This model was tested empirically with dyadic data on 50 matched pair service outsourcing arrangements between organisations in Australia. Results show that information asymmetry impacts performance ambiguity through adverse selection, whereas goals compatibility affects performance ambiguity directly, without influencing adverse selection. These results suggest that the two agency problems are differentially affected by the antecedents of service outsourcing. The theoretical and practical contributions of this study are a better understanding of how different agency problems arise and how they can be controlled in service outsourcing in particular and in service production context more generally.

Purpose: Prior studies suggest that most expropriation of firm's resources is conducted through related party transactions (RPTs). Based on the conflict of interest view, related parties opportunistically use their authorities to expropriate firms' resources for their own benefits via RPTs subsequently increasing agency costs and reduce firm value. One important monitoring system suggested by agency theory to reduce the agency problem is corporate governance (CG). CG monitors firm's performance to align the interests of those who control and those who own the residual claims in a firm. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the moderating effect of CG characteristics on the relationship between RPTs and firm value. Design/methodology/approach: In order to clarify the distinct effect of RPTs, this study categorises RPTs into two groups including beneficial and detrimental RPTs (DRPTs). Applying "proportionate stratified random sampling", this study covers a panel of 271 firms listed on Bursa Malaysia over the period of 2009-2011, using a moderated multiple regression model. Findings: This study documents that firm value is positively associated with beneficial RPTs (BRPTs) and negatively related to detrimental RPTs (DRPTs). In addition, results show that divergence can intensify the negative relationship between DRPTs and firm value. Findings support the necessity for more scrutiny by regulators, policy makers and standard setters to monitor the conflict of interests in RPTs and restrain the power of related parties to protect the firm's wealth by introducing stricter regulations for RPTs and improve CG practices especially to monitor RPTs in order to limit the opportunistic behaviour of related parties. Research limitations/implications: Research implications have been presented in Section 10. It has also been summarised in practical implications and social implications sections. Practical implications: The findings of this study indicate that investors, creditors and policy makers should not consider all RPTs as harmful transactions and it seems necessary to categorise RPTs into different groups including transactions which are detrimental and transactions which are beneficial to the firm. Social implications: The findings of this study support the necessity for more scrutiny by regulators, policy makers and standard setters to monitor the conflict of interests in RPTs. They should restrain the power of related parties to protect the firm's wealth by introducing stricter regulations for RPTs and improving CG practices especially to monitor RPTs in order to limit the opportunistic behaviour of related parties. Originality/value: This study contributes to the RPTs literature by showing that the effect of RPTs on firm value depends on the types of RPTs, and market participants allocate different values to different types of RPTs. Therefore, to fill the gap and clarify the distinct effect of RPTs, this study categorizes RPTs into two groups including beneficial and detrimental RPTs. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Incentive alignment is discussed as one of the key factors for successful implementation of supply chain management. However, there is a lack of empirical research regarding implementation as well as evaluation of the effects of alignment mechanisms in practice. The purpose of this study is therefore to explore and describe the current practice and to identify gaps of Supply chain incentive alignment. The study is an explorative and descriptive survey study based on forty-eight responses from members, supply chain officers, of the Swedish Supply chain panel. The theoretical lenses are based on literature discussing incentive alignment in supply chains, e.g. principal-agency theory and supply chain contracting, but also on literature discussing internal process based management and rewards for goal congruence. The study shows a clear gap between perceived importance and realized practice of both external (inter-organizational) and internal (cross-functional) incentive alignment. Very few of the existing sophisticated coordinating mechanisms proposed in theory were used to any significant extent. In fact, the internal incentive structures seem to counter act, and not support, supply chain orientation. This finding relates not only to non-logistics departments but also to functions in "the logistics family". The major challenge, both externally and internally, is to be able to define incentives that drives behavior in the right direction. The study clearly shows gaps between practitioners' intent and current practice, and it provides a broad range of more sophisticated and coordinating mechanisms than the ones mainly used today.

Research Question/Issue: Concentrated ownership is more the rule than the exception in weak institutional environments, and the absence of external control mechanisms, leading to ineffective legal enforcement, intensifies principal-principal agency issues. Our study examines how the structuring of the corporate board plays a vital role in informing foreign investors about the risk of being expropriated, which affects their decisions to make equity investments in firms in weak institutional regimes. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of large listed Indian firms in the period 2010-2014, we hypothesize that the presence of affiliate directors on the board has a negative impact on foreign investments. Likewise, the presence of controlling owners-directors on the board together with chief executive officers' additional directorial positions has an inverted U-shaped impact on foreign investments. Theoretical/Academic Implications: By making use of agency theory and focusing on the importance of foreign financing, our study highlighted the factors that deter foreign investors from providing capital to firms in weak institutional regimes. The use of this theoretical perspective, by emphasizing the differences in agency problems prevalent in strong versus weak institutional regimes, further suggested that examination of the structure of corporate boards is an important way to detect and gauge the potential for expropriation in countries suffering from weaknesses in investor protection. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our study has important implications for corporations operating in markets suffering from a legal environment that offers little investor protection. Investors are less prone to invest in these countries, as the risk of expropriation by dominant shareholders means they cannot be sure of actually getting the putative return. Our work shows how corporations can structure their boards effectively to convince investors that they face less danger of expropriation and so attract foreign capital. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

This study aims to examine the direct and moderating effects of the chief executive officer's (CEO) decision horizon and the board governance on a firm's entry into new technological fields, respectively. In a sample of 1727 firm-year observations for 156 Taiwanese firms in the semiconductor and optoelectronics industries for the period of 2003-2014, we found that the longer the CEO decision horizon, the more eager the focal firm is to enter new technological fields. Such a relationship is also strengthened by board power characterized by boards dominated by more outside directors, but weakened by board homogeneity of industry background. The configurational analysis further reveals that board homogeneity outweighs board power in reducing the positive influence of the CEO decision horizon on technological entry. This study not only contributes to the behavioral agency theory by infusing and testing CEO decision horizon to enhance predictions of the incidence of entering into new technological fields, but also reveals the contextual influences of board governance on executive risk taking. In addition, this study cautions against drawing a simple governance solution in support of a firm's technological entry. We point out different governance arrangements in which the CEO decision horizon will encourage more active technological entries in an environment of incessant changes. (c) 1988-2012 IEEE.

In this paper we investigate the under-researched topic of the use of executive share-based compensation in Poland, and we analyse empirically whether theoretical explanations developed and applied mainly in the context of developed countries also hold in this specific context. Building on agency and institutional theories we study the determinants of using executive share-based pay in 362 companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. As a result, we highlight the role of the state in Polish firms and the need to consider specifically principal-principal conflicts typical of emerging economies in post-state-socialist organisational research. Our findings not only reflect particularities of the institutional environment in the country studied but also highlight the limits of the traditional principal-agent lens applied in emerging economies.

Purpose: Despite the importance of accountability for the oversight of projects, few studies have directly examined accountability mechanisms at the project level. While the literature already provides descriptions of governance and mechanisms of accountability, the purpose of this paper is to examine how project managers view their accountability relationships within their organizational context. Design/methodology/approach: The study is guided by critical realism as a philosophy of science. The authors interviewed 15 project managers from 12 organizations and analyzed the transcripts in the light of existing project management accountability literature. Findings: The authors observe the practice of socializing accountability through face-to-face negotiation and symmetries of power due to interdependencies happen to some extent in management of projects. This suggests ambidexterity in accountability in project-based organizations. Therefore, the current models of project accountability and governance that are solely based on the agency theory are not sufficient to explain the accountability relationships in such organizations. Practical implications: Accountability arrangements happen within a system for steering projects. Managers should be aware of how project managers view their accountability and how socializing practices of accountability can help the project's management and the organization's management interact in order to transform organizational systems by regulating issues of project concern and defining the process and direction of how project deliverables are produced, introduced, absorbed and used within the organization. Originality/value: "Theory driven" interviews and analysis are used to confirm or refine conceptualization of accountability in management of projects. Most models of project governance are based on the agency theory or governability theory. The authors have demonstrated that socializing practices of accountability should be included in investigating project governance. The authors observe that project managers are often concerned with the interdependence with their principals and the socializing processes of accountability that arise from this interdependence.

Prior research in agency theory views outside directors as being mostly extrinsically motivated by the potential for financial rewards, and as such stresses the value of using director stock options and equity to incentivize outside directors to pursue strategic risks. We draw on and extend agency-theory by arguing that outside directors are primarily intrinsically motivated, and therefore excessive emphasis on pecuniary rewards and punishments can ironically subvert a director's motives away from strategic risk-taking. In particular, we claim that more important than extrinsic rewards and government regulations is creating a secure environment for directors so that they may exercise their fiduciary duties without fear of litigation. We test our theory on a sample of 196 S&P 500 firms from 2005 to 2015 and find that the pressures imposed on the board through external regulations and controls can often backfire and result in outside directors signing off on less risky expenditure. A strong implication of these findings is no real substitute exists to creating a safe environment for directors, where they have the freedom to pursue the long-term interests of the principals, even if this goes against the short-termism of capital markets.

To create transparency on the rising plethora of Shadow IT (SIT) and Business-managed IT (BMIT) research, this paper reviews how existing research in the field uses reference theories. A review of 107 SIT and BMIT literature items shows that 52 (49%) of the literature items drew on 37 reference theories for theory testing and theory building. The remaining 55 (51%) literature items did not base their research on reference theories. To guide theorizing in future SIT and BMIT research, this paper argues in favor of 'category-spanning' reference theories, i.e., reference theories already used across the SIT and BMIT research categories 'causing factors,' 'outcomes,' and 'governance of SIT and BMIT.' The paper identifies four category-spanning theories: (1) transaction cost theory, (2) agency theory, (3) loose coupling theory, and (4) technological frames. Analyzing the prior use of these reference theories in SIT and BMIT, the paper at hand suggests and discusses extensions for their application in future SIT and BMIT research. In addition to the category-spanning reference theories, the theory of workarounds seems to be highly applicable. Due to the novelty of the research field and the explorative character of most existing studies, the paper calls for enhanced theorizing in the field of SIT and BMIT since currently most of the literature items do not build on reference theories.

Although the link between managerial ownership and firm performance is often explained in relation to a firm's risk-taking behavior, little is known about how managerial ownership affects corporate risk-taking in industries characterized by high financial and operational risks, like the restaurant industry. To understand this important and understudied link, our study draws upon agency theory to examine the relationship between managerial ownership and franchising, typically a risk-reduction strategy of restaurant firms. Our results from panel data analyses using a sample of 962 firm-year observations show that managerial ownership is negatively associated with degree of franchising. Further, we find that after considering the scope of managerial discretion, there is a U-shaped relationship between managerial ownership and degree of franchising such that the degree of franchising decreases as managerial ownership increases up to a certain level, but then increases in tandem as managerial ownership increases to higher levels. Our results indicate that there is an optimal level of franchising associated with managerial ownership, implying that owners can influence their firms' risk-taking behavior by setting target managerial ownership goals and designing effective incentive contracts.

This paper offers a fresh perspective on executive compensation by offering a new paradigm for choosing executive compensation structure based on environmental factors and firm size. This new perspective uses agency theory as a theoretical foundation. The availability of information, primarily information related to the agent, has typically been of utmost concern in the compensation selection process. However, a predominant focus on cognitive or behavioral information of the agent neglects the relative importance and impact of environmental forces in this process. This study evaluates the composition of the compensation contract using fluctuating environmental dimensions as the primary determinant. Specifically, we examine environmental munificence, dynamism, and complexity and the influence of varying levels of each of these variables and their interaction on the optimal choice of compensation contract utilized for both large firms and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This externally focused view of compensation contract creation underscores the significance of environmental factors in determining contract selection while also acknowledging the necessity of principals utilizing information related to both the agent and the environment. Furthermore, we argue that top executive compensation structures for large organizations and non-adaptive SMEs should differ from those of adaptive SMEs.

Purpose: This study aims to determine the fraud risk factors perceived by employees to have the greatest influence on individuals committing fraud as an unethical conduct, as well as to analyze employees' opinions on fraud prevention program. Design/methodology/approach: The fraud risk factors in this study are based on the concept of the fraud triangle as developed by Donald Cressey, as well as examples of situations set out in SAS No. 99. The samples used in this study are company employees who have been selected using the convenience sampling method. Findings: A survey of 109 employees reports that none of the three factors (pressure, opportunity and rationalization) has a significant influence on fraud. However, when comparing the factors, the pressure is considered to have the highest impact. In terms of fraud prevention, the employees suggest that it is extremely important to implement all prevention tools, especially with regard to the adequate segregation of duties. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of this study in terms of method and small samples are expected to inform future studies to overcome the limitations by using other methods such as interview and by collecting more respondents to gather their perceptions and opinions. Originality/value: This study contributed to the literature in confirming the pressure as the dominant factor and in confirming the importance of anti-fraud programs as suggested by the agency theory.

Purpose: This study aims to develop a conceptual model and assess the extent to which pre-, during- and post-employment HR security controls are applied in organizations to manage information security risks. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual model is developed based on the agency theory and the review of theoretical, empirical and practitioner literature. Following, empirical data are collected through a survey from 134 IT professionals, internal audit personnel and HR managers working within five major industry sectors in a developing country to test the organizational differences in pre-, during- and post-employment HR security measures. Findings: Using analysis of variance, the findings reveal significant differences among the organizations. Financial institutions perform better in employee background checks, terms and conditions of employment, management responsibilities, security education, training and awareness and disciplinary process. Conversely, healthcare institutions outperform other organizations in post-employment security management. The government public institutions perform the worst among all the organizations. Originality/value: An integration of a conceptual model with HR security controls is an area that is under-researched and under-reported in information security and human resource management literature. Accordingly, this research on HR security management contributes to reducing such a gap and adds to the existing HR security risk management literature. It, thereby, provides an opportunity for researchers to conduct comparative studies between developed and developing nations or to benchmark a specific organization's HR security management.

The paper aims to evaluate the combination of strategies that influence the success of New Technology Based Firms (NTBFs) located in isolated areas with resource constraints. We utilize the Kauffman Firm Survey to construct a subset of 224 firms operating in primary metal manufacturing industries and who are located in non-thriving areas. We focus on the impact of technological strategy, in the form of Inward Technology Licensing (ITL), combined with financial strategy, in the form of increased financial slack. Using a negative binomial-specification technique to model these relations, we find that ITL positively impacts internal innovation in the firm and this relation is strengthened by the presence of greater financial slack. This positive impact of financial slack supports the behavioral theory of the firm rather than agency theory in that financial slack enables further innovation rather than stifling it. This research confirms the importance of resource acquisition, suggesting that entrepreneurs may utilize external sources of knowledge in an effort to build a favorable situation when facing the challenges of location. Finally, by presenting evidence showing the compatibility of a financial strategy with a knowledge strategy (ITL), this study emphasizes the importance to entrepreneurs of choosing the proper combination of varying strategies.

This study aimed to determine whether executive remuneration levels at poorly performing state-owned entities (SOE)s in South Africa are justified. The study was motivated by the weak economic growth, fiscal consolidation, increased debt levels and poor financial performance of these entities. Dynamic panel data models were employed and estimated using the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimator. The data set comprised an unbalanced panel data of 33 commercial SOEs in South Africa that are listed under the Public Financial Management Act. The study found an inverse relationship between executive remuneration and financial performance. This is of concern as executive remuneration is high despite the SOEs' declining performance. The misalignment between pay and performance undermines the core principles of the agency theory, resulting in poor performance. These findings provide empirical support for public and media perceptions that executive remuneration is excessive and unmerited when measured against SOEs' performance. The findings will be of interest to observers of the economy, as they measure SOEs' capacity to play a leading role in investment and in improving the efficiency of the economy. They could also inform decision making and policy development on SOEs. (c) 2019, Allied Business Academies.

Scholars have long studied drivers of entrepreneurial behavior among established firms. Yet little is known about how individual factors shape a firm's choice to pursue entrepreneurship. We draw on behavioral agency theory to explore the role of equity incentives in driving corporate entrepreneurship. Our findings suggest CEOs avoid corporate entrepreneurial behaviors as their option wealth increases. However industry dynamics also prove to be an important contingency when predicting the effects of both restricted stock and stock options on the likelihood that the CEO engages in corporate entrepreneurship. Our findings provide a theoretical platform for predicting dimensions of entrepreneurial behavior and highlight effects of CEO equity ownership.

Scholars argue that the agency theory has some limitations as the sustaining theory of governance. It is its inability to distinguish the wider stakeholder influencing forces effecting on organisations. This paper delivers a concise picture incorporating other management-based theories to supplement agency theory in distinguishing the wider stakeholder influencing forces as well as the consequential extended governance standard it creates. Yet, for developing the theory building approach it has reviewed and critically examined the existing literatures. Furthermore, a circumstance is built to assimilate four existing theories that supplement each other to distinguish the wider stakeholder influencing forces. Finally, further studies have been recommended to certify the approach with wide-ranging real life institutional settings.

In this paper, we aim to empirically assess the main determinants of decisions of established large firms to launch or join a corporate venture fund. Our study is performed on a database of all French firms that adopted a corporate venture capital (CVC) strategy between 1995 and 2015. This specifically collected dataset includes 58 large groups listed on the SBF 120 index, with 29 groups that launched or joined CVC funds and the other 29 groups are our control sample. The results provide evidence that a firm's CVC strategy is an increasing function of the strength of its specific resources, its performance, the availability of resources, and its low level of indebtedness.

Purpose: Motivated by agency theory, this paper aims to explore the impact of bank diversification and bank independency on the likelihood of bank failure. The effects of corporate governance (ownership and board structures) are also examined. Design/methodology/approach: Logistic regressions are used to explore the role of corporate governance on bank failure risk. This sample covers 608 banks from eight European countries. Findings: The results suggest that the well-documented finding that diversification and bank independency may increase bank failure risk does not persist under strong corporate governance mechanism. Thus, to reduce the bank failure risk, diversification should be strongly monitored by the management to avoid excessive risk-taking by shareholders. Originality/value: The approach used in this study differs from that used in previous studies from certain perspectives. First, unlike most previous studies that focused on the relationship between bank performance and bank diversification, the impact of income and asset diversification on bank failure is tested. Also, the impact of a combined effect of diversification and corporate governance variables on bank failure is tested. This allows the control for different ownership and board variables as factors that would potentially affect the likelihood of bank failure. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines the role of codes of ethics used to reduce the tendency for managers to irrationally escalate their investment decision commitments, and compares the effectiveness of such codes of ethics in mitigating the escalation of these commitments. Based on 2 (adverse selection and no adverse selection) x 3 (self-certification of code of ethics with signatures, code reading, and no code of ethics) factorial experimental data, the participants in the adverse selection condition tend to escalate more than those who do not. The code of ethics (self-certification of code of ethics with signatures and code reading) is significantly able to mitigate the manager's escalation behavior. Furthermore, the code certification with signatures is the most effective method to mitigate the escalation of commitment. This study contributes to the literature on the escalation of commitment by providing empirical evidence of effective de-escalation strategies through the organizational ethics aspect.

This study explores new evidence considering the global debate regarding board leadership structure and its effects on the dual performance of microfinance by observing 80 microfinance institutions in Bangladesh from 2010 to 2015. Random (GLS) and fixed (LSDV) effects models were applied in identifying the insignificant positive effects of CEO duality into microfinance sustainability and the negative effects on outreach of the poor. Results indicate that the structure of board leadership, have positive effects on the sustainability performance of microfinance but have negative effects on outreach performance.

Increasing pressure from stakeholders that demands for a holistic corporate report both in terms of financial and non-financial information, has resulted in a move towards a more integrated approach in corporate reporting. The aim of this study is to examine the presence of the elements of integrated reporting and the drivers for the adoption of such reports. The influence of internal and external pressure from the perspective of agency and stakeholder theories forms the focus of this study. Content analyses of the annual reports of the top 100 companies in Malaysia for the year 2014 are examined. The results show positive relationships for the independent variables mission and vision, and risk and opportunities with the presence of the elements of integrated reporting in the annual reports. The positive relationships reveal that companies that align key strategies with the mission and vision statement and take measures to address risk and opportunities of the organization, will be more proactive in implementing integrated reporting. The findings provide empirical evidence on the progress of integrated reporting in a developing country where research to examine the effects of specific determinants on the likelihood of companies in a developing country providing integrated reports is almost non-existent.

We empirically investigate the largely unexplored relationship between corporate top management teams (TMT) and CVC unit managers. Doing so, we provide new insights into the interplay between TMT decisions and CVC managers' behaviour and how agency conflicts between them influence the survival of CVC units. Using a proprietary dataset of 64 CVC units we apply fsQCA in order to identify the interrelatedness, causal asymmetry and equifinality of agency-related conditions leading to survival. We relativise former literature by demonstrating that financial incentivisation of CVC managers need to be complemented by additional factors to impact the survival of CVC units. Further, we conclude that the decision-making autonomy of CVC managers seem to work as a form of non-financial incentive. Finally, we demonstrate that the configuration of providing strategic support, investing with high strategic proximity, and non-autonomously acting CVC managers is related to non-survival of the CVC unit.

Purpose: This paper aims to discuss the role of agency theory in combatting bribery in multinational corporations. It is shown how a combination of bonus and malus payments could help to create the right incentives for agency. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the analysis of 15 formal and 15 informal expert interviews with both prevention experts and corrupt individuals, concrete ways of more effectively combatting bribery have been developed. Findings: As a result, it is suggested that matrix systems could help to adjust incentives systems to take compliance issues into account. It is found that multinational corporations should eliminate. Research limitations/implications: This study's findings are limited to the perspectives of 30 interviewees. Hence, it is possible that a study with a larger sample conducted in different countries or at a different time would have led to different results. Practical implications: The identification of the potential role of incentive systems in compliance mechanisms is meant to provide compliance officers and legislators with valuable insights into why the current prevention schemes are ineffective. This can help to both improve compliance mechanisms. Originality/value: While the empirical findings are based in Europe, the results could be applied globally. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Organizational control is used to coordinate the activities and align the interests of independently managed marketing channel firms, which should result in better performance (i.e., disciplining effects of control). Yet, some research suggests that control may have unintended, crowding out effects, such as increased opportunism. Using meta-analytic techniques, the authors attempt to reconcile these contradictory findings and provide some empirical generalizations about control in marketing channels. Based on transaction cost economics and agency theory, hypotheses regarding the antecedents and consequences of control in marketing channels are developed and tested. The results show that environmental uncertainty and transaction specific investments are related positively to both outcome and process control. Performance ambiguity, in contrast, is related negatively to output control. In general, the results support the disciplining effects of organizational control in marketing channels through reduced opportunism and enhanced performance. One exception is the positive, crowding out relationship between process control and opportunism. (c) Charles A. Ingene, James R. Brown and Rajiv P. Dant 2019.

Control as a primary project governance mechanism and a basic managerial function has been extensively utilized in projects which embrace principal-Agent relationships. Prior studies have shown that control is an effective strategy in mainstream principalagent relationships for principals to motivate their agents to behave in a desired manner and deliver satisfactory outputs. However, little is known about how principals perform control when agents are professionals providing intangible services in professional service projects. Therefore, this study aims to address the research question of how clients determine control strategies (including control modes and intensity) in design consulting projects. The specific research objective is to develop a conceptual framework for determining control modes and intensity in design consulting projects. Based on literature review and agency theory, this conceptual paper establishes a framework comprising antecedents of control modes and control intensity which indicate the feasibility and necessity of control respectively. This study enriches the knowledge about how to determine control strategies in professional service projects. Also, it expands the application of agency theory by delineating a particular type of principal-Agent relationship of which agents are professionals.

This article primarily investigates the influence of voter turnout and education of councillors on the efficiency of public goods delivery by Polish municipalities in 2011 and 2015. Efficiency is measured by the PSE index. The results reveal a positive impact of voter turnout on public sector efficiency. We confirm the existence of an agency relationship, in which higher voter turnout, through more public interest, creates pressure on the effective behaviour of the elected officials. Exceptions to this are shown in the biggest cities. The negative correlation may theoretically point towards electoral activation in the case of poor local authority assessments, and thus opposition to its further activities. According to estimates, the level of the councillors education negatively affects public sector efficiency. We reject the existence of an agency relationship, in which citizens try to select highly qualified councillors, expecting them to provide more public goods. There may be exceptions in the biggest cities. (c) 2019 Narodowy Bank Polski. All rights reserved.

Decentralisation has been attributed to fruitful outcomes for public services. However, by employing agency theory in this paper we argue that full decentralisation of all dimensions may not help, at least in the public bus service. Instead, better quality and satisfaction can only be achieved in a more fiscal but less administrative and political decentralisation. Data from two municipalities in the emerging economy of Vietnam is used to provide the empirical evidence. This paper thus is contributed to the literature of decentralisation and the emerging one of quality and satisfaction in public services. Limitations of the study are also discussed.

Orientation: Classic agency theory posits that the impact of uncontrollable factors should be excluded from executive remuneration. Existing research, however, shows a departure from this theory. Research purpose: This study sought to determine the approaches organisations take and the reasons thereof to account for uncontrollable factors in the design of their executive incentive schemes. Motivation for the study: There is little research in South Africa on how organisations account for uncontrollable factors in the design of their incentive schemes. Research approach/design and method: An exploratory qualitative research using semistructured interviews was conducted. Main findings: South African organisations are not strictly conforming to the classic agency theory prediction for uncontrollable factors as some allow the impact of uncontrollable factors to be included, and further, hybrid approaches may be applied. Practical/managerial implications: The menu of approaches presented will aid designers of incentive schemes to identify a tried and tested approach to adopt or improve their incentiverelated policies. Contribution/value-add: An expanded list of uncontrollable factors identified from South Africa's uniqueness is presented. Models for (1) accounting for uncontrollable factors in incentive schemes and (2) pay for individual performance versus firm performance dilemma are presented. These add to the body of existing literature. (c) 2019. The Authors.

Integrated reporting is the latest novelty in the corporate reporting field. It is a tool capable of better representing the capacity of companies to create value over time. In recent years, attention to this new reporting tool has grown in both professional and academic fields. However, despite past research that has analysed many aspects of integrated reporting, the integrated reporting quality and its determinants are still little explored. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing the effect of board characteristics on integrated reporting quality according to an agency theory approach. The findings, based on a sample of 134 international firms, show a positive relationship between the size, independence, diversity, and activity of a board with integrated reporting quality. This study contributes to enriching literature in this area in various ways. First, it broadens the scope of application of agency theory; second, it identifies further internal determinants of integrated reporting quality. This is the first study that analyses the impact of the characteristics of a board as a determining factor of integrated reporting quality. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

We take the perspective that considering the affective motives of dominant owners is essential to understanding business exit. Drawing on a refinement of behavioral agency theory, we argue that family-controlled firms are less likely than non-family-controlled firms to exit and tend to endure increased financial distress to avoid losses to the family's socioemotional wealth (SEW) embodied in the firm. Yet, when confronted with different exit options and when performance heuristics suggest that exit is unavoidable, family firms are more likely to exit via merger, which we argue saves some SEW, although it is less satisfactory financially. In contrast, nonfamily firms are more likely to exit via sale or dissolution, options that are more prone to offer higher financial returns than mergers. Family and nonfamily firms thus show different orders of exit options. We find support for these arguments in a longitudinal matched sample of privately held firms. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

Integrated reporting (IR) is used to demonstrate a firm's capacity to create value in the short, medium, and long term. It can better represent existing relationships between the company and its stakeholders, with a particular focus on investors. Attention to IR has grown considerably in recent years. However, studies on the determinants of IR quality are still limited. This study aims to bridge this literature gap by being the first study to analyse the role of ownership structure in IR context. To this end, it uses agency theory and is based on a sample of 152 international companies that have adopted IR. The results indicate a positive effect of institutional ownership and a negative effect of ownership concentration, managerial ownership and state ownership on the quality of integrated reports. These results are also consistent with the level of alignment of integrated reports with the <IR> framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study that analyses the role of ownership structure in the IR policies. (c) 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to explore empirically the consequences of knowledge hiding at the individual level and from the knowledge hiding committers' perspective. Hence, in line with agency theory and prior literature on knowledge hiding, the study investigates the associations between different facets of knowledge hiding and individual-level job performance, as well as the mediating role of employee well-being in the associations. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to analyze multisource survey data from a sample of 214 employees and 34 immediate supervisors, in a professional services company in Finland. Findings: Evasive hiding was found to be negatively associated with in-role job performance and positively associated with innovative job performance. Playing dumb was found to be positively associated with in-role job performance. Finally, even though the association between rationalized hiding and innovative job performance was found to be positive, it was found to be of a smaller magnitude when employee well-being was taken into account. Practical implications: Forceful unhealthy competition and exploitative and workaholic cultures are discussed to reduce knowledge hiding behavior among employees and their negative consequences. Originality/value: The study highlights the paradox of managing organizational knowledge. In line with agency theory, we advocate that while knowledge sharing is one of the major assets of organizational welfare from the organizational perspective, it may resonate with the employee's perspective. Consequently, unless employees' self-interest and organizational interests are aligned, the paradox of managing organizational knowledge arises, and the classic agency problem occurs.

Purpose: This study aims to analyse the role that the chief executive officer (CEO) has on integrated reporting (IR) adoption and whether this role is moderated by incentives to promote corporate transparency, including information asymmetry problems and financial constraints. IR represents the last frontier of corporate disclosure and aims to represent, through the annual integrated report, the ability of an organization to create value over time. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on 10,819 observations (an unbalanced data panel of 1,588 firms for the period 2009-2017). A logistic regression model is used to examine the association between CEO power and disclosure of an integrated report. Findings: The results show that CEOs with greater power oppose the disclosure of integrated information, and this behaviour is not modified by firms' incentives. Furthermore, greater growth opportunities increase CEO opposition to disclosing integrated information on the creation of value, perhaps as a consequence of the possible use of it by competitors. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature. First, it expands the scientific debate on the topic of IR. Second, it extends the application field of agency theory, which is seldom used to explain the phenomena related to IR. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Intellectual capital is an important tool for strengthening a firm's competitive advantage and helping it achieve its medium- and long-term financial objectives. Currently accepted accounting principles do not outline strict rules and regulations for intellectual capital disclosure. However, the advent of integrated reporting offer firms an innovative tool to disseminate this information. Although previous research has analysed the intellectual capital found in integrated reports, no studies have analysed the board of directors' role in intellectual capital disclosure policies. This study uses agency theory to analyse the effect of board characteristics on intellectual capital disclosure quality (ICDQ) in the context of integrated reporting. To this end, it develops a new scoring system to measure ICDQ. The results, based on a sample of 130 international firms operating in different sectors, show a positive relationship between board size, independence, diversity and activity with ICDQ.

Many government services are delivered by (partially) autonomous agencies. Governments need effective measures for contracting, steering, and monitoring agencies and to balance control and trust. In the literature, control-based agency theory and trust-based stewardship theory have often been portrayed as alternative and competing approaches. In empirical studies in public administration, however, these approaches often find mixed and contradictory results. Against this background, this article analyzes how a combination of trust- and control-based approaches, explicitly founded on agency and stewardship theory, can help explain when participants find a given governance regime to be most satisfactory. A survey instrument is developed which, for the first time, fully measures the rich concept of stewardship theory in conjunction with agency theory. The analysis of the governance of Dutch agencies shows that government indeed combines governance solutions from both theoretical camps and illuminates under which conditions this combination is most satisfactory.

The discourse of corporate sustainability performance (CSP) has created an increasing motivation for companies to improve their competitive advantage. This study examines the drivers leading to a high level of CSP within non-financial Turkish companies listed in the Borsa Istanbul Sustainability Index. Drawing on both stakeholder and agency theories, we formulate a set of hypotheses that link CSP with ownership structure, board diversity, and firm-specific characteristics. Based on logit and probit models, the empirical results tend to confirm the positive influence of foreign and institutional ownerships in shaping CSP and indicate that CSP is positively linked with board size and the proportion of independent board members. Further, the findings show that companies with a leading level of CSP have a lower return than companies with mediocre CSP based on a market-based measure, Tobin's Q. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

With supply chain finance gaining more prominence in practice and drawing increasing attention from researchers, the question arises how this emerging discipline can build on existing theoretical conceptualisations. However, few studies have incorporated theoretical frameworks and there remains therefore a gap in literature. To fill this gap, the study reviews five theories on their suitability for supply chain finance: transaction cost economics, agency theory, network theory, collaborative networks and social exchange theory. A Scottish focus group consisting of practitioners involved in supply chain finance provided empirical data for the evaluation. The findings suggest that there is supporting evidence for using agency theory, network theory, transaction cost economics and social exchange theory as theoretical frameworks for studying phenomena of supply chain finance. Furthermore, the results indicate that the conceptualisations based on agency theory should be extended with 'reverse principal-agent theory' to fit with the contingencies of supply chain finance. The frameworks of collaborative networks are found less suitable. In addition to these theoretical considerations, the focus group discussion also points out that the financial department's collaboration with other departments involved in the primary supply chain process in firms needs to be improved. To achieve this training and supplier development, particularly for smaller firms, is seen as key. These outcomes have informed a research agenda for research groups, early career researchers and doctoral students. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Integrating expatriate staffing and leadership succession literature, this study investigates the influence of expatriate top manager replacement on foreign subsidiary performance and the moderating effects of subsidiary context. Building on a refined understanding of agency theory and evidence from 2113 firm-year observations, including 260 expatriate successions, this study shows that when expatriates are replaced, regardless by whom (either host-country national or expatriate manager), the performance of the subsidiaries declines, suggesting that the departure of expatriate top managers often see subsidiaries being left in a less than favorable condition. If the subsidiary's prior performance has been unsatisfactory, the newly appointed expatriate might not be able to prevent further deterioration of its performance. Replacing expatriates with host-country national managers can help improve subsidiary performance, but this usually happens in older, more established subsidiaries. These findings framed in a refined agency theory provide us a more in-depth understanding of expatriate staffing failure. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate governance of Oman's financial sector companies. Intellectual capital has been found to successfully contribute to the economic wealth creation of firms in germane literature. Unfortunately, financial statements do not necessarily capture and reflect the contributions of intellectual capital, thereby leading to an information asymmetry between companies and users of financial statements. The research also investigates the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital efficiency across various financial subsectors. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports available on Muscat Securities Market for 31 listed financial sector companies for the period 2012 to 2016 and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Intellectual capital is measured using Pulic's efficiency measure of value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). Corporate governance individual components such as board characteristics, audit committee characteristics and ownership structure are presented as independent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that board size and frequency of audit committee meetings have a significant association with the intellectual capital efficiency of Oman's financial sector. VAIC and human capital efficiency of banks are also significantly influenced by most of the corporate governance mechanisms; however, other subsectors do not report such findings. Corporate governance of banks in comparison to other subsectors effectively engages in utilizing the potential of intellectual capital efficiency. Agency theory and resource dependency theory find limited support as a result of this study. The GMM results are not robust to the alternative instruments. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small as the study is limited to the listed financial sector of Oman. Future studies can be extended to include all of Oman's or GCC's listed companies. Additionally, the intellectual capital is measured using the construct of VAIC which suffers some limitations and can be overcome using other tools such as content analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that Oman's regulators can create an awareness strategy on highlighting the importance of intellectual capital for companies (board of directors and managers), investors, debtors and creditors. Further, Oman's Capital Market Authority and Muscat Securities Market need to strengthen the regulations related to intellectual capital. Originality/value: This study extends intellectual capital and corporate governance literature by presenting the research outcome for Oman's financial sector. It is useful for Oman's financial sector companies to direct corporate governance measures for driving value creation of firms through the management of intellectual capital efficiency.

Research Question/Issue: We review the literature on the relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. Research Findings/Insights: We identify the theoretical lenses that researchers apply when studying strategic leadership and innovation, most notably agency theory and upper echelons theory. We review the innovation constructs and measures that scholars employ, and we survey the links among strategic leaders' characteristics and technological innovation. Ultimately, we organize the literature into an integrative framework that provides a concise overview of the extant knowledge, and we outline an agenda for future research. Theoretical/Academic Implications: First, we offer scholars a discipline-spanning overview of the extant knowledge on the topic. Second, by integrating important aspects of corporate governance, such as the role of the board of directors, incentives for the chief executive officer or the top management team, and firm ownership, into the context of technological innovation, we highlight the vital role it plays in the realm of technological innovation. Third, we provide a useful guide for scholars and direct their work towards fruitful avenues for future research. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer insights for practitioners interested in better understanding the bidirectional relationship between strategic leadership and technological innovation. In particular, our framework and our detailed analysis of the impact of strategic leaders on technological innovation can guide shareholders and board members in matters related to board composition as well as top executive selection and compensation.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of financial, monitoring and experiential expertise of audit committee chair (ACC) and HR, monitoring and experiential expertise of nomination committee chair (NCC) on the financial performance (FP) of the firm. Design/methodology/approach: Quantitative approach was used in this study to collect data from 50 non-financial firms of Pakistan and to analyze the data through e-views for testing hypotheses. Findings: The findings revealed that financial and monitoring expertise of ACC and experiential expertise of NCC positively influence return on assets, return on equity and the net profit margin of the firm. However, no significant influence of experiential expertise of ACC and monitoring and HR expertise of NCC on FP was found. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study will help firms of Pakistan to understand what expertise of their ACC and NCC can contribute to the enhancement of their FP. However, the current study examined the non-financial firms of Pakistan only. Originality/value: Past studies have never shown the particular focus on different types of expertise of "Chairs" of nomination and audit committees in a combined research to analyze their impact on FP of firms. The present study has abridged this gap in the field of expertise of chairs of board committees so, it will open new areas of discussion for future researchers in domains of "agency theory", "human capital theory" and corporate governance.

The effectiveness of the well-known corporate governance practices may not be universal due to fundamental differences in the environments under which firms operate. By using hand-collected data from all the non-financial firms listed on the unexplored East African frontier markets (i.e., Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda), we examine the effect of board characteristics on the performance of firms. Our results show that board size has a negative and significant effect on firm performance. The presences of foreigners and civil servants on the board play positive roles on financial performance, where the agency and resource dependence theories apply. Further, we find that board members with higher education also contribute to firm performance. These findings still hold when we consider the 2008-2009 financial crisis period. Overall, we show that in a business climate where ownership is largely dominated by few shareholders, the conventional governance mechanisms do not work effectively. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the impact of chief executive officer (CEO) duality (a chief executive operating chair of board and leader of a firm) of newly privatized Vietnamese firms on the level of corporate entrepreneurship; this understanding is used to throw light on the extent to which a position of strategic agility is achieved. Specifically, does CEO duality enable firms to keep consistent with their vision, while remaining flexible in their business model? Data from a survey of 114 CEOs of board and top management team members in privatized firms in Vietnam were collected and examined through a combination of agency theory and stewardship theory. The research finds that CEO duality does not necessarily lead to a higher degree of entrepreneurial activity in privatized Vietnamese firms. The results have policy implications for shaping corporate governance and management implications for firms striving to be competitive, in ways that advance corporate entrepreneurship in economies such as Vietnam that are both emerging and pursuing privatization.

Innovation contributes to a firm's long-term competitive advantages but also involves significant risk and uncertainty. As agency theory predicts, CEOs are self-interested and risk-averse, and thus are reluctant to engage in innovation investments. However, the extent to which CEOs are self-interested and the mechanisms through which self-interested CEOs affect firm innovation have not been empirically tested. To fill this gap, we propose that CEOs possess a mix of both self-preserving and other-regarding motives, and build a mediation model in which CEO values affect firm innovation via firms' long-term orientation. Based on a three-phase (from 2014 to 2016) survey of 436 Chinese manufacturing firms, we find that CEOs with high self-regarding values reduce innovation efforts and performance by damaging a firm's long-term orientation. Moreover, CEO tenure, CEO duality, and environmental uncertainty weaken the relationship between CEO values and firm innovation via long-term orientation. Our study enriches the innovation literature by extending the basic assumptions of agency theory and by providing empirical evidence to determine whether and how self-regarded CEOs affect firm innovation.

In recognition of the significance of external business environments for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), this study examines the relationship between macroenvironments and financing decisions of SMEs in the restaurant industry. With a focus on formal and informal credits, the study is grounded in agency theory, which explains how information asymmetry between SMEs and lenders might influence SMEs' financing decisions. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to analyze the data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and the World Bank. The results indicated that the financial infrastructure and tax regulation can significantly increase the odds of choosing formal credits and decrease the odds of choosing informal credits. This study contributes to the literature by assessing the role of information asymmetry and agency theory on restaurant SMEs' financing decisions. The study also has implications for industry practitioners and policymakers for the financial sustainability and success of SMEs.

Stakeholders expect focal firms to improve their environmental performance. While firms may be able to accumulate the environmental expertise needed to achieve this goal internally, doing so may require significant time and resource commitments. Alternatively, buyer firms can leverage their suppliers' existing environmental expertise and gain access to such expertise when they purchase products and services from these suppliers. The purpose of this study was to develop and test theory regarding under what conditions suppliers' environmental expertise influences a buying firms' procurement spend with these suppliers. We ground our study in transaction cost economics and agency theories and empirically test our hypotheses using a unique buyer-supplier dyadic data set. We find that buyer firms are willing to increase their overall business spend with suppliers that have strong environmental expertise, particularly when the buyer firms are more profitable and have higher levels of absorptive capacity. However, we find the opposite effect when the buyer firm's executive compensation is linked to the firm's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Likewise, we also find that the buyer firm's environmental concern ratings negatively moderate the relationship between the supplier's environmental expertise and the buyer's procurement spend with the supplier.

Product expirations at retail stores erode profits and burden the environment. We investigate whether manufacturers can leverage salesforce compensation design as a waste-reduction tool. We propose a data-driven framework that uses structural econometric modeling and agency theory. Our analysis starts with a game theoretic model in which a salesperson interacts with a manufacturer that reimburses retailers and penalizes its own salesforce for expired products. We then use our model's equilibrium outcome to estimate factors that determine the effort exerted by the sales representatives of a consumer-packaged-goods manufacturer. We first show theoretically that a manufacturer can simultaneously increase profits and reduce waste by increasing its sales representatives' penalty for product expiration that occurs at the retailer. Based on this, we formulate a manufacturer's profit maximization problem to compute optimum expiration penalties. Solving this problem for the manufacturer, we find the potential to simultaneously reduce waste and improve profits for 14% of the product-market combinations in our dataset. For these cases, we find that charging the salesperson 2.1 times the commission (on average) for each expired unit can increase the manufacturer's profits by 0.58% and reduce waste by 23.3%. This study determines that a profit-seeking manufacturer can reduce waste at retailers by optimizing its salesforce incentive structure. Our work bridges the salesforce compensation and sustainable operations literatures. Furthermore, our framework allows consumer-packaged-goods manufacturers to identify win-win opportunities for the environment and their bottom line.

The aim of this paper is to bring together some of the foundational and recent literature interlinking corporate governance and the leadership role of the board of directors. Strategic leadership is widely assumed to be a responsibility that defaults to the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). However, in practice, what most CEOs do is strategic management rather than strategic leadership. While strategic management does share key aspects of strategic leadership CEOs are expected to prioritize the managerial side over the leadership side. This is just one of the situations in which the boardroom assumes the leadership role. This paper discusses how boards of directors conduct the process of strategic leadership in their organizations. In recent years there has been an increasing interest among scholars to understand how boards strategize from a behavioral point of view. This growing interest has resulted in the development of various typologies regarding boards' involvement in the strategic leadership processes.

Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to extend agency theory in the context of tunneling by exploring how different owner types seek private benefits of control. Specifically, we examine how information asymmetries and board representation create different pressures for tunneling for state-owned, business group-owned, and family-owned firms. We tested our hypotheses with a meta-analytic structural equation model. Research Findings/Insights: Our findings show that the relationship between ownership and tunneling differs across owner types in terms of both directionality and magnitude. Our study offers a substantial theoretical contribution to the principal-principal problem literature by theorizing and testing variations of the problem among owners. Our study also advances our understanding of the role of ownership in firms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our findings have important theory-building implications for the principal-principal literature. Controlling shareholders have been linked to performance outcomes or to tunneling in general, yet little is known about their comparative propensity to engage in tunneling. Our results, however, highlight that the propensity to engage in tunneling varies substantially among controlling shareholders. Furthermore, in the robustness checks, we disconfirm some of the assumptions of the principal-principal literature. This study demonstrates the need to theorize about specific types of ownership and reassess the core arguments of principal-principal theory. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights for policymakers interested in mitigating the risk of minority shareholders being expropriated by the controlling shareholder. As the key driver of tunneling appears to be access to private information and knowledge of the firm, we offer recommendations on what policymakers can do to minimize the asymmetry of information.

Governance can be challenging in healthcare operations, particularity when attending physicians lack financial relationships with the hospital. In the absence of formal incentive system mechanisms, it may be possible to use informal relational governance to synchronize activities. We use Relational Resource Based View and Agency theory to conceptualize trust (an informal governance mechanism) and physician employment (a formal governance mechanism) as moderators of key operational phenomena in hospitals. Specifically, we test the moderated effects of trust and physician employment on the relationships among lean strategy, process integration, operational efficiency, and patient satisfaction. Analysis of 583 data points from 302 acute care U.S. hospitals reveals that lean strategy impacts process integration, and process integration impacts operational efficiency and patient satisfaction. Trust enhances the positive relationship between lean strategy and process integration such that the relationship is stronger when physicians are employed by the hospital and weaker when physicians are not employed by the hospital. A post hoc analysis reveals that physician employment also influences how process integration affects patient satisfaction. Our results explain the key roles of trust, physician employment, and integration in linking strategy and outcomes. Practitioner interviews validate and help to tease out the implications of our findings. This study contributes important insights for researchers, executives, and policy makers interested in governance and improvements in healthcare delivery. (c) 2019 Decision Sciences Institute

Global apparel brands that source production from less developed countries are increasingly exposed to risks that arise from human rights violations. Despite widely publicized factory safety failures, reactionary regulatory efforts remain inadequate. This situation is commonly attributed to unyielding downward price pressure imposed on factories by Western brands. To address this problem, this research develops a comprehensive cost model for low-cost apparel production following a total cost of ownership approach. Comprehensive production data for cotton T-shirts from nine Bangladeshi factories provide the basis for model construction. The model reveals that materials generate the bulk of production costs (77%) for a T-shirt, in contrast to worker wages which generate only 2 percent of the total production cost per unit (e.g., 16 cents out of a $8USD retail price).

Using agency and stewardship theories, this article investigates conditions that affect the impact of performance management in the ministerial steering of agencies. Agency theory assumes that agencies act opportunistically, leading to low trust between the ministry and the agency. Conversely, stewardship theory assumes that agencies act trustworthily. Arguably, however, in the steering of agencies, the impact of performance management depends on performance management practices and the type of ministry-agency relation. The effect of performance contract design and a top-down or bottom-up approach to performance management on the impact of performance management is analyzed in the context of whether the ministry-agency relation tends toward the principal-agent or principal-steward type. The data were obtained from a survey of bureaucrats employed in government agencies in Norway and a systematic analysis of official policy documents. The results show that a bottom-up approach increases the impact of performance management in principal-steward relations but not in principal-agent relations. Performance contract design has no effect on the impact of performance management, irrespective of relationship characteristics. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Research Question/Issues: Most extant literature implicitly equates obtaining information through board interlocks to acting on the information. We investigate triggers that help to translate the information into action. In addition to exposure to the information by board interlocks, we suggest that the self-interest of the individuals who create these ties and hierarchical power of interlinked firms determines the likelihood of taking actions of adopting new practices. Research Findings/Insights: Using the action of adopting two distinctive governance practices, stock option pays or board reform, we find that sent ties and received ties affect the adoption decisions differently. Whereas sent ties reflect managerial interests, received ties derive power from a hierarchical relationship between the focal firm and the interlinked firm. Such differential nature of sent and received ties drives a differential result in terms of adopting two distinctive governance practices. We also find support for different moderating effects of firm performance on the impact of sent and received ties. Theoretical/Academic Implications: In this study, we incorporated the self-interest of executives with sent ties to prior adopters and the power of directors who establish ties with prior adopters that are hierarchically positioned. By doing so, this study paints a more fine-grained picture regarding underlying mechanisms by which information gained through ties is translated into action. This provides important insights for both agency theory and resource-dependency theory. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Hierarchical board ties are not a unique phenomenon in Japan. We often find such ties in business groups in China, India, Korea, and some European countries. Establishing board interlocks among subsidiaries in a business group is an important governance resolution for controlling the whole business group. Hence, our findings that the ties carry not only information but also agent's interest and hierarchical power should be taken into account when a business group designs board interlocks.

This paper explores the development and articulation of the agency and stakeholder theories of the firm and their corresponding logics of shareholder wealth maximisation and stakeholder interest optimisation. We note how these two perspectives have been viewed as diametrically opposite normative, instrumental and descriptive theories, despite efforts by some authors to find common ground. Each has served as a basis for firm governance. We explore the relationship of the agency and stakeholder theories to the conceptualisations of the roles of boards of directors, and how both theories hold value in understanding two board functions/roles: control/monitoring roles and service roles (which covers both resources and strategy).

Purpose: In a time where stakeholders increasingly demand social, environmental, and economic sustainability, mismanaging suppliers can impose substantial sustainability risks for a company and harm its reputation and business severely. This research explores the implementation of a corporate sustainable supplier strategy designed to cope with such risks from an agency theory perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A case study of a multinational enterprise, a provider of leading mobility solutions in the realm of escalators, moving walkways and elevators, is conducted. Data is collected from multiple sources of evidence, including strategy documents, a focus group and semi-structured interviews. Findings: The study identifies several implementation challenges and coping mechanisms in firstly, the agency relationships between the headquarter and the regional subsidiary units and secondly, the relationships between the regional subsidiary units and their suppliers. Research limitations/implications: A framework conceptualising the implementation of sustainable supplier strategies is proposed. The framework positions the topic at the interface between supply chain sustainability risk, supplier quality management as well as agency relationships and identifies avenues for further research. The key limitations refer to the single case study methodology and the exclusion of suppliers in the data collection approach. Practical implications: The proposed framework can support multinational enterprises in developing corporate sustainability strategies and in implementing them in the supplier network. Originality/value: The originality of the framework lies in the integrated approach combining supply chain sustainability risk, supplier quality management and triadic agency relationships.

The governance of non-profit organisations is complex, as these organisations are not only intended to create value for third parties but also dependent on their donors. When the donor is a for-profit firm, it may be challenging to align and balance the firm's for-profit interests and the non-profit organisation's social aims. The board of directors has the main responsibility for supporting and monitoring managers' decisions so that all perspectives are considered, but doing so requires appropriate information about stakeholders' expectations. Adopting the agency theory perspective, this study focuses on corporate governance in corporate foundations (CFs), a type of non-profit organisation with a private firm as its founder and main donor. We hypothesise that bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between CFs and their founder firms, which are the main donors and consequently the main stakeholders, can increase the involvement of the board of directors, thereby leading to higher organisational effectiveness. We argue that the implementation of bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm can strengthen corporate governance and provide the board of directors with the information needed to be more involved; such implementation fosters organisational effectiveness because it aligns the profit-oriented objectives of the founder firm and the social-oriented objectives of the CF. By analysing data from interviews of 188 CFs from six European countries, we aim to contribute to the debate on the role of corporate governance in non-profit organisations under the agency theory perspective. We provide evidence that the implementation of coordination and bureaucratic control mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm gives the board more information and leads to higher board involvement, thereby minimising agency issues and fostering organisational effectiveness.

Purpose: From the agency theory's point of view, this paper aims to analyze corporate governance mechanisms about the characteristics of the companies quoted in the segments Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais 2 and their influence on the creation of value in preparation for the opening of the initial public offering (IPO). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was adopted to achieve the proposed objective using the panel data with fixed effects and secondary data collected on the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios website, using statistical software Stata(r) 13.0 for statistical tests. The population comprises non-financial companies belonging to the Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais Level 2 groups, as the survey sample took into account the period of adhesion of the companies, totaled in 15 companies, which cover the period from 2008 to 2019. The selected variables correspond to the ownership structure's characteristics, then the board's composition and the fiscal council as the body responsible for supervising the administrators' acts. Findings: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. However, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Research limitations/implications: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. Despite this, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Practical implications: This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. This paper finds that internal governance characteristics (founder-chief executive officer, executive incentives and board independence) and external network characteristics (prestigious underwriters, degree of venture capitalist syndication and board interlocks) are significant predictors of foreign capital market choice by foreign IPO firms. Social implications: While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally crucial strategic decision. This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. Originality/value: This situation generates value to shareholders and is perceived by the market and, ultimately, generates a direct relationship with the market performance of companies. While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally major strategic decision.

The number of unicorns, startups valued over $1 billion, has steadily risen over the past decade. The abnormally high valua-tion of a unicorn from investors is based on their potential to disrupt a market and create a new paradigm. With this as the back-drop, this piece asks the question, what theoretical tools do we have to understand unicorns? Specifically, we explore agency theory. We argue that if principals and agents agree on the goal of disruption, then perhaps the agency problem that does occur in unicorns is beneficial, not a cost. Further, we argue that the principals of unicorns do want agents to take higher than normal risks with their investment to disrupt a given market. From this phenomenon, we introduce the concept of agreeable moral hazard and its use in the unicorn setting. Not only does the concept of agreeable moral hazard provide theoretical implications for future research, but it also highlights the need for more research to test existing theory on the unicorn population.

This systematic literature review of 54 articles investigates quantitative and qualitative studies published between 1974 and 2017 in terms of differences in investment criteria between venture capitalists (VCs) and business angels (BAs). Research has shown a persistent interest in examining VCs' and BAs' investment criteria; however, inconsistent findings demonstrate the need for a review of the aggregate extant knowledge. We clarify what is known about the controversial debate on VCs' and BAs' investment criteria and shed light on key issues that can lead to a better understanding of why VCs and BAs focus on certain investment criteria. To achieve these objectives, we develop a conceptual framework grounded on agency theory for investment criteria that VCs and BAs use for funding decisions. Our review reveals that VCs in the first instance focus on the business and financial traction, whereas BAs initially employ investment criteria related to the management team. These differences between VCs' and BAs' investment decision policies support the agency view. In addition, we propose a detailed path for future research and provide entrepreneurs with practical implications. (c) Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between cooperative practices of accountability, cooperative ownership, advanced communication and non-financial performance in savings and credit cooperative societies. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a cross-sectional research design and adopted a mixed methodological approach were hypotheses were statistically tested using structural equation modeling based on survey data (n = 220) and narratives from qualitative findings supported the quantitative findings from savings and credit cooperative societies. Findings: The findings reveal that cooperative practices of accountability, cooperative ownership and advanced communication are significantly and positively associated with non-financial performance of savings and credit cooperative societies. Originality/value: This study provides empirical evidence on the relationship between cooperative practices of accountability, cooperative ownership and advanced communication and non-financial performance in savings and credit cooperative societies in emerging economies like Uganda. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is limited or no study that has used the construct of agency theory in explaining the relationship between cooperative practices and non-financial performance in savings and credit cooperative societies.

How do public procurement practices influence effective public financial management (PFM) in Africa? Notwithstanding the several public procurement reforms to improve PFM in Africa, outcomes have not been sustainable. Prior studies have failed to explain this phenomenon. With a descriptive case study design based on comprehensive datasets, this paper explains this situation with three key factors underlying the public procurement environment in three African countries: Ethiopia, Central African Republic, and Ghana. From the agency theory lenses, these factors affect the agency cost in public administrative systems necessary for addressing the agency problems in public procurement management towards desired PFM outcomes.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of preferences when small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are confronted with the practical problems associated with implementing frequent and large-scale changes to their working policies and practices. This paper aims to alleviate some of the concerns as claimed in positioning and change agency theory by introducing "preferential role positioning" to organizational change. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative case study approach and change agency and positioning theories to find out the extent to which staff and management experienced the practical difficulties and challenges and what resolution actions they took. Eighty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2004/2005 and 2011 with the staff and management of four SMEs in the UK. An interpretative analysis was conducted on the case data in the tradition of Husserl and Schutz. In the first set, participants were asked to elucidate the difficulties faced in their roles and how these were experienced whilst the second focused on impacts and strategies. Three independent researchers reviewed and interpreted the qualitative data and helped with the coding and thematization. Findings: This paper's main results are based on the data's three stages showing how SME members chose to deal with the practical difficulties namely "new structures and procedures" (stage 1); "new ways of communicating" (stage 2) and "new collaborations" (stage 3). The combination of the stages' aspects led to the emergence of "preferential role positioning" as the study's theoretical contribution to the gap on preferences in organizational change research. Research limitations/implications: The eighty-five interviews from UK-based SMEs constrained the sample size thereby limiting the number of questionnaire categories asked. The findings and their analysis cannot be generalized to non-SMEs that seek to address similar difficulties. Practical implications: Managers need to be aware of the adverse impacts of using draconian, top-down disciplinary and punishment measures/structures as a way to implement change. Other practical lessons include the fact that managers should contextualize people's anxieties, dissatisfaction, resistance and disengagement as a platform from which social knowledge can be generated with all change agents in order to resolve implementation challenges in the longer term. Staff developed the ability to deal with some practical issues such as navigating through the new departmental structures, new working procedures and new ways of talking with management and with each other to implement change more successfully. Social implications: The social value of the findings demonstrates that preferences can be imported from other social science disciplines into Organizational Studies to show the value of what people can contribute and how they choose to do so (i.e. via what discourse, using what types of interactions and capabilities to do so). In addition, the results show that management need to consider employees in their plans as they try to implement change firstly to facilitate greater interaction and success, secondly to minimize implementation difficulties and thirdly as a recognition that there are multiple change agents and multiple role-enacting positions in developing sociological knowledge that can be of value. Originality/value: This study's three-stage approach has shown that a successful implementation and management of change in SMEs should also include a bottom-up recognition of the difficulties, adversities, conflicts and tensions and a resolution to deal with the structural and communicative constraints via dialogue and "preferential role positioning".

Considering that principal-principal conflicts in companies under mixed public-private ownership are substantially different from the typical agency conflict model, this paper's objective is to analyze principal-principal conflicts in mixed ownership companies in the Brazilian electric power industry. In order to expand understanding of the phenomenon which we are studying, we have integrated the assumptions that underlie agency theory and institutional theory, using a qualitative approach and collecting data during semi structured interviews with companies' board members. Data was analyzed and interpreted as per Bardin (2006), with the aid of ATLAS(r)ti software. Our main findings suggest that while a government stake in a firm's ownership structure can provide a useful channel for the government to seek support and resources, in counterpoint, it can also create distortions and uncertainties, and exacerbate principal-principal conflicts. The development of stronger institutions and corporate governance could bring about useful options for providing checks and balances and, in the final analysis, mitigate principal-principal conflict. The article contributes to the literature by providing additional elements that are not available in public reports. Analysis of the conflict between principal and principal, together with theoretical integration, seek to broaden the understanding of this theme. (c) 2020 FUCAPE Business School. All rights reserved.

This study examined the strategic planning process used in U.S. public company boardrooms, with a particular focus on companies that used board-level Strategic Planning Committees (SPCs) as opposed to those that engaged the full board in strategic planning oversight (which we call "strategic planning overall" or "SPO" firms). Based on interviews with 8 SPC members and 12 directors from SPO firms, we found a number of similarities in SPC and SPO processes, as well as a number of key differences. Overall, it is clear that there often can be a fundamental tension between management and directors with respect to the responsibility for strategic planning. There also can be significant information asymmetries arising from agency theoretic assumptions requiring board independence and arms-length interactions. Organizational scope may, within limits, constrain these assumptions. Such conditions increase both resource and information processing demands on the board, creating a need for greater formality in the board's strategic planning processes. These demands increase the need for paradoxical approaches that can accommodate greater flexibility in board-management interactions. The paradox lies in the board's ability to simultaneously meet and balance agency theoretic, resource dependence based and information processing demands. The contrasting organizational logics that are in play result in paradoxes that influence whether and in what form a board-level SPC should be constituted. The evidence suggests that constituting and structuring SPCs to embrace more collaborative interactions between the board and management could be helpful in dealing with the contrasting requirements and tensions that arise in certain firms. Embracing paradoxes and modifying governance approaches to include collaborative interactions with management may also help in ensuring that the board's strategic planning processes are equipped to deal with the challenges that confront the organization. Ultimately, individual company directors will need to determine whether and in what form a board-level SPC would add value to their governance structure and processes. Our interview-based evidence suggests that firm size and director experience are important considerations in the choice of how the board should oversee strategy. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Although acquisitions rarely deliver the anticipated value acquiring firms estimate, it remains a popular strategy for growth. We draw upon agency theory to investigate two types of stakes acquiring firms can obtain during an acquisition to ensure greater post-acquisition value - voting rights and cash flow rights. Using domestic acquisition data in Japan over 12 years to test our hypotheses, we find that greater voting rights directly improve value creation and positively moderate the effect of cash flow rights to improve acquiring firm value. This study sheds light on the strategic mechanisms crucial for post-acquisition integration value creation, and highlights acquisition strategies.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of behaviour-based and buffer-based management mechanisms on enterprise agility using the lens of the agency theory. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on data collected from 185 manufacturing enterprises using a survey instrument. The authors employ structural equation modelling for data analysis. Findings: The results of this study show that buffer-based mechanisms used for dealing with agency uncertainty of supplier/buyer not only have a positive impact on agility of enterprises, but are also contingent on the behavioural interventions used in the relationship with a supplier/buyer. Behaviour-based mechanisms also positively impact enterprise agility through mitigating the likelihood of supplier/buyer opportunism. Practical implications: This study demonstrates that buffer- and behaviour-based management mechanisms can be used as complementary approaches against agency uncertainties for enhancing enterprise agility. Therefore, for enterprises to boost their agility, it is vital that their resources and capabilities are fairly distributed across entities responsible for creating buffers through functional flexibility, as well as individuals and teams dealing with stakeholder engagement, in particular, suppliers and buyers. Originality/value: The authors use the lens of the agency theory to assimilate and model characteristic agency uncertainties and management mechanisms that enhance enterprise agility.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore why different directors feel different levels of accountability toward board tasks. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a reflexive three wave data and analysis process culminating in a rich data set of 49 interviews with Australian directors and 15 h of boardroom observations. Findings: Differences in role identification lead directors to perceive their accountability differently resulting in wide variation in levels of firm specific knowledge, eventually affecting their breadth of contribution to board tasks. Research limitations/implications: Researchers should question the application of traditional governance theory (such as agency theory) if it fails to account for individual differences in intrinsic self-interest. Practical implications: Selecting board members for their functional knowledge alone may not always produce optimal outcomes for the board and firm. Board induction processes and ongoing director training are important tools to inform and remind directors of their role and accountabilities on a board. Originality/value: This paper establishes that the strength of directors' identification with either the director role or expert role affects what they feel accountable for, the development of firm specific knowledge and long-term efficacy as a director.

Purpose: As widely known and well established, strategic decision-making at family firms is an interface between business interests and family considerations. The purpose of this paper is to understand the underlying basis of decision-making in setting corporate strategy and designing chief executive officer (CEO) compensation at founder- vis-a-vis descendant-led family firms in the Indian pharmaceutical sector. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 106 BSE-listed pharmaceutical companies have been studied over the period 2012-2017 resulting in a total of 636 firm-year observations. Impact of family involvement in business (FIB) on corporate strategy and CEO compensation has been analysed by constructing multivariate panel data regression models. To deal with the problem of endogeneity, Arellano-Bond (1991) dynamic panel data estimation procedure has moreover been conducted. Findings: Supporting stewardship theory, founder-owned and governed firms have been found to favour "growth" strategy and distribute "conservative" executive pay, thereby exerting a positive moderating impact on the strategy-compensation linkage. On the contrary, descendants/second-generation entrepreneurs have put forth a "conservative" stance for growth and innovation, and have rather been observed to favour a "liberal" compensation policy, thereby showcasing the application of behavioural agency theory. Originality/value: The research is a novel attempt to unravel the interaction between corporate strategy and CEO compensation in a family firm backdrop carried out in the context of an emerging economy. The study, moreover, adopted an all-encompassing definition of FIB (ownership, management and governance). (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Although principal-agent theory has gained a prominent place in research, its negative image of self-serving managers is frequently criticized. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine how existing theories of agency and stewardship can be combined by using behavioral characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: This study reviewed articles on the behavior of agents and stewards from the domains of finance, economics, management, corporate governance and organizational research. Additional theoretical and meta-analytical empirical literature from the fields of psychology and sociology was used to account for general patterns of human behavior. Findings: The results indicate that goal congruency and the perception of fairness can serve as moderators distinguishing agency theory and stewardship theory. Goal congruency can be achieved by stipulating psychological ownership. The perception of distributive and procedural fairness is demonstrated by two major corporate governance mechanisms: performance-based compensation and board monitoring. The results are summarized in six hypotheses that allow a situational, customized corporate governance. These hypotheses can be tested in future research. Originality/value: Prior work either focused on the merits of principal-agent theory or advocates the utilization of positive management theories, such as stewardship theory. However, little work has been done on bridging the gap between both constructs and develop a more extensive view of management theory. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Two divergent theories emerge from the literature on CEO duality. The agency theory advocates that a dual CEO negatively affects corporate performance, because it compromises the monitoring and control of the CEO, whilst the stewardship theory suggests the contrary effect due to the unity of command it presents. For a sample of 26 non-financial listed Portuguese firms from 2002 to 2016, this study draws on agency and stewardship theories to evaluate the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance, proxied by Tobin's Q. Using ordinary least square (OLS) and two stage least squares (2SLS) techniques to control potential problems simultaneity between CEO duality and firm performance, the author finds a negative relationship between CEO duality and Tobin's Q. This suggests that investors perceive no value in having a concentration of power with a dual leadership structure. Therefore, this study recommends that the positions of chairman and CEO should be separated for listed Portuguese firms. (c) 2020 by IGI Global.

This book examines tax transparency as part of multinational enterprises' corporate social responsibility (CSR). It considers revelations like the Panama and Paradise Papers that shed light on corporations' tax practices and the growing public dissatisfaction, resulting in legislative projects, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) base erosion and profit shifting. Tax transparency is defined as companies' voluntary disclosure of numerical tax data (e.g. taxes paid by country) and other tax-related information (e.g. tax policies). It is set apart from tax avoidance and tax evasion to clarify the often-blurred concepts. In this book, tax transparency is placed in a historical context and possible drivers and hindering factors to tax transparency are investigated. Tax transparency is discussed in the light of socio-economic theories (stakeholder, legitimacy, institutional theory and reputation risk management), as well as economic theories (agency theory, signalling, proprietary costs) and information overload theory. The book provides examples of tax transparency development of the largest multinational enterprises in five countries (France, Germany, UK, Finland and USA) in six years, 2012-2017, a period featuring increased media coverage of tax matters and legislative movement in the OECD and the European Union. The future of tax transparency is discussed in light of quality characteristics, assurance of information and potential use of artificial intelligence. Companies' managers and tax and CSR specialists benefit from the book by gaining insight into how to design transparent, high-quality tax reporting. Assurance professionals can use information about the quality criteria of tax transparency. Regulators can track historical development and see examples of voluntary tax transparency in companies' reporting. Scholars and students obtain theoretical framework for analysing the tax transparency phenomenon and the ability to distinguish between the concepts of tax transparency, planning, avoidance and evasion.

Motivated by the agency theory and the need to examine the effect of separation of ownership and management, this study examines the determinants of profitability in different firm ownership structures and how different ownership structures impact the profitability of listed firms between 2003 and 2013, using pooled annual data of 23 Ghanaian listed firms. Employing a number of static models (OLS, Random Effects and 3 Stage Least Squares), we find evidence that while profit determinants vary for listed firms given their ownership structures, ownership structures also affected profitability differently. Specifically, for listed firms, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, financial risk, age and GDP; for non-family owned listed firms, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, market share and age; for foreign-owned firms, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, age and GDP; and for non-foreign ownership, profitability was determined by capital intensity, liquidity, financial risk, growth, age and GDP. When we examine the impact of ownership structure on profitability and find that family-owned listed firms make 30% less profits compared to non-family owned ones, whilst foreign-owned firms make 13% more profits than non-foreign owned ones. These findings confirm the agency theory which posits that separation of ownership and management, though may lead to agency problems, can positively affect profits. The study recommends that family-owned listed firms should consider diluting ownership in order to grow more profits. (c) 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

Part-time and temporary employees and contractors become a major cybersecurity threat for organizations due to the ephemeral nature of their engagement. Compared with full-time employees, they may be less commited to the welfare of the organization and, therefore, less willing to engage in security recommendations to protect it. Perceived psychological ownership is an important factor that shapes employees' security behaviors. The endowment effect also explains employees' tendencies to overvalue information that belongs to them, and conversely, extend fewer protections to information that they view as belonging to others. Thus, employees may be more motivated to safeguard their own information than organizational information. From a principle-agent perspective, this study investigates how three types of employees perceive organizational and personal information, and how different employees make decisions about protecting their own versus organizational information.

Thus this study explores CEO duality by using quantile regression, which estimates the CEO duality at different performance level of the firm, as classical OLS method explores relation at conditional mean of the two variable .The study uses both the accounting measure (EPS,ROCE& ROE) and market measure (P/BV and PE) to provide robust measure for relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. The results are mixed both positive and negative and only some models are significant, supporting the agency theory and negating the organisation theory. Finally, this paper contributes to the literature of corporate governance-CEO duality and firm performance substantially through the quantile regression method and comprehensive measure of firm performance in the Indian context.

Public Private Partnership (PPP) project in the public sector of South Africa have come under major scrutiny in the last decade due to overspending and the failure of PPP projects being completed timely. The ruling party government have been under major scrutiny by the media, specifically the Treasury to be held accountable for the mismanagement of public funds. Opposition Parties on behalf of the citizens are demanding that public sector management are held accountable and that the right management be put in charge of managing PPP projects risks. In order to get better understanding of PPP project risks we will investigate the PPP contract for an information and Communication Technology (ICT) service delivery project between the Department of Labour and Siemens. In this regard the study looked at the contract to unearth its strengths and weaknesses as a mechanism for identifying and managing risks. Using an agency theory risk framework and qualitative content analysis, the researcher interrogated the PPP contract from a risk perspective. Content analysis, was used to interrogate the PPP contract documents, to build on a comprehensive risk framework. The agency theory framework suggested that risk factors for ICT service delivery are widely acknowledged in literature however; these were not specified in the PPP contract for ICT service delivery. The analysis identified risks inherent in PPP contracting that should be addressed to manage ICT service delivery. The risk framework provided risk strategies, which could provide important insights for managing risks in PPP contracting relationships for ICT services.

Growing evidence suggests that gender diversity on boards of directors is important for corporate governance and overall organizational effectiveness. Yet, progress in increasing female board representation has been slow. Prior studies have focused primarily on either the role of organizational characteristics in board gender composition or the role of national institutions as predictors of female board representation across countries. In this study, we integrate psychological theory related to implicit biases and agency theory, with institutional theory, to propose that the national context for gender equality moderates the extent to which characteristics of organizational leadership relate to female board representation. We conduct a meta-analysis of 158 samples encompassing 60,648 organizations across 36 countries to test our hypotheses. Our findings highlight the importance of the national context for gender equality as a boundary condition for understanding the relationship between organizational leadership characteristics and female board representation. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for increasing the representation of female directors across countries. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Research shows that electronic monitoring technologies can reduce illicit agent (e.g., frontline worker) behavior along monitored dimensions such that principals (e.g., firms) benefit. Drawing on theory from criminology regarding the concept of offense displacement, we explain why the benefits from increased monitoring may be mitigated if agents subsequently increase other types of illicit acts not subject to greater monitoring. We investigate this possibility by examining how a mandate requiring millions of truck drivers to adopt electronic logging devices to record their working hours affected different safety behaviors and outcomes. Using data from millions of driver inspections and crash counts before and after the mandate and a differences-in-differences identification strategy, we find greater monitoring due to the mandate achieved its first-order effect of reducing the frequency that drivers were in non-compliance with work hour rules (the monitored dimension). However, drivers for small firms that were most affected by the mandate also appear to have increased their frequency of unsafe driving (e.g., speeding). We also find that crash counts for small firms did not fall relative to large firms, and may have increased. These results call into question whether increased electronic monitoring has improved safety in this industry. (c) 2020 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.

Social entrepreneurs are often at the forefront of remedying complex societal issues by linking the entrepreneurial mindset with approaches to solving these systemic societal issues. We build upon existing notions regarding the field of social entrepreneurship and existing forms of social entrepreneurship while deepening the understanding of the different roles that social entrepreneurs must embody on a daily basis. Agency theory is used by identifying principal and agent factors underlying social entrepreneurship in terms of role stressors and role conflict. We outline varying types of social entrepreneurs and discuss role duality, an area with room for much exploration. We also identify and discuss problems for principals and agents within these types of social entrepreneurship. Thus we contribute to the literature (1) by extending on the types of social entrepreneurs, (2) by identifying the threats that social entrepreneurs face through an agency lens; namely the dual role that social entrepreneurs must embark upon, and (3) by describing the boundary conditions of the different social entrepreneur types, we link the potential challenges of social entrepreneurship with a deeper look into the growing domain that is social entrepreneurship.

Infusing stakeholder agency theory with insights from behavioural agency theory, we describe a frame-dependent relationship between CEO stock option incentives and tax avoidance. Our theoretical framework highlights the role of competing shareholder demands in providing a salient reference point for a CEO contemplating the implications of tax avoidance for their stock option wealth. In a study of 2,573 publicly listed U.S. firms between 1993 and 2014, we show that the implications of CEO stock option incentives are contingent on whether the firm's effective tax rate is anticipated to be below or above the tax rate of peer firms - an outcome that the CEO can cast as balancing stakeholder demands. Consistent with our theoretical reasoning, we also show that, both above and below this reference point, the implications of option incentives for corporate tax avoidance are amplified by the level of activist institutional ownership and attenuated by the CEO's ability to unwind their bond with shareholders through hedging. In doing so, our study offers an impetus for a broader stakeholder approach to governance research examining CEO incentive alignment.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the moderating role of family involvement on the corporate social responsibility (CSR)-firm performance (FP) relationship in the US hospitality industry. Building on agency theory, this study examines how family ownership, management and board control influence the relationship between CSR and FP. Design/methodology/approach: To examine the moderating effect of family ownership, family management and family board control, this study adopts the two-way fixed-effects model and performs a panel regression analysis with robust standard errors. The sample period spans 1994-2018 and 565 firm-year observations are included. Findings: This study finds that the impact of CSR on FP is positively moderated by the extent of a firm's family member involvement. In specific, all three aspects of corporate governance (i.e. ownership, management and board control) positively moderate the relationship between CSR and FP. Research limitations/implications: Findings of this study yield several recommendations for hospitality managers, including shaping strategic decisions for implementing CSR, by providing a unique perspective that the involvement of founding family members can be helpful in enhancing firm value through CSR activities. Originality/value: This study sheds light on the further understanding of the CSR-FP link in the hospitality literature. In addition, this study provides practical guidelines for hospitality firms in the context of CSR by revealing possible advantages of strengthened founding family involvement.

Multi-family firms represent an important and complex type of family firm that is not as well understood as single-family firms. We develop a governance-based framework of the agency complexities in multi-family firms, theorizing that divergent family-centered noneconomic goals between the owning families create complex inter-family agency problems that are intensified by evolving family dynamics. We propose governance mechanisms that address these problems by limiting opportunistic behavior associated with the pursuit of noneconomic goals related to firm control, family altruism, social capital, and transgenerational succession. We then present a future research agenda that can expand our knowledge of multi-family firms. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

When should business-to-business firms encourage their salespeople to advocate for the customer in pricing negotiations? This research extends dual agency theory to the sales domain to address this question. In Study 1, the authors examine discount negotiations with secondary data from a major U.S. distributor. They find that the customer and seller both experience the most favorable outcomes when the salesperson advocates strongly for both parties; advocacy for either party alone is counterproductive. Study 2 confirms these results using matched survey, pricing, and profit data and demonstrates a key boundary condition: broad customer-seller ties enable the synergy between customer advocacy and seller advocacy by enhancing the firms' abilities to monitor the salesperson. In Study 3, experiments with business-to-business buyers replicate key findings and provide evidence for theorized mechanisms. This research emphasizes the interdependence between the salesperson's dual roles and demonstrates how the salesperson can serve as an effective agent of both the customer and seller, thereby mitigating challenges associated with role conflict.

Evidence in the literature suggests that employees can engage in other types of creative behavior at work beyond producing something new and useful for their organization. This paper seeks to advance our understanding of these "atypical" creative behaviors. We conceptualize a typology that encompasses both the commonly studied form of employee creativity (conventional steward-type) and three other types of employee creativity that have not been previously theorized (critical steward-type, cunning agent-type, and innocent agent-type). We then advance a conceptual model to identify situations that may lead employees to use their creative potential one way versus another. Further, we examine the different implications of these creative behaviors for the organization, employee, and society. Our conceptual framework provides a broader perspective of workplace creativity in which a wider range of behaviors, mechanisms, and outcomes must be considered. It provides new directions for future research as well as implications for managing creativity in different organizational and cultural contexts. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Central to economic development is entrepreneurship. Using an agency theory lens, we seek to better understand how national policy can spur entrepreneurship. Guided by capitalist and socialist logic and ideals we investigate the direct and joint effects of market freedom and social spending national policies. In drawing from a sample of 19 countries spanning 2004-2010, we find that neither market freedom nor social spending alone positively impacts entrepreneurial activity; however, an interaction exists, as entrepreneurial activity is bolstered when enhancing market freedom and social spending complement one another. Findings suggest mixed national policies that combine market freedom and social spending are best positioned to spur entrepreneurship. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Nonprofit leaders face the challenge of making decisions within a complex environment of heterogeneous and often competing stakeholder claims. In such a setting, leaders not only make judgments about the power of their organization's stakeholders but they also make conscious choices about which stakeholders they personally represent while making organizational decisions. This study uses insights from stakeholder theory and agency theory to investigate (1) how nonprofit leaders' perceptions of stakeholder power and stakeholder representation are interrelated across a wide range of stakeholder groups and organizations, and (2) how perceptions of power and representation differ between board members and executive managers. Drawing on data from 491 nonprofit leaders, we find evidence of stakeholder representation surpluses and deficits for several stakeholders, although perceptions of these deficits and surpluses differ considerably between board members and managers. Our study holds important implications for nonprofit governance, the practice of stakeholder analysis, and the use of stakeholder constructs in future empirical research. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Corruption has emerged as a well-debated subject against the backdrop of electronic government (e-government). While e-government has attained a level of sophistication in leading countries, there are countries for which going digital remains comparatively new on their national schedules. Their struggle and lag in reaching maturity in e-government can be attributed to corruption, which is an infamous issue prevalent across the globe and argued to impede technological innovation. Despite such a possibility, there is a paucity of research examining the "corruption-e-government" linkage. This study, hence, adopts the institutional perspective for conceptualizing corruption and seeks to understand the relationship of corruption in basic national institutions and national stakeholder service systems with e-government maturity. Specifically, by grounding the discussion on the agency theory, the rent-seeking theory, and the perspective of institutions as structures of cooperation and power, this study analyses the moderating influence of corruption in a national stakeholder service system (i.e., business systems) on the relationship of corruption in three basic national institutions (i.e., political, legal, and media) with e-government maturity in a country. The hypothesized relationships are empirically validated using a panel data of 94 countries, and the findings confirm that political corruption, legal corruption, and business-systems corruption in a country play vital roles in influencing its e-government maturity. Implications of our results to research and practice are discussed. (c) 2021

Research Summary: Venture capital firms (VCs) must simultaneously manage a range of relationships with investors, investees, prospective buyers, and co-investors who frequently exert divergent influences on when investments should be exited. The greater weight of one particular relationship can lead a VC to exit an investment earlier than would maximize returns for that investment. In this study, we utilize a global sample to examine how VC firms' investment duration decisions are shaped by firm-specific and environmental factors. Our findings suggest that VCs are less patient and exit faster when they have less experience, invest in more institutionally challenged host countries, or are foreign and invested in an emerging economy. Importantly, while co-investing with other VCs increases patience in advanced economies, this effect disappears in emerging economies. Managerial Summary: Agency theory explains why firms commonly capitalize on information advantages created by conditions of uncertainty to prioritize their own private interests over those shared with partners. This article introduces a framework, based on multiple agency theory, to examine the factors shaping the duration of venture capital firms' investments. Our findings, based on a sample of deals across 33 countries, suggest greater patience when host country market institutions are more advanced and venture capitalists themselves have more experience. In emerging economies only, we find that patience is increased by being local or from a foreign country with similarly challenging institutions. Importantly, while co-investing with other venture capitalists increases patience in advanced economies, this effect disappears in emerging economies. (c) 2021 Strategic Management Society.

While CEO compensation is seen as influencing firm performance, the intervening mechanisms that govern this influence have remained largely unexplored. Using the agency and expectancy theories, this paper attempts to open the "black box" between CEO compensation and firm performance and empirically tests the intervening effect of CEO risk-taking behavior on this relationship. Specifically, we hypothesize that CEO compensation indirectly influences firm performance through its direct effects on CEO risk-taking behavior. Results based on data collected from 204 U.S. manufacturing firms revealed a strong, positive relationship between CEO option pay and a firm's strategic risk, stock returns risk, and income stream risk. Results also showed that firm strategic risk, measured by R&D expenditure, mediates the CEO option pay-firm performance relationship, sometimes fully and sometimes partially, depending on which type of performance is being examined.

Sustainable supply chain management practices can be particularly difficult to implement when the responsibility for sustainable procurement (SP) rests with buyers employed by a contractor, rather than an in-house procurement team. Yet there is no extant research that investigates the effect of outsourcing on SP. To address this research gap, this paper uses multi-case study data to explore the impact of outsourcing versus in-house implementation modes in the pursuit of SP. The findings suggest that each implementation mode has distinctive challenges and facilitators. However, by considering Transaction Cost Economics, results reveal that the advantage of outsourcing to professionals, with well-established SP expertise, brings information asymmetries in developing initial outsourcing contracts, which can lead to poorer sustainability performance than initially expected. Furthermore, when applying Principal Agency Theory, results suggest that sustainable performance can be improved in the long term through the effective design of well-constructed contractual relationships as SP maturity increases.

Purpose: Bundled mode of public-private partnership (PPP) procurement has been a widely advocated governance structure of infrastructure delivery. The purpose of this paper is to identify the various aspects of how this bundling phenomenon has to be played out in practice and examines the implications of such decisions. Design/methodology/approach: A longitudinal case study with an Indian municipal solid waste (MSW) PPP project provides the necessary evidence on the identification of constructs which are deemed important in the decision making of bundling in PPP MSW projects. Transaction cost economics theory, agency theory and auction theory informed the development of theoretical constructs. The longitudinal case study used interviews, observations and documents analysis. Findings: This study has highlighted the complexity inherent in bundling decision, arising out of the relatively scanty rationale by which stakeholders first developed. Not only they are very different from the practice, but also many assumptions are proved otherwise. Poor sectoral developments, hindrances arguably caused to innovation, increase in transaction cost and a decrease in the competition along with ex post characteristics such as unfavourable transaction attributes made bundling a too early proposition to Guwahati MSW project. This study suggests that strong liability of the bundling phenomenon was the above the rationale of typical PPP bundling benefits envisaged in the extant literature. It also shows that poor practice and decision making by immature clients would lead to project failure. Research limitations/implications: A cognitive map emerged from the study on the failure of Guwahati project. An empirical generalisation can be attempted using multiple contrasting case studies to make the theory more acceptable. Practical implications: The case illustrated why naive clients should not try PPPs in a bundled model. Accordingly, the developed framework would help the governments to create the right projects catalysing the bundling benefits and harness the full potential of private sector participation in future PPP projects. Originality/value: The current study would be novel in advancing the theory of bundling in PPP projects. This would be of interest to academia and to industrial practice and policy.

Rationale/Purpose: Certification is an institutional mechanism that may, indirectly, have utility for managing the challenges that are likely to be present when the state and voluntary sport clubs (VSCs) connect for sport development. Design/Methodology/Approach: A hermeneutic-dialectic approach guides the adoption of agency theory to conceptualize the state as principal and VSCs as its agents, and to consider agency problems of information asymmetry and divergent interests. Findings: The potential for VSC certification to counter agency problems through harmonization of interests, VSC signaling and reporting of quality and professionalization, state screening and monitoring, and confidence-building through quality assurances, are discussed. Practical Implications: The challenges of certification further inform implications for its indirect application for effectively managing the VSC-state relationship. Research Contribution: The paper advances the limited consideration of both VSC certification and agency theory in the sport literature, combining them for new insights into the potential role of certification for government and community sport relations.

This study scrutinises the mechanism between uncertainty factors and supply chain quality risk (SCQR), and to examine the moderating role of supply market thinness (SMT). Drawing on agency theory and resource dependency theory, a conceptual model for the SCQR is proposed. Based on the survey data obtained from 202 managers, we use the structural equation modelling method to test our conceptual model, and the multiple group method to conduct the moderating analysis. We find that the uncertainty factors are associated with managers' perceptions of the probability and magnitude of SCQR. Moderation analysis show that the impacts of technology uncertainty and traceability uncertainty on probability of SCQR, and the impacts of technology uncertainty, testability uncertainty and product complexity on magnitude of SCQR, are moderated by SMT. The validated model provides practitioners with the direction to scrutinise the nature of SCQR, in order to establish effective practical approaches to manage it. (c) 2020

Technology licensing is an important form of exchange in business-to-business markets. Licensees consider licensing technologies as a key mechanism to expand their technological asset base and to innovate. Even though exchange is the central focus of marketing academia, technology licensing contracts as a form of exchange have been largely overlooked. We take some steps to fill this void by studying the role of governance in licensing contracts. We rely on governance and specifically agency theory to study two-sided moral hazard problems in technology licensing. The two-sided nature of the problem is reflected in the presence of both upstream monitoring (i.e., the licensee monitoring the licensor) and downstream monitoring (i.e., the licensee being monitored by the licensor). We demonstrate that the effects of monitoring on licensee value creation are conditional on the licensee's experience in licensing. Specifically, we observe that, conditional on the licensee having accumulated a high level of licensing experience, upstream process monitoring and downstream output monitoring increase licensee market value while downstream process monitoring reduces licensee market value. Interestingly, we find no support for similar moderating effects of partner-specific experience. We rely on a unique database of original licensing contracts, historical data on past licensing contracts, and stock price data to analyze the value created by individual licensing contracts. The combined results may help licensees draft more valuable contracts. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This article uses Michel Foucault's conceptualization of power to rethink how power operates within leadership relations. Foucault (1980:220) defines power as a "a structure of actions, bearing on the actions of those who are free." This idea is explored, noting how it differs from much leadership theorizing which defines power in terms of a leader's position or personal characteristics. Foucault's assertions that "power is everywhere" (1988, 12), that it is relationally based and is best perceived through its effects are examined. We identify implications for researching power from this perspective, including the appropriateness of methods capable of mapping social, historical, and institutional dynamics. We offer four analytic strategies: beginning from power's outcomes, investigating points of resistance, proactively identifying hidden dynamics and attending to networked alliances. Insights generated from this approach highlight the contingent, ephemeral nature of power and help explain the indeterminacy leaders often experience when wielding it in practice.

Rule changes are not uncommon in most professional sports, and scholars often study the effects of such changes. Given the substantial increase in rule changes and the substantially different nature of new rules (e.g., safety driven) in the National Football League since 2005, the authors examined how coaches adapt to the changing National Football League in terms of coaching strategies and securing subsequent head coach positions in the labor market. Using agency theory, the authors identified agency misalignment when coaches employ strategies whereby incurring more penalties results in on-field success, but decreases their likelihood of obtaining future employment as a head coach. In addition, the authors found evidence that, regardless of the penalties accrued, former coaches who previously held more head coaching jobs, are Black, or are younger have higher chances of securing subsequent head coaching positions. However, these attributes do not increase team performance, indicating that coach-hiring decisions are incongruent with determinants of coach performance. (c) 2021 Human Kinetics, Inc.

This study examines the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on corporate social performance. The amount a given country spends on corporate social responsibility activities varies due to various motives. Therefore, the objectives of the study involve examining the impact of board characteristics and ownership structure on corporate social responsibility. Based on a panel data regression, this study finds that board size is positively related to corporate social performance (social performance and environmental performance) in the Chinese context. In the case of India and South Africa, board size exhibits a negative relationship, which is inversely related to China. CEO duality is positively related to firms' corporate social performance in India and China. However, in the context of South Africa, it exhibits a negative relationship. Gender diversity has positive impact in India and South Africa, wherein in case of China it is inversely related. It is observed that women on the board and women directors significantly influence corporate social responsibility spending. Moreover, among the ownership structure, family ownership is positively related to corporate social responsibility in the India and South Africa. The institutional investors have a negative impact in South Africa and a positive impact in India and China. This study supports the stewardship theory and agency theory and finds that firms should spend on corporate social responsibility activities to protect the interests of the stakeholders and the role of firms' responsibilities towards different sectors of society. Finally, this study provides insights into the state-of-the-art literature and offers practical implications for top-level management and shareholders. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

We present evidence that the negative impact of CEO short-termism on firm value can be attributed to a sub-optimal exercise of real options. Accordingly, the value relevance of firms' real options portfolios is maximized in the absence of CEO temporal myopia. Moreover, the impact of real options on firms' stock returns' idiosyncratic characteristics is more pronounced when CEOs' decision horizons are longer, in line with the view that enhanced operating flexibility from longer decision horizons can amplify the convexity of real options' payoffs. These findings have important implications regarding the impact of CEO career horizons on corporate strategies and board decisions related to CEO incentives and succession.

Purpose: This study aims to propose a tool for conceptualizing and operationalizing perceptual distance in client-contractor collaborations: the perceptual distance monitor (PDM). This paper explains how this monitor was developed and used to examine the impact of perceptual distance on project outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: This paper developed the PDM by gathering quantitative survey data from client and contractor representatives. Structural equation modeling tested the predictive validity of perceptual distance on project outcomes. Findings: The PDM enables a valid and reliable assessment of the perceptual distance between client and contractor in projects. Moreover, the PDM shows that project outcomes suffer if parties have different perceptions of project objectives, project managers' competences and the level of trust in the collaboration. These findings confirm the predictive validity of the PDM. Research limitations/implications: The study builds on survey data representing dyadic perceptions from 38 measurements in collaborative projects. This paper may not have identified all the effects of perceptual distance on project outcomes, as the analyses were conducted at the project level. This research underlines the importance of gathering dyadic data for studies in interorganizational settings. Practical implications: Perceptual distance can be expected between clients and contractors, and higher perceptual distance is generally associated with lower project outcomes. Using the PDM, project managers can concretize, discuss and monitor this perceptual distance over time. The PDM provides project managers with a useful tool to prevent the escalation of conflicts and project failure. Originality/value: Based on agency theory and social identity theory, this study provides a unique and validated conceptualization and operationalization of perceptual distance between client and contractor in interorganizational collaborations and supply chains.

Given that nonprofits embrace diverse perspectives when adopting performance measurement, one key area of scholarly attention is understanding what leads nonprofits to embrace different performance measures. In this article, the author combines agency theory, resource dependence theory, and neo-institutional theory to explore how performance measures of nonprofits are associated with prominent organizational contingencies. Based on survey data from California nonprofits (n = 143), the regression results demonstrate that the adoption of performance measurement is not only influenced by external institutional pressures but also is associated with task characteristics and environmental uncertainty of nonprofits. This study helps nonprofits' stakeholders to better understand why nonprofits choose to adopt certain measurement dimensions. (c) 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Despite the importance of good collaborative relationships in interorganisational projects, clients and contractors often develop adversarial relationships due to perceptual distance about key project issues. In this case study research, we investigated how perceptual distance emerges and changes over time, and how the collaborative relationship between client and contractor develops alongside these dynamics. In this exploration, we built upon agency theory and stewardship theory as complementary perspectives for understanding client-contractor collaborative relationships. We gathered quantitative and qualitative data in two projects, conducting three assessments in about one year. We found that perceptual distance increased and decreased over time, and that a reduction was typically associated with the collaborative relationship being characterized by stewardship rather than agency. These findings suggest that a regular assessment and evaluation of partners' perceptions of critical project issues is warranted to timely detect and counteract perceptual distance. Moreover, partners would best adopt a stewardship orientation to reduce perceptual distance, although this may take considerable effort given the distributive nature of many pre-project negotiations.

Research Question/Issue: On the basis of a dynamic interrelation between the assumptions of agency theory and stewardship theory, this study seeks to make sense of disobedience at the highest corporate level. Departing from a processual view in order to better understand how loyalty plays a critical role in the relationships between a CEO and his/her principal, we propose a conceptualization of the options open to a top executive in disagreement with the principal. We view the relationship from "below" by primarily taking the CEO's perspective, resulting in a more complex view on how "duty" is perceived and acted upon by the CEO. Research Findings/Insights: We use the rich and abundant archives left behind by the CEO of a large French firm. We had access to over 50,000 pages of documents that allowed us to follow the CEO and his relationships with his principals, at times from day to day. We found two competing loyalties (loyalty to the principal--agency theory--and loyalty to the organization--stewardship theory) that gradually become independent of each other, triggering different responses in terms of "exits" from the relationship with the principal. This particular dynamic in which the CEO acted as a guardian of the overall purpose of the organization enabled the emergence, development, and consolidation of a disobedience process that over the years contributed to the well-being of his firm as well as to the social changes occurring in France at that time. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This longitudinal study extends the corporate governance literature by offering a process-oriented approach, quite rare in this stream of research, and a more dynamic view of how agency theory and stewardship theory interact. Then, by providing empirical support for the idea that the disobedience process can protect and allow an organization to first evolve positively over time and eventually contribute to social improvements, our study proposes a form of responsible stewardship. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers important insights for executives, directors, and shareholders on how to make sense of, and in the long run potentially benefit from, disobedience at the highest corporate levels.

Prior studies examining the impact of organizational controls on subsidiaries' strategic initiatives have to a large extent failed to find a significant direct association between the two. We argue that this lack of direct association may be due to the fact that the control mechanisms used exert their influence on subsidiaries' strategic initiatives indirectly by suppressing subsidiaries' decision-making autonomy. Drawing upon agency theory we consider the effects of two types of controls, monitoring and incentive alignment, as mediated by subsidiaries' decision-making autonomy. We test this effect on data from 115 subsidiaries of foreign multinationals operating in Greece. The results of our analyses empirically validate this assertion for both mechanisms. Our findings further show that, when both mechanisms are present, one may accentuate the effect of the other, highlighting the value of employing a contingency approach to fully capture the effects of organizational controls on the pursuit of subsidiaries' strategic initiatives.

Twenty-seven years have elapsed since Bergen et al. (1992) published their work on agency theory in marketing. Agency theory is still relevant in marketing today. However, since 1992, there has been no comprehensive update of the literature on agency theory in marketing-related contexts despite the various developments in marketing, such as the advent of the internet, that have occurred in the interim. This paper covers the application of agency theory to marketing-related topics between 1992 and 2018. It seeks to update the overall knowledge of this application, suggesting new areas of research and managerial implications. (c) 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Purpose: Classical assumptions of agency theory (AT) fall short of providing satisfactory answers to modern management and organizational knowledge (MOK) problems, and there is a need for extending the scope of the field. This article aims to compare modern AT assumptions with the agency perspective of Islamic historical political treatises (namely, siyasetnamas) and point out how AT can be furthered. Design/methodology/approach: This article applies content analysis method to find out agency perspectives in Islamic political treatises and then compare them with those of the basic AT assumptions to find out similarities and differences between them in explaining agency problems. Findings: The agency perspective in siyasetnamas are based on the following assumptions which could contribute to the development of AT with their emphasis on (1) responsibilities beyond contracts, (2) entrustment rather than ownership, (3) shared societal responsibility rather than conflicting individual interests, (4) importance of self-control for both principals and agents and (5) trust discourse which emphasizes inner virtues rather than control discourse. Originality/value: Agency perspectives cannot be considered independent of cultural imprints. By introducing siyasetnamas' agency perspective, this article makes an effort to suggest implications for how to further modern MOK based overwhelmingly on individualistic cultural assumptions to rediscuss agency problems from the viewpoint of specifically the emerging markets in which collectivist culture plays an important role in social and economic life. In this respect, siyasetnamas' agency perspective based on the notion of entrustment seems, arguably, to be a better fit to the contextual realities and managerial practices of emerging markets.

Although it is assumed that CEOs attempt to use corporate reputation ratings to justify increases in their annual compensation, controversy persists on the relationship between corporate reputation ratings and CEO compensation. Based on agency theory and signaling theory, we predict a positive relationship between corporate reputation ratings and CEO compensation but only during periods of economic recovery. Using a subset of Fortune's "Most Admired" companies, this study demonstrates that corporate reputation ratings are significantly associated with CEO compensation during periods of economic recovery but not during periods of economic recession, after controlling the potential extraneous factors that may influence CEO pay.

Prior empirical research investigating the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) tenure and firms' financial performance has shown inconclusive results. Based on arguments of agency and behavioral agency theories, we suggest that this relationship is nuanced and may vary depending on CEO pay and board monitoring. In response to these arguments, we meta-analytically test 385 studies (n = 1,029,602). We find that CEO tenure is positively related to firms' financial performance. This positive relationship is enhanced when CEOs receive higher cash compensation or hold more stock ownership. On the other hand, the above positive relationship becomes weaker when CEOs receive higher long-term incentives or when the firm has more independent board directors. These findings suggest that CEO pay and board monitoring, or agency mechanisms in general, can offer new research avenues to help explore boundary conditions of the CEO tenure and firms' financial performance relationship.

Using an agency theory framework, we investigate the relationship between CEO option pay and CEO risk-taking behavior. We integrate the incentive alignment and monitoring approaches to reducing principal-agent conflicts by considering them simultaneously. We develop and test hypotheses that suggest that aspects of the governance system of a firm moderate the relationship between CEO option pay and CEO risk-taking. Results based on data collected from 204 Fortune 1000 U.S. manufacturing firms revealed a strong, positive relationship between CEO option pay and CEO risk-taking. Further, moderating effects were found for CEO duality, blockholder ownership, institutional ownership, and insider ownership. However, empirical analyses fail to provide adequate evidence to support the expected moderating effect of board independence. (c) 2021

The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship between government and public sector universities in the perspective of agency theory and propose a theoretical framework that will highlight the various aspects of the principle and agents. In this perspective government plays a main role as principal while public sector universities are as agent and this relationship is known as agency theory. This relationship normally has two major issues such as goal conflicts and information asymmetries. Correspondingly, in this review paper, systematic approach and content analysis approach have been adopted. The reviewed literature revealed that the government provides performance based grants to the public sector universities so government have pursued some expectations from public sector universities like accountability and transparency of the funds. Similarly, it has been highlighted that to verify the relationship between government and public sector universities in the context of agency theory because there is a sheer need to conduct empirical research studies.

This paper examines the current state of service quality research through various organizational theoretical perspectives and identifies potential research directions that can be explored to provide novel insights into the field. A systematic literature review approach is used to examine service quality literature from the perspective of agency theory, contingency theory, motivational theories, prospect theory, resource-based view, signaling theory, social network theory and transaction cost economics. This paper is the first attempt to review service quality literature from an organizational theory lens and can serve as a template study for future theory-building research to advance topics in other areas.

This study aims to examine the role of supervisory board on internationalisation of Indonesia's listed companies. Based on the agency theory, supervisory board may improve the international company performance through company oversight. Specifically, this study investigates the effect of supervisory board composition, size, and expertise on international performance. The sample of this study is 61 manufacturing listed companies from 2012-2016 periods. The result shows that supervisory board composition has a positive and significant relationship with the company internationalisation. While, supervisory board size and expertise have no effect on company internationalisation. In addition, the company age and leverage also contribute to the internationalisation of companies.

Theoretical literature provides different predictions on the relationship between multiple directorships and managerial ability (relationship). Therefore, we empirically investigate the relationship. We find that the relationship is generally negative and statistically significant but not economically significant, i.e., the relationship is very small. In this regard, we show that the relationship is negative (positive) and also statistically and economically significant for firms with high levels of monitoring (advising) needs. Furthermore, we show that the regulatory oversight (1) mitigates the general negative relationship; (2) changes the direction of relationship from negative to positive, for firms with high levels of monitoring needs; and (3) does not influence the relationship, for firms with high levels of advising needs. Collectively, the results suggest that the monitoring-advising needs and regulatory oversight are important factors in the analysis of the relationship. (c) 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

There is a growing concern towards full integrity of Halal food and its traceability as supply chains become global. This research identifies the current traceability challenges for the food supply chain in Malaysia to comply with Halal requirements. We position these challenges in the context of institutional theory and agency theory. Our manuscript directly addresses Duan et al.'s (2020) call for studies grounded in actual real-life data to address Blockchain implementation in Halal food chains. As such, we propose a novel traceability framework built on Blockchain derived from real-life Blockchain implementation in three distinct Halal supply chains. The technology with smart contract is proposed with inputs from three Blockchain software providers with the aim to create a conceptual framework that integrates both Halal processes and technologies to improve traceability of Halal food supply chain from farm to fork.

Interorganizational fraud, or fraud that occurs between organizations, is a critical component of supply chain fraud and supply chain relational risk, yet empirical evidence on the scale of interorganizational fraud and its antecedents remains scant. Despite its hidden nature, interorganizational fraud can have major implications for supply chain performance. Based on the theories of transaction cost economics, agency theory, and the fraud triangle, widely used in accounting and auditing research, five potential antecedents of supply chain fraud are considered and compared with reported losses due to interorganizational fraud. The data collected via a survey questionnaire with a sample of 151 supply chain employees in manufacturing demonstrate that informants estimated median losses due to interorganizational fraud to be 9% of their firm's total revenue. The most common types of fraud reported include product quality fraud, pricing/invoicing fraud, and corruption. Using a two-step generalized method of moments technique for estimation, the results found that transactional complexity, competitive pressures facing the supply chain, and weak firm ties were significantly related to interorganizational fraud, and that supply chain monitoring and ethical sourcing were not significantly related to interorganizational fraud. These findings contribute to the research on relational risk, supply chain risk management, and opportunism. (c) 1988-2012 IEEE.

This paper presents an examination of the relationship between the presence and composition of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee on the corporate governance board and CSR decoupling. Using a sample of listed firms drawn from 41 countries, we found that the presence of a CSR committee on the corporate board is negatively associated with CSR decoupling. We also noted that the nature of the industry to which a firm belongs, a firm's level of CSR orientation, and corporate governance quality strengthen such association. Further analysis of the relationship between the structure of the CSR committee and CSR decoupling shows that larger CSR committee size and a greater independence and longer tenure of its members negatively affect CSR decoupling. Our results are robust to various alternative specifications and offer important research and managerial implications. The findings of this study contribute to the growing literature on corporate governance and CSR. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

We use a sample of French firms over the period 2001-2017 to investigate the relationship between board gender diversity and related-party transactions (RPTs). Although some of these transactions are efficient, RPTs are usually perceived negatively by outsiders because of the existence of conflict-of-interest transactions deemed to be value-destroying. Based on agency theory and managerial power theory, we argue that female directors have the ability and motivation to challenge managers' use of RPTs. Consistently with this argument, we find that board gender diversity negatively correlates with the number of reported RPTs. This negative correlation is driven by female directors involved in the board's monitoring duties (female independent directors and members of the audit committee). However, because they are less likely to be able to challenge managers, female inside directors do not affect the occurrence of RPTs. In January 2011, the French regulator enacted a gender quota law resulting in a significant increase in female board representativeness. We find that the marginal effect after enacting the gender quota law on the number of reported RPTs is negative for the proportion of female independent directors and female audit committee members, and positive for female inside directors.

Purpose: Different from the previous organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) literature, this study aims to propose an OCB-O (organizational citizenship behavior toward organizations) and OCB-I (organizational citizenship behavior toward individual coworkers) driven mechanism for the formation of OCB-C (organizational citizenship behavior toward customers). Based on the social exchange and agency theories, the authors propose that perceived leadership support and work autonomy contribute to both OCB-I and OCB-O, which contributes to proactive and reactive customer service attitude as well as OCB-C. Design/methodology/approach: A three-wave survey was conducted in five-star hotels in Mainland China, and a sample of 410 hotel frontline employees was used to test the model. Findings: Findings of the study suggested that perceived leadership support positively led to OCB-O and OCB-I while work autonomy led to OCB-I, demonstrating the importance of employees' perceived leadership support on motivating employees to perform OCB-I and OCB-O. OCB-I and OCB-O directly improved OCB-C, confirming the proposed spillover effect from OCB-I and OCB-O to OCB-C. OCB-I supported both proactive and reactive customer service attitudes, revealing OCB-I as more effective than OCB-O on influencing employees' service attitudes. Furthermore, OCB-I, OCB-O and proactive customer service attitude lead to OCB-C. Practical implications: This study suggests that it is important for leaders to show care and support to employees and design jobs with a certain level of flexibility, so that employees are motivated to go the extra mile to do a good job. When employees make helping others a habit, they will provide more genuine care to customers and do a better job in serving customers. Originality/value: This study supports the spillover mechanism of OCB-I and OCB-O on OCB-C. Specifically, the spillover mechanism starts from a workplace-driven model with employees' perceived leadership support and work autonomy to enhance OCB-O as well as OCB-I. Then, spillover effects stem directly from OCB-I and OCB-O to OCB-C and indirectly to proactive customer service attitude. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Supplier audits are frequently criticized for lacking authenticity and objectivity. Technology-enhanced audits (TEA) offer a potential solution to supplier audit problems by enabling enhanced analytical, visualization, modeling, and predictive capabilities. This paper explores the potential of Industry 4.0 practices in enhancing supplier audit authenticity and efficacy, as well as reducing supplier monitoring costs. The application of Industry 4.0 in supplier auditing is still in its infancy. Therefore, this paper adopts an exploratory approach building on an extensive review of the literature. The paper builds upon an inductive-deductive approach to explore how the individual technologies underlying Industry 4.0 can be leveraged to enhance supplier audits. Based on insights from the literature, the paper develops propositions outlining the role of Industry 4.0 in supplier audit authenticity, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. The paper builds arguments against the backdrop of traditional audits' limitations and illustrates how TEA can overcome many of these limitations. TEA can enhance the authenticity and efficacy of supplier audits, while also reducing supplier monitoring costs. TEA are most effective in an Industry 4.0 environment where the use of technologies is supported with governance structures. The application of Industry 4.0 can make supplier audits more transparent and value-adding, benefiting both the buyer and supplier. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are explored. Suppliers can leverage TEA to create opportunities for strategic differentiation, enhance transparency and trust, and stand out from those who view audits solely as a cost. Buyers can use TEA to enhance audit efficacy, enhance insights into supplier operations, cut monitoring costs, and improve their competitiveness. TEA is a new generation of supplier auditing that has the potential to bring fundamental changes to current auditing models and make audits genuine, authentic, prospective, and insightful while building on Industry 4.0 principles.

Concentrated ownership implies greater alignment between ownership and control, mitigating the agency problem. However, it may also engender governance challenges such as funds appropriation through related party transactions and the oppression of minority shareholders, especially in the context of weak legal systems. We draw from legal theory (the tradeoff controlling shareholder model and private benefits of control) and from organization theory (socioemotional wealth), to suggest that concentrated ownership can be beneficial in both robust and weak legal systems for different reasons. We advance theory on the effects of controlling shareholders and suggest that the longer-term outlook associated with engaged concentrated ownership can aid the shift of the corporation toward Berle and Means' (1932, p. 355) "third possibility" of corporations serving the interests of not just the stockholders or management but also of society.

Corporate governance has received substantial scholarly attention for decades, although the focus of this research has by and large been on publicly traded for-profit organizations. However, agency problems are increasingly recognized in nonprofits. As such, we examine the application of corporate governance logic in the context of nonprofits. Our study relies on nearly a decade of data spanning 6853 US-based charities and comprising nearly US$346 billion in total revenue. Our results show that common corporate governance practices--such as independent boards, chief executive officer oversight, and transparency--enhance the degree to which donor contributions are allocated toward a charity's mission. Overall, we assess the broader applicability and benefits of corporate governance and build on literature highlighting links between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In doing so, we demonstrate the usefulness of governance in this economically and socially consequential context. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

Horizontal logistics collaboration can increase environmental sustainability and reduce shipping costs. Given these benefits--and the fact that few shippers actually opt to collaborate--public sector agencies and industry associations have attempted to sponsor and support the facilitation of horizontal logistics collaboration projects over the past 20 years. The literature, however, has yet to reveal the fact that these efforts have largely failed. Here, we introduce systematic horizontal logistics collaboration and apply Ostrom's theory of the commons and agency theory to extract antecedents on why these projects failed. We present a multiple-case study on unsuccessful horizontal logistics collaboration projects in Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. We address a gap in supply chain literature with regard to systematic collaboration; we also demonstrate the utility of commons theory in the supply chain domain and contribute to the literature on supply chain collaboration with facilitators. Finally, we discuss managerial implications, both for the practitioners attempting systematic horizontal logistics collaboration and for the policymakers seeking to promote it. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Purpose: In view of the current climate change emergency and the growing importance of the climate-related accountability of companies, this paper aims to advance a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of carbon-related chief executive officer (CEO) compensation. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the agency-theoretical perspective on executive compensation and existing work in the fields of management, corporate governance, cultural studies, and behavioral science, this paper derives a multilevel framework of the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation. Findings: This paper maps the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation at the societal, organizational, group, and individual levels of analysis. It also provides research propositions on the determinants that can support and challenge the implementation of this instrument of environmental corporate governance. Originality/value: In the past literature, the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation have remained largely unexplored. This paper contributes to the academic discussion on environmental corporate governance by showcasing the role of interlinkages among the determinants of carbon-related CEO compensation and the possible countervailing impacts. In view of the complex interdisciplinary nature of climate change impact, this paper encourages businesses practitioners and regulators to intensify their climate change mitigation efforts and delineates the levers at their disposal.

Nonprofit accountability research has garnered much attention in recent years, greatly expanding our understanding of the field. Yet, this focus has resulted in a complex and oftentimes fragmented body of research, which has made it difficult to navigate and effectively study nonprofit accountability. To address this concern, this article uses characteristics of accountability and articulates the dynamic interaction between the various accountability dichotomies found in the literature through a theory-based typology. In summary, this article argues that a narrow conception of accountability, focused on resource dependence, public interest and agency theories, can be seen as a functional process ("how") to meet the imposed requirements ("for what") of upward principals ("to whom"). In contrast, a broad conception of accountability, focused on stewardship, democratic, and stakeholder theories, can be seen as a strategic process ("how") to provide information that is based on felt responsibility ("for what") to downward stakeholders ("to whom").

Previous corporate governance research has paid little attention to the role of chief executive officer (CEO) labor markets in controlling CEO behaviors because the CEO labor market has been considered inefficient. With the increasing mobility of top executives across firms, however, the potential of CEO labor markets to serve as an external disciplining force has been growing. In this study, we argue that CEOs will be more pressured to engage in desirable behaviors as the CEO labor market becomes more efficient. Using a longitudinal sample of S&P 1500 firms in high-technology industries in United States from 2011 to 2019, we found that CEOs tend to increase R&D investment as CEO labor market supply increases. We also found that the tendency is greater when external CEO succession is more frequent in the market. Our results demonstrate that CEO labor markets have the potential to function as an effective external governance mechanism. Copyright (c) The Author(s), 2022.

There is a widely believed tradition that good or high-quality agency-client relationships make for superior advertising campaigns, with many scholars highlighting the benefits agency professionals bring to the advertising creative development process. However, not all agree, and some scholars point to a "dark side" of apparently good relationships--an alternative tradition that is based on agency theory. This approach suggests agencies can take advantage of clients who are highly committed. Our research focuses on the agency perspective to this question and collects data on 518 campaigns from London and Amsterdam agencies. We show both traditions have merit in that the two processes operate simultaneously. When agencies perceive that the quality of their client relationship is low, the professionalism of agency personnel shines through developing original, strategic, and creative work. But when relationship quality is considered high, dark side problems emerge. However, there is a bright side to good relationships. Creativity theory suggests that a good relationship can increase the intrinsic motivation of agency staff such that their increased passion for the work offsets dark side problems--something for which we find empirical support.

Prior work on solutions has often neglected double agency relationships. However, exchanges in solution business enable suppliers and customers to be in the agent and the principal position. Outcome-based pricing (OBP) is supposed to mitigate suppliers' opportunistic behavior; however, customers are often not willing to accept OBP. Drawing on a cross-industry survey with 172 managers of business-to-business firms, we show that the degree to which customers accept OBP in response to supplier opportunism depends on the customers as well. First, the interaction between perceived supplier opportunism and customers' opportunistic mindset on customer acceptance of OBP is negative. Second, customer switching costs and customer firm size reflecting the customers' dependence and bargaining power also intensify the double agency problem, making customers less likely to accept OBP. In addition to theoretically enriching literature on solutions and contracting from an agency perspective, this research provides new insights for managers into the appropriateness and implementation of OBP.

Purpose: Organizational climate is an essential dynamic to leverage in salesforce performance. This study aims to develop a model that explores the determinants of independent manufacturers' representatives' (i.e. IMRs') intentions to comply with their principals' requests for additional tasking. Using agency theory, the authors explore the application of behavior and outcome-based controls upon dyadic manufacturer-IMR relationships for these additional performance/task requests. Design/methodology/approach: Data from over 1,000 US-based IMRs were used to test two constructs; inter-organizational climate and perceptions of mutual satisfaction within the agency-principal dyad. Compliance behaviors tested were IMRs' intentions to engage in non-selling-related tasks and intentions to allocate additional selling time to principals' products. The following four exogenous controls were tested: perceived goal congruence between IMRs and principals; IMRs' perceptions of principals' expertise; mutual communications between IMRs and principals in the supply chain dyad; resources and sales support programs provided by principals to IMRs; and IMRs' perceptions of the adequacy and fairness of the principals' compensation plans. Findings: Two constructs - inter-organizational climate and perceptions of mutual satisfaction with the agency-principal dyad - mediated the effects of exogenous sales controls on two compliance behaviors. The model's data were analyzed using Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). A marker variable was deployed to check for common method variance also supported using the Partial least squares (PLS) factor solution. Most variables demonstrated significant direct and mediated effects on each compliance behavior. Variables that emphasized behavioral-based controls dominated intentions for IMRs to engage in non-selling tasks. The principal commission structure, the only sales outcome-based control in the study, most influenced IMRs' intentions to commit additional sales time to their principals' products. Research limitations/implications: This study only examined the intentions of IMRs to engage in additional selling activities and their intention to engage in non-selling tasks. Principals may desire longer-term commitments from IMRs. The model developed here can be modified to capture additional behavioral and attitudinal outcomes including, for example, the exit intentions of IMRs. Practical implications: Principals are well-advised to foster a positive inter-organizational climate that fuels perceptions of mutually satisfying working relationships with their IMRs. These mutually satisfying working relationships can, by themselves, positively influence IMRs to acquiesce to reasonable requests made by principals. This advice appears to be particularly crucial when asking IMRs to engage in additional non-selling tasks. The total pattern of path estimates points to the conclusion that capable sales control plays an important role in fostering positive inter-organizational climates. The inter-organizational climate - mutual satisfaction link proved crucial as a mediator of the impact of sales controls on IMRs' behavioral compliance intentions. Originality/value: Knowing the impact of sales controls on IMR's affords businesses the ability to use these controls for behavioral compliance intentions on non-selling tasks.

Purpose: Health systems function in an ecosystem that is turbulent and competitive because of demographic, economic, political, technological and lifestyle changes and sociopolitical influences, requiring hospitals to adopt comprehensive business strategies. Failure to do so may result in duplication, waste and deficits. This original article uses the prism of agency theory to examine differences in approach at two levels of hospital management and the consequent problems in the incorporation of necessary changes. Agency theory posits an inherent conflict of interest in organizations, including health organizations: the managers (agents) always aim to maximize their profit or personal interest instead of that of the owner or organization (principal), potentially causing difficulty in managing the organization. The aim is to generate recommendations for policymakers. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on 30 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with key figures in the health system and on two levels of hospital management: senior managers and heads of selected departments. The analysis used a categorical qualitative methodology. Findings: The main findings are five key themes: views of business behavior, asymmetry of interests, asymmetry of information, transparency and cooperation between various levels of management and ambivalence toward business in hospitals. The two levels of management are clearly divided in terms of interests, information and activity, leading to difficulty in cooperation, efficiency and achievement of organizational goals. Originality/value: Using agency theory, this study provides a systemic and organizational view of hospitals' management and environmental adaptation. Understanding the processes and increasing cooperation at various managerial levels can help make the system more efficient and ensure its survival in a dynamic market.

Not-for-profit organisations are increasingly being held to account for their social performance. Due to their resource dependency, they generally rely on external financial resources to ensure their missions. This alternative is usually coupled with social accountability requirements from private investors. Given their externally induced nature, social accountability initiatives might result in the implementation of management control systems imported from for-profit organisations without any real consideration - and, consequently, leading to an oversimplification - of the social sector's characteristics and complexities. Relying on both agency and stewardship theories, we consider how to reconcile external reporting obligations with the characteristics of non-profit organisations. To this end, we use a single qualitative case study of a social organisation responsible for housing services, which recently introduced a reporting system to meet its private investors' external requirements. We stress the potential risks of implementing an agency theory-based system in a social context and maintain that the expected accountability targets are unlikely to be reached. We also make recommendations to improve the current system by drafting new metrics. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Multinational corporations (MNCs) are considered as dispersed structures of power, in which diverse headquarters (HQ)-subsidiary power relationships collectively influence performance and management. Yet, few studies have accounted for the subsidiary portfolio characteristics shaped by the entire set of differentiated HQ-subsidiary power relationships, and little is known about their effect on the performance and management decisions of MNCs. Drawing on agency and resource dependence theories, this study investigates how the power structure of the MNC, or the pattern of power distribution in the subsidiary portfolio, affects MNC performance and expatriate utilization. Results from a comprehensive panel of Korean MNCs show that the degree of power concentration in the subsidiary portfolio has inverted U-shaped relationships with MNC performance and the use of expatriate control. However, the results also reveal that these relationships vary between manufacturing and downstream subsidiary portfolios. These findings suggest that the structural characteristics of the subsidiary portfolio are important determinants of MNC performance and management. This study opens an important new avenue for international business scholarship by explicitly conceptualizing the MNC as a portfolio of differentiated subsidiaries and by examining the consequences of the subsidiary portfolio characteristics.

Board director independence is critical to achieving and maintaining control to address the agency theory-based issue of interest misalignment between the principal (the organization) and the executives (agent). However, theoretical and empirical research and strategic risk considerations have brought into question the role or relevance that director independence plays in these control task and agency theory domains. We ask, using a quantitative survey method, whether board activity-based applications of independence may be associated with the service task of the board, namely its resource dependence mission. Our findings suggest that the resource dependence duty of the board may be positively associated with some autonomous activities, and yet other activities might be driven primarily by normative practices. Based on this, we suggest that a theoretical scope beyond and greater than agency theory may be needed when reassessing the role of director independence.

Within MNCs' foreign subsidiaries financial slack, i.e., uncommitted financial resources in excess of those needed for current operations, may incur costs for headquarters. These costs may emanate from subsidiaries' decision to forego investment opportunities and stockpile cash instead, which, in turn, may lead to fewer resources being available for redistribution within the organization. From an agency theory perspective, headquarters can minimize these costs through monitoring mechanisms. While agency theory is considered theoretically appropriate for the study of the headquarters-subsidiary relationship, it reflects a rather undersocialized manifestation of human behaviour, which in turn limits its applicability. In this paper, we attempt to address this limitation by suggesting and empirically exploring that the effect of monitoring mechanisms is dependent (1) on the different types of monitoring used, and (2) on subsidiaries' external embeddedness. Drawing on empirical evidence from 94 subsidiaries of foreign multinationals operating in Greece, we provide some initial evidence on the differential impact of monitoring through expatriates and monitoring through bureaucratic processes. Most importantly, we show that subsidiaries' structural embeddedness moderates both associations. In doing so, we reveal that whether subsidiaries behave opportunistically or as good citizens is partially determined by the social context in which they are embedded. An unexpected finding concerns the positive effect of the origin of the CEO on subsidiaries' financial slack for expatriates compared to local managers. This finding underscores the importance of the CEO identity, and highlights the need for future research exploring its effect on subsidiaries' performance. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

In the wake of technological innovation, supply chain transparency has become a concrete avenue for long-awaited improvements to supply chain processes and practices. Transparency is of particular interest to Supply Chain Finance; however, it is yet empirically unknown whether and how benefits would materialise. Being at the interface of finance and operations, Supply Chain Finance aims at improving the inter-company management of financial flows. Nowadays, different financing schemes are offered foremost by cooperation between financial institutions and fintechs. Uncertainty remains on whether and how supply chain transparency would benefit these schemes to allow the adoption of more sophisticated, higher-value schemes. By applying the Gioia method, we analysed a series of interviews with experts from the Supply Chain Finance industry regarding transaction cost economics, agency theory, and dynamic capability. The resulting series of pragmatic, theory-grounded but practice-inspired propositions untangle the relationship and barriers between supply chain transparency and Supply Chain Finance. The propositions provide advances in the theoretical understanding of Supply Chain Finance and uncover relevant directions for future research. This poses the base for actionable results in future research and leads to an impact in research by addressing the concerns and tensions raised by Supply Chain Finance experts.

Purpose: Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are notoriously prone to disputes among stakeholders, some of which may unduly jeopardize contract performance. Contract disputes arising in Iran are often due to inefficiency of PPP concession agreements and practice. This study presents a causal-predictive model of the root causes and preventive measures for inter-organization disputes to enhance the likelihood of achieving desirable performance in PPP projects. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical "causal-predictive" model was developed with fourteen hypotheses based on extant literature and contractual agency theory, which resulted in the creation of a pool of 110 published items. Data were obtained from a questionnaire survey with 75 valid responses, completed by 4 stratified groups of Iranian PPP experts. Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used for validating the proposed model via a case study. Findings: Results reveal that the main three factors of PPP desirable performance are as follows: on-time project completion, high quality of activities/products and services for public satisfaction. Further, the most influential factors of the lifecycle problems, construction stage, and preferred risk allocation included risk misallocation, improper payment mechanism and failure to facilitate a timely approval process. Originality/value: For researchers, the findings contribute to the theory of contractual agency; specifically, how different influences among the model's elements lead to better PPP performance. In practical terms, proposed outcome-based strategies will inform PPP stakeholders to avoid dispute occurrence and thus improve the time, quality and services of projects.

Purpose: In this study, the authors explore the effects of politically controlled boards on bank loan performance in both state-owned commercial banks (SCBs) and private sector commercial banks (PCBs) in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: The data consist of 409 bank-year observations from 46 sample SCBs and PCBs of Bangladesh for the period 2008-17. The authors apply ordinary least squares pooled regression with year fixed effect for baseline econometric analyses and generalized method of moments regression for robustness tests after addressing the endogeneity issue. Findings: The regression results reveal that the presence of bank "boards controlled by politically affiliated directors" (PA) have significant positive effects on non-performing loans (NPLs). Similarly, the presence of "boards controlled by politically affiliated directors without substantial ownership interests" (PAWOI) show positive association with NPLs. In contrast, the presence of "boards controlled by politically affiliated directors with substantial ownership interests" (PAOI) exhibit an inverse relationship with NPLs. These findings support 'agency conflict' arguments and document that both PA and PAWOI are detrimental to bank loan performance in Bangladesh, while PAOI do not have significant effect on increasing NPLs. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing bank governance literature by providing evidence from an emerging economy perspective, where politically affiliated directors (PADs) exploit their positions for personal and/or political gain at the cost of other stakeholders by taking advantage of relaxed regulatory oversights and investor protections.

This paper is aimed at examining the choice between behavior-based and outcome-based payment types through the views of practitioners from construction projects with variables defined by agency theory. The study adopts the analysis of data through the Delphi technique supported by factor analysis and multinomial logistic regressions to test the paper hypotheses. The paper shows that in projects with a high level of contractor risk aversion, outcome uncertainty, task programmability, and information systems, cost-plus-fee payment is more attractive than lump-sum payment. Conversely, the paper shows that in projects with a high level of goal conflict and outcome measurability, lump-sum payment is more attractive than cost-plus-fee payment. The results demonstrate the practical usefulness of agency theory in the arena of construction management. The contribution of this paper lies in providing insights into choosing an appropriate contract payment type based on agency theory parameters. (c) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The purchaser-provider co-operation model is a way of increasing efficiency and quality in healthcare services. Risks associated with this model, including goal misalignment and information asymmetry, are managed through control mechanisms. Based on data from 12 clinical commissioning groups (purchasers of cancer care) in the English National Health Service, this paper describes the control mechanisms used to facilitate purchaser-provider co-operation and identifies good practices in using different control mechanisms. Effective control mechanisms were found to include stakeholder involvement (social control); co-operation and partnerships with providers (process control); and monitoring and service outcome measures for provider (outcome control). The paper fills an important gap in the literature--little scholarly attention has to date been paid about how purchaser and provider relationships are managed ex post and how performance is affected.

In lateral exchange markets, consumers can interact with one another to varying degrees (consociality) along different levels of platform management and involvement (platform intermediation). Applying agency theory and attribution of blame, two experimental studies investigate blame for service failures and remediating effects of service recovery strategies in the context of lateral exchange markets. The findings suggest that consumers are more likely to become upset and blame the platform when consociality is low; this is especially true when platform intermediation is high. Moreover, partial refunds are a more effective service recovery strategy than apologies when intermediation is low (i.e. enablers). However, when intermediation is high (i.e. hubs), partial refunds are no more effective than apologies. These findings carry important implications for managers of lateral exchange platforms when facing service failures in knowing when consumers attribute the most blame to platforms and how to best retain patrons without unduly compromising profitability.

The founding of the town of Guelph, Ontario, was uncommon in that the town was established prior to the development of surrounding agricultural lands. This was done through an arrangement between the British government and a private, for-profit company. Grounded in agency theory, this study examines the establishment of the town and the role of accounting in its early development. The results show how the absence of accounting created a space in which the company's agent could operate in a way that promoted the well-being of the local population while adopting a long-term approach to shareholder wealth creation. This study highlights the insights that can be gained by investigating where accounting is absent and the importance of aligning accounting techniques with organisational and social objectives, particularly in the context of private companies acting on behalf of governments.

Purpose: On the example of professional football in Germany, this paper analyses the conflict about the punishment of fan misbehaviour within an agency-theoretical framework to cast light on the reasons for the ineffectiveness of the sentences and to show possible solutions. Design/methodology/approach: In a pre-study, more than 1,300 hand-collected past sentences against clubs by the German and European sports courts were analysed to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the penalties so far. Additionally, in the main study, 26 expert interviews with German representatives of the football association, courts, clubs, sponsors, police and active fan scenes allow a deep insight into the relationships of the involved parties. Findings: The paper suggests that the sentences do not sufficiently consider several agency problems. Due to moral hazard, they exert hardly any influence on fan behaviour and only a small one on the clubs. While the lighting of pyrotechnics is by far the most punished type of misbehaviour, most of the interviewees cite the impossibility of preventing it. Despite the sentences, some clubs make non-public agreements with their fans about still tolerable misconduct or do not pass the penalties on to the polluters as intended by the association. The findings highlight the importance of communication for less misbehaviour. Originality/value: For the first time, the agency theory and the economic theory of optimal punishment are brought together with insights from interviews with the involved parties. The authors discover a two-stage principal-agent problem and get new insights into stakeholders' hidden motivations and attitudes. The results should encourage a debate on the current penalties and possible solutions to the recurring problem of pyrotechnics. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Financial internationalization is of particular importance to emerging country firms. Its significance arises from the impact of institutional void and related agency problems (common to emerging markets) on the internationalization path of these firms. Building on concepts from international finance, agency theory and institutional theory, this paper aims to examine the main aspects of financial internationalization by emerging country multinationals, namely, cross-listing, foreign ownership and foreign independent directors. Design/methodology/approach: This paper follows a multiple case study approach which is a good fit for the exploratory nature of this research. The interest is to examine the context-driven financial internationalization of each case firm and replicate the firm-level information to find a common strategy. Findings: The findings suggest that financial internationalization by emerging country multinationals starts mainly as these firms plan to enter advanced country markets. It is a dynamic process that entails interaction between financial internationalization and real internationalization, as well as among different aspects of financial internationalization. Cross-listing comprises the first stage of the process. Then, foreign ownership, particularly foreign institutional investments, would increase gradually in response to advances in financial and factor markets. Recruiting foreign independent directors seems to be adopted last, possibly out of fear of losing control of strategic decisions. Originality/value: This paper presents a unique perspective that delineates different stages of the process of financial internationalization by emerging country multinationals. This complements the efforts to explain the distinct path of internationalization followed by these firms and supplements scarce literature by including emerging multinationals from India where the matter has not yet attracted proper attention.

Organizational citizenship behavior is a highly sought-after outcome. We integrate insight from the psychological ownership perspective and agency theory to examine how the juxtaposition of informal psychological mechanisms (i.e., ownership feelings toward an organization) and formal and informal governance mechanisms (i.e., employee share ownership, agency monitoring, and peer monitoring) influences employees' organizational citizenship behaviors. Our empirical results show that psychological ownership has a positive effect on organizational citizenship behavior. Contrary to the common belief that informal and formal mechanisms complement each other, we find that the positive influence of psychological ownership on organizational citizenship behavior is more pronounced when employee share ownership and agency monitoring is low compared to high. Implications for theory and future research are discussed. (c) 2022, The Author(s).

Following its 40th anniversary and more than three decades after its introduction to the strategic management literature, agency theory remains the predominant theory of corporate governance. In this paper, we examine affect, an underexplored dimension in principal-agent relationships. Using the CEO-board of directors relationship as a context, we develop a theoretical lens that explains how interpersonal affect underlying relationships between CEOs and directors of boards shapes behavior in ways that deviate from traditional agency theory predictions. We discuss how the incorporation of an affective perspective advances principal-agent research by revising agency theory's assumptions concerning human nature and behavior and suggesting new research directions. By acknowledging a central role of affect, we connect existing behavioral approaches to organizational agency and advance our understanding of socioemotional foundations of principal-agent tensions, problems, and agency costs.

Purpose: In a volatile agricultural postharvest market, producers require more personalized information about market dynamics for informed decisions on the marketed surplus. However, this adaptive strategy fails to benefit them if the selection of a computational price predictive model to disseminate information on the market outlook is not efficient, and the associated risk of perishability, and storage cost factor are not assumed against the seemingly favourable market behaviour. Consequently, the decision of whether to store or sell at the time of crop harvest is a perennial dilemma to solve. With the intent of addressing this challenge for agricultural producers, the study is focused on designing an agricultural decision support system (ADSS) to suggest a favourable marketing strategy to crop producers. Design/methodology/approach: The present study is guided by an eclectic theoretical perspective from supply chain literature that included agency theory, transaction cost theory, organizational information processing theory and opportunity cost theory in revenue risk management. The paper models a structured iterative algorithmic framework that leverages the forecasting capacity of different time series and machine learning models, considering the effect of influencing factors on agricultural price movement for better forecasting predictability against market variability or dynamics. It also attempts to formulate an integrated risk management framework for effective sales planning decisions that factors in the associated costs of storage, rental and physical loss until the surplus is held for expected returns. Findings: Empirical demonstration of the model was simulated on the dynamic markets of tomatoes, onions and potatoes in a north Indian region. The study results endorse that farmer-centric post-harvest information intelligence assists crop producers in the strategic sales planning of their produce, and also vigorously promotes that the effectiveness of decision making is contingent upon the selection of the best predictive model for every future market event. Practical implications: As a policy implication, the proposed ADSS addresses the pressing need for a robust marketing support system for the socio-economic welfare of farming communities grappling with distress sales, and low remunerative returns. Originality/value: Based on the extant literature studied, there is no such study that pays personalized attention to agricultural producers, enabling them to make a profitable sales decision against the volatile post-harvest market scenario. The present research is an attempt to fill that gap with the scope of addressing crop producer's ubiquitous dilemma of whether to sell or store at the time of harvesting. Besides, an eclectic and iterative style of predictive modelling has also a limited implication in the agricultural supply chain based on the literature; however, it is found to be a more efficient practice to function in a dynamic market outlook.

This study investigates the effects of top management staffing on foreign subsidiary performance, moderated by the occurrence of uncertainty shock in the home market. Building on a refined model of agency theory, this study introduces the context of a parent country to the existing theoretical framework and addresses the importance of appointing top managers with an intermediary status between host and home countries. The empirical evidence from foreign subsidiaries of South Korean firms in 102 countries (1992-2007) shows that assignment of immigrant top managers originating from the parent country is positively associated with subsidiary performance in the wake of home-country uncertainty. These findings highlight the benefits of appointing managers with dual knowledge structure and adaptive flexibility in the top management position in foreign locations.

This chapter considers the new labour market relations within the high-tech sector through the prism of agency theory. Agency theory offers a valuable lens for examining work relationships as its unit of analysis is the contract between principal and agent. This chapter takes an up-close look at the nature of this contract in the conditions of the digital economy, the race for innovation and high demand for high-tech professionals. It discusses the implications of new forms of work for both employers and high-tech professionals. First, the assumptions and logics of agency theory are presented. Then, the landscape of new labour relations in high-tech industries is discussed in order to understand their contractual nature in the digital economy. New forms of work might limit workers' agency potential by fragmenting employees from each other and depriving them of social security nets. On the other hand, the hyper-competitive high-tech industry, pressure on new technologies coupled with surging demand for high-tech professionals and labour market disequilibrium impact high-tech professionals' agency potential. To understand the potential alignment and misalignment of agency contracts, two important variables of agency theory - risk and agency control - are examined. Finally, the usefulness of agency theory in explaining contemporary agency problems is assessed, its limitations are discussed and promising new research directions are proposed.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate the moderating effect of external financing needs on the relationship between the disclosure level of integrated reporting (IR) and firm value using evidence from Egypt. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a panel regression analysis for a matched sample of 50 companies listed on the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX), specifically from EGX100. The sample covers four years (2017-2020). The current study uses content analysis to measure IR and Tobin's Q as a proxy for firm value. Findings: The findings reveal a significant positive relationship between the disclosure level of IR and firm value. In addition, the authors find that external financing needs moderate the relationship between IR and firm value. It is concluded that the higher the disclosure level of IR content, the higher the firm's value, and that this relationship strengthens in firms with high needs for external financing. Practical implications: Several practical implications can be derived from the results of the current study. Policymakers and regulators can impose mandatory requirements for IR in Egypt. It also opens new insights for board members, managers, analysts and auditors in forming financing decisions based on annual reports. Originality/value: The present study has a novel insight from a developing country and significant contributions to the extant literature. The study provides empirical evidence from an emerging economy and an insight into how external financing can be used for firms with different levels of IR. It also provides a comprehensive disclosure index to estimate the level of IR. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The growing number of corporate scandals globally highlights the importance of effective corporate governance mechanisms. Many of the corporate governance frameworks that are rooted in the agency theory advocate the election of independent non-executive directors, an independent chairperson, and a lead independent director. Shareholder voting on the election or re-election of directors (hereafter referred to as 'director re-elections') has been largely unexplored in South Africa--a country widely recognised as a pioneer in the corporate governance field and yet marred by several corporate scandals in recent years. In this study, an unbalanced panel data set was thus constructed comprising voting outcomes and board-level characteristics of companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2020. Significant positive relationships were noted between shareholder voting opposition to director re-elections and both board size and board tenure. Shareholders who cast opposing votes mainly did so because of their concerns about the lack of director independence, at board, committee, and nominee level. The findings of this study were explained in the context of the agency, stakeholder, stewardship, and resource dependence theories. It is recommended that nomination committees use more robust selection criteria for directors. Shareholders are also encouraged to vote more actively on director re-elections to monitor these monitors. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

This research examines and compares perceptions of Omani university students with those of American business students towards entrepreneurs and business managers. Bucar and Hisrich's (2001) model was used to measure and collect students' perceptions towards ethical behaviours of firm managers and entrepreneurs. T-tests were employed to test statistical significance in the mean scores of Omani and American students. Results showed that Omani students perceive entrepreneurs as more ethical in decision making than managers, following the American sample, but with no significant gender based alterations among them. However, degree of perception among American students was higher than Omani students, being contrary to previous studies. This study contributes to body of literature contextually, firstly by adding Oman (Arab) to existing body of knowledge based on gender, national differences and institutions, and secondly by making comparative study of youth perceptions towards ethical behaviour of entrepreneurs and managers between a developed and a developing country.

Shippers and logistics service providers implement information communication technology (ICT) in outsourced logistics to increase efficiency and remedy information asymmetry. However, the nature of outsourced logistics operations can create technology management challenges due to the organizational distances between the technology initiator and the technology users. Here, we apply the lens of positivist agency theory to study four cases of technology management and agency in multi-tier outsourced logistics services. Our findings suggest that while ICT remedies some information asymmetry, it also creates new information asymmetry--and gives rise to user privacy concerns. Furthermore, the setting of multi-tier subcontracted logistics services appears to be a critical factor in designing governance mechanisms for effective technology management. In addition to our theoretical contributions to technology management in multi-tier outsourcing, we offer an empirical account of agency, proposals for future research, and practical suggestions to help managers tackle agency issues that arise from information asymmetry.

Increasingly organizations have dedicated systems and personnel (recipients) to receive and handle internal whistleblower reports. Yet, the complexity of handling whistleblower reports is often underestimated, and there is a dearth of literature that attempts to describe or analyse the challenges internal recipients face. This paper uses an agency theory inspired lens to provide insight into the complexity of internal whistleblowing, with the aim to identify focal points for improving internal whistleblowing processes. We conceive of internal recipients as agents of two principals in the event of whistleblowing: owner/top management as well as whistleblowers. We identify sources of agency problems and agency costs within these double-agent relationships. We provide avenues for solving these problems and reducing the agency costs. We close by offering paths for future research. (c) 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate how the negative effect of litigation risk on firm performance could be controlled through the channel of voluntary disclosure and under the condition of institutional ownership. Design/methodology/approach: To get the objectives, the study analyzed an unbalanced panel of 918 non-financial listed Chinese firms from 2010 to 18. To capture any expected unobserved heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the unbalanced sample, the authors have applied fixed effect regression with robust standard errors clustered at the firms' levels as suggested by Newey and West (1987). Findings: The research provides that the good disclosure practices and presence of institutional ownership in corporations raise the trust of the investors by making the corporate operation clear in the eyes of the stakeholders. This increases the corporate credibility and as consequence corporations are protected against litigation risk. Thus, in the light of the information asymmetry and signaling theories, voluntary disclosure practices, and financial institutions' ownership, bridges the information gap and transmit a positive signal in the market regarding the better financial performance of the corporations. Research limitations/implications: These findings are helpful for the corporate managers for effective strategic decisions, regulatory authorities for policy formulation, and individual investors for developing a diversified investment portfolio. Originality/value: By applying the mediation and moderation effects, the research enhances the understanding of the underlying causes of the association between a firm's litigation risk and its performance. The current research contributes to the literature, that agency issues which create litigation risk could be settled internally with voluntary disclosure practices and externally with institutional ownership.

Purpose: A supplier may sell not only to one buyer (sole relationship configuration) but also to the buyers competitors (shared relationship configuration) for a specific product category. This study examines the performance implications when suppliers establish shared relationships with the buyer's competitors. Design/methodology/approach: Secondary data are used to test hypotheses relating a supplier's relationship configurations to its operational performance. A seemingly unrelated regression approach (SUR) is applied to analyze the data, followed by endogeneity checks of the empirical findings. Findings: The study shows that suppliers with less-shared ties with buying firms' competitors exhibit superior inventory efficiency and asset turnover. Thus, suppliers can improve operational efficiency by creating relatively exclusive, deep and trust-based relations instead of more extensively shared and shallower relationships. Research limitations/implications: Based on agency theory as a theoretical lens and aerospace industry data, this research contributes by addressing the supplier's perspective and linking its operational efficiency performance with its chosen supply relationship configuration. Practical implications: Suppliers need to understand the performance implications of choosing relatively exclusive relationships versus shared relationships with buying firms. The research provides new insights for managers and can guide their supply chain decision-making. Originality/value: Little is known about how a supplier's relationship configurations can elevate, or impair, its operational efficiency. While conventional wisdom holds that suppliers should focus on multiple avenues of revenue growth by selling to buyers' competitors, this study demonstrates that more sales to a buying firm's rivals might, in fact, reduce a supplier's efficiency.

Research question: This article aims to explain that poorly functioning separation between decision-making, decision-control, and risk-bearing is a fundamental reason for the financial underperformance of major or large sport events. We look at empirical data from four major sports events hosted in Norway: The 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics, the 2011 International Ski Federation (FIS) World Skiing Championship, the 2014 FIDE Chess Olympiad, and the 2017 International Cycling Union (UCI) World Road Cycling Championships. All these events suffered financially. Research methods: The study data were collected from 66 semi-structured interviews and different types of documents, like guides and reports filed by different stakeholders, applications for financial support, collaboration agreements, protocols of meetings, e-mail correspondence, financial statements, and budgeting documents. Results and findings: Through an examination of the previous literature, our analysis confirms drivers and symptoms of financial problems at sport events. These are: the exaggerated focus on legitimising the event, soft-budget practices, interference by political interests, and so on. We argue that many of these factors could have been handled better if a more consequent separation of risk-bearing, decision-making, and decision-control was in place. Implications: We propose a better separation between the decision-making and decision-control function, by means of a permanent and independent entity that is responsible for the decision-control function. Such an institution could enhance knowledge transfer, contribute competence and skills, and improve the financial outcome of a sports events. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

To defeat myopic brand management, we need to understand better what motivates executives to invest in brand building. Drawing from agency theory, we argue that a better alignment of executives` and shareholders` interests can help. Tests using longitudinal compensation data of chief executive officers (CEO) from 123 public firms suggest that decreasing the sensitivity of CEO`s Equity-Based Compensation (EBC) to the firm`s stock price and increasing its sensitivity to the firm`s stock return volatility are associated with higher brand equity. Weak governance somewhat offsets these effects. Moreover, we find that the impact of EBC on brand equity is partially mediated through the firm`s strategic emphasis. Our research highlights the importance of understanding managerial incentives as drivers of brand equity. (c) 2022 Westburn Publishers Ltd.

As procurement processes in many developing countries are without transparency, addressing agency problems becomes necessary. This study reflects on public procurement and public financial management in a comparative analysis within Asia and Africa through the agency theory lens. With a descriptive case study design, the study utilises datasets from 100 Asian and African countries from 2002 to 2018. The distinctiveness of this paper is that it uses public expenditure framework and accountability procurement indicators to ascertain whether agency cost has increased in both continents. The results showed that Asia performed better than Africa in all the indicators except for voice and accountability, and procurement complaint management. There is also clear evidence to suggest that procurement decisions reduce agency cost in Asia than in Africa. The study, therefore, concludes that Asian countries tend to converge more to international standards during procurement processes than African countries, which leads to efficient PFM outcomes.

Though managerial ties are substitutes for the weak market-supporting institutions in developing and emerging countries, little is known about the contingent value of these ties in credit markets. In this study, we disintegrate managerial ties into political and financial ties, and examine their effect on access to finance. Using agency theory, we propose that political and financial ties reduce information asymmetry between firms, politicians and banks, culminating in increased access to bank loans for firms. We also propose that CEO duality, through its influence on corporate governance and information consolidation, strengthens (weakens) the effect of financial (political) ties on access to finance. Using survey data from Ghana, we found support for our propositions. Overall, this study shows that the value of managerial ties is contingent on CEO duality. It also suggests that CEO duality is a double-edged sword with corporate governance and information implications for credit access in developing economies. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

In client-provider-customer service triads, direct interactions between the providers and customers result in clients' exposure to various risks. This paper develops a taxonomy of service triads based on four attributes of outsourced services that result in those risks: 1) business impact; 2) customer contact; 3) mode of interaction; and 4) relationship continuity. We conduct a qualitative study to develop a contextually rich understanding of the resulting taxonomy. Characterization of the four taxons, namely, 'low-hazard,' 'easily-monitored,' 'to-be-watched,' and 'vulnerable' service triads, based on agency theory, contributes to the understanding of how these services have traits and risks that are different from one another. It also provides insights into how the providers in each of the four taxons should be contracted and managed. (c) 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Purpose: This study draws on agency, theory to evaluate the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) duality and earnings quality, proxied by discretionary accruals. Additionally, this study aims to examine whether board independence moderates the relationship between CEO duality and earnings quality. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a fixed-effects regression model to examine the effect of CEO duality on earnings quality and to test whether board independence moderates that relationship for a sample of non-financial listed Portuguese firms-year from 2002 to 2016. Findings: Consistent with agency theory, this study suggests that CEO duality decreases earnings quality. Further, the results also suggest that the earnings quality reduction associated with CEO duality is attenuated when the board of directors has a higher proportion of independent directors. Practical implications: The findings based on this study provide useful information to investors and regulators in evaluating the impact of CEO duality on earnings quality and the effect of board independence on the role of CEO duality, especially under concentrated ownership. Originality/value: To the knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the role of board independence on the association between CEO duality and earnings quality. In addition, this paper is the first empirical study to investigate the direct and indirect effect of CEO duality on earnings quality in Portugal. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyse three decision-making approaches that involve humans and artificial autonomous agents, namely, human "in the loop", "on the loop" and "out of the loop" and identifies the decision characteristics that determine the choice of a decision-making approach. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper that analyses the relationships between the human and the artificial autonomous agents in the decision-making process from the perspectives of the agency theory, sustainability, legislation, economics and operations management. Findings: The paper concludes that the human "out of the loop" approach is most suitable for quick, standardised, frequent decisions with low negative consequences of a wrong decision by the artificial intelligence taken within a well-defined context. Complex decisions with high outcome uncertainty that involve significant ethical issues require human participation in the form of a human "in the loop" or "on the loop" approach. Decisions that require high transparency need to be left to humans. Originality/value: The paper evaluates the decision-making approaches from the perspectives of the agency theory, sustainability, legislation, economics and operations management and identifies the decision characteristics that determine the choice of a decision-making approach.

The majority of projects - even ultimately successful ones - run into significant problems during their development. While organizations have a variety of mechanisms at their disposal to correct projects that are experiencing difficulties, one of the most radical is replacing the project manager. Replacing a project manager 'mid-stream' involves a major change to an ongoing project with the potential benefits of onboarding an individual with a different perspective or set of managerial and/or technical skills. Using agency theory as our critical evaluative lens and a qualitative data collection methodology, we interviewed 19 key informants who had experience as part of project manager replacement efforts. This article reports of the dynamics of replacing project managers, identifying the critical decision criteria and mechanisms involved in such decisions. We found that three themes emerged with regard to project manager replacement decision making: 1) replacement is a common correction practice for troubled projects; 2) replacement is viewed by decision makers and team members alike as a message for change; and 3) in reestablishing processes and trust in governance, project size is an important moderator when deciding on a course of action. We finally propose a process model, based on our analysis, which identifies the critical antecedents, effects, and consequences of project manager replacement. (c) 1988-2012 IEEE.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the performance of marginalized farmers in supply relationships with agri-tech firms in emerging rural agricultural economies. The complex relationship among the suppliers, dual relationship and knowledge transfer (KT) was studied. This paper empirically investigates the relationship between KT and supplier's performance improvement (SPI) via buyer-supplier relationship (BSR). Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on agency theory, a conceptual framework has been proposed to identify the mediation effect of BSR. The context deals with suppliers who are farmers in developing nations. The hypotheses were tested using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation with a sample of 121 marginalized farmers from Indian states. The data was collected using a survey instrument designed by adapting the well-cited and validated measures. These marginalized farmers worked in collaboration with the agri-tech firms facilitating them with the KT. Findings: The relationships established from the results also indicate the fact that KT is a powerful tool to make connections with farmers that lead to their performance improvement. The KT was found as a driver to improve performance (SPI) and the BSR acted as a positive mediator in this study. The complex relationships among the KT, BSR and SPI hold. Research limitations/implications: This paper can be subscribed to various nuanced understandings of the agricultural supply chain context in emerging economies, in the specialized cases where farmers belong to the marginalized communities. This study has the scope to replicate using a mixed-method approach in emerging economies beyond India. It also advances the agency theory literature in the supply chain discipline of emerging rural economies. Practical implications: This study offers strategic implications for agri-tech practitioners, policymakers and academic debate. The marginalized farmers with KT and improved BSR can become a part of the mainstream value chain, their debts can be reduced, suicides can be prevented and the quality of their family life can be significantly improved. Originality/value: This study makes a unique contribution by investigating how the agri-tech firms (non-traditional buyer) and supplier relationship and KT helps improve the economic sustainability of smallholder farmers in India. The authors immersed themselves in fieldwork by interacting and meeting in person with 121 farmers residing in the remotest of the remote rural areas across multiple states of India. This resulted in the collection of authentic data and capturing the ground realities from one of the fastest-growing and largest emerging economies. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The first finding explains that board size does not have a negative effect on financial distress. The second finding explains that female commissioners have a positive and significant influence on financial distress. The third finding explains that the woman director has a positive and significant influence on financial distress. The fourth finding explains that the role of political connections strengthens and has a significant effect on board size on financial distress. The fifth finding explains that the role of political connections weakens and significantly influences the woman commissioner on financial distress. The sixth finding explains that the role of political connections weakens the influence of woman directors on financial distress. The practical implications of the results of this study can help company management and government in policy makers regarding the influence of board size, woman commissioners, woman directors on financial distress, and evaluate the role of political connections in moderating the effect of board size, woman commissioners, woman directors on financial distress. Theoretical implications of the results of this study can explain agency theory. As far as the results of the researchers' observations so far have not found research on the topic and to evaluate the role of political connections in moderating the effect of board size, female commissioners, female directors on financial distress.

Purpose: Digital solutions (DS) that build on recurring revenue models (RRMs) offer new opportunities to continuously create and capture superior value. However, many firms fail to engage their sales force in digital solution selling (DS selling), leading to agency problems that receive little attention in literature. This study aims to examine the drivers of agency problems that surface in the transition toward DS selling and the sales control systems that resolve these problems. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a qualitative, inductive study. Data were collected from interviews with 72 marketing and sales managers representing 53 industrial firms transitioning toward DS selling. Findings: DS selling is subject to adverse selection and moral hazard caused by motivation-related, opportunity-related and ability-related drivers. Input, capability, activity and outcome controls - detailed in this study - can resolve these agency problems. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this study's methodology and scope suggest several directions for future research. Methodology-wise, the authors mainly relied on cross-sectional interview data from informants in Central and Northern Europe. Scope-wise, more research is needed on the capabilities, processes and steering instruments supporting DS sales. Finally, only now do the authors begin to understand which compensation plans motivate DS selling. Practical implications: The controls identified in this study help managers to steer their sales force in DS sales. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to investigate DS sales control systems. Thereby, the authors enhance prior understandings of solution selling, agency problems and sales control systems. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the drivers for proactive workplace social performance in family firms through a configurational approach. Comparative research on family versus non-family firms and workplace social performance has produced mixed results. Consequently, several calls have been made to account for family business heterogeneity to understand better how family involvement in the business affects the workplace social performance. The authors respond to these calls by exploring the governance antecedents that can catalyze family firms' workplace social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using qualitative comparative analysis, the authors analyze 131 family firms from the STEP survey data. Findings: The authors find two governance configurations that lead to better family business workplace social performance. The first configuration is the combination of 100% family ownership, high family involvement in management and a mix of outside directors and family members on the board. The second configuration is the combination of less than 100% family ownership and low family involvement in management. Originality/value: The study builds on and extends the nascent work suggesting the integration of agency and stewardship theories. The authors show that these two theoretical approaches are able to not only coexist, but that they can also be complementary in helping to understand the unique workplace social behaviors of family firms.

This paper explores how contracts in private equity-backed buyouts shape corporate governance in portfolio companies. Drawing upon agency theory and incomplete contracting theory, 50 actual contracts are analyzed in detail. Contracts focus on reducing adverse selection risks through limiting pre-investment information asymmetries and aligning the goals of investors and sellers. Moral hazard risks vis-a-vis management are limited through limiting post-investment information asymmetries and limiting shirking behavior through limiting free cash flows. Goal alignment is achieved through high-powered incentive structures combined with shifting risk of underperformance to management. Managerial hold-up problems are addressed through restricting share transactions and limiting managerial actions. Residual powers and contingencies are mainly used to deal with incomplete contract designs due to uncertainties. Few clauses are used to address the reverse agency problem in which management is protected against moral hazard problems created by the private equity investor. PE contracts have transparent and very strong outcome-based cash flow rights, both limiting downside risk and rewarding upside potential. This contrasts with VC contracts which are especially contingency-based given the high levels of uncertainty of the portfolio companies.

Publicly listed firms have discretion to disclose (or not) advertising spending in their annual (10-K) reports. The disclosure of advertising spending can provide valuable information because advertising is a leading indicator of future performance. However, estimates of advertising spending are available from data providers, arguably mitigating the need for its formal disclosure. This article argues that firms' disclosure of advertising spending provides more complete and public information and therefore lowers investor uncertainty about future firm performance (idiosyncratic risk). Empirical analyses show that the effect is largely driven by the negative effect of disclosure of advertising spending on analyst uncertainty. Consistent with agency theory, the negative effect of the disclosure of advertising spending on analyst uncertainty is stronger for firms with more financial resources, firms with lower disclosure quality, and firms that are in more competitive industries. Additional analyses show that the disclosure of advertising spending has a significant positive effect on firm value in specific sectors. These results, therefore, identify an avenue for chief marketing officers to play a greater role in managing investor relations. In addition, they suggest strong merit for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board to reconsider current regulations governing advertising spending disclosure.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the role of project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in international development (ID) project stakeholders' relationships. This study draws on agency theory to examine the specific role M&E plays in improving ID project impact. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative data comprising of in-depth interviews were collected from ID project stakeholders such as project donors, implementing partners and steering committee members. Findings: Results of the study show that project M&E activities can serve multiple purposes including the collection of data for the assessment of inputs, outputs, outcomes and impact. This information is shared with stakeholders to assist in evidence-based decision-making to improve project impact on community. This study shows that M&E activities strengthen the relationship between stakeholders by involving multiple stakeholders at different stages of ID projects to identify community needs and to demonstrate the positive community impact. Agency issues such as goal incongruence, information asymmetry and risk-sharing affect the relationship between the stakeholders. Investing in different M&E activities can reduce these issues, ultimately leading to a positive impact at the community level. Originality/value: There has been limited research that explores the principal-agent relationship between project stakeholders of ID projects through the lens of agency theory. The role of M&E to collect project data and address agency issues between project stakeholders to improve project impact is the novel contribution of this paper. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study aims to determine the moderating role of trust on the influence of export incentives over importer role performance. The mediating role of importer role performance and the impact of export incentives on exporter performance have also been investigated. Design/methodology/approach: This study used survey as the main data collection method to obtain data from 105 executives of exporting firms. An official database of export firms was provided to this study by the Department of Export Promotion, Ministry of Commerce of Thailand. Findings: Significant partial moderation effect of trust on the impact of export incentives over importer role performance has been seen. Also, this study found a partial mediating role of the importer role performance in mediating the association of export incentives and exporter performance. In addition, export incentives in the form of credible channel policies and price and financial incentives have been found to have a significant positive effect on importer role performance. Practical implications: This study will be of practical value for practitioners or managers of export firms because it is essential to enhance trust with importers and select the appropriate export incentives for importers. This could enhance competitiveness of the export firms. Originality/value: This is an original attempt to investigate the role of trust as moderator in influencing the impact of export incentives on importer role performance. Also, this study initially ascertains the mediating effect of importer role performance in mediating the effectiveness of both monetary and non-monetary incentives on exporter performance.

Purpose: This paper aims to combine the agency theory and efficiency wage theory to explore the effects of relative compensation for executive directors with marketing experience on two marketing outcomes (marketing efficiency and market share) and the moderating roles of ownership type (private vs state-owned enterprises) and market concentration in this process. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 2,753 firm-year observations from Chinese listed companies (from 2010 to 2014) were retrieved from China Stock Market and Accounting Research database and analyzed using firm random-effects with industry, year and region fixed effects. Findings: Relative compensation has a positive effect on both marketing efficiency and market share, and these effects are moderated by ownership type and market concentration. Specifically, the positive effect of relative compensation on marketing efficiency and market share are stronger for central state-owned enterprises (SOEs) compared to local SOEs and private-owned enterprises but the results are mixed for market concentration. Research limitations/implications: This study shows that paying higher compensation to the executive directors with marketing experience can enhance marketing performance, but the data does not allow identification of the actual actions taken by these directors for this. Practical implications: This study highlights the importance of appropriate compensation for directors with marketing experience to motivate them to make better marketing decisions to overcome the challenges posed by market concentration and agency conflicts. Originality/value: This paper points out the importance of having directors with marketing experience and paying them suitable compensation to motivate them to be more effective.

The study investigates the effects of financial accounting services on SMEs' financial performance. The agency theory was used in the research. The study used a quantitative strategy and a survey method to acquire the essential data for the project. The study used a sample of 320 SMEs to carry out the analysis. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used to undertake the statistical analysis. The results indicate that using financial accounting services helps SMEs improve their financial performance. The research also discovered a link between information technology and SMEs' financial performance. The findings of our research reveal that, small businesses that employ accounting services in their business experience an increase in financial performance. This is because the use of financial accounting has a lot of technical advantages which can be helpful to business users. A lot of SMEs need credit to be able to improve their business, therefore they need a financial statement to serve as evidence of their performance before the loan could be granted to them. This means that financial accounting service is a key component in the scheme of this SME. Information technology has been one of the driving forces of every business. It was found that information technology has a positive effect on the financial performance of SMEs. The study is unique in that it gives a successful approach for small and medium-sized businesses in emerging nations to focus more on the function of financial accounting in improving business performance.

Recruitment is one of the most important human resource functions for organizational success and survival. While organizations increasingly use headhunters to recruit employees, little research has focused on client-headhunter relations. This paper draws on agency theory and interviews with 130 contingency-based headhunters and corporate clients to examine clients' opportunistic behaviors and how headhunters sought to mitigate these opportunistic behaviors. Our analysis shows that clients used several headhunters in search assignments, negotiated and refused to pay placement fees, contacted candidates directly, changed search criteria and terminated search assignments, and used headhunters to poach employees from their competitors. Our analysis also shows that headhunters used various social interaction and contract-based approaches to mitigate these behaviors, which affected recruitment-related outcomes. This paper contributes to the literature by providing the first agency theory-based study on clients' opportunist behaviors, bringing principals into agency theory-based research, and showing that clients' opportunism affects recruitment-related outcomes.

Building on qualitative data from 53 interviews with different types of investors and start-ups, we study the financial and non-financial information that different investor types demand to monitor their portfolio start-ups' performance during different lifecycle stages, as well as how entrepreneurs generate and furnish the required information. We specifically show in detail how investors, like venture capitalists, incubators, or business angels, mitigate agency conflicts through the exchange of specific financial and non-financial information, both formally and informally. By directly comparing both investor and investee cases, we provide insight into the monitoring methods common among different investor types and start-ups. While investors consider accounting to be an important part of the relationship, some entrepreneurs do not or set their priorities differently. Our study illustrates that accounting not only plays a crucial role in the management of established businesses, but is equally important in entrepreneurial investment settings, as is financial literacy.

How private firms can overcome their unique governance challenges remains an important but understudied topic. Using novel data on more than 28,000 private firms in India from 1988 to 2017, we examine whether private firms can improve their survival prospects by having board interlocks with public firms and, specifically, interlocks whereby a public firm director subsequently joins the private firm's board. In our data, we found a U-shaped relationship between the number of incoming board interlocks and the probability of private firm exit. We also found that board interlocks formed by public firm directors of public firms audited by Big Four companies improve private firms' survival more than other interlocks, consistent with the notion that such interlocks improve monitoring at private firms. Overall, our study points toward the importance of considering the role of incoming board interlocks when explaining private firm survival. (c) The Author(s) 2023.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the theoretical underpinnings of international financial reporting standards (IFRS)-related studies and offers directions for theoretical and empirical research. Specifically, this study examines the main theories in IFRS adoption research (i.e. adoption, compliance and effects). Design/methodology/approach: The sample contains 67 empirical papers that have used theories and was collected from Web of Science database. This study uses a systematic review technique. Findings: Generally, the review shows the prevalent and pervasive use of institutional theories of isomorphism across all the three areas of IFRS adoption. Particularly, regarding IFRS adoption stream, this study finds the institutional theory as a dominant theory used to explain IFRS diffusion around the globe. For IFRS compliance, this study finds that the agency and the capital need theories are widely used. For IFRS adoption effects stream, this study finds a few studies using the contingency and neo-institutional theories. Overall, the review provides theoretical lens for IFRS adoption, IFRS compliance and IFRS adoption effects. Originality/value: Given the lack of a well-defined set of theories in the domain of accounting, the findings provide further guidance on theory building within the field. Further, accounting regulators, academics and practitioners may benefit from the findings when explaining various changes in the world of accounting. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Influencer marketing continues to be popular with marketing managers because of its effectiveness as a marketing tactic for raising brand awareness and ROI. To date, much of the literature on influencer marketing focused on its benefits, but it also bears potential risks: not all influencer marketing experiences are positive. While influencer marketing is still emerging in the digital space, managers should not forgo supplier managerial principles when hiring influencers. This article provides a checklist to help managers navigate this marketing tactic and avoid potential mistakes by encouraging the same due diligence they would with other suppliers. The checklist asks nine questions during the life cycle of an influencer relationship--including selection, performance and contract management, and reputation management--and is corroborated by the marketing literature but should be applied by managers. To demonstrate this, several case studies were examined in which managers should have considered supplier management when engaging with influencers. By employing the checklist amid influencing marketing efforts, managers can avoid the mistakes identified in the case studies. (c) 2022 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University

Limited research has been conducted on companies' use of share-based payments in a South African context. Where research has been performed, the focus has been predominantly on shared-based payments as part of executive remuneration packages. This paper extends this research by investigating all uses of share-based payments by the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's (JSE) Top 100 companies. A content analysis was used to capture the details of each scheme disclosed by the JSE Top 100 companies. This included at whom the scheme was aimed, the purpose of the scheme, the settlement type, the vesting period and conditions, and whether there had been any modifications or cancellations. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. Results reflected that 93 of the 100 companies investigated made use of share-based payments. Seventy-four per cent of all instruments were equity-settled. The few cash-settled schemes found were primarily used by the Basic Materials and Financials sectors. The average vesting period for all instruments was approximately 4 years, with Black Economic Empowerment-aimed schemes having the longest vesting period at 10 years. Non-market performance conditions were most prevalent at 87% while only 27% included market conditions. Overall, the findings are in line with Agency Theory and prior papers. In addition, this paper found a significant number of modifications and cancellations of instruments. This may be because of poor economic conditions, where reduced economic activity and lower share prices result in share-based payments becoming unfavourable to holders.
