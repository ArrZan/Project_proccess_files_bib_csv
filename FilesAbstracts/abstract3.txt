The yield, plant characteristics (pseudostem height and girth), and relative tolerance to bunch loss of 4 banana varieties (Musa AAA Group, Cavendish subgroup) were studied over 2 crops in the semi-arid subtropics at Carnarvon, Western Australia. The varieties were New Guinea Cavendish, Chinese Cavendish, Hsien.Jen Chiao, and the most widely grown Australian variety, Williams. The marketable yield of Williams was higher (P<0.05) than the mean of the other varieties in the parent crop (70.2 v. 50.7 t/ha) and ratoon 1 crop (65.8 v. 34.4 t/ha). This was the result of lower (P<0.05) bunch loss, about 41% less over the 2 crops, than for the other varieties. Resistance to bunch loss-pseudostem breakage and bunch peduncle snap was not associated with the shorter varieties (New Guinea Cavendish and Chinese Cavendish), but resistance to choke throat was associated with the taller varieties (Williams and Hsien Jen Chiao). © 1992 ASEG.

Banana weevil females laid on an average 2.7 eggs/week in rhizome material and 0.7 eggs/week in pseudostem material in the laboratory. At extremely high weevil population densities the egg‐laying activity declined. Under controlled field conditions 0.7 eggs/week were laid in banana suckers and 1.3 eggs/week in stumps of harvested suckers. 25% of the weevil stages found in suckers in the field were eggs of which 78% were laid in the rhizome and 22% in the pseudostem base. The majority of eggs was deposited in the crown area of the rhizome followed by the remaining surface area of the rhizome, the walls of abandoned larval tunnels in rhizome and pseudostem and the leaf sheaths. 58% of the eggs found were considered accessible to egg predators. 1993 The Netherlands Entomological Society

During examination of banana suckers in western Kenya egg predators of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus were regularly found in the pest's egg‐laying sites, viz. on the surface of the rhizome and the pseudostem base as well as inside abandoned larval tunnels. Under experimental conditions at high pest and predator densities Eutochia pulla (Erichs.) (Col., Tenebrionidae), Euborellia annulipes (Luc.) (Dermapt., Carcinophoridae) and Dactylosternum abdominale (F.) (Col., Hydrophilidae) reduced weevil multiplication in banana suckers through egg predation by 20.5 %, 28 % and 44 %, respectively. D. abdominale was similarly effective also at lower weevil and predator densities.

The influence of windbreak shading was investigated over the plant crop (P) and first ratoon (R1) cycle of bananas cv. Dwarf Cavendish, to quantify its effects on assimilation, phenology and yield in the subtropics. Plants growing under seasonal windbreak shading (late autumn to early spring) were compared with those growing under full sun but under similar windbreak protection. Windbreak shading reduced average photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by 69%, which in turn reduced photosynthesis rate by 27%, transpiration rate by 38% and stomatal conductance by 40% compared with plants growing in full sun. Pseudostem temperature was 2.1 K lower on plants growing in shade. This led to a reduction in monthly leaf emergence rate and an extended cycle time. An additional extension to cycle time was caused by the extra 3.4 leaves produced before flowering on plants growing under windbreak shading. The decreased photosynthesis of leaves growing in shade was partially compensated for in the P cycle by an extended flowering to harvest interval, resulting in no loss of bunch mass. However, bunch mass was significantly reduced in the R1 cycle, when flower to harvest intervals were similar. The most significant effect of windbreak shading was therefore a cumulative 10.6% extension in cycle time over the two crop cycles. The effect of a longer cycle and reduced bunch mass in the R1, caused by windbreak shading, resulted in an overall reduction of 13% in annual yield per ha, compared with plants growing in full sun.

Two bean (Phaseollus vulgaris L.) cultivars, Arroyo Loro and DOR 364, and four lines, 9443-1, 9443-8, 9443-33, 9226-17, were intercropped once or twice with one cycle of plantain cultivar Maricongo at the AES-UPR Corozal substation during 1994-1995. The first cycle of beans intercropped at the time of plantain planting produced a high yield. The second cycle of beans intercropped two months before the termination of plantain harvest yielded poorly. The height of intercropped plantain plants was less than that of non-intercropped plantain plants (P < 0.05) at six months after planting. However, at 12 months, there was no height difference between them. There was no significant difference in diameter of pseudostem, nor in number of leaves, between the intercropped and the non-intercropped plantain plants. Plantain yields, in terms of number of fruits and bunch weight, were not significantly affected by the intercropping (P < 0.05). The highest net income of the intercropping treatment was derived from the first cycle of the bean line 9443-1 ($7,646/ha). This net income represents an additional income of $4,894/ha beyond that of plantain monoculture.

A dwarf variant (TC1-229) of banana resistant to race 4 of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense was identified from a tall, resistant Cavendish cultivar, 'Tai Chiao No. 1'. This study showed that the dwarf characteristic of TC1-229 was retained over 4 clonal generations. Although 3% of tissue-cultured plants of TC1-229 were found to be a tall reversion, the dwarf characteristic of TC1-229 appears to be a relatively stable genetic trait. The average pseudostem height of TC1-229 in the plant crop was 229 cm which was about 62 cm shorter than its source plant. TC1-229 retained the resistance to fusarium wilt in a wide range of environments. Unlike Dwarf Cavendish, the leaf bases of TC1-229 were not crowded and the bunch stalk was normal, thus 'choking' was not observed. This study shows that the step-wise selection of beneficial traits by using somaclonal variation can be useful in banana improvement.

Disease severity associated with the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum is generally thought to be proportional to the population of fungal propagules in the soil. However, results from studies using naturally infested soil are contradictory, implicating host predisposition to disease. In this study, soil was amended with chicken manure to investigate the interdependence between the activity and invasiveness of the pathogen, and the incidence of Panama disease in susceptible banana plantlets. Two soil types naturally infested with either race 1 or race 4 of the pathogen, and cultivars Lady finger and Grande Naine, were used. Pathogen activity was measured by burying root tip segments for 5 days, then calculating the frequency of isolation of Fusarium from the segments. Pathogen invasion was measured by transplanting banana plantlets into trays of amended and unamended soil for 4 weeks, then calculating the frequency of recovery of Fusarium from each pseudostem. Amending both soil types with chicken manure enhanced both pathogen invasion and disease incidence. However, pathogen activity was not correlated with either parameter. We postulate that the addition of chicken manure is predisposing banana plantlets to Panama disease, by reducing the efficacy of the host wound response.

The effects of host and non-host plant odours on the foraging responses of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), were investigated in the laboratory through arena and olfactometer bioassays. Contrary to previous reports that banana rhizome and pseudostem were the most attractive parts to the weevil, dead leaves were most preferred. Comparison of dead banana leaves with dead leaves of other plants showed that attractant odours were present in yam, cocoyam and dead grasses but absent in cocoa and soybean leaves. Complete leaf senescence while the leaf was attached to the mother plant proved necessary for the development of the dead-leaf-based odours but the involvement of microbial organisms could not be demonstrated. It is possible that dead-leaf-based attractants could be used in combination with microbials such as entomogenous fungi and nematodes in integrated management of C. sordidus.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

Two cDNAs, designated MWPL1 and MWPL2, encoding putative pectate lyases (Pel; EC 4.2.2.2), which catalyze the cleavage by β-elimination of α-1 → 4-linked galacturonosyl residues of pectins found mostly in middle lamella and primary cell wall in plants, were isolated from ripening fruit of banana (Musa acuminata) and their expressions in fruit during ripening and in response to ethylene were investigated. MWPL1 and MWPL2 encode a single polypeptide of 407 and 454 amino acid residues, respectively. The two cDNAs shared an overall identity of 75% in both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. Sequence comparison of MWPL1 and other plant Pels revealed the homology ranging from 76% with zinnia to 48% with ragweed. Southern analysis indicated that MWPL1 might be present as a single copy gene, and there might be up to two copies of MWPL2 in the banana genome. The two cDNAs were expressed differentially and/or spatially in various banana organs, with female flower and fruit tissues showing accumulation of the MWPL2 transcript, which was not detected in root, pseudostem, leaf, male flower and ovary, whereas the MWPL1 transcript was not detectable in all organs tested. In fruit tissue during ripening, although transcripts of both members were not detectable in unripe preclimacteric fruits, they began to accumulate as ripening progressed and the level remained high thereafter in overripe fruits. However, the magnitude of transcript accumulation differed between the two Pel members, with substantially more abundant MWPL2 than MWPL1 in ripening fruit. Similar differential transcript accumulation was also observed between peel and pulp, where the former was markedly higher than the latter. Expression of both Pel members was also affected by exogenous ethylene, whose presence at 5-100 ppm stimulated accumulation of MWPL1 and MWPL2 transcripts in preclimacteric fruit, suggesting that ethylene may play an important regulatory role in regulating Pel expression during fruit ripening of the banana.

To compare the mineral nutrition of organically and normally grown banana plants, observations were made on growth and yield of organic banana plants, at the Canary Islands. The data were then discussed opposite the results previously reported for conventional plantations. Materials and methods. Growth parameters (plant height, leaf emission rate, pseudostem circumference) and yield parameters (bunch weight, number of hands, finger grade, etc.) were measured during ten months on an organically grown banana plantation of Dwarf Cavendish cv. Leaf N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn contents were also assessed. Results and discussion. Leaf emission rates showed higher values in late spring and early summer (0.099-0.109 leaf.d-1), while pseudostem circumference grew more in late spring (0.238 cm.d-1) than in summer. In August, pseudostem circumference decreased dramatically, probably because the plants with a larger circumference had flowered before that month and could not be measured. Bunches gave good yields for the zone (43.59 kg on average) and had a high mean number of hands (12.79). Number of fingers of the second upper hand (25.63), their grade (37.63 cm), length (23.50 cm) and weight (165.19 g) ranged from normal to high. Month of harvesting influenced yield and quality of the fruits. Leaf content of N, P, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn fell within the normal range related to the conventionally grown banana plants. Potassium foliar content showed low levels but not deficiencies, whereas Ca leaf concentrations were high but not excessive. No relationship was found among leaf nutrient levels and growth, yield and fruit quality parameters. © 2001 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

An experiment was established to characterize twenty-seven locally selected and introduced plantain clones. The clones were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Twenty morphological descriptors were used to obtain information of the plant, bunch and individual fruits at bunch-emergence and at harvest. The clones were first organized into two main groups on the basis of their genomic constitution: true plantain (Musa AAB) and cooking banana (Musa ABB, AAAB). Within the second group, we included three Musa AAB clones that are considered distinctive cooking bananas because the M. acuminata species responsible for the donation of the A genome had its origin in the Pacific and not in Asia. In each main group the clones were subdivided into true-horn, false-horn and French on the basis of bunch phenotype. Clones in these three subgroups were further subdivided into tall and dwarf, depending on the height of the pseudostem. After the clones were organized into this classification, statistical comparisons were made between or among those corresponding to the same subdivision, utilizing the data obtained from the plant, bunch and individual fruit traits. This scheme is easy to implement in the field, provides for the clustering and separation of clones regardless of their geographical origin and common names, and offers the opportunity for agronomists and horticulturists to learn about the economic potential of the clones from the outset. The application of this scheme will allow the number of plantain accessions in the TARS collection to be reduced from 27 to 20 clones.

The spatial location of the banana (Musa AAA) root parasitic nematodes within three root parts considering two root thickness was determined in three commercial farm management systems, which differ in weed and nematode management. Roots in each farm management system were classified in thick (>5 mm-d) and thin (1 ≤ 5 mm-d) roots. From each root type, the epidermis, the cortical parenchyma (CP) and the vascular cylinder (VC) were separated by fingernail, and nematodes were extracted by maceration of each root part. Independent of the farm management system, and for either root thickness, highest numbers of Radopholus similis per gram of root was found in the CP, followed by the epidermis and VC. The highest number of Helicotylencus spp., Pratylenchus spp. and the total nematode population per gram of root was found in the epidermis. Considering the number of nematodes per root part, the highest number of R. similis and total nematodes was located in the CP, while Helicotylenchus spp. and Pratylenchus spp. were concentrated in the epidermis. These patterns were approximately reproduced in the two root thickness and in the three farm management systems. This behavior suggests that injection of systemic nematicides into the plant pseudostem to replace the granular applications on surface soil might be promissory. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Sterility has profound effects on the development of reproductive tissues in members of the Musaceae and limits genetic improvement required to deal with new diseases. Ovules of seeded diploid Musa acuminata (AA) and edible triploids (AAA) from the same cytogenetic group, plus edible triploids containing genomes of the M. balbisiana cytogenetic group (AAB, ABB) and the related genus Ensete sp. were studied to determine the effects of sterility on the growth and development of the ovule and its tissues. Specimens were collected from subtropical and Mediterranean environments in Australia. At anthesis, the ovules of triploid plants were 36% larger than the ovules of diploid plants. The diploid ovules ceased growth shortly after the inflorescence emerged from the pseudostem. In contrast, the triploid ovules continued to grow 7-10 days past anthesis, increasing in size by 70%. All ovules of diploid M. acuminata ssp. had an embryo sac at anthesis, against 97% for triploids. At anthesis the embryo sacs in diploid ovules occupied 2.7% of the nucellus compared with 1.5% in triploid ovules. The embryo sacs did not grow between bunch emergence and anthesis, once formed they maintained the same size. Many embryo sacs were not positioned correctly, flush with the nucellar cap. The diploid M. acuminata ssp. had 75% of embryo sacs correctly positioned against 10% in the edible triploids. The proportion of balbisiana genome (B) did not affect ovule or nucellus size or shape, or cell number across the nucellus. It increased the embryo sac presence 96-100% of ovules. The sterile edible triploid bananas have embryo sacs at anthesis but many are incorrectly positioned, which may contribute to their sterility. The balbisiana genome in the edible triploids was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the number of correctly positioned embryo sacs and this may contribute to the increased fertility associated with the B genome. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A morphological variant obtained from in vitro corm-derived plants of banana (Musa sp.) cv. Grande Naine (AAA) was evaluated up to harvest, and the genetic basis of variation was confirmed by the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The corms formed during the multiplication phase of shoot tip-derived cultures of the cv. Grande Naine grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium enriched with 13.3 μM N6-benzyladenine (BA) developed numerous morphological variants after transfer to MS medium with 6.66 μM BA. The variant designated as CUDBT-B1, with distinct morphological features, was further evaluated. The morphological features of CUDBT-B1 were variegated leaf, pseudostem, bracts, ovary of the male flower and fruits, reduced height, decreased lamina length and breadth, and early flowering. These features were also manifested in the second-cycle progeny of CUDBT-B1. RAPD assay showed a marker DNA band of 1650 bp, and differential band intensity between the CUDBT-B1 and normal clone. CUDBT-B1 was multiplied using shoot tip culture, and the shoots were rooted on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 2.69 μM α-naphthaleneacetic acid.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

Plantain production (Musa spp.) in Central and South America and the Caribbean is affected by bacterial diseases. In Puerto Rico, production of the plantain 'Hua Moa' is affected by a condition known as bunch abortion or 'choke neck'. This condition in some cases is accompanied by soft rot symptoms and therefore could be related to phytopathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacteria related to the soft rot tissues on plants affected with the bunch abortion symptoms and determine their virulence in other clones of plantain and banana. Bacterial colonies were isolated from pseudostems of Hua Moa at three locations in Puerto Rico, using semi-selective and nutritive agar media. The pathogenicity was determined by using potato and plantain pseudostem discs in humid chambers under in vitro conditions. Pathogenic bacteria were identified by using the BIOLOG® system. Under greenhouse conditions, the virulence of Burkholderia gladioli, Pseudomonas spinosa, Erwinia chrysanthemi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was confirmed on plantain (Maricongo, FIAH-121, Enano Común, and Hua Moa) and banana (Grand Nain) using a scale from 1 to 9. All clones evaluated under greenhouse conditions were susceptible to E. chrysanthemi, potential causal agent of soft rot in Hua Moa plantain once the bunch abortion appears. Burkholderia gladioli is reported for the first time affecting plantain and banana.This bacterium was more virulent in Hua Moa and Grand Nain clones with severity of 7 and 5, respectively, than in Maricongo, severity 3. Pseudomonas spinosa and P. aeruginosa produced less damage with severity less than 4, than E. chrysanthemi and B. gladioli with severity greater than 4. This research was conducted under in vitro and greenhouse conditions and demonstrates that the most important bacteria causing soft rot in plants with the choke neck condition are E. chrysanthemi and B. gladioli. It is recommended to conduct field studies using plants up to the reproductive stage to determine whether these bacteria are also related as causal agents of the choke neck.

An agronomic study was conducted to evaluate three Musa hybrids (BITA-3 - cooking banana, FHIA-21 and CRBP-39- both hybrid plantains) with five hundred farmers in the two Assin districts in the Central region of Ghana. At harvest sensory evaluation was carried out on the three hybrids for use as fufu, ampesi and ripe fried plantain to access their acceptability at four locations in the two districts. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p<0.05) between the numbers of leaves at flowering among the hybrids across the locations. The hybrids showed superiority over the local check in terms of number of functional leaves from flowering to harvest. All the hybrids (FHIA-21, CRBP 39, BITA-3 and FHIA-25) exhibited stable performance in yield and growth characteristics across the locations. FHIA-25 was however late maturing (18-20 months) whereas BITA-3 was early maturing (10-12 months). Nevertheless, the bunch weight (40-50 kg) of FHIA-25 could be said to have compensated for the long crop cycle. Daughter sucker production by FHIA-25 was also low (two daughter suckers at flowering). BITA-3 was roboust and sturdy with pseudostem girth of 60 cm carrying an average bunch weight of 25 kg. All the hybrids were resistant to the black Sigatoka disease. These results suggested that the performance of the hybrids was not influenced by the seasons or locations. It implies that under good management practices, farmers would be assured of good yields irrespective of time or season of planting so long as there is adequate supply of moisture. The results of the sensory evaluation indicated that there were no significant differences (p<0.01) between FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 and the local Apantu across the location, across the parameters and the recipes assessed. FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 were the most prefened and compared favourably with the local triploids (Apantu and Apem) with BITA-3 the least preferred. The hybrids were accepted for ripe fried plantain at stages 3 and 4 of ripening. Beyond these stages of ripening, the hybrids could only be used for other processed food recipes. © 2008 Academic Journals Inc.

World production of bananas, estimated at 106 million tons (Lescot 2006), ranks fourth in agricultural production. Bananas make up the largest production of fruits and the largest international trade, more than apple, orange, grape and melon. Bananas are cultivated in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical zones on 5 continents. Banana products represent an essential food resource and have an important socioeconomic and ecological role. Current varieties are generally seedless triploid clones either of the single genome A from the species Musa acuminata (group AAA) or of both genomes A and B from species M. acuminata and Musa balbisiana (groups AAB and ABB). More rarely, diploid varieties (AA and AB) and tetraploid clones are encountered. There are two major channels of banana production: those cultivated for export and those reserved for local markets. The main banana varieties cultivated for export, known as Grande Naine, Poyo and Williams, belong to the monospecific triploid bananas (AAA) of the Cavendish sub-group. They differ from each other only in somatic mutations such as plant height or bunch and fruit shape. Their production relies on an intensive monoculture of the agro-industrial type, without rotation, and a high quantity of inputs. Banana cultivation for local consumption is based on a large number of varieties adapted to different conditions of production as well as the varied uses and tastes of consumers. Diploid bananas, close to the ancestral wild forms, are still cultivated in Southeast Asia. In other regions, triploid clones belonging to different sub-groups Plantain, Silk, Lujugira, Gros Michel, Pisang Awak are the most widely distributed. Bananas have many uses. They are not only consumed as fresh fruits but also cooked, like plantains. They are processed in various ways, into chips, fries, fritters, purees, jams, ketchup and alcohol (banana wine and beer have a very significant production in East Africa). The daily per capita consumption of bananas from 30 g to over 500 g in some East African countries. Apart from the fruit, other parts of the plant are also used: the pseudostem is used for its fibres and as floaters (Musa textilis or abacá) in the Philippines, and the leaves are used to make shelters or roofs or as wraps for cooking. In Thailand, the floral buds of particular varieties (Pisang Awak) are used in various culinary preparations. Some varieties are also considered to have medicinal properties. Cultivated throughout the world, bananas are threatened by several diseases and pests (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Jones 1999) that need to be taken into account for banana improvement. Various major fungal diseases are constraints in industrial production and, to a lesser degree, in local production. For example, Sigatoka disease (SD) due to Mycosphaerella musicola and black leaf streak disease (BLSD) caused by M. fijiensis result in production losses in large industrial plantations and necessitate costly pest control measures to be adopted. In certain production zones, Fusarium wilt due to the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense prevents the cultivation of susceptible varieties like the Gros Michel types. Great constraints are also exerted by the nematodes Radopholus similis and several representatives of the genus pratylenchus and by the black weevil of banana, Cosmopolites sordidus. Also, viral diseases are spreading. Those of greatest concern are due to BBTV (banana bunchy top virus), CMV (cucumber mosaic virus), BSV (banana streak virus) and BBMV (banana bract mosaic virus). Chemical control measures used in intensive cultivation are not available to small banana farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, for some diseases, there is no effective chemical control. Genetic improvement has thus been focused mainly on obtaining varieties resistant to principal pests and diseases. Breeding bananas through hybridisation, which began in the 1920s, is currently being pursued at seven research centres. FHIA in Honduras is breeding banana for export as well as the cooking types (Rowe 1984). EMBRAPA-CNPMF in Brazil (Dantas et al. 1993), NRCB and TNAU in India (Sathiamoorthy et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy and Kumar 2004) aim at breeding local types of dessert and cooking bananas. CARBAP (Jenny et al. 2003) in Cameroon and IITA (Tenkouano and Swennen 2004) in Nigeria are conducting research on plantain and banana breeding in Africa. These six research centres are mainly interested in developing new tetraploid varieties by crossing triploid varieties and wild or improved diploid clones with resistance to diseases. Some secondary triploids derived from crosses between these new tetraploid varieties and other diploid clones were also obtained. In the French West Indies, CIRAD has conceived another crossing strategy aimed at the development of triploid varieties directly from diploid plant material (Bakry et al. 2001). Since the 1980s, apart from these conventional breeding approaches, other groups have focused on mutagenesis as at IAEA (Roux 2004) in Austria or on the selection of somaclonal variants as at TBRI (Hwang and Ko 1990) in Taiwan. These technologies appeared as a result of the development of in vitro culture techniques designed for rapid industrial multiplication of micro-propagated banana plants. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

Purpose of review: This article reviews some of the versatile postharvest uses of plantains and other components of plantain plants. Findings: Plantain belongs to the Musacace family and is cultivated in over 120 countries. Many African, Asian and Latin American countries depend primarily on the plantain plant for sustainability. Mature plantains are consumed as a staple on cooking, while overripe fruit is consumed in raw form. Plantains are rich in iron, potassium, ascorbic acid and vitamin A, and are a very good source of starch, which has various uses, such as in functional foods and edible films. In addition to plantains being used for food, the waste material such as the peel, pseudo-stem, pith, male bud and leaves, have also been used as food and feed, as well as for other special purposes in most of the plantain-growing parts of the world. Directions for future research: A plantain-based diet can be designed for diabetic people based on its low glycaemic index. Moreover, due to its high starch content and cheaper cost, it has the potential to be added to other fruit-based juices and beverages as starch filler. Further research can be done on deflavouring of plantain, which might overwhelm other fruit based beverages when added as a filler. Since most of the parts of the plantain plant have some or other therapeutic value, further research can be done to extract the phytochemicals for potential drug development.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

The infection of banana by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) can result in variable disease development, ranging from no symptoms to severe rotting and wilting. Understanding the infection process of Foc is a prerequisite for effective control and management of this disease. To visualise the infection process, we used a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged strain of tropical race 4 of Foc and characterised early events in infection and disease development in Cavendish plantlets. With fluorescence microscopy, the labelled strain was observed to infect roots, colonise the root mesocotyl and, finally, the plant pseudostem. These studies indicated that the preferential colonisation sites on the root surface were grooves along the junction of the epidermal cells. This resulted in mosaic patterns of infection that developed after specific epidermal and cortical cells were infected by intercellular hyphae, while surrounding cells remained free of fungus. Finally, hyphae developed inside xylem vessels of fully colonised, rotted roots. Specific infection structures, such as appressoria, were not observed. These observations clarify events that occur after Cavendish is infected by this important pathogen and provide new clues to explore infection mechanisms of Foc. More detailed knowledge of the host-pathogen interaction could help develop more efficient ways to control the disease.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Fungal diseases of banana can be classed into diseases of the foliage, diseases of the root, corm and pseudostem and diseases of the fruit, including those at post harvest, such as anthracnose. Of these, the most important are the fungal disease of the foliage caused by black sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and the wilt disease of the pseudostem caused by the four races of Panama disease (Fusarium oxysporum fm sp cubense). The monoculture of dessert bananas for urban consumption and the export trade has facilitated the spread of black sigatoka, such that serial applications of fungicides are obligatory in most production areas of the world. In addition, the production of susceptible plantains by smallholders has become unsustainable in many areas due to high costs and difficulty in applying fungicides without the use of airplanes. After the advent of Panama disease in the 20th century, wilt resistant Cavendish dessert bananas replaced the susceptible banana 'Gros Michel' as the principal bananas in the export trade; however, these plantations are now threatened by a new race of Panama disease (Tropical race 1V) which is now present and spreading in S.E. Asia. Here we review the most significant advances in both basic and applied scientific understanding of these two disease complexes which have been made in the last two decades. A full review of fungal diseases (of which there are more than 40) which affect bananas and plantains has been given in Jones [2000]. The present review deals with advances in research into the two most important diseases, black sigatoka (causal agent Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt tropical race 4 (Fusarium oxysporum f sp cubense). © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Anã' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Anã' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Anã' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Anã' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Anã' cultivar.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

Background:Fusarium wilt, caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), is one of the most destructive diseases of banana. Toxins produced by Foc have been proposed to play an important role during the pathogenic process. The objectives of this study were to investigate the contamination of banana with toxins produced by Foc, and to elucidate their role in pathogenesis.Methodology/Principal Findings:Twenty isolates of Foc representing races 1 and 4 were isolated from diseased bananas in five Chinese provinces. Two toxins were consistently associated with Foc, fusaric acid (FA) and beauvericin (BEA). Cytotoxicity of the two toxins on banana protoplast was determined using the Alamar Blue assay. The virulence of 20 Foc isolates was further tested by inoculating tissue culture banana plantlets, and the contents of toxins determined in banana roots, pseudostems and leaves. Virulence of Foc isolates correlated well with toxin deposition in the host plant. To determine the natural occurrence of the two toxins in banana plants with Fusarium wilt symptoms, samples were collected before harvest from the pseudostems, fruit and leaves from 10 Pisang Awak 'Guangfen #1' and 10 Cavendish 'Brazilian' plants. Fusaric acid and BEA were detected in all the tissues, including the fruits.Conclusions/Signficance:The current study provides the first investigation of toxins produced by Foc in banana. The toxins produced by Foc, and their levels of contamination of banana fruits, however, were too low to be of concern to human and animal health. Rather, these toxins appear to contribute to the pathogenicity of the fungus during infection of banana plants.

To evaluate the effect of the time of storage of propagation material on growth and production of plantain, corms were extracted from healthy plants and were peeled to eliminate roots and necrosed tissue. The half of themwas submerged during 60 minutes in a solution on basis of 15g of Carbofuran an 20g of Manzate in 10 L of water, after which, all of the corms, chemically treated and non-treated, were disposed on de soiland covered with plantain fresh leaves.Each week, during a period of 6 weeks, the required quantity of corms was taken to be planted at 3m between rows and 2m between plants in an experimental design of split plots, with four replicates and 10 plants per replication. At flowering registers of plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of functional leaves and the youngest spotted leaf were made; at harvest bunch weight was registered and the average finger weight was calculated. It was found thatstorage of the corm reduces plant growth but not affect the Sigatokas' severity; that bunch and finger weights are severe and significantly reduced and that corm preventive treatment has positive effects on plant growth and production but not reduces the damage caused by propagation material storage.

Occurrence of multiple male buds in banana is a rare phenomenon. It is caused by branching of the peduncle or differentiation of the male flower into male bud. Five types of peduncle branching occur, viz.: (i) inside the pseudostem, (ii) at the time the peduncle emerges from the pseudostem, (iii) after the peduncle emerges from the pseudostem but before fruit development, (iv) during fruit development, and (v) after fruit development. Mostly, branching is accidental, except for that produced by 'Double Mahoi' cultivar that always produces two or three bunches per pseudostem, which is inherited. Differentiation of male flower into male bud in banana is the world's first reported case. It has been found in four accessions of probably the same clone of Musa acuminata subsp. siamea cultivated by the Hmong hill-tribe villagers living on the highlands in northern Thailand as an idol of worship to obtain prolific babies as well as to obtain more male buds as food for nursing mother. After a brief female phase with almost no fruit developed, numerous male flowers, instead of withering and dropping, differentiate into male buds with long rachilla. Close to a hundred small male buds may be produced on a single pseudostem, thus the name 'Kluai Roi Pli' (banana having hundred male buds) has been given to this clone of banana. A single, normal-sized terminal male bud continues to produce male flowers, which may or may not differentiate into male buds. The values of multiple male buds are: (1) to satisfy curiosity, (2) as educational material, (3) as an idol for worship, (4) as ornamental plant, and (5) economic gain of increasing overall yield, number of fruits and male buds, and size and length of fruits.

The objective of this study was to agronomically characterize plants from induced chromosome doubling experiments in the Pisang Lilin parthenocarpic banana accession to select genotypes that will be used as 2n gamete donors in crosses with improved diploids to generate secondary triploids. Twenty-two plants were evaluated, of which 17 were autotetraploids. Compared with the original diploids, the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids showed significant increases in the plant height, number of living leaves at flowering and harvest, pseudostem diameter, and length and diameter of fruits; the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids also exhibited greater fruit and bunch weights compared with the original diploids. In addition, all autotetraploid plants did not exhibit any symptoms of yellow Sigatoka. Female fertility was also detected, as some plants produced seeds, indicating that they can be used as female parents. Therefore, the autotetraploids characterized in this study exhibited useful agronomical traits to be used as 2n gamete donors for generating secondary triploids. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Introduction. Mycosphaerella fijiensis, the fungal pathogen causing Black Sigatoka disease, attacks almost all cultivars of bananas and plantains. Currently, the repeated application of fungicides is the most widespread control measure, while the use of bio-control agents remains almost ignored. Here we investigated, under in vitro culture conditions, whether an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF - Rhizophagus irregularis MUCL 41833) could reduce the severity of disease caused by M. fijiensis MUCL 47740 on banana. Materials and methods. Prior to their transfer to autotrophic in vitro culture systems and subsequent inoculation by the pathogen, the banana plantlets cultivar Grande Naine (AAA genome Cavendish group) were grown in the extra-radical mycelium network of the AMF, arising from Medicago truncatula plantlets, for fungal root colonization. Results and discussion. At the time of infection with M. fijiensis, the AMF colonization of the banana plantlets was 12%, 56% and 10% for hyphae, arbuscules and spores/vesicles, respectively, and the number of spores produced in the medium was above 200. At day 21 and day 35 following infection by the pathogen, the number of extra-radical spores as well as the abundance of arbuscules in roots, were significantly higher than in the non-infected plantlets. Conversely, the severity index measured in the mycorrhizal plantlets decreased by more than 80% and 60%, respectively, 21 and 35 days after infection by the pathogen. Similarly, the area under disease progress curve, estimated at day 35, was reduced by 59% in the mycorrhizal banana plantlets as compared to the control plantlets. Whatever the treatment (mycorrhizal or non mycorrhizal plantlets in presence/absence of M. fijiensis), no significant differences were observed in plantlet dry weight, pseudostem height and diameter, and leaf area at both observation times. Conclusions. These results emphasize the complex multitrophic interactions between above and below-ground microorganisms mediated via the plant. They further suggest that AMF may decrease, at least at the early stage of infection, M. fijiensis symptoms possibly via the induction of a systemic resistance pathway. The important decrease in symptoms observed in the mycorrhizal banana plantlets suggest that these microorganisms may represent a potentially attractive option to consider in the context of an integrated control of this important disease. © Cirad / EDP Sciences 2015.

Bacterial diseases of bananas and enset have not received, until recently, an equal amount of attention compared to other major threats to banana production such as the fungal diseases black leaf streak (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense). However, bacteria cause significant impacts on bananas globally and management practices are not always well known or adopted by farmers. Bacterial diseases in bananas and enset can be divided into three groups: (1) Ralstoniaassociated diseases (Moko/Bugtok disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and banana blood disease caused by R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis); (2) Xanthomonas wilt of banana and enset, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum and (3) Erwinia-associated diseases (bacterial head rot or tip-over disease Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi), bacterial rhizome and pseudostem wet rot (Dickeya paradisiaca formerly E. chrysanthemi pv. paradisiaca). Other bacterial diseases of less widespread importance include: bacterial wilt of abaca, Javanese vascular wilt and bacterial fingertip rot (probably caused by Ralstonia spp., unconfirmed). This review describes global distribution, symptoms, pathogenic diversity, epidemiology and the state of the art for sustainable disease management of the major bacterial wilts currently affecting banana and enset. © 2017 Blomme, Dita, Jacobsen, Pérez Vicente, Molina, Ocimati, Poussier and Prior.

Ethnopharmacological relevance Musa acuminata, the wild species of banana is a plant of the tropical and subtropical regions. Over the past few decades, the health benefits of M. acuminata have received much attention. All parts of the plant including fruits, peel, pseudostem, corm, flowers, leaves, sap and roots have found their use in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. Literature review have indicated use of M. acuminata in the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cough, bronchitis, dysentery, allergic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and some of the non-communicable diseases. The reported pharmacological activities of M. acuminata include antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic, anticancer, and antimicrobial especially anti-HIV activity. This review presents information on the phytochemicals and pharmacological studies to validate the traditional use of different parts of M. acuminata in various diseases and ailments. A comprehensive assessment of the biological activities of M. acuminata extracts is included and possible mechanisms and phytochemicals involved have also been correlated to provide effective intervention strategies for preventing or managing diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was performed on M. acuminata using ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, local magazines, unpublished materials, and scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The Plant List, Promusa, Musalit, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases were used to validate the scientific names and also provide information on the subspecies and cultivars of M. acuminata. Result and discussion The edible part of M. acuminata provides energy, vitamins and minerals. All other parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. The rich diversity of phytochemicals present in them probably contributes to their beneficial effects, and validates the role of M. acuminata plant parts used by various tribes and ethnic groups across the geographical areas of the world. Conclusion This review presents information on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of M. acuminata plant parts. Pharmacological studies support the traditional uses of the plant, and probably validate the uses of M. acuminata by the indigenous people to treat and heal many infections and diseases. Some studies on animal models have been carried out, which also provide evidence of efficacy of the M. acuminata plant as a therapeutic agent. These observations suggest that M. acuminata plant parts possesses pluripharmacological properties, and can be used in designing potent therapeutic agents. However, individual bioactive constituent(s) from different parts of this plant need further investigations to confirm various pharmacological claims, and to explore the potential of M. acuminata in the development of drugs and use in functional foods. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

Soil management offers various options to alleviate the effects of Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) in bananas. Nevertheless, it receives little attention as a strategy in Fusarium wilt management. Literature provides ample evidence linking soil conditions such as soil texture and fertility to the spread and severity of plant diseases. However, the inconsistency of results between case studies limits the attention of soil management in crop disease management. The present study aimed at unravelling the role of soil abiotic factors on nutrient concentrations in plant tissue, biomass production and the incidence of Fusarium wilt (Foc race 1) in bananas (‘Gros Michel’, AAA) under field conditions. A large field trial was established in which the effects of soil pH and nutrients (N, Ca, Mg and Mn) were studied. Around 30% of the plants showed symptoms of Fusarium wilt at flowering in the first season. However, Fusarium wilt incidence did not vary between treatments. Soil pH showed significant interactions with soil N and Mn concentrations resulting in a lower bunch weight and increased micronutrient concentrations in the pseudostem. With a higher pH, bunch weight increased, although higher Mn concentrations suppressed this positive effect. Interactions between a high soil pH and Ca and Mg resulted in a higher bunch weight and lower micronutrient concentrations in the pseudostem. The results can be used to develop soil management strategies for improving banana productivity in infected plantations. © International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

Organic banana (Musa sp.) is one of the most important export crops in Peru, especially in the Department of Piura. The cultivation of the crop is mainly affected by biotic factors, resulting in important economic losses. The aim of this research was to characterize the causal agent of banana bacteriosis disease in Piura. Bacterial isolates were extracted from rhizome and pseudostem samples of organic bananas with typical symptoms of soft rot from different banana growing areas of Piura. Sixty colonies were obtained, while 10 isolates were selected for presenting cultural and morphological characteristics similar to those of Pectobacterium (01MB, 04MB, 05MB, 06MB and 10MB) and Dickeya (02MB, 03MB, 08MB, 07MB and 09MB); different biochemical and molecular tests were conducted. The pathogenicity of the isolates was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo inoculation of rhizome pieces and pseudostems from cultivated plants. The 10 isolates were gram negative and with perimeter flagella. The biochemical tests showed that all the isolates were positive on nutrient agar medium, Mac Conkey, catalase, gelatin hydrolysis and growth at 37°C, whereas they were negative on King’s B medium, nitrate reductase and oxidase tests. Isolates 02MB, 03MB, 08MB, 07MB and 09MB also tested positive for erythromycin and indole, while isolates 01MB, 04MB, 05MB, 06MB and 10MB were positive for CVP (Crystal violet pectate). Molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that isolates 01MB, 04MB, 05MB and 10MB corresponded to Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum; isolates 03MB and 08MB corresponded to Dickeya chrysanthemi; and 02MB and 07MB corresponded to Dickeya paradisiaca and Klebsiella variicola, respectively. It was concluded that rhizome and pseudostem wet rot of banana grown organically in Piura is caused by the bacterial complex formed by P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, D. chrysanthemi, D. paradisiaca and K. variicola. This is valuable information for the implementation of appropriate disease management practices in the area. © 2022 Universidad de Concepcion. All rights reserved.
