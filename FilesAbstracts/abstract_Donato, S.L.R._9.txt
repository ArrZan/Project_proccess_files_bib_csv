The objective of this work was to evaluate the phytotechnical behavior of 'Prata-Anã' banana and four progeny hybrids, during two production cycles, in the Perímetro Irrigado do Estreito, southwest of Bahia state, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized with fi ve treatments: cultivar 'Prata-Anã' and the hybrids Fhia-01 (BRS Fhia Maravilha), BRS Fhia-18, Fhia 18 and PA42-44, with ten replicates. Phenotypic vegetative descriptors, cycle length and yield were measured. Increases occurred between cycles for: plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of hands and fruits, and yield. The Fhia-18 hybrid showed greater size and pseudostem perimeter, and 'Prata-Anã' had the smallest, (with maintenance of this character in the PA42-44). The hybrids were similar in the number of suckers produced. BRS Fhia-18, PA42-44 and Fhia-1 were early for harvest and had greater fruit length than 'Prata-Anã'. Fhia-18 produced more fruit and PA42-44 had fewer hands compared to the parental cultivar. BRS Fhia-18, Fhia-18 and Fhia-1 are more productive than the parental cultivar. 'Prata-Anã' is more susceptible to yellow sigatoka, while PA42-44 is resistant, with greater retention of leaves at harvest; however, both have similar yields.

The purpose of this research was to assess the plants growth and production of genotypes of 4 genomic groups of banana: 'Nanicão-IAC-2001', 'Grande Naine', 'Caipira' and 'Nam' (AAA); 'Maçã', 'Thap Maeo', 'Prata Anã' and 'Prata Zulu' (AAB); 'FHIA 01', 'FHIA 18', 'Prata Graúda' and 'Maçã Tropical' (AAAB), in Botucatu, state of São Paulo, Brazil. Some growth characteristics were evaluated such as: plant height, the pseudostem circumference, number of leaves, number of days between planting and flowering, number of days between flowering and harvest and number of days from planting to harvest. The production characteristics such as the bunch weight, number of fruits, average weight of the fruits, number of hands and weight, number, length and diameter of the fruits of the 2nd hand and yield. The results indicated that in the group AAA, 'Nanicão' showed good characteristics regarding to growth and production. However, 'Grande Naine' had the highest values in productive terms. 'Nam' showed the lowest height and the shortest cycle, but it had low productive values. Regarding to the group AAB, 'Prata Zulu' showed the biggest pseudostem circumference, good productive characteristics, but it had the longest cycle and the highest height. 'Thap Maeo' stands out as it shows good production characteristics. 'Prata Anã' had the lowest height and the shortest cycle. However, it did not have a good productive performance. In relation to the group AAAB, 'FHIA 01' showed the highest values in most of the characteristics which were evaluated, standing out among the other hybrids. We can conclude that 'Grande Naine' stands out inside the group AAA, 'Thap Maeo' and 'Prata Zulu' inside the group AAB and 'FHIA 01' inside the group AAAB.

The goal of this work was to make a agronomical evaluation of the vegetative characteristics and income of five cultivars of banana type Plantain, in the first production cycle under irrigation in the semi-arid conditions of the region of the city of Guanambi - Bahia State. Relevant phenotypic descriptors were used for the identification and selection of individuals with superior characteristics, so as to make available to the producers of the perimeters of irrigation an alternative for the diversification of the banana crops. The evaluated genotypes AAB were the varieties Terra, Terra-Maranhão, Terrinha and D'Angola and the hybrid AAAB: FHIA-21. The following characteristics were analyzed: number of days from the sowing to the flowering and to the harvest, height of the plant, perimeter of the pseudostem, number of alive leaves at flowering and harvest, gap flowering-harvest, weight of the bunch, of the peduncle and of the hands, number of hands and fruits per bunch, length and diameter of the fruit. The procedure employed was randomized blocks, with five treatments, consisting of the cultivars AAB: Terra, Terra-Maranhão, Terrinha and D'Angola and the hybrid AAAB: FHIA-21, and five repetitions. Each plot was comprised by 20 plants: four rows of five plants, with six useful plants in the spacing of 3,0 m x 3,0 m. Terra and Terra Maranhão were the most productive varieties, however, with larger load and late cycles. The hybrid FHIA-21 and the varieties Terrinha and D'Angola showed a larger number of living leaves in the harvest. The variety D'Angola presented the smallest productivity between the evaluated cultivars.

The objective of the present study was to select diploids (AA) hybrids of banana based on three non-parametric indices as to guide the selection and increase the use of the variability present in the Banana Germplasm Bank of Embrapa Cassava and Tropical Fruits. Eleven hybrids were evaluated in random blocks with four replicates. The plots consisted of six plants spaced 2.5 m × 2.5 m whereas the border rows were from the Pacovan cultivar. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle from planting to bunch emission, presence of pollen, number of hands, number of fruits, fruit length and yellow-Sigatoka resistance. The average of these ten characteristics was used for calculating the multiplicative indices of sum of classification and genotype-ideotype distance. The two hybrids presenting best global performance SH3263 and 1318-01 ranked respectively, first and second by the multiplicative indices and sum of classification whereas the genotype-ideotype distance index ranked them first and fourth. Although in general, all three indexes presented good coherence between general performance of the hybrids and their classification, the multiplicative and sum of classification indexes provided a more adequate classification of these hybrids.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of Prata banana plants during three production cycles, under different irrigation systems, in semi-arid conditions. A randomized block design was adopted with six treatments, in a 3×2 factorial arrangement: three irrigation systems - conventional sprinkler, microsprinkler and drip - and two genotypes - 'Prata-Anã' and its hybrid PA42-44. Four replicates in plots with six useful plants were used. Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of alive leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area, and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. Weight of bunch and hands, mean weight of hands, weight of the three first hands, number of hands and fruits per bunches, and weight, length and diameter of fruits and number of alive leaves were evaluated during the harvest season. The drip irrigation system provides smaller vigor to banana Prata, in comparison to conventional and to micro sprinkler systems, as can be seen by the size and perimeter of the pseudostem. The cultivar Prata-Anã shows a larger number of fruit and hands per brunch, while its hybrid PA42-44 shows larger weight, length and fruit diameter.

The fertilization with micronutrients is poorly studied for banana production, especially boron (B) application, which affects the development of apical meristems. This experiment aimed to study responses of B fertilization with different rates and application methods in banana plant 'Grande Naine'. The experimental design was in randomized block and factorial scheme with three rates (0.85, 1.70 and 3.40 g plant-1) and three fertilizer application methods (soil, leaves and tiller hole chopped) and a control, without B application, using boric acid as the source of B. Treatments effects were evaluated by B availability on soil, plant grown, plant nutritional status and by the yield. Treatments effects were submitted to variance analysis and when significant it was adjusted by regression equations. The B application on soil and in the leaves increased this micronutrient content in topsoil (between 1.0-1.5 mg kg-1, with the highest rate of the nutrient) and a corresponding increase up the soil layer to 20-40 cm, as a result of leaching. The contribution of foliar fertilization increasing the content in the soil was due to the washing and by draining the fertilizer solution from the leaves to the soil surface. Moreover, there was no effect of B availability in the soil when the fertilizer was applied in the tiller hole chopped (~0.3 mg kg-1 of B). It was also verified that there were no effects of B application on banana plant growth (height and pseudostem diameter) at the blooming stage. In leaf samples, collected each 15 days, it was observed that when the micronutrient was applied in the tiller hole chopped, leaf B concentration was higher and lasted up for one month. However, in the last foliar sampling (at blooming) it was observed that there was no effect of application methods on leaf B concentration (~20 mg kg-1). There were no effects of fertilization in yield according to rates and application methods of B, but the application on the tiller hole chopped promoted an increased accumulation of this micronutrient in the bunch due to the applied rates. Under the conditions of this experiment, it can be concluded that B application did not influenced the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' according to the rates and application methods of this micronutrient.

The information of a plant root distribution allows defining regions of soil around it suitable for fertilizer application and for sensor placement in order to improve irrigation schedule. The present study had as objective to evaluate root system distribution of banana cv.'Prata-Anã' irrigated by different systems, during the second production cycle. The experiment followed a random block design in a split split-plot scheme with three replications in which the variation sources consisted of three irrigation systems (drip, microsprinkler and conventional sprinkler), six distances from plant (0.15; 0.30; 0.45; 0.60; 0.75 e 1.00 m) and five soil depths (0.0 -0.20; 0.20 -0.40; 0.40-0.60; 0.60 -0.80 and 0.80-1.00 m). The banana root system remained near-surface soil, with its 80% at 0.61 m, 0.51 m and 0.61 m depth and at effective distance of 0.63 m, 0.66 m 0.79 m from the pseudostem for irrigation systems, drip micro sprinkler and conventional sprinkler, respectively. In general there were more roots with diameter less than 2 mm all over the evaluated root zone. The roots of larger diameter tended to concentrate near to the pseudostem with depths less than 0.40 m from soil surface.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Anã' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Anã' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Anã' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Anã' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Anã' cultivar.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield and the cycle of banana trees treated with paclobutrazol (PBZ). We tested five doses of PBZ (0.0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5 and 2.0 g plant-1), applied on the soil around 'Prata Anã' and 'FHIA-01' banana trees four months after planting. Data were obtained during the first cicle and the bunchs were harvested when yellow color was observed on the peel of the first fruits. The cicle time was of 507 days, not differing in terms of doses and cultivars. The use of PBZ reduced pseudostem length. Increasing of PBZ doses increased the number of active leaves at inflorescence emission period of 'Prata Anã', but the effects on bunch were harmful, with reduction of the number of fruits per bunch, of commercial length and diameter of the fruits, which caused reduction of bunch weight and of productivity. In FHIA-01 cultivar, PBZ applied via soil reduced pseudostem length and improved bunch sustentation, not influencing crop productivity. The optimal dose of PBZ on 'FHIA-01' banana tree is around 1,0 g plant-1. For the 'Prata Anã' is not recommended the use of PBZ.

The productivity in banana is a complex character that results from the combination of different factors, influenced by environment. This work aimed to study the direct and indirect effects of vegetative traits on production in three cycles in banana. The work was conducted in the Experimental Field of Embrapa Acre in Rio Branco, Acre, among years 2003 and 2006. Thirteen genotypes of banana (Preciosa, Japira, Pacovan Ken, Pacovan, BRS Platina, Prata Anã, ST12-31, Nanicão, Grande Naine, Calypso, Ambrosia, Bucaneiro and FHIA 02) were evaluated, spaced 3 m × 2 m, in the randomized blocks with five replicates. The evaluated traits were: plant height, diameter of pseudostem, number of leaves at flowering and harvest, weight of bunch and number of hands in the bunch. Analysis of variance and path analysis were carried out for each cycle and phenotypic correlation coefficients were estimated. The trait weight of the bunch was adopted as the basic variable and the others were considered the explanatory variables. The study of direct and indirect effects showed that the character output is much influenced by the environment in the first cycle, and the following production cycle is much influenced by vegetative traits, especially number of leaves at harvest.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

Phytotechnical characters observed in field experimental are of phenotypic nature and most of the time its assessment is based only on the experience of the observer. The assessment of the correlations between variables allows the estimation of the changes in a character based on the changes in other characters. This present study estimated the impact of agronomic characters related to the weight of the bunch measured in banana plants. The experiment was a test for uniformity, conducted in Guanambi, Bahia, by using the cultivar Tropical (YB42-21), an AAAB tetraploid hybrid. The vegetative characters evaluated during flowering included plant height, perimeter of the pseudostem, number of offshoots, and number of living leaves. The yield related characters were evaluated during the harvest and included, bunch's weight, number of hands and fruits, weight of the second hand, and length and diameter of the fruit in two production cycles. In the evaluations, each plant was considered as a basic unit (bu). This work described a protocol for prediction of banana yield by using the artificial neural networks (ANNs) method as modeling tool. The computational model ANN was used and the prediction of the weight of the bunch in banana plants cv. Tropical was estimated with precision and efficiency (R2=91%, MPE=1.40 and MSD=2.29). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the response of irrigated 'Prata Anã' banana (AAB) to soil application of phosphorus, in four production cycles. The experiment was carried out in the semiarid region of the north of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a clayey Oxisol, with very low available P (4.6 mg dm-3, Mehlich). A randomized complete block design was used, in a 5x4 factorial arrangement, with five doses of triple superphosphate (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 g P2O5 per plant per year), four production cycles, and four replicates. In the first cycle, the soil application of P increased plant height, pseudostem diameter, weight and number of fruits per bunch of banana; however, banana plants did not respond to P application in the second, third, and fourth cycles. 'Prata Anã' banana, even when grown in soil with low P content, responds to the application of this nutrient only in the first production cycle.

The high density planting of some banana cultivars is an usable practical to increase productivity, especially in regions affected by Sigatoka. This study aimed to evaluate the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' grown in different planting densities with black leaf streak presence at Vale do Ribeira, SP. It was installed a banana orchard with seedlings produced in vitro of the Grande Naine cultivar. The experimental design was a completely randomized, in factorial scheme 5 x 2, with five densities (2,500; 2,222; 2,000; 1,667 and 1,111 plants.ha-1) and two production cycles. The black leaf streak severity was weekly monitored using the state evolution method (SE) and its control were set when occurred the second consecutive progression of the severity and/or increases of 200 points from a week to the next. For each plot it was evaluated eight plants measuring plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of active leaves at blooming and at harvest, bunch fresh weight, productivity, number of hands, bunch fruits number, total fresh weight and individual fresh weight of the 2nd hand, length and diameter of 2nd hand fruits. Data were submitted to variance analysis by F test and the significant means were compared by Tukey test (5% probability). Under the experimental conditions, it can be concluded that the density did not influence the plant development (plant height and pseudostem diameter). The biggest plants density gave higher banana plant 'Grande Naine' yields.

The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3×2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0×2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

The objective of this study was to agronomically characterize plants from induced chromosome doubling experiments in the Pisang Lilin parthenocarpic banana accession to select genotypes that will be used as 2n gamete donors in crosses with improved diploids to generate secondary triploids. Twenty-two plants were evaluated, of which 17 were autotetraploids. Compared with the original diploids, the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids showed significant increases in the plant height, number of living leaves at flowering and harvest, pseudostem diameter, and length and diameter of fruits; the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids also exhibited greater fruit and bunch weights compared with the original diploids. In addition, all autotetraploid plants did not exhibit any symptoms of yellow Sigatoka. Female fertility was also detected, as some plants produced seeds, indicating that they can be used as female parents. Therefore, the autotetraploids characterized in this study exhibited useful agronomical traits to be used as 2n gamete donors for generating secondary triploids. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

This study aimed to evaluate development and production of banana plant ‘Grande Naine’ under different management systems with black leaf streak presence at Vale do Ribeira, SP (Brazil). For the experiment it was used micropropagated seedlings of ‘Grande Naine’ banana that was planted in field in a completely randomized design with five treatments (management systems): interspersed planting; fungicide control; defoliation + interspersed planting; defoliation + fungicide control and control, which were subdivided in time (two production cycles), with eight repetition and one plant per repetition. It was evaluated the following parameters: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of active leaves at blooming and at harvest, marketable fruits fresh weight, productivity, number of hands, number of fruit, total fresh weight and individual fresh weight of the 2nd hand, length and diameter of 2nd hand fruits. Data were submitted to variance analysis by F test and the significant means were compared by Tukey’s test (5% probability). It can be conclude that fungicides applications were effective for black leaf streak control, showing better results in plants development and production and also in fruit quality of cultivars Grande Naine. No differences were observed when fungicide application was associated with defoliation. The interspersed planting affected negatively all the development and production parameters of cultivar Grande Naine. © 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Fruticultura. All rights reserved.

The characterization and evaluation of new genotypes bananas is an important step both for breeding programs and for nomination to producers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield and fruit quality post-harvest of 'Maravilha' and 'Preciosa' bananas in the first and second production cycles, grown in Sub-middle São Francisco Valley. The seedlings produced by tissue culture, were transplanted to the field after six month old, cultivated in the spacing of 3 × 3 m. Both two cycles, for all characteristics was adopted a completely randomized design with two treatments (cultivars), 10 replicates and two plants per plot, with external borders. The following variables were evaluated: production cycle (days between planting and harvesting), plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of adult leaves, bunch fresh mass, number of cluster and fruits per bunch, fresh mass of the second cluster; number, length and diameter of fruits of the second cluster, pulp/skin ratio, firmness, pH, soluble solids (SS), titratable acidity (TA) and SS/TA ratio. The 'Maravilha' banana showed plant and yield characteristics superior to 'Preciosa' banana; in the physical and chemical characteristics, the 'Preciosa' banana had fruit with higher sugar content, however, smaller size; and for other characteristics, the two cultivars showed behavior similar to each other in the first and second production cycles.

Brazil is the sixth largest producer of banana; however, traditional practices of banana propagation fall short when the intention is to introduce a uniform, pathogen-free banana plantation, with high yield potential . This research aimed to evaluate the vegetative growth and production of 'Prata Anã' banana derived from conventional seedlings (whole rhizome) of different sizes (up to 1000g, 1001 to 2000g, 2001 to 3000g, 3001 to 4000g, 4001 to 5000g, and more than 5000g) and in vitro micropropagation, during the first and second production cycles. The experimental design was completely randomized, with a variable number of repetitions. Analysis of variance was performed using regression equations for the vegetative data and Tukey test at 5% of probability for production data. Micropropagated plants originating from rhizomes with weight of less than 1000g, between 1001g and 2000g resulted in plants with more vegetative vigor, in the first cycle. In the second cycle, the number of leaves, height and diameter of the pseudostem tended to equalize for tratadifferent classes of plants assessed. In the first production cycle, periods between planting and floral anthesis and between planting and harvesting were inversely proportional to the size of conventional seedlings; the periods for micropropagated plants were similar to the conventional seedlings of greater weight. There was no difference in the number of hands, fingers and bunch weight between the different classes of seedlings. The differences between the amount of time from planting to flowering and until harvest among the different classes of seedlings tend to disappear from the first to the second cycle. Thus, the propagation of the banana with seedlings weighing less than 2000g or micropropagated is preferable; however, it is possible to use any kind of seedlings, planted in various plots according to the size.

The evaluation of tetraploid genotypes, originated from crosses between commercial triploid and diploid cultivars, improved or wild, has been made to solve traditional problems of cultivars of Prata type, as susceptibility to pests and diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield and fruit quality of banana trees 'Pacovan Ken' and PA94-01 genotype during the first and second production cycles in Vale do São Francisco in the northeast of Brazil. The seedlings were produced by the tissue culture process and transplanted into the field at six months of age, spaced 3.0 × 3.0 m. In both production cycles, the following variables were evaluated: number of days between planting and harvesting, plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of adult leaves, bunch fresh mass, number of bunch and fruits per bunch, second bunch fresh mass; number, length, and diameter of second buch fruits, pulp/peel ratio, firmness, pH, soluble solids (SS), titratable acidity (TA), and SS/TA ratio. The PA94-01 genotype had more vigorous plants and with better productive characteristics in the two production cycles. However, the cycle duration and physicochemical characteristics of fruits were similar to those of 'Pacovan Ken' fruits.

The use of humic substances and plant extract has been increasing mainly in organic crop systems without scientificbased recommendations. Research is necessary to evaluate the feasibility and the recommendations of these substances. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of humic substances (humic and fulvic acids) applied by fertigation with and without saponin-based plant extracts on growth and yield of 'BRS Princesa' banana. The experiment was carried out using the banana cultivar 'BRS Princesa', at a spacing of 2.0 × 2.5 m, fertigated by drip irrigation in a Dystric Densic Xantic Ferralsol, at the Recôncavo da Bahia, Brazil. Treatments consisted of five doses of humic substances (0.0; 70; 105; 140, and 210 L ha-1 cycle-1) applied with and without a saponin-based plant extract in a randomized block design in split-plot scheme. The following growth variables were evaluated: number of leaves, pseudostem height, pseudostem diameter, and length and width of the third leaf. The number of fruits/hand and hands/bunch, hand and bunch yield, and length and fruit diameter of the second central hand were evaluated during harvest. The doses of humic substances influenced only pseudostem height. Hand yield, as well as fruit length and diameter of 'BRS Princesa' banana were higher in plants fertigated with humic substance and plant extract in comparison with plants fertigated with only humic substance.

Banana production stands out in Brazilian semiarid agriculture; however, due to little availability of water resources, associating water-saving technologies with the knowledge of parameters involved in the interplay between plants and soil is critical to improving banana production systems. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of planting densities and irrigation levels on root length density of ‘BRS Platina’ banana and to correlate root parameters to crop yield and leaf area. A randomized block design was used, with factors arranged in split-split plots and treatments replicated three times: four irrigation levels (55%, 70%, 85% and 100% ETc) were assigned to plots, four planting densities (1,600; 2,000; 2,666; and 3,333 plants ha-1) to subplots and distance from pseudostem or sampling depth to sub-subplots. Root length density (RLD) was measured at five distances from the pseudostem, longitudinally to a row of plants: 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.10 m; and at three depths for each distance: 0 to 0.20 m, 0.20 to 0.40 m and 0.40 to 0.60 m from surface level. Root length densities were highest at 100% ETc irrigation level and at 2,666 plants ha-1 and 3,333 plants ha-1, within 0.31 m deep and within 0.78 m of the pseudostem. Irrigation interacts with root system, and coupled with higher planting densities, contributes to increasing crop yields of ‘BRS Platina’ banana plants. © 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. © 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the phytotechnical behavior of 'Prata-Ana' banana and four progeny hybrids, during two production cycles, in the Perimetro Irrigado do Estreito, southwest of Bahia state, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized with fi ve treatments: cultivar 'Prata-Ana' and the hybrids Fhia-01 (BRS Fhia Maravilha), BRS Fhia-18, Fhia 18 and PA42-44, with ten replicates. Phenotypic vegetative descriptors, cycle length and yield were measured. Increases occurred between cycles for: plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of hands and fruits, and yield. The Fhia-18 hybrid showed greater size and pseudostem perimeter, and 'Prata-Ana' had the smallest, (with maintenance of this character in the PA42-44). The hybrids were similar in the number of suckers produced. BRS Fhia-18, PA42-44 and Fhia-1 were early for harvest and had greater fruit length than 'Prata-Ana'. Fhia-18 produced more fruit and PA42-44 had fewer hands compared to the parental cultivar. BRS Fhia-18, Fhia-18 and Fhia-1 are more productive than the parental cultivar. 'Prata-Ana' is more susceptible to yellow sigatoka, while PA42-44 is resistant, with greater retention of leaves at harvest; however, both have similar yields.

The purpose of this research was to assess the plants growth and production of genotypes of 4 genomic groups of banana: 'Nanicao-IAC-2001', 'Grande Naine', 'Caipira' and 'Nam' (AAA); 'Maca', 'Thap Maeo', 'Prata Ana' and 'Prata Zulu' (AAB); 'FHIA 01', 'FHIA 18', 'Prata Grauda' and 'Maca Tropical' (AAAB), in Botucatu, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Some growth characteristics were evaluated such as: plant height, the pseudostem circumference, number of leaves, number of days between planting and flowering, number of days between flowering and harvest and number of days from planting to harvest. The production characteristics such as the bunch weight, number of fruits, average weight of the fruits, number of hands and weight, number, length and diameter of the fruits of the 2nd hand and yield. The results indicated that in the group AAA, 'Nanicao' showed good characteristics regarding to growth and production. However, 'Grande Naine' had the highest values in productive terms. 'Nam' showed the lowest height and the shortest cycle, but it had low productive values. Regarding to the group AAB, 'Prata Zulu' showed the biggest pseudostem circumference, good productive characteristics, but it had the longest cycle and the highest height. 'Thap Maeo' stands out as it shows good production characteristics. 'Prata Ana' had the lowest height and the shortest cycle. However, it did not have a good productive performance. In relation to the group AAAB, 'FHIA 01' showed the highest values in most of the characteristics which were evaluated, standing out among the other hybrids. We can conclude that 'Grande Naine' stands out inside the group AAA, 'Thap Maeo' and 'Prata Zulu' inside the group AAB and 'FHIA 01' inside the group AAAB.

The goal of this work was to make a agronomical evaluation of the vegetative characteristics and income of five cultivars of banana type Plantain, in the first production cycle under irrigation in the semi-arid conditions of the region of the city of Guanambi - Bahia State. Relevant phenotypic descriptors were used for the identification and selection of individuals with superior characteristics, so as to make available to the producers of the perimeters of irrigation an alternative for the diversification of the banana crops. The evaluated genotypes AAB were the varieties Terra, Terra-Maranhao, Terrinha and D'Angola and the hybrid AAAB: FHIA-21. The following characteristics were analyzed: number of days from the sowing to the flowering and to the harvest, height of the plant, perimeter of the pseudostem, number of alive leaves at flowering and harvest, gap flowering-harvest, weight of the bunch, of the peduncle and of the hands, number of hands and fruits per bunch, length and diameter of the fruit. The procedure employed was randomized blocks, with five treatments, consisting of the cultivars AAB: Terra, Terra-Maranhao, Terrinha and D'Angola and the hybrid AAAB: FHIA-21, and five repetitions. Each plot was comprised by 20 plants: four rows of five plants, with six useful plants in the spacing of 3,0 m x 3,0 m. Terra and Terra Maranhao were the most productive varieties, however, with larger load and late cycles. The hybrid FHIA-21 and the varieties Terrinha and D'Angola showed a larger number of living leaves in the harvest. The variety D'Angola presented the smallest productivity between the evaluated cultivars.

The objective of the present study was to select diploids (AA) hybrids of banana based on three non-parametric indices as to guide the selection and increase the use of the variability present in the Banana Germplasm Bank of Embrapa Cassava and Tropical Fruits. Eleven hybrids were evaluated in random blocks with four replicates. The plots consisted of six plants spaced 2.5 m x 2.5 m whereas the border rows were from the Pacovan cultivar. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle from planting to bunch emission, presence of pollen, number of hands, number of fruits, fruit length and yellow-Sigatoka resistance. The average of these ten characteristics was used for calculating the multiplicative indices of sum of classification and genotype-ideotype distance. The two hybrids presenting best global performance SH3263 and 1318-01 ranked respectively, first and second by the multiplicative indices and sum of classification whereas the genotype-ideotype distance index ranked them first and fourth. Although in general, all three indexes presented good coherence between general performance of the hybrids and their classification, the multiplicative and sum of classification indexes provided a more adequate classification of these hybrids.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of Prata banana plants during three production cycles, under different irrigation systems, in semi-arid conditions. A randomized block design was adopted with six treatments, in a 3x2 factorial arrangement: three irrigation systems - conventional sprinkler, microsprinkler and drip - and two genotypes - 'Prata-Ana' and its hybrid PA42-44. Four replicates in plots with six useful plants were used. Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of alive leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area, and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. Weight of bunch and hands, mean weight of hands, weight of the three first hands, number of hands and fruits per bunches, and weight, length and diameter of fruits and number of alive leaves were evaluated during the harvest season. The drip irrigation system provides smaller vigor to banana Prata, in comparison to conventional and to micro sprinkler systems, as can be seen by the size and perimeter of the pseudostem. The cultivar Prata-Ana shows a larger number of fruit and hands per brunch, while its hybrid PA42-44 shows larger weight, length and fruit diameter.

The fertilization with micronutrients is poorly studied for banana production, especially boron (B) application, which affects the development of apical meristems. This experiment aimed to study responses of B fertilization with different rates and application methods in banana plant 'Grande Naine'. The experimental design was in randomized block and factorial scheme with three rates (0.85, 1.70 and 3.40 g plant-1) and three fertilizer application methods (soil, leaves and tiller hole chopped) and a control, without B application, using boric acid as the source of B. Treatments effects were evaluated by B availability on soil, plant grown, plant nutritional status and by the yield. Treatments effects were submitted to variance analysis and when significant it was adjusted by regression equations. The B application on soil and in the leaves increased this micronutrient content in topsoil (between 1.0-1.5 mg kg-1, with the highest rate of the nutrient) and a corresponding increase up the soil layer to 20-40 cm, as a result of leaching. The contribution of foliar fertilization increasing the content in the soil was due to the washing and by draining the fertilizer solution from the leaves to the soil surface. Moreover, there was no effect of B availability in the soil when the fertilizer was applied in the tiller hole chopped (~0.3 mg kg-1 of B). It was also verified that there were no effects of B application on banana plant growth (height and pseudostem diameter) at the blooming stage. In leaf samples, collected each 15 days, it was observed that when the micronutrient was applied in the tiller hole chopped, leaf B concentration was higher and lasted up for one month. However, in the last foliar sampling (at blooming) it was observed that there was no effect of application methods on leaf B concentration (~20 mg kg-1). There were no effects of fertilization in yield according to rates and application methods of B, but the application on the tiller hole chopped promoted an increased accumulation of this micronutrient in the bunch due to the applied rates. Under the conditions of this experiment, it can be concluded that B application did not influenced the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' according to the rates and application methods of this micronutrient.

The information of a plant root distribution allows defining regions of soil around it suitable for fertilizer application and for sensor placement in order to improve irrigation schedule. The present study had as objective to evaluate root system distribution of banana cv.'Prata-Ana' irrigated by different systems, during the second production cycle. The experiment followed a random block design in a split split-plot scheme with three replications in which the variation sources consisted of three irrigation systems (drip, microsprinkler and conventional sprinkler), six distances from plant (0.15; 0.30; 0.45; 0.60; 0.75 e 1.00 m) and five soil depths (0.0 -0.20; 0.20 -0.40; 0.40-0.60; 0.60 -0.80 and 0.80-1.00 m). The banana root system remained near-surface soil, with its 80% at 0.61 m, 0.51 m and 0.61 m depth and at effective distance of 0.63 m, 0.66 m 0.79 m from the pseudostem for irrigation systems, drip micro sprinkler and conventional sprinkler, respectively. In general there were more roots with diameter less than 2 mm all over the evaluated root zone. The roots of larger diameter tended to concentrate near to the pseudostem with depths less than 0.40 m from soil surface.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Ana' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Ana' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Ana' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Ana' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Ana' cultivar.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield and the cycle of banana trees treated with paclobutrazol (PBZ). We tested five doses of PBZ (0.0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5 and 2.0 g plant-1), applied on the soil around 'Prata Ana' and 'FHIA-01' banana trees four months after planting. Data were obtained during the first cicle and the bunchs were harvested when yellow color was observed on the peel of the first fruits. The cicle time was of 507 days, not differing in terms of doses and cultivars. The use of PBZ reduced pseudostem length. Increasing of PBZ doses increased the number of active leaves at inflorescence emission period of 'Prata Ana', but the effects on bunch were harmful, with reduction of the number of fruits per bunch, of commercial length and diameter of the fruits, which caused reduction of bunch weight and of productivity. In FHIA-01 cultivar, PBZ applied via soil reduced pseudostem length and improved bunch sustentation, not influencing crop productivity. The optimal dose of PBZ on 'FHIA-01' banana tree is around 1,0 g plant-1. For the 'Prata Ana' is not recommended the use of PBZ.

The productivity in banana is a complex character that results from the combination of different factors, influenced by environment. This work aimed to study the direct and indirect effects of vegetative traits on production in three cycles in banana. The work was conducted in the Experimental Field of Embrapa Acre in Rio Branco, Acre, among years 2003 and 2006. Thirteen genotypes of banana (Preciosa, Japira, Pacovan Ken, Pacovan, BRS Platina, Prata Ana, ST12-31, Nanicao, Grande Naine, Calypso, Ambrosia, Bucaneiro and FHIA 02) were evaluated, spaced 3 m x 2 m, in the randomized blocks with five replicates. The evaluated traits were: plant height, diameter of pseudostem, number of leaves at flowering and harvest, weight of bunch and number of hands in the bunch. Analysis of variance and path analysis were carried out for each cycle and phenotypic correlation coefficients were estimated. The trait weight of the bunch was adopted as the basic variable and the others were considered the explanatory variables. The study of direct and indirect effects showed that the character output is much influenced by the environment in the first cycle, and the following production cycle is much influenced by vegetative traits, especially number of leaves at harvest.

Due the necessity in improve the banana production system in Pernambuco State, Brazil, mainly in Siriji River Valley, a trail was carried out in Vicencia County, with the objective to evaluate the behavior of seven banana genotypes (Pacovan Ken, PV 79-34, Japira, Preciosa, ST 12-31, YB 42-03 and YB 42-07) during two production cycles, using randomized complete blocks with four replicates and 12 plants per plot. The following characters had been considered: plant height; pseudostem circumference; number of leaves in the flowering and the harvest; number of days from plantation to the flowering and the harvest; flowering-harvest interval; mass of bunch, hands and fingers; number of hands and fingers; fruit length and diameter; and skin thickness. In first cycle, fruit mass, length and skin thickness were the ones that presented significant difference. However, in second cycle, there was difference among the most evaluated characters. Japira, Preciosa and Pacovan Ken hybrids presented potential to the exploitation in the Siriji River Valley, due advantages observed in the vegetative and production characteristics, beyond good acceptation among banana farmers, in relation to agronomic characteristics.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

Phytotechnical characters observed in field experimental are of phenotypic nature and most of the time its assessment is based only on the experience of the observer. The assessment of the correlations between variables allows the estimation of the changes in a character based on the changes in other characters. This present study estimated the impact of agronomic characters related to the weight of the bunch measured in banana plants. The experiment was a test for uniformity, conducted in Guanambi, Bahia, by using the cultivar Tropical (YB42-21), an AAAB tetraploid hybrid. The vegetative characters evaluated during flowering included plant height, perimeter of the pseudostem, number of offshoots, and number of living leaves. The yield related characters were evaluated during the harvest and included, bunch's weight, number of hands and fruits, weight of the second hand, and length and diameter of the fruit in two production cycles. In the evaluations, each plant was considered as a basic unit (bu). This work described a protocol for prediction of banana yield by using the artificial neural networks (ANNs) method as modeling tool. The computational model ANN was used and the prediction of the weight of the bunch in banana plants cv. Tropical was estimated with precision and efficiency (R2=91%, MPE=1.40 and MSD=2.29).

The objective of this work was to evaluate the response of irrigated 'Prata Ana' banana (AAB) to soil application of phosphorus, in four production cycles. The experiment was carried out in the semiarid region of the north of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a clayey Oxisol, with very low available P (4.6 mg dm-3, Mehlich). A randomized complete block design was used, in a 5x4 factorial arrangement, with five doses of triple superphosphate (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 g P2O5 per plant per year), four production cycles, and four replicates. In the first cycle, the soil application of P increased plant height, pseudostem diameter, weight and number of fruits per bunch of banana; however, banana plants did not respond to P application in the second, third, and fourth cycles. 'Prata Ana' banana, even when grown in soil with low P content, responds to the application of this nutrient only in the first production cycle.

This study evaluated the influence of different irrigation levels on the growth of the banana crop cv. Grande Naine. The experiment was conducted in the experimental field of the Centro Nacional de Pesquisa Mandioca e Fruticultura. A randomized block design was used with six levels of irrigation and eight replications. The irrigation L1 corresponded to rain. The irrigation L6 was determined using the Kc and ETo. The other irrigation levels were determined by the formula NH = K x AF x ETo, where NH is the water requirement of the crop (L plant-1), K (empirical coefficient of plant transpiration), AF - leaf area (m2 plant-1) and ETo - reference evapotranspiration (mm). The parameters evaluated were: plant height, pseudostem circumference, leaf area, alive leaf number and duration of the crop cycle. The growth of cv. Grande Naine was influenced by irrigation, it is possible to estimate the water requirement of the banana crop, based on knowledge of leaf area and ETo. The best crop growth was obtained with a transpiration coefficient of 0.57 and irrigation depth estimated in 1247 mm.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of different water depths on the morphophysiological and yield variables of three Terra-type banana cultivars. A randomized complete block design was used, in a factorial arrangement with 12 treatments and three replicates. Treatments consisted of water depths correspondent to 33, 66, 99, and 120% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc), besides the control without irrigation, and of the cultivars Terra Maranhao, Terrinha, and D'Angola. The morphophysiological variables evaluated were: plant height, pseudostem diameter, leaf area, stomatal conductance, and, during harvest, the number of fingers and hands, and hand weight per bunch. Crop coefficients of the Terra-type banana cultivars were obtained from the best combination of yield and water use efficiency. The consumptive water-use depths of 1,599 mm (1.20 ETc), 922 mm (0.84 ETc), and 940 mm (1.06 ETc) correspond to the maximum yields and water use efficiencies of the cultivars Terra Maranhao, Terrinha, and D'Angola, respectively.

The high density planting of some banana cultivars is an usable practical to increase productivity, especially in regions affected by Sigatoka. This study aimed to evaluate the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' grown in different planting densities with black leaf streak presence at Vale do Ribeira, SP. It was installed a banana orchard with seedlings produced in vitro of the Grande Naine cultivar. The experimental design was a completely randomized, in factorial scheme 5 x 2, with five densities (2,500; 2,222; 2,000; 1,667 and 1,111 plants.ha-1) and two production cycles. The black leaf streak severity was weekly monitored using the state evolution method (SE) and its control were set when occurred the second consecutive progression of the severity and/or increases of 200 points from a week to the next. For each plot it was evaluated eight plants measuring plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of active leaves at blooming and at harvest, bunch fresh weight, productivity, number of hands, bunch fruits number, total fresh weight and individual fresh weight of the 2nd hand, length and diameter of 2nd hand fruits. Data were submitted to variance analysis by F test and the significant means were compared by Tukey test (5% probability). Under the experimental conditions, it can be concluded that the density did not influence the plant development (plant height and pseudostem diameter). The biggest plants density gave higher banana plant 'Grande Naine' yields.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3x2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0x2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

The objective of this study was to agronomically characterize plants from induced chromosome doubling experiments in the Pisang Lilin parthenocarpic banana accession to select genotypes that will be used as 2n gamete donors in crosses with improved diploids to generate secondary triploids. Twenty-two plants were evaluated, of which 17 were autotetraploids. Compared with the original diploids, the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids showed significant increases in the plant height, number of living leaves at flowering and harvest, pseudostem diameter, and length and diameter of fruits; the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids also exhibited greater fruit and bunch weights compared with the original diploids. In addition, all autotetraploid plants did not exhibit any symptoms of yellow Sigatoka. Female fertility was also detected, as some plants produced seeds, indicating that they can be used as female parents. Therefore, the autotetraploids characterized in this study exhibited useful agronomical traits to be used as 2n gamete donors for generating secondary triploids.

This study aimed to evaluate development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' under different management systems with black leaf streak presence at Vale do Ribeira, SP (Brazil). For the experiment it was used micropropagated seedlings of 'Grande Naine' banana that was planted in field in a completely randomized design with five treatments (management systems): interspersed planting; fungicide control; defoliation + interspersed planting; defoliation + fungicide control and control, which were subdivided in time (two production cycles), with eight repetition and one plant per repetition. It was evaluated the following parameters: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of active leaves at blooming and at harvest, marketable fruits fresh weight, productivity, number of hands, number of fruit, total fresh weight and individual fresh weight of the 2nd hand, length and diameter of 2nd hand fruits. Data were submitted to variance analysis by F test and the significant means were compared by Tukey's test (5% probability). It can be conclude that fungicides applications were effective for black leaf streak control, showing better results in plants development and production and also in fruit quality of cultivars Grande Naine. No differences were observed when fungicide application was associated with defoliation. The interspersed planting affected negatively all the development and production parameters of cultivar Grande Naine. (c) 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Fruticultura. All rights reserved.

Brazil is the sixth largest producer of banana; however, traditional practices of banana propagation fall short when the intention is to introduce a uniform, pathogen-free banana plantation, with high yield potential . This research aimed to evaluate the vegetative growth and production of 'Prata Ana' banana derived from conventional seedlings (whole rhizome) of different sizes (up to 1000g, 1001 to 2000g, 2001 to 3000g, 3001 to 4000g, 4001 to 5000g, and more than 5000g) and in vitro micropropagation, during the first and second production cycles. The experimental design was completely randomized, with a variable number of repetitions. Analysis of variance was performed using regression equations for the vegetative data and Tukey test at 5% of probability for production data. Micropropagated plants originating from rhizomes with weight of less than 1000g, between 1001g and 2000g resulted in plants with more vegetative vigor, in the first cycle. In the second cycle, the number of leaves, height and diameter of the pseudostem tended to equalize for tratadifferent classes of plants assessed. In the first production cycle, periods between planting and floral anthesis and between planting and harvesting were inversely proportional to the size of conventional seedlings; the periods for micropropagated plants were similar to the conventional seedlings of greater weight. There was no difference in the number of hands, fingers and bunch weight between the different classes of seedlings. The differences between the amount of time from planting to flowering and until harvest among the different classes of seedlings tend to disappear from the first to the second cycle. Thus, the propagation of the banana with seedlings weighing less than 2000g or micropropagated is preferable; however, it is possible to use any kind of seedlings, planted in various plots according to the size.

The use of humic substances and plant extract has been increasing mainly in organic crop systems without scientificbased recommendations. Research is necessary to evaluate the feasibility and the recommendations of these substances. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of humic substances (humic and fulvic acids) applied by fertigation with and without saponin-based plant extracts on growth and yield of 'BRS Princesa' banana. The experiment was carried out using the banana cultivar 'BRS Princesa', at a spacing of 2.0 x 2.5 m, fertigated by drip irrigation in a Dystric Densic Xantic Ferralsol, at the Reconcavo da Bahia, Brazil. Treatments consisted of five doses of humic substances (0.0; 70; 105; 140, and 210 L ha-1 cycle-1) applied with and without a saponin-based plant extract in a randomized block design in split-plot scheme. The following growth variables were evaluated: number of leaves, pseudostem height, pseudostem diameter, and length and width of the third leaf. The number of fruits/hand and hands/bunch, hand and bunch yield, and length and fruit diameter of the second central hand were evaluated during harvest. The doses of humic substances influenced only pseudostem height. Hand yield, as well as fruit length and diameter of 'BRS Princesa' banana were higher in plants fertigated with humic substance and plant extract in comparison with plants fertigated with only humic substance.

Banana production stands out in Brazilian semiarid agriculture; however, due to little availability of water resources, associating water-saving technologies with the knowledge of parameters involved in the interplay between plants and soil is critical to improving banana production systems. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of planting densities and irrigation levels on root length density of 'BRS Platina' banana and to correlate root parameters to crop yield and leaf area. A randomized block design was used, with factors arranged in split-split plots and treatments replicated three times: four irrigation levels (55%, 70%, 85% and 100% ETc) were assigned to plots, four planting densities (1,600; 2,000; 2,666; and 3,333 plants ha-1) to subplots and distance from pseudostem or sampling depth to sub-subplots. Root length density (RLD) was measured at five distances from the pseudostem, longitudinally to a row of plants: 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.10 m; and at three depths for each distance: 0 to 0.20 m, 0.20 to 0.40 m and 0.40 to 0.60 m from surface level. Root length densities were highest at 100% ETc irrigation level and at 2,666 plants ha-1 and 3,333 plants ha-1, within 0.31 m deep and within 0.78 m of the pseudostem. Irrigation interacts with root system, and coupled with higher planting densities, contributes to increasing crop yields of 'BRS Platina' banana plants. (c) 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. (c) 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

The experimental design was completely randomized with fi ve treatments: cultivar 'Prata-Ana' and the hybrids Fhia-01 (BRS Fhia Maravilha), BRS Fhia-18, Fhia 18 and PA42-44, with ten replicates. Phenotypic vegetative descriptors, cycle length and yield were measured. Increases occurred between cycles for: plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of hands and fruits, and yield. The Fhia-18 hybrid showed greater size and pseudostem perimeter, and 'Prata-Ana' had the smallest, (with maintenance of this character in the PA42-44). The hybrids were similar in the number of suckers produced. BRS Fhia-18, PA42-44 and Fhia-1 were early for harvest and had greater fruit length than 'Prata-Ana'. Fhia-18 produced more fruit and PA42-44 had fewer hands compared to the parental cultivar. BRS Fhia-18, Fhia-18 and Fhia-1 are more productive than the parental cultivar. 'Prata-Ana' is more susceptible to yellow sigatoka, while PA42-44 is resistant, with greater retention of leaves at harvest; however, both have similar yields.

The objective of the present study was to select diploids (AA) hybrids of banana based on three non-parametric indices as to guide the selection and increase the use of the variability present in the Banana Germplasm Bank of Embrapa Cassava and Tropical Fruits. Eleven hybrids were evaluated in random blocks with four replicates. The plots consisted of six plants spaced 2.5 m x 2.5 m whereas the border rows were from the Pacovan cultivar. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle from planting to bunch emission, presence of pollen, number of hands, number of fruits, fruit length and yellow-Sigatoka resistance. The average of these ten characteristics was used for calculating the multiplicative indices of sum of classification and genotype-ideotype distance. The two hybrids presenting best global performance SH3263 and 1318-01 ranked respectively, first and second by the multiplicative indices and sum of classification whereas the genotype-ideotype distance index ranked them first and fourth. Although in general, all three indexes presented good coherence between general performance of the hybrids and their classification, the multiplicative and sum of classification indexes provided a more adequate classification of these hybrids.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of Prata banana plants during three production cycles, under different irrigation systems, in semi-arid conditions. A randomized block design was adopted with six treatments, in a 3x2 factorial arrangement: three irrigation systems - conventional sprinkler, microsprinkler and drip - and two genotypes - 'Prata-Ana' and its hybrid PA42-44. Four replicates in plots with six useful plants were used. Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of alive leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area, and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. Weight of bunch and hands, mean weight of hands, weight of the three first hands, number of hands and fruits per bunches, and weight, length and diameter of fruits and number of alive leaves were evaluated during the harvest season. The drip irrigation system provides smaller vigor to banana Prata, in comparison to conventional and to micro sprinkler systems, as can be seen by the size and perimeter of the pseudostem. The cultivar Prata-Ana shows a larger number of fruit and hands per brunch, while its hybrid PA42-44 shows larger weight, length and fruit diameter.

Fusarium wilt is one of the major diseases which cause great damage to the banana crop in Brazil since most cultivars used are susceptible. This study was carried out to evaluate agronomical characteristics and resistance to Fusarium wilt in tetraploid banana hybrids. The experiment was led in the experimental field at Embrapa Cassava and Tropical Fruits in a complete randomized design with 14 treatments and 10 replicates in the years 2000 and 2001. Fourteen tetraploids were evaluated: FHIA-03, PV03-44, PC42-01, PV42-53, PV42-68, PV42-81, PV42-85, PV42-129, PV42-142, PV42-143, SH3640, ST12-31, ST42-08 and YB42-21 and the Silk cultivar used as the control. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height (m) and pseudostem diameter (cm) at 30cm from the ground, bunch weight (kg), hand weight (kg) and fruit weight (g), number of hands per bunch, fruits per hand and days to flowering until harvest and Fusarium wilt incidence. The mean values of the genotypes were grouped by the Scott Knott test at 5% significance. There is a broad variation regarding the characteristics evaluated. FHIA 03, ST12-31, SH3640, PV42-142, PV42-53 and PV42-68 present good agronomical characteristics as well as resistance to Fusarium wilt.

The fertilization with micronutrients is poorly studied for banana production, especially boron (B) application, which affects the development of apical meristems. This experiment aimed to study responses of B fertilization with different rates and application methods in banana plant 'Grande Naine'. The experimental design was in randomized block and factorial scheme with three rates (0.85, 1.70 and 3.40 g plant-1) and three fertilizer application methods (soil, leaves and tiller hole chopped) and a control, without B application, using boric acid as the source of B. Treatments effects were evaluated by B availability on soil, plant grown, plant nutritional status and by the yield. Treatments effects were submitted to variance analysis and when significant it was adjusted by regression equations. The B application on soil and in the leaves increased this micronutrient content in topsoil (between 1.0-1.5 mg kg-1, with the highest rate of the nutrient) and a corresponding increase up the soil layer to 20-40 cm, as a result of leaching. The contribution of foliar fertilization increasing the content in the soil was due to the washing and by draining the fertilizer solution from the leaves to the soil surface. Moreover, there was no effect of B availability in the soil when the fertilizer was applied in the tiller hole chopped (~0.3 mg kg-1 of B). It was also verified that there were no effects of B application on banana plant growth (height and pseudostem diameter) at the blooming stage. In leaf samples, collected each 15 days, it was observed that when the micronutrient was applied in the tiller hole chopped, leaf B concentration was higher and lasted up for one month. However, in the last foliar sampling (at blooming) it was observed that there was no effect of application methods on leaf B concentration (~20 mg kg-1). There were no effects of fertilization in yield according to rates and application methods of B, but the application on the tiller hole chopped promoted an increased accumulation of this micronutrient in the bunch due to the applied rates. Under the conditions of this experiment, it can be concluded that B application did not influenced the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' according to the rates and application methods of this micronutrient.

The information of a plant root distribution allows defining regions of soil around it suitable for fertilizer application and for sensor placement in order to improve irrigation schedule. The present study had as objective to evaluate root system distribution of banana cv.'Prata-Ana' irrigated by different systems, during the second production cycle. The experiment followed a random block design in a split split-plot scheme with three replications in which the variation sources consisted of three irrigation systems (drip, microsprinkler and conventional sprinkler), six distances from plant (0.15; 0.30; 0.45; 0.60; 0.75 e 1.00 m) and five soil depths (0.0 -0.20; 0.20 -0.40; 0.40-0.60; 0.60 -0.80 and 0.80-1.00 m). The banana root system remained near-surface soil, with its 80% at 0.61 m, 0.51 m and 0.61 m depth and at effective distance of 0.63 m, 0.66 m 0.79 m from the pseudostem for irrigation systems, drip micro sprinkler and conventional sprinkler, respectively. In general there were more roots with diameter less than 2 mm all over the evaluated root zone. The roots of larger diameter tended to concentrate near to the pseudostem with depths less than 0.40 m from soil surface.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Ana' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Ana' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Ana' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Ana' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Ana' cultivar.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield and the cycle of banana trees treated with paclobutrazol (PBZ). We tested five doses of PBZ (0.0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5 and 2.0 g plant-1), applied on the soil around 'Prata Ana' and 'FHIA-01' banana trees four months after planting. Data were obtained during the first cicle and the bunchs were harvested when yellow color was observed on the peel of the first fruits. The cicle time was of 507 days, not differing in terms of doses and cultivars. The use of PBZ reduced pseudostem length. Increasing of PBZ doses increased the number of active leaves at inflorescence emission period of 'Prata Ana', but the effects on bunch were harmful, with reduction of the number of fruits per bunch, of commercial length and diameter of the fruits, which caused reduction of bunch weight and of productivity. In FHIA-01 cultivar, PBZ applied via soil reduced pseudostem length and improved bunch sustentation, not influencing crop productivity. The optimal dose of PBZ on 'FHIA-01' banana tree is around 1,0 g plant-1. For the 'Prata Ana' is not recommended the use of PBZ.

The productivity in banana is a complex character that results from the combination of different factors, influenced by environment. This work aimed to study the direct and indirect effects of vegetative traits on production in three cycles in banana. The work was conducted in the Experimental Field of Embrapa Acre in Rio Branco, Acre, among years 2003 and 2006. Thirteen genotypes of banana (Preciosa, Japira, Pacovan Ken, Pacovan, BRS Platina, Prata Ana, ST12-31, Nanicao, Grande Naine, Calypso, Ambrosia, Bucaneiro and FHIA 02) were evaluated, spaced 3 m x 2 m, in the randomized blocks with five replicates. The evaluated traits were: plant height, diameter of pseudostem, number of leaves at flowering and harvest, weight of bunch and number of hands in the bunch. Analysis of variance and path analysis were carried out for each cycle and phenotypic correlation coefficients were estimated. The trait weight of the bunch was adopted as the basic variable and the others were considered the explanatory variables. The study of direct and indirect effects showed that the character output is much influenced by the environment in the first cycle, and the following production cycle is much influenced by vegetative traits, especially number of leaves at harvest.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

Phytotechnical characters observed in field experimental are of phenotypic nature and most of the time its assessment is based only on the experience of the observer. The assessment of the correlations between variables allows the estimation of the changes in a character based on the changes in other characters. This present study estimated the impact of agronomic characters related to the weight of the bunch measured in banana plants. The experiment was a test for uniformity, conducted in Guanambi, Bahia, by using the cultivar Tropical (YB42-21), an AAAB tetraploid hybrid. The vegetative characters evaluated during flowering included plant height, perimeter of the pseudostem, number of offshoots, and number of living leaves. The yield related characters were evaluated during the harvest and included, bunch's weight, number of hands and fruits, weight of the second hand, and length and diameter of the fruit in two production cycles. In the evaluations, each plant was considered as a basic unit (bu). This work described a protocol for prediction of banana yield by using the artificial neural networks (ANNs) method as modeling tool. The computational model ANN was used and the prediction of the weight of the bunch in banana plants cv. Tropical was estimated with precision and efficiency (R2=91%, MPE=1.40 and MSD=2.29).

The objective of this work was to evaluate the response of irrigated 'Prata Ana' banana (AAB) to soil application of phosphorus, in four production cycles. The experiment was carried out in the semiarid region of the north of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a clayey Oxisol, with very low available P (4.6 mg dm-3, Mehlich). A randomized complete block design was used, in a 5x4 factorial arrangement, with five doses of triple superphosphate (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 g P2O5 per plant per year), four production cycles, and four replicates. In the first cycle, the soil application of P increased plant height, pseudostem diameter, weight and number of fruits per bunch of banana; however, banana plants did not respond to P application in the second, third, and fourth cycles. 'Prata Ana' banana, even when grown in soil with low P content, responds to the application of this nutrient only in the first production cycle.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3x2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0x2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation.

The objective of this study was to agronomically characterize plants from induced chromosome doubling experiments in the Pisang Lilin parthenocarpic banana accession to select genotypes that will be used as 2n gamete donors in crosses with improved diploids to generate secondary triploids. Twenty-two plants were evaluated, of which 17 were autotetraploids. Compared with the original diploids, the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids showed significant increases in the plant height, number of living leaves at flowering and harvest, pseudostem diameter, and length and diameter of fruits; the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids also exhibited greater fruit and bunch weights compared with the original diploids. In addition, all autotetraploid plants did not exhibit any symptoms of yellow Sigatoka. Female fertility was also detected, as some plants produced seeds, indicating that they can be used as female parents. Therefore, the autotetraploids characterized in this study exhibited useful agronomical traits to be used as 2n gamete donors for generating secondary triploids.

Brazil is the sixth largest producer of banana; however, traditional practices of banana propagation fall short when the intention is to introduce a uniform, pathogen-free banana plantation, with high yield potential . This research aimed to evaluate the vegetative growth and production of 'Prata Ana' banana derived from conventional seedlings (whole rhizome) of different sizes (up to 1000g, 1001 to 2000g, 2001 to 3000g, 3001 to 4000g, 4001 to 5000g, and more than 5000g) and in vitro micropropagation, during the first and second production cycles. The experimental design was completely randomized, with a variable number of repetitions. Analysis of variance was performed using regression equations for the vegetative data and Tukey test at 5% of probability for production data. Micropropagated plants originating from rhizomes with weight of less than 1000g, between 1001g and 2000g resulted in plants with more vegetative vigor, in the first cycle. In the second cycle, the number of leaves, height and diameter of the pseudostem tended to equalize for tratadifferent classes of plants assessed. In the first production cycle, periods between planting and floral anthesis and between planting and harvesting were inversely proportional to the size of conventional seedlings; the periods for micropropagated plants were similar to the conventional seedlings of greater weight. There was no difference in the number of hands, fingers and bunch weight between the different classes of seedlings. The differences between the amount of time from planting to flowering and until harvest among the different classes of seedlings tend to disappear from the first to the second cycle. Thus, the propagation of the banana with seedlings weighing less than 2000g or micropropagated is preferable; however, it is possible to use any kind of seedlings, planted in various plots according to the size.

Research is necessary to evaluate the feasibility and the recommendations of these substances. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of humic substances (humic and fulvic acids) applied by fertigation with and without saponin-based plant extracts on growth and yield of 'BRS Princesa' banana. The experiment was carried out using the banana cultivar 'BRS Princesa', at a spacing of 2.0 x 2.5 m, fertigated by drip irrigation in a Dystric Densic Xantic Ferralsol, at the Reconcavo da Bahia, Brazil. Treatments consisted of five doses of humic substances (0.0; 70; 105; 140, and 210 L ha-1 cycle-1) applied with and without a saponin-based plant extract in a randomized block design in split-plot scheme. The following growth variables were evaluated: number of leaves, pseudostem height, pseudostem diameter, and length and width of the third leaf. The number of fruits/hand and hands/bunch, hand and bunch yield, and length and fruit diameter of the second central hand were evaluated during harvest. The doses of humic substances influenced only pseudostem height. Hand yield, as well as fruit length and diameter of 'BRS Princesa' banana were higher in plants fertigated with humic substance and plant extract in comparison with plants fertigated with only humic substance.

Banana production stands out in Brazilian semiarid agriculture; however, due to little availability of water resources, associating water-saving technologies with the knowledge of parameters involved in the interplay between plants and soil is critical to improving banana production systems. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of planting densities and irrigation levels on root length density of 'BRS Platina' banana and to correlate root parameters to crop yield and leaf area. A randomized block design was used, with factors arranged in split-split plots and treatments replicated three times: four irrigation levels (55%, 70%, 85% and 100% ETc) were assigned to plots, four planting densities (1,600; 2,000; 2,666; and 3,333 plants ha-1) to subplots and distance from pseudostem or sampling depth to sub-subplots. Root length density (RLD) was measured at five distances from the pseudostem, longitudinally to a row of plants: 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.10 m; and at three depths for each distance: 0 to 0.20 m, 0.20 to 0.40 m and 0.40 to 0.60 m from surface level. Root length densities were highest at 100% ETc irrigation level and at 2,666 plants ha-1 and 3,333 plants ha-1, within 0.31 m deep and within 0.78 m of the pseudostem. Irrigation interacts with root system, and coupled with higher planting densities, contributes to increasing crop yields of 'BRS Platina' banana plants. (c) 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. (c) 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.
